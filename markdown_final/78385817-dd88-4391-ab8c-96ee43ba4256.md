## Question

A 51-year-old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for a follow-up visit. She feels well and wants to discuss pausing her only current medication, flecainide. Her pulse is 75/min and regular, blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a PR interval of 180 ms, QRS time of 120 ms, and corrected QT interval of 440 ms. Which of the following ECG changes is most likely to be seen on cardiac stress testing in this patient?
A. Prolonged QTc interval
B. False-positive ST-segment depression
C. Prolonged QRS complex
D. Decreased maximal heart rate

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ECG change is most likely to be seen on cardiac stress testing in a 51-year-old woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is taking flecainide, given her resting PR 180 ms, QRS 120 ms, and QTc 440 ms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about flecainide's electrophysiology and its use-dependence. Then, I should verify how exercise alters conduction and which intervals are most affected. Next, I will review guideline and label statements about monitoring QRS during therapy and during exercise. After that, I should consider the other options (QTc, false-positive ST depression, and chronotropic response) and whether they are more or less likely in this scenario. Finally, I will synthesize the most probable ECG change and state the clinical implication for monitoring and safety.

> Let me first confirm the drug's mechanism and its rate-related effects. Flecainide is a class IC sodium channel blocker with slow dissociation and prominent use-dependence, meaning sodium channel blockade strengthens as heart rate rises, which predictably widens the QRS duration during exercise; the FDA labeling notes average QRS increases around 25% and that QRS widening can be marked, with guidance to monitor QRS during therapy and to reduce dose or stop if QRS widens excessively, especially with rapid rates [^111pPB7h] [^1164ezHJ].

> Wait, let me verify the exercise-specific risk signal. The FDA materials describe reports of wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during maximal exercise testing in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide, underscoring that rapid rates can unmask conduction toxicity. Guidelines similarly advise that exercise testing can help detect QRS widening that occurs only at fast heart rates, reinforcing the mechanistic expectation of rate-related QRS prolongation during stress [^114dBSuQ] [^114Vg3X6] [^1164ezHJ].

> I will now examine the baseline ECG in light of this pharmacology. Her QRS is already 120 ms at rest. Given flecainide's use-dependence, I should expect further QRS widening with exercise as sodium channel blockade intensifies at higher heart rates, and the magnitude of increase can be substantial in some patients, which is precisely why serial QRS checks and exercise-related vigilance are recommended during therapy [^111pPB7h] [^1164ezHJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other options. Could the QTc prolong instead? Flecainide does lengthen the QT, but most of that effect is secondary to QRS widening rather than independent repolarization delay; with a baseline QTc of 440 ms and no clear repolarization disease suggested, a large additional QTc prolongation during exercise would be less likely than further QRS widening from use-dependence, so prolonged QTc is not the best answer here [^111pPB7h]. Could there be false-positive ST depression? While women can have less specific ST responses on exercise ECG, there is no signal here that flecainide itself predisposes to ischemic-looking ST depression during stress, and guidelines emphasize integrating global exercise variables rather than relying on ST depression alone in women, so this would be speculative rather than expected from flecainide's mechanism [^113CJnh8] [^111aVK4t]. Could maximal heart rate be blunted? Negative chronotropy is not a recognized effect of flecainide, and beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are the usual culprits for limiting heart rate during stress testing, so decreased maximal heart rate would not be the expected flecainide-related change in this context [^116umpxo].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize. The most mechanistically consistent and guideline-aligned change during exercise in a patient on flecainide is rate-related QRS widening due to use-dependent sodium channel blockade, with the practical implication that clinicians should monitor for excessive QRS prolongation during therapy and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if QRS widens beyond accepted thresholds or if there are concerning conduction changes under stress [^111pPB7h] [^1164ezHJ] [^113KtB3o].

> Final answer: Prolonged QRS complex during exercise due to flecainide's use-dependent sodium channel blockade is the most likely ECG change on cardiac stress testing in this patient [^111pPB7h] [^1164ezHJ].

---

The most likely ECG change during cardiac stress testing in a patient taking flecainide is **prolonged QRS complex** due to flecainide's use-dependent sodium channel blockade, which slows ventricular conduction and widens the QRS as heart rate rises [^111pPB7h]. This rate-related QRS widening is a hallmark of class IC toxicity and can unmask or worsen conduction disease during exercise [^1164ezHJ]. The other options are less likely: QTc prolongation is not a primary flecainide effect, false-positive ST depression is not characteristic, and decreased maximal heart rate is not expected with flecainide alone.

## Pharmacological mechanism of flecainide relevant to stress testing

Flecainide is a **class IC antiarrhythmic** that blocks fast sodium channels with slow dissociation, producing use-dependent conduction slowing — especially at higher heart rates during stress testing [^114CiRyQ]. This mechanism slows phase 0 depolarization, widening the QRS and potentially causing rate-related conduction block [^111pPB7h].

---

## ECG changes associated with flecainide during stress testing

During stress testing, flecainide is most associated with **rate-related QRS widening** from its use-dependent blockade; QRS may increase > 25% at peak exercise, particularly in patients with underlying conduction disease or structural heart disease [^116x4BFY] [^1164ezHJ]. This can manifest as new bundle branch block or progression of existing block, and in vulnerable patients may precipitate wide-complex tachycardias or ventricular arrhythmias during exertion [^114dBSuQ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prolonged QRS complex during stress testing

Clinical studies and case reports document **rate-related QRS widening** during exercise in patients on flecainide, including progression to wide-complex tachycardias or ventricular arrhythmias, especially in those with structural heart disease or pre-existing conduction abnormalities [^114dBSuQ] [^116x4BFY]. Guidelines recommend monitoring for QRS widening during therapy and caution against use in patients with significant conduction disease or structural heart disease [^1164ezHJ] [^113KtB3o].

---

## Comparison with other ECG changes

- **Prolonged QTc interval**: Flecainide can modestly prolong QT, but this is typically secondary to QRS widening; torsades is rare, and QT prolongation is not the primary stress-test finding [^111pPB7h].

- **False-positive ST-segment depression**: Flecainide does not characteristically cause ischemic ST depression; when ST depression occurs, it usually reflects underlying ischemia rather than drug effect.

- **Decreased maximal heart rate**: Flecainide lacks significant negative chronotropic effects; reduced maximal heart rate is not expected and, if present, suggests concomitant beta-blockade or intrinsic sinus node dysfunction [^116umpxo].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Pre-test assessment**: Evaluate for baseline conduction disease (PR, QRS) and structural heart disease before flecainide initiation; avoid use in patients with significant conduction abnormalities or structural heart disease [^113KtB3o] [^111eDEA8].

- **Monitoring during stress testing**: Continuously monitor the ECG for progressive QRS widening or new bundle branch block during exercise; terminate testing if significant QRS widening or arrhythmias occur [^1164ezHJ].

- **Post-test management**: If significant QRS widening is observed, reassess flecainide dosing, consider dose reduction or discontinuation, and evaluate for alternative antiarrhythmic therapy [^113KtB3o].

## ECG changes during stress testing with flecainide

| **Ecg change** | **Likelihood with flecainide** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Prolonged QRS complex | High | - Use-dependent sodium channel blockade <br/> - Rate-related widening <br/> - Potential for conduction block |
| Prolonged QTc interval | Moderate | - Secondary to QRS widening <br/> - Rare torsades |
| False-positive ST-segment depression | Low | Not characteristic of flecainide |
| Decreased maximal heart rate | Low | - No significant negative chronotropy <br/> - Consider other causes |

---

The most likely ECG change during stress testing in a patient on flecainide is **prolonged QRS complex** due to use-dependent sodium channel blockade, with potential for rate-related conduction block and arrhythmias; careful pre-test screening and close ECG monitoring are essential to mitigate risk [^111pPB7h] [^1164ezHJ].

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

Centenarians have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, left-axis deviation, premature beats, first-degree atrioventricular block, and nonspecific ST-T changes. Fewer men live long enough to reach 100 years of age, and they tend to have more significant conduction defects and old myocardial infarcts than women.

Family screening — supportive considerations — states that in the absence of genetic results, screening tests should include a medical history, standard and high precordial lead ECG, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise test, with select use of pharmacological provocation and advanced imaging, and that surveillance testing after a negative evaluation is uncertain, though commonly undertaken until age 45 years (range: 40–50 years), with decreasing frequency with age; CMR and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring of family members can inform diagnosis; circumstances of death can guide suspected diagnoses (febrile illness or sleep suggests Brugada syndrome, whereas physical activity suggests long QT syndrome or CPVT); sodium channel blocker challenge may unmask the type 1 pattern but a positive ECG may be induced in 4–5% of normal subjects; long QT syndrome may also be unmasked by standing, exercise test, epinephrine test, or mental stress test; and in first-degree relatives of young SUD victims with no manifest abnormalities during the initial examination, the risk of developing manifest inherited cardiac disease or cardiac events during follow-up is low.

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation — trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

Atrial fibrillation — initial clinical assessment emphasizes that diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination and confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, sometimes in the form of bedside telemetry or ambulatory Holter recordings, and that initial evaluation involves characterizing the arrhythmia pattern as paroxysmal or persistent, determining its cause, and defining associated cardiac and extracardiac factors pertinent to the etiology, tolerability, or history of prior management. A thorough history will result in a well-planned, focused workup that serves as an effective guide to therapy, and the workup can usually take place during a single outpatient encounter, with delay when the rhythm has not been specifically documented and additional monitoring is necessary. Commonly mentioned triggers include alcohol, sleep deprivation, and emotional stress, and stimulants such as caffeine or exercise may also precipitate atrial fibrillation. The physical examination may suggest atrial fibrillation on the basis of irregular pulse, irregular jugular venous pulsations, and variation in the intensity of the first heart sound or absence of a fourth sound heard previously during sinus rhythm, and examination may also disclose associated valvular heart disease, myocardial abnormalities, or heart failure.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) — management recommendations include I C-LD exercise restriction in patients with CPVT presenting with syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology and I C-LD beta blockers lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in patients with CPVT and stress-induced syncope. Flecainide is reasonable in patients with CPVT who continue to have syncope of suspected VA despite beta-blocker therapy (IIa C-LD), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is reasonable in patients with CPVT and a history of exercise- or stress-induced syncope despite use of optimal medical therapy or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (IIa B-NR). Beta blockers should be first-line therapy in patients with CPVT; however, they are not always completely protective, and exercise testing and cardiac monitoring to document arrhythmia suppression can be reassuring. In patients intolerant of beta-blocker therapy, flecainide is useful as monotherapy. ICD implantation should be performed in conjunction with beta-blocker therapy or LCSD when available, and careful programming, including long detection intervals with high cutoff rate, is recommended to decrease the prevalence of inappropriate shocks.

ST-segment response and initial testing strategy in functionally capable women: In contrast to men, ST-segment depression with ETT does not appear to provide strong prognostic value among women; in the WOMEN trial, 824 symptomatic women with suspected CAD were randomized to exercise ECG versus exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and followed for 2 years, with similar 2-year outcomes between groups (P = 0.59), and an initial ECG prompted follow-up stress MPI in nearly 1 in 5 women; this trial put forth the recommendation that an initial ECG strategy with follow-up stress imaging be limited to women with indeterminate or abnormal ECG findings.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^116THt7F]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Exercise treadmill testing (ETT) recommendations in symptomatic women — For a symptomatic woman with intermediate ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk who is capable of exercising at ≥ 5 METs and who has a normal rest ECG, the ETT is recommended as the initial test of choice, with imaging reserved for those women with resting ST-segment abnormalities or those unable to exercise adequately (Class I; Level of Evidence B). As per standardized reporting, the ETT interpretation should include not only the ST-segment response and risk score measurements but also exercise capacity, chronotropic response, heart rate recovery, and the blood pressure response to exercise (Class I; Level of Evidence B). If an ETT is indeterminate (eg, negative ECG in the setting of submaximal exercise [below age-predicted level or failure to achieve > 85% of predicted maximal heart rate]) or abnormal, the next step should be additional diagnostic testing with stress imaging, and individualized decision making and targeted anti-ischemic therapies after the ETT should consider the woman's ongoing symptom burden and the degree of abnormalities noted during the ETT (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) — features and management: Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT is characterized by ventricular tachyarrhythmias that develop with physical or emotional stress despite a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) without diagnostic abnormalities, and it can follow either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance with approximately one-half of autosomal dominant cases due to ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mutations and recessive cases associated with calsequestrin (CASQ2) mutations. Arrhythmias are usually reproducibly induced by exercise stress testing, with runs that lengthen and may become sustained; a beat-to-beat alternating QRS axis that changes by 180° ("bidirectional VT") is typical. Beta blockers appear generally effective in preventing recurrences of syncope, electrophysiological testing is not useful because the arrhythmia is usually not inducible with programmed ventricular stimulation, and patients who have had ventricular fibrillation (VF) are usually treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in addition to beta-blocker therapy; if syncope occurs in a patient taking a beta blocker, implantation of an ICD is recommended.

What is Flecainide and what is its Mechanism of Action?

Flecainide is classified as a Vaughan Williams class IC antiarrhythmic that is approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention and treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia. Like all class I antiarrhythmics, flecainide exerts its therapeutic activity primarily through interactions with the cardiac sodium channel. Specifically, flecainide antagonizes fast inward voltage-gated sodium channels, slowing inward sodium movement during phase zero of cardiac depolarization. Flecainide has increased sodium channel binding at higher heart rates, a property known as "use-dependence". Overall, this effect manifests as QRS prolongation on the ECG. Flecainide dissociates from the sodium channel slowly compared with many other antiarrhythmic sodium channel blockers. Flecainide also inhibits opening of the delayed rectifier potassium channels which manifests electrocardiographically as a prolonged QT interval.

### US antiarrhythmic drug treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation: an insurance claims-based report [^116R6X5d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of class IC agents (flecainide/propafenone) in patients with CAD observed in our study also raises some concerns. In the post–myocardial infarction population, IC agents have been associated with increased risk of deaths attributable to pro‐arrhythmia, based on evidence from CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial), a multicenter, double‐blind, randomized, controlled trial. 6 Considering that CAST included patients who were up to 2 years post–myocardial infarction, AF guidelines do not recommend use of IC agents in individuals with CAD or structural heart disease. Recent studies and analyses of IC agents, including cardioversion and "pill‐in‐the‐pocket" efficacy with flecainide, 20 have broadened the appeal of these agents. Furthermore, contemporary reviews have challenged restrictions of IC agents in all individuals with CAD such as those who have not had a prior myocardial infarction or who exhibit ischemia on stress testing. 21 These elements, in addition to the remoteness of CAST (nearly 30 years after publication), may explain the considerable use of IC agents in CAD. Potential coding of CAD in the presence of nonobstructive disease as evidenced on imaging modalities, or setting of demand ischemia, may also contribute to this discordance, a limitation inherent to ICD‐9 – and ICD‐10 –based review.

Our analysis also found that there was differing concordance by provider type, with "other" HCPs showing the lowest concordance, followed by cardiologists and then electrophysiologists; these rates are comparable with previously published studies. 8 The prescribing behavior of the specialist HCPs may be attributable to the greater knowledge about treatment options and guidelines, as well as potential comfort levels in using different AADs among electrophysiologists and cardiologists. 8 However, one caveat in interpreting our findings is the volume of use of AADs by HCP type, as well as the AADs that are used by these specialty HCPs. Clearly, the high and nearly exclusive use of amiodarone by other HCPs results in this group's high guideline concordance with respect to HF. Electrophysiologists are most diversified with respect to AAD treatments used in practice, and general cardiologists are intermediate (with greater use of class IC agents and sotalol) regarding AAD treatments used. Additionally, the lower use of dofetilide by the general cardiology and "other" HCPs may be explained by restrictions on its use (ie, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program limited prescribing to specialty cardiologists) during the period of this study. 22

### Conduction abnormalities during dipyridamole stress testing [^116hJXqj]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pharmacological stress tests using dipyridamole are considered to be safe. However, cases of atrioventricular (AV) block have been reported. We retrospectively analyzed ECG at baseline and during dipyridamole stress tests of 2010 consecutive patients (patients with second or third degree AV block were excluded). At baseline, 350 (17.4%) patients had conduction abnormalities. Following dipyridamole infusion 16 patients (0.8%) developed a transient change in AV conduction (15 patients) and or sinus arrest (1 patient). Compared to patients without baseline conduction abnormalities, patients with any conduction abnormalities at baseline were at a higher risk for the development of AV block after dipyridamole infusion [0.3% vs 3.14%, respectively; P < .0001].

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^114Vg3X6]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

It is uncertain if flecainide's risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.

In patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient's underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.

Among patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

The relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

### Mechanism of action… [^113UYeeh]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Flecainide is a medication used to prevent and treat abnormally fast heart rates. This includes ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias. Its use is only recommended in those with dangerous arrhythmias or when significant symptoms cannot be managed with other treatments. Its use does not decrease a person's risk of death. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include dizziness, problems seeing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure. It may be used in pregnancy, but has not been well studied in this population. Use is not recommended in those with structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease. Flecainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent. It works by decreasing the entry of sodium in heart cells, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential. Flecainide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1985.

It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 223rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Medical uses Flecainide is used in the treatment of many types of supraventricular tachycardias, including AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It also has limited use in the treatment of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia. In particular, flecainide has been useful in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias that are not in the setting of an acute ischemic event. It has use in the treatment of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia and in the suppression of arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Studies have shown an increased mortality when flecainide is used to suppress ventricular extrasystoles in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

Flecainide can be used for the management of atrial fibrillation. In individuals suspected of having the Brugada syndrome, the administration of flecainide may help reveal the electrocardiography findings that are characteristic of the disease process. This may help make the diagnosis of the disease in equivocal cases. In the long-term, flecainide seems to be safe in people with a healthy heart with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, or heart failure. Side effects Results of a medical study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial demonstrated that patients with structural heart disease, or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published. The dose may need to be adjusted in certain clinical scenarios.

As with all other antiarrhythmic agents, there is a risk of proarrhythmia associated with the use of flecainide. This risk is probably increased when flecainide is co-administered with other class Ic antiarrhythmics, such as encainide. The risk of proarrhythmia may also be increased by hypokalemia. The risk of proarrhythmia is not necessarily associated with the length of time an individual is taking flecainide, and cases of late proarrhythmia have been reported. Because of the negative inotropic effects of flecainide, it should be used with caution in individuals with depressed ejection fraction, and may worsen congestive heart failure in these individuals. It should be avoided in people with ischaemic heart disease and the elderly. As with all class I antiarrhythmic agents, flecainide increases the capture thresholds of pacemakers.

Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) — diagnostic accuracy and prognostic thresholds are outlined, with lower diagnostic accuracy than stress imaging noted as "sensitivity and specificity range, 60%–77%", and in the WOMEN trial of "824 symptomatic women" exercise ECG was "equally effective" versus exercise SPECT MPI with "similar 2-year CAD event rates (2.0% versus 2.3%; P = 0.59)". Failure to complete Bruce stage 1 "or < 5 METs" or not achieving "85% of age predicted fitness level" increases CAD event risk, whereas "Bruce stage III or > 10 METs with a negative ECG" indicates low risk. After submaximal exercise or with "ischemic ECG ≥ 1.0 mm ST depression", additional stress imaging "may improve its detection and guide clinical management", and "Marked ischemia (eg, ≥ 2.0 mm at reduced workloads) or high Duke or Lauer scores" signifies increased risk and "such patients may benefit from additional testing (anatomic or stress testing)".

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^111pPB7h]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Effects on Cardiac Conduction

Flecainide slows cardiac conduction in most patients to produce dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. PR interval increases on average about 25% (0.04 seconds) and as much as 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.2 seconds). The QRS complex increases on average about 25% (0.02 seconds) and as much as 150% in some patients. Many patients develop QRS complexes with a duration of 12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed new bundle branch block while on flecainide. The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict either efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it was unusual for PR intervals to increase to 0.3 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to increase to 18 seconds or more. Thus, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens about 8%, but most of this widening (about 60% to 90%) is due to widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) only widens about 4% on the average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. There have been rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia associated with flecainide therapy.

Clinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction such as sinus pause, sinus arrest and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%), second-degree AV block (0.5%) and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose in an effort to minimize these effects. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) If second- or third-degree AV block, or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occur, flecainide therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.

Sick Sinus Syndrome (Bradycardia-Tachycardia Syndrome)

Flecainide should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest.

### Brugada syndrome presenting as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-ventricular fibrillation lasting 94 seconds recorded on an ambulatory monitor [^1145s2sB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cardiac arrhythmias are common causes of syncope. Brugada syndrome is an uncommon but serious genetic arrhythmia disorder that can be unmasked by medicines causing sodium channel blockade.

Observations

This report documents a case of Brugada syndrome and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-ventricular fibrillation not initially recognized in a patient taking nortriptyline and experiencing syncope. It also illustrates one of the longest episodes of ventricular fibrillation recorded on an ambulatory monitor (94 seconds). Although the baseline electrocardiogram did not demonstrate a typical appearance for Brugada syndrome, provocative testing with flecainide in this patient with documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revealed a Brugada electrocardiogram pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Vigilance should be maintained for arrhythmia substrates such as Brugada syndrome in patients with typical symptoms when they are prescribed membrane-active medicines. Long-term ambulatory rhythm monitors can provide useful information in these cases, especially when symptoms are infrequent.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — sodium channel blocker challenge and ECG lead positioning: Administration of procainamide, flecainide, or ajmaline may be useful to provoke type 1 ST elevation in patients suspected to have Brugada syndrome who do not have a type 1 electrocardiographic pattern at baseline, and medication challenge should be terminated with the development of VA, marked QRS widening, or type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern. The use of high electrocardiographic electrode positioning in the second and third interspaces for electrocardiographic recording improves detection of a type 1 Brugada ECG. Asymptomatic patients with a family history of Brugada syndrome may be offered sodium channel blocker challenge for diagnostic evaluation, although a positive test does not require chronic therapy due to a low risk in this setting; in asymptomatic patients with type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic findings, medication challenge does not offer additional diagnostic value.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^1142LTUK]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

More recently, Kannankeril et al showed, in a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, that flecainide in combination with beta-blockers was superior in reducing VAs during exercise stress tests in patients with CPVT compared with beta-blockers alone. In this trial, the initial primary end point of AEs was changed to VA burden on exercise stress test after recruiting a sufficient number of patients proved insurmountable. It is important to note that none of the patients in this trial had complex VAs (couplets or nonsustained VTs) on the exercise stress test while using the combination of beta-blockers and flecainide. The presence of couplets and the presence of nonsustained VTs are considered risk factors for AEs during follow-up.

Our study adds to these previous observations, showing that flecainide is associated with a significantly lower incidence of AEs when added to beta-blocker therapy in the setting of no other therapeutic changes. Because no changes in background therapy were allowed during the pre-flecainide and on-flecainide study periods (including a switch from nonselective to beta1-selective beta-blockers or vice versa), it is unlikely that the observed effect is caused by a change in other medical therapies. The residual risk of AEs during the on-flecainide period may, to an unknown degree, be explained by proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, although this risk is presumably very low in these young patients without structural heart disease and coronary artery disease. It is conceivable that persisting significant ventricular ectopy (eg, frequent bigeminal ventricular premature beats, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) on the exercise stress test may identify the patients who are insufficiently protected by combination therapy with a beta-blocker and flecainide.

A patient taking regular flecainide for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented with broad complex tachycardia and circulatory compromise. With no history of pacemaker insertion and no pacing spikes visible on the ECG, this was presumed to be ventricular tachycardia and treated with electrical cardioversion, leading to p-wave asystole. An indwelling pacemaker was now recognised and ventricular capture was eventually attained by significantly increasing ventricular lead output. Invasive haemodynamic support was required due to new ventricular systolic dysfunction. Pacing thresholds and ventricular function normalised within 72h consistent with flecainide toxicity; levels were shown to be toxic. Pacemaker interrogation revealed evidence of an undiagnosed atrial flutter, at presentation this was likely slowed by flecainide toxicity to a rate below the pacemaker mode switch, such that it was tracked in the ventricle at the upper tracking rate (120bpm). Cardioversion terminated the arrhythmia but raised the capture threshold of the ventricle above the maximum lead output.

### Tachycardia due to atrial flutter with rapid 1: 1 conduction following treatment of atrial fibrillation with flecainide [^113n9PNH]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Current guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.1 2 An important, under-recognised complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.

Cardiac scintigraphy — physical exercise stress endpoints and medication considerations: For patients who are physically able to exercise, the desired endpoint is a heart rate of at least 85% of the age-predicted maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) or a workload of at least 5 mets. The patient must be monitored frequently for abnormal change in blood pressure, marked ST changes on the electrocardiogram, development of serious arrhythmias, severe chest pain, or other signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia. Beta-blocking and calcium-channel-blocking medications often prevent the patient from achieving the desired heart rate and may reduce the sensitivity of the test; depending on the clinical necessity or the clinical question, these agents may need to be discontinued by the patient's physician prior to examination for a time sufficient to obviate their pharmacologic effect.

### Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome with a sodium-channel-blocker test: who should be tested? Who should not? [^1148snzD]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous infusion of sodium-channel blockers (SCB) with either ajmaline, flecainide, procainamide, or pilsicainide to unmask the ECG of Brugada syndrome is the drug challenge most commonly used for diagnostic purposes when investigating cases possibly related to inherited arrhythmia syndromes. For a patient undergoing an SCB challenge, the impact of a positive result goes well beyond its diagnostic implications. It is, therefore, appropriate to question who should undergo a SCB test to diagnose or exclude Brugada syndrome and, perhaps more importantly, who should not. We present a critical review of the benefits and drawbacks of the SCB challenge when performed in cardiac arrest survivors, patients presenting with syncope, family members of probands with confirmed Brugada syndrome, and asymptomatic patients with suspicious ECG.

### Dobutamine hydrochloride [^113duQvR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Increased Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Ventricular Ectopic Activity

A 10 to 20-mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure and an increase in heart rate of 5 to 15 beats/minute have been noted in most patients (see WARNINGS regarding exaggerated chronotropic and pressor effects). Approximately 5% of adult patients have had increased premature ventricular beats during infusions. These effects are dose related.

Hypotension

Precipitous decreases in blood pressure have occasionally been described in association with dobutamine therapy. Decreasing the dose or discontinuing the infusion typically results in rapid return of blood pressure to baseline values. In rare cases, however, intervention may be required and reversibility may not be immediate.

Stress Cardiomyopathy

Stress cardiomyopathy has been reported with dobutamine in association with cardiac stress testing.

Reactions at Sites of Intravenous Infusion

Phlebitis has occasionally been reported. Local inflammatory changes have been described following inadvertent infiltration.

Miscellaneous Uncommon Effects

The following adverse effects have been reported in 1% to 3% of adult patients: nausea, headache, anginal pain, nonspecific chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath.

Administration of dobutamine, like other catecholamines, has been associated with decreases in serum potassium concentrations, rarely to hypokalemic values.

### Time-dependent responses to provocative testing with flecainide in the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome [^117U3qWk]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Time-dependent variability of electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with Brugada syndrome could affect the interpretation of provocative testing.

Objective

The aim of this study was to characterize ECG changes during and after flecainide infusion.

Methods

We studied 59 consecutive patients. The ECG was continuously analyzed during the first 30 minutes of provocative testing, and a single ECG was recorded 60 minutes later. We analyzed CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 variants affecting flecainide metabolism and performed blinded measurements at lead II.

Results

At baseline, ECG patterns were classified as follows: type II in 31 patients (53%), type III in 15 (25%), and normal ECG in 13 (22%). Because of induction of type I ECG, the percentage of responders progressively increased with longer recording time periods (6.8% in 10 minutes vs 11.9% in 20–30 minutes vs 18.6% in 90 minutes; P < .01). Four patients displayed a late response, which was evidenced 90 minutes after the initiation of provocative testing. QRS width differentially increased between responders and nonresponders (P < .01), with a maximum QRS width of 110 ms during the first 30 minutes being effective for identifying possible late responders (sensitivity 100%; specificity 85.6%; positive predictive value 88%; negative predictive value 100%). The incidence of CYP2D6 variants was lower in late responders than in early or delayed responders (0% vs 75% vs 100%; p = 0.04), while a homogeneous distribution of CYP3A5*3/*3 was observed in our population.

Conclusion

Response to flecainide exhibits time-dependent variability of ECG patterns and intervals. Longer periods of ECG recording increase the recognition probability of type I ECG.

### Atrial fibrillation… [^11795apX]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Other risk factors include excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, subclinical hypothyroidism, and thyrotoxicosis. However, about half of cases are not associated with any of these aforementioned risks. Healthcare professionals might suspect AF after feeling the pulse and confirm the diagnosis by interpreting an electrocardiogram. A typical ECG in AF shows irregularly spaced QRS complexes without P waves. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as weight loss in people with obesity, increased physical activity, and drinking less alcohol, can lower the risk for AF and reduce its burden if it occurs. AF is often treated with medications to slow the heart rate to a near-normal range or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm. Electrical cardioversion can convert AF to normal heart rhythm and is often necessary for emergency use if the person is unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people.

For those at low risk of stroke, AF does not necessarily require blood-thinning though some healthcare providers may prescribe an anti-clotting medication. Most people with AF are at higher risk of stroke. For those at more than low risk, experts generally recommend an anti-clotting medication. Anti-clotting medications include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants. While these medications reduce stroke risk, they increase rates of major bleeding. Other possible symptoms include congestive heart failure symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or swelling. Loss of consciousness can also occur on atrial fibrillations due to lack of oxygen and blood to the brain. The abnormal heart rhythm is sometimes only identified with the onset of a stroke or a transient ischemic attack. It is not uncommon for a person to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or electrocardiogram, as it often does not cause symptoms.

Since most cases of AF are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of chest pain or angina, signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as weight loss and diarrhea, and symptoms suggestive of lung disease can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, or rheumatic fever, may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications. Rapid heart rate Presentation is similar to other forms of rapid heart rate and may be asymptomatic. Palpitations and chest discomfort are common complaints. The rapid uncoordinated heart rate may result in reduced output of blood pumped by the heart, resulting in inadequate blood flow, and therefore oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. AF can cause respiratory distress due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, the heart rate will be greater than 100 beats per minute.

Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital non-invasive blood pressure monitors. For this reason, when determining the heart rate in AF, direct cardiac auscultation is recommended. Low blood pressure is most concerning, and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation of congestive heart failure due to the reduced cardiac output. The affected person's respiratory rate often increases in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of too little oxygen reaching the body's tissues, related to any precipitating factors such as pneumonia. Examination of the jugular veins may reveal elevated pressure. Examination of the lungs may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy — risk stratification and prognosis: ARVC is suspected in patients, typically a young man, with right ventricular (RV) arrhythmias or in relatives of individuals with known ARVC, and the ventricular arrhythmias have left bundle-branch block (LBBB) morphology that spans the spectrum of simple ventricular ectopy, sustained and NSVT, or VF; ARVC needs to be considered along with idiopathic RV outflow VT in the individual with ventricular ectopy and VT coming from the RV outflow region, whereas idiopathic RV outflow VT is usually not associated with the ECG abnormalities seen with ARVC, is more common in women, and is initiated by isoproterenol infusion instead of by EP testing; the ECG in ARVC frequently shows precordial T-wave inversion, usually over V1 to V3, and QRS duration greater than 110 ms, with epsilon waves characteristic but relatively infrequent and late potentials observed on the signal-averaged ECG in greater than 50% of individuals; SCD is frequently the first manifestation, the annual incidence of SCD has varied from 0.08% to 9%, and in an autopsy series 24 of 27 patients died suddenly and 3 died of congestive HF, while SCD occurs relatively frequently during exercise or stress but also without apparent provocation.

Potent sodium channel, blockade with type IC antiarrhythmics can provoke characteristic electrocardiographic changes consistent with Brugada's syndrome in unselected patients with atrial fibrillation. In 176 treated patients, the incidence of the characteristic abnormality is small (2.3%), and thus although no ventricular arrhythmia events were observed during follow-up, the long-term clinical significance in a larger patient cohort remains to be determined. These data provide insight into the specificity of the response to type I drug administration in patients suspected of having Brugada's syndrome.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^111ah1s2]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 35 mL/min/1.73 square meters or less), the initial dosage should be 100 mg once daily (or 50 mg bid); when used in such patients, frequent plasma level monitoring is required to guide dosage adjustments (see Plasma Level Monitoring). In patients with less severe renal disease, the initial dosage should be 100 mg every 12 hours; plasma level monitoring may also be useful in these patients during dosage adjustment. In both groups of patients, dosage increases should be made very cautiously when plasma levels have plateaued (after more than four days), observing the patient closely for signs of adverse cardiac effects or other toxicity. It should be borne in mind that in these patients it may take longer than four days before a new steady-state plasma level is reached following a dosage change.

Based on theoretical considerations, rather than experimental data, the following suggestion is made: when transferring patients from another antiarrhythmic drug to flecainide allow at least two to four plasma half-lives to elapse for the drug being discontinued before starting flecainide at the usual dosage. In patients where withdrawal of a previous antiarrhythmic agent is likely to produce life-threatening arrhythmias, the physician should consider hospitalizing the patient.

When flecainide is given in the presence of amiodarone, reduce the usual flecainide dose by 50% and monitor the patient closely for adverse effects.

Plasma level monitoring is strongly recommended to guide dosage with such combination therapy (see below).

Plasma Level Monitoring

The large majority of patients successfully treated with flecainide were found to have trough plasma levels between 0.2 and 1 mcg/mL. The probability of adverse experiences, especially cardiac, may increase with higher trough plasma levels, especially when these exceed 1 mcg/mL. Periodic monitoring of trough plasma levels may be useful in patient management. Plasma level monitoring is required in patients with severe renal failure or severe hepatic disease, since elimination of flecainide from plasma may be markedly slower. Monitoring of plasma levels is strongly recommended in patients on concurrent amiodarone therapy and may also be helpful in patients with CHF and in patients with moderate renal disease.

### Flecainide acetate tablet (flecainide acetate) [^11744ZyD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with sustained VT, use of higher initial doses and more rapid dosage adjustments have resulted in an increased incidence of proarrhythmic events and CHF, particularly during the first few days of dosing (see WARNINGS). Therefore, a loading dose is not recommended.

Intravenous lidocaine has been used occasionally with flecainide acetate tablets while awaiting the therapeutic effect of flecainide acetate. No adverse drug interactions were apparent. However, no formal studies have been performed to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen.

An occasional patient not adequately controlled by (or intolerant to) a dose given at 12 hour intervals may be dosed at eight-hour intervals.

Once adequate control of the arrhythmia has been achieved, it may be possible in some patients to reduce the dose as necessary to minimize side effects or effects on conduction. In such patients, efficacy at the lower dose should be evaluated.

Flecainide acetate tablets should be used cautiously in patients with a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction (see WARNINGS).

Any use of flecainide acetate tablets in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children. Because of the evolving nature of information in this area, specialized literature should be consulted. Under six months of age, the initial starting dose of flecainide acetate tablets in children is approximately 50 mg/m2body surface area daily, divided into two or three equally spaced doses. Over six months of age, the initial starting dose may be increased to 100 mg/m2per day. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg/m2per day. This dose should not be exceeded. In some children on higher doses, despite previously low plasma levels, the level has increased rapidly to far above therapeutic values while taking the same dose. Small changes in dose may also lead to disproportionate increases in plasma levels. Plasma trough (less than one hour pre-dose) flecainide levels and electrocardiograms should be obtained at presumed steady state (after at least five doses) either after initiation or change in flecainide dose, whether the dose was increased for lack of effectiveness, or increased growth of the patient. For the first year on therapy, whenever the patient is seen for reasons of clinical follow-up, it is suggested that a 12-lead electrocardiogram and plasma trough flecainide level are obtained. The usual therapeutic level of flecainide in children is 200 to 500 ng/mL. In some cases, levels as high as 800 ng/mL may be required for control.

WARNINGS

Mortality – Flecainide was included in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long term, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had a myocardial infarction more than six days but less than two years previously. An excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was seen in patients treated with flecainide compared with that seen in patients assigned to a carefully matched placebo-treated group. This rate was 16/315 (5.1%) for flecainide and 7/309 (2.3%) for the matched placebo. The average duration of treatment with flecainide in this study was ten months.

The applicability of the CAST results to other populations (e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain, but at present, it is prudent to consider the risks of Class IC agents (including flecainide), coupled with the lack of any evidence of improved survival, generally unacceptable in patients without life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not life-threatening, symptoms or signs.

Ventricular Pro-arrhythmic Effects in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter. A review of the world literature revealed reports of 568 patients treated with oral flecainide for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF). Ventricular tachycardia was experienced in 0.4% (2/568) of these patients. Of 19 patients in the literature with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), 10.5% (2) experienced VT or VF. FLECAINIDE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. Case reports of ventricular proarrhythmic effects in patients treated with flecainide for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased PVCs, VT, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and death.

As with other Class I agents, patients treated with flecainide for atrial flutter have been reported with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction due to slowing the atrial rate. A paradoxical increase in the ventricular rate also may occur in patients with atrial fibrillation who receive flecainide. Concomitant negative chronotropic therapy such as digoxin or beta-blockers may lower the risk of this complication.

### Flecainide toxicity: ECG changes associated with supratherapeutic levels in milk-fed infants [^11174kv3]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Flecainide is a class 1C antiarrhythmic and is highly effective for treating a wide range of arrhythmias. It is not licensed for children under the age of 12 years, but has been used safely for years in young children, particularly when first-line agents are not effective. Although toxicity does occur in both adult and paediatric populations, there have been very few reported instances of flecainide toxicity in neonates and children. Supratherapeutic levels of flecainide manifests on ECG with prolongation of the PR interval, QRS duration and QT, and can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. In milk-fed infants receiving flecainide, regular feeding patterns are paramount to achieve a steady therapeutic state, as milk and dairy products are known to reduce the absorption of flecainide. This case series details four milk-fed infants admitted with ECG changes secondary to flecainide toxicity.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^111uBSsU]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our findings, derived from the largest cohort of patients with CPVT treated with flecainide, provide further evidence that flecainide has an important role in the treatment of CPVT. We demonstrated that the addition of flecainide to beta-blocker therapy is associated with a significantly lower incidence of AEs both in the overall cohort as well as in symptomatic patients, and especially in patients who experience breakthrough AEs while on beta-blocker therapy.

Flecainide in Patients With CPVT

Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug that has been used for the management of arrhythmias for decades. The efficacy of flecainide in CPVT was first suggested in 2009, when it was shown that flecainide dramatically reduced rates of calcium sparks in vitro, as well as VAs in vivo, in a CASQ2 -knockout mouse model and in 2 patients. This finding led to subsequent studies showing a reduction in VA burden on exercise stress tests in patients with CPVT when treated with flecainide in addition to beta-blockers.– Furthermore, flecainide was effective in patients with CPVT carrying homozygous CASQ2 variants. Previous studies have suggested that flecainide use, particularly combined with beta-blocker therapy, results in a reduction in AEs. However, to date, this has not been analyzed systematically in a robust study with a significant number of patients and follow-up duration.

Atrial fibrillation — flecainide and propafenone efficacy, dosing, and safety caveats: Randomized trials and a Cochrane analysis established efficacy of flecainide and propafenone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF. In the Flec‑SL trial, flecainide prevented episodes of paroxysmal AF in 31% over 4 months versus 9% with placebo. Sustained‑release propafenone 425, 325, and 225 mg twice daily extended median time to AF/AFL/SVT versus placebo (> 300, 291, and 112 days versus 41 days; P < 0.001). Patients with prior MI or significant structural heart disease "should not take" flecainide or propafenone, and individuals on these agents "should be concomitantly taking an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent" to reduce risk of 1:1 atrial flutter.

Atrial fibrillation — general antiarrhythmic drug therapy and monitoring: Before administering any antiarrhythmic agent, reversible precipitants of AF should be identified and corrected, and patients who develop HF in association with alcohol intake should abstain from alcohol consumption. When treatment with a single antiarrhythmic drug fails, combinations may be tried; useful combinations include a beta blocker, sotalol, or amiodarone with a class IC agent, and the combination of a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem, with a class IC agent, such as flecainide or propafenone, is advantageous in some patients. A drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic if coronary disease or HF develops or with interacting medications; thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of such symptoms as syncope, angina, or dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that might prolong the QT interval. With class IC drugs, prolongation of the QRS interval should not exceed 50%, and for class IA or class III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should be kept below 520 ms; exercise testing may help detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates. During follow-up, plasma potassium and magnesium levels and renal function should be checked periodically, and in individual patients, serial noninvasive assessment of LV function is indicated, especially when clinical HF develops during treatment of AF.

2 CASE 1

A 51‐year old male, past national champion in shot put and javelin throw, continued after retirement from athletics, to practice endurance sport activities as canoeing and field jogging. He used to practice on a daily basis at least 1 h a day. He started feeling palpitations and described his pulse as irregular. Baseline ECG was normal. A 24‐h ECG Holter monitor recorded at rest paroxysmal episodes of AF at a ventricular rate of 130 per minute. Echocardiography revealed normal heart function, no major valvular problems, a septal thickness of 14 mm and posterior wall of 12 mm, and a normal size left atrium. Stress test was normal without any arrhythmias. He was prescribed to take Propafenone if AF recurs ["Pill in the pocket" approach] and was advised to decrease physical activity. His CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score was 0. However, only a month later, when he had a prolonged AF episode that lasted for several hours, he stopped his vigorous daily sport activity. Since he reduced his physical activity to twice a week, he did not report feeling palpitations, and 24‐h ECG Holter monitor revealed only normal sinus rhythm with long periods of bradycardia. He did not use any medications.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias — evaluation and initial management synopsis: On initial discovery, an evaluation for structural heart disease is warranted with physical examination, an ECG, and imaging, usually with echocardiography. In the absence of any abnormality or a family history of sudden cardiac death, further assessment and treatment are guided by symptoms, and if the patient is asymptomatic and does not have evidence of a cardiac channelopathy, reassurance as to the benign nature is sufficient. If the arrhythmia is suspected of being sufficiently frequent to cause ventricular dysfunction over time, periodic follow-up with reassessment of ventricular function is warranted, and for mild symptoms, avoidance of aggravating factors such as excessive consumption of caffeine or sympathomimetic agents, may be sufficient. Therapy with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker reduces symptoms for some patients; Class I antiarrhythmic medications can be effective, but those are generally avoided due to concerns for adverse effects, and for patients who require arrhythmia suppression for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or undesired, catheter ablation can be a highly effective treatment.

### Efficacy of flecainide in the treatment of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: a randomized clinical trial [^116drKqU]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a potentially lethal genetic arrhythmia syndrome characterized by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with physical or emotional stress, for which current therapy with β-blockers is incompletely effective. Flecainide acetate directly suppresses sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release-the cellular mechanism responsible for triggering ventricular arrhythmias in CPVT-but has never been assessed prospectively.

Objective

To determine whether flecainide dosed to therapeutic levels and added to β-blocker therapy is superior to β-blocker therapy alone for the prevention of exercise-induced arrhythmias in CPVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial was conducted from December 19, 2011, through December 29, 2015, with a midtrial protocol change at 10 US sites. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CPVT and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator underwent a baseline exercise test while receiving maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy that was continued throughout the trial. Patients were then randomized to treatment A (flecainide or placebo) for 3 months, followed by exercise testing. After a 1-week washout period, patients crossed over to treatment B (placebo or flecainide) for 3 months, followed by exercise testing.

Interventions

Patients received oral flecainide or placebo twice daily, with the dosage guided by trough serum levels.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point of ventricular arrhythmias during exercise was compared between the flecainide and placebo arms. Exercise tests were scored on an ordinal scale of worst ventricular arrhythmia observed (0 indicates no ectopy; 1, isolated premature ventricular beats; 2, bigeminy; 3, couplets; and 4, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia).

Results

Of 14 patients (7 males and 7 females; median age, 16 years [interquartile range, 15.0–22.5 years]) randomized, 13 completed the study. The median baseline exercise test score was 3.0 (range, 0–4), with no difference noted between the baseline and placebo (median, 2.5; range, 0–4) exercise scores. The median ventricular arrhythmia score during exercise was significantly reduced by flecainide (0 [range, 0–2] vs 2.5 [range, 0–4] for placebo; P < .01), with complete suppression observed in 11 of 13 patients (85%). Overall and serious adverse events did not differ between the flecainide and placebo arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of patients with CPVT, flecainide plus β-blocker significantly reduced ventricular ectopy during exercise compared with placebo plus β-blocker and β-blocker alone.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy — components of cardiovascular evaluation in at-risk relatives: Cardiovascular evaluation should include 12-lead ECG, ambulatory ECG, and cardiac imaging. Evaluation of all at-risk family members should include a 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and cardiac imaging, and in relatives who demonstrate disease features, electrocardiographic changes typically occur earlier and more commonly than structural changes; LGE on CMR, most frequently observed in the LV myocardium, was the first evidence of disease expression in a small subset.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome — risk with normal QTc and beta-blocker considerations: Approximately 10% to 36% of genotype-positive patients have QTc intervals ≤ 440 ms and, although patients with normal QTc have a lower risk of VA and SCD than those with prolonged QTc, they still have increased risk versus genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched patients. Beta blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events substantially; during the periods of highest risk in the first 3 decades of life, treatment with a beta blocker may reduce risk of SCA. Because QTc changes over time, assessment of QTc on ECG annually or with medication changes and assessment of medication efficacy with exercise testing are indicated, and asymptomatic adult (male) patients with normal QTc intervals may choose to decline beta-blocker therapy.

### Approach to a patient with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^111VR1p3]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive evaluation

Ambulatory monitoring and exercise/pharmacological stress tests are readily available non-invasive risk stratification tools. Abrupt and complete loss of pre-excitation (intermittent pre-excitation) in sinus rhythm on a Holter monitor, exercise stress test or pharmacological stress test suggests the AP has a long ERP and renders the AP extremely unlikely to conduct quickly during AF (SPRRI in AF of < 250 ms) (figure 1A, B, are examples).

Figure 1
(A) Holter monitor tracing demonstrating intermittent pre-excitation. The first two QRS complexes are not pre-excited, and pre-excitation abruptly resumes beginning with the third QRS complex. Note that gradual change in the degree of pre-excitation does not. (B) Another heart rhythm tracing showing abrupt loss of pre-excitation. The top and bottom channels are simultaneous. The first four beats are pre-excited, and the next four beats are not pre-excited at all. This patient's atrioventricular pathway likely has a long effective refractory period and would not be expected to conduct rapidly during atrial fibrillation.

Physiologically, intermittent pre-excitation represents periodic complete block in AP conduction, suggesting that the anterograde AP conduction is too fragile to support rapid conduction during AF. To diagnose intermittent pre-excitation, care must be taken to ensure the delta wave is abruptly and completely lost (figure 1A, B). Gradual loss of the delta wave with each consecutive beat does not qualify as intermittent pre-excitation (example in figure 2). This is because it may reflect progressively less contribution of ventricular activation through the accessory pathway and a larger contribution of conduction through the AV node to ventricular activation. This does not reflect the ability AP to conduct during AF and should not be considered as intermittent pre-excitation. A small retrospective study suggested that gradual loss of pre-excitation is prognostically equivalent to no loss of pre-excitation. Catecholamine excess during exercise recruits the AV node to conduct faster, which often results in ventricular activation via the AV node, leading to less apparent pre-excitation. During exercise and catecholamine testing, the delta wave becomes less obvious and can be obscured by improved AV nodal conduction, making it unclear whether it is truly abruptly lost. For this reason, if exercise and catecholamine testing are to be used, the ECG tracing must be examined very carefully with the aforementioned caveat in mind.

Brugada syndrome

Reported for the first time in 1992, BrS is a rare (1/2500) inherited arrhythmogenic entity characterised by a typical ECG: coved ST-segment elevation (> 2 mm) in more than two right precordial leads, V1-V2 located in the second, third and fourth intercostal space, followed by an inverted T wave in V1-V3, with right bundle branch block and no apparent structural heart alteration. This is the only diagnostic pattern despite two other electrocardiographic patterns may be identified but types 2 and 3 are not diagnostic; provocation tests using sodium channel blockers (ajmaline or flecainide) are necessary to unmask the diagnostic ECG pattern type 1. In BrS, a cardiac sodium channel impairment, the transient outward potassium current repolarises the membrane beyond the voltage at which L-type calcium channels are activated, resulting in a potential action loss. This electrolytic misbalance determines a gap that causes premature impulse triggering polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) that can lead to SCD, sometimes, the first manifestation of the disease. Certain conditions such as fever or the intake of medicines/drugs can be triggers of the diagnostic ECG pattern, consequently, it is mandatory to avoid these special situations. A circadian pattern is presently influenced by vagal activity enhancement or sympathetic activity decrease. Hence, lethal episodes usually occur at rest or night, mainly in men around 40 years of age; however, malignant arrhythmias may occur at both sexes and at all ages. Currently, the main therapeutic management is based on prevention, reducing the risk of malignant arrhythmias and even SCD by avoiding those facilitating situations (fever, drugs), use of quinidine and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), in those cases in which it is deemed necessary (after surviving a cardiac arrest or the occurrence of cardiogenic syncope). In recent years, catheter ablation has been progressively incorporated as an effective treatment for BrS patients with severe phenotypes. Concerning the genetic basis, several genes have been proposed as causative for BrS despite most parts remaining to be definitively associated. To date, only conclusive pathogenic variants in the SCN5A gene have been reported leading to 'loss of function' of the alpha subunit of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5. All deleterious variants follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, explaining 15%–30% of all cases (figure 1). Clinical assessment of relatives, whether or not they have a positive genetic study, is highly recommended.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation of stable chest pain, intermediate-high risk, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain stress testing with echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI, or exercise stress testing with ECG in patients with an intermediate risk of coronary artery disease and stable chest discomfort.

### Flecainide acetate tablet (flecainide acetate) [^114dBSuQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

It is uncertain if flecainide acetate's risk of proarrhythmia is exaggerated in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), high ventricular rate, and/or exercise. Wide complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in two of 12 CAF patients undergoing maximal exercise tolerance testing.

In patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, it is often difficult to distinguish a spontaneous variation in the patient's underlying rhythm disorder from drug-induced worsening, so that the following occurrence rates must be considered approximations. Their frequency appears to be related to dose and to the underlying cardiac disease.

Among patients treated for sustained VT (who frequently also had CHF, a low ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction and/or an episode of cardiac arrest), the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 13% when dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, and did not exceed 300 mg/day in most patients. In early studies in patients with sustained VT utilizing a higher initial dose (400 mg/day) the incidence of proarrhythmic events was 26%; moreover, in about 10% of the patients treated proarrhythmic events resulted in death, despite prompt medical attention. With lower initial doses, the incidence of proarrhythmic events resulting in death decreased to 0.5% of these patients. Accordingly, it is extremely important to follow the recommended dosage schedule. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation — diagnostic evaluation and genetic testing — A staged case screening approach "was associated with an incremental diagnostic yield" and included "(1) ECG, signal-averaged ECG, telemetry; (2) imaging (MRI with and without contrast); (3) provocative tests (exercise stress test, epinephrine infusion, procainamide); (4) EPS and voltage map; (5) ventricular biopsy; and (6) targeted genetic testing)". Genetic diagnostic testing "may be considered" when evaluation is inconclusive or suggests a "forme fruste" channelopathy, with reported yields ranging from targeted approaches where "mutations in 47% of patients" were identified to screening that is "very low in the absence of a clinical suspicion", and broad gene screening "is too expensive at this stage to be recommended".

### Utility of routine exercise testing to detect rate-related QRS widening in patients without structural heart disease on class Ic antiarrhythmic agents (flecainide and Propafenone) [^116x4BFY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Class Ic antiarrhythmic agents are effective in the treatment of various atrial tachyarrhythmias. They are known to cause rate-related QRS widening in the presence of structural heart disease, which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The role of routine exercise electrocardiography in patients without structural heart disease is unknown. All patients initiated on class Ic antiarrhythmic agents and who had exercise electrocardiography performed from June 2009 to June 2013 were included. Symptom-limited treadmill electrocardiography was performed to detect significant QRS widening at peak exercise (defined as an increase of > 25% of baseline QRS). Fifty-six patients were included in the study. All patients were screened for structural heart disease before initiation of the medication. Significant QRS widening and atrial tachycardia occurred in a single patient, which terminated with cessation of exercise. This patient had a history of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy with normalization of ejection fraction 3 years before being placed on flecainide. In conclusion, routine exercise testing to detect QRS widening is not warranted in patients with no structural heart disease.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy family screening — It is recommended that a genetic counselor or appropriately experienced clinician obtain a comprehensive 3-generation family history (Class of Recommendation [COR] I, Level of Evidence [LOE] C‑EO). It is recommended that first-degree relatives undergo clinical evaluation every 1–3 years starting at 10–12 years of age (COR I, LOE B‑NR). Cardiovascular evaluation should include 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ambulatory ECG, and cardiac imaging (COR I, LOE B‑NR). Exercise stress testing (arrhythmia provocation) may be considered as a useful adjunct to cardiovascular evaluation (COR IIb, LOE C‑LD).

### Electrocardiography… [^114h77px]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

- Cardiac rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia;
- Inadequate coronary artery blood flow, such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction;
- and electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia. Traditionally, "ECG" usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below. However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG. ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system.

Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers. Medical uses The overall goal of performing an ECG is to obtain information about the electrical functioning of the heart. Medical uses for this information are varied and often need to be combined with knowledge of the structure of the heart and physical examination signs to be interpreted. Some indications for performing an ECG include the following:

- Chest pain or suspected myocardial infarction, such as ST elevated myocardial infarction or non-ST elevated myocardial infarction
- Symptoms such as shortness of breath, murmurs, fainting, seizures, funny turns, or arrhythmias including new onset palpitations or monitoring of known cardiac arrhythmias.
- Medication monitoring and management of overdose
- Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia
- Perioperative monitoring in which any form of anesthesia is involved. This includes preoperative assessment and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring. ECGs can be recorded as short intermittent tracings or continuous ECG monitoring. Continuous monitoring is used for critically ill patients, patients undergoing general anesthesia, and patients who have an infrequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia that would unlikely be seen on a conventional ten-second ECG. Continuous monitoring can be conducted by using Holter monitors, internal and external defibrillators and pacemakers, and/or biotelemetry. Screening For adults, evidence does not support the use of ECGs among those without symptoms or at low risk of cardiovascular disease as an effort for prevention.

This is because an ECG may falsely indicate the existence of a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, and overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening may also be considered in adolescents as part of a sports physical out of concern for sudden cardiac death. The Lewis lead or S5-lead can be used to better detect atrial activity in relation to that of the ventricles. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry. Interpretation Interpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the electrical conduction system of the heart.

### ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads following administration of class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs [^113dHi1k]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic changes were evaluated retrospectively in five patients without previous episodes of syncope or ventricular fibrillation who developed abnormal ST segment elevation mimicking the Brugada syndrome in leads V1-V3 after the administration of class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. Pilsicainide (four patients) or flecainide (one patient) were administered orally for the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or premature atrial contractions. The QRS duration, QTc, and JT intervals on 12 lead surface ECG before administration of these drugs were all within normal range. After administration of the drugs, coved-type ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads was observed with mild QRS prolongation, but there were no apparent changes in JT intervals. No serious arrhythmias were observed during the follow up periods. Since ST segment elevation with mild QRS prolongation was observed with both pilsicainide and flecainide, strong sodium channel blocking effects in the depolarisation may have been the main factors responsible for the ECG changes. As the relation between ST segment elevation and the incidence of serious arrhythmias has not yet been sufficiently clarified, electrocardiographic changes should be closely monitored whenever class Ic drugs are given.
