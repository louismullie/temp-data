## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered for a patient with alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for a patient with alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline laboratory panel to assess injury and synthetic function. Then, I should verify coagulation studies and their prognostic use. Next, I will consider alcohol-specific biomarkers, followed by noninvasive fibrosis assessment. After that, I need to review labs for complications of cirrhosis, screen for coexisting etiologies, set a surveillance cadence, and finally determine when advanced noninvasive or invasive tests are indicated.

> Let me first confirm the core baseline panel. Standard guidance for abnormal liver blood tests recommends bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP, and GGT, plus a complete blood count; these differentiate hepatocellular injury from cholestasis and give a snapshot of synthetic function and portal hypertensive sequelae such as thrombocytopenia, which is particularly relevant in established cirrhosis; I should double-check interpretation against patterns defined in liver chemistry guidelines to avoid misclassification of injury type [^113z2Ems] [^117MpALN].

> I need to check coagulation parameters next. PT/INR is integral to assessing hepatic synthetic function and is part of prognostic indices; elevated INR suggests advanced dysfunction and contributes to MELD-based prognostication, though I should remember that INR alone is not a bleeding risk predictor in low-risk procedures and that coagulation in cirrhosis is rebalanced; still, as a lab for synthetic function and prognosis, PT/INR belongs in the initial and serial workup [^117JDhKB] [^117JDhKB] [^112d1MmZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without alcohol-specific markers. GGT is often elevated with heavy alcohol use, and the AST/ALT ratio is informative: a ratio greater than 1 supports alcohol-related disease and greater than 2 is characteristic of alcoholic hepatitis or advanced cirrhosis; macrocytosis on CBC (elevated MCV) can also support chronic alcohol use; however, let me verify ongoing consumption with objective markers and clinical history because lab surrogates are imperfect; noninvasive alcohol biomarkers and structured assessments complement GGT and transaminase patterns in ALD [^116Wxnis] [^113LmmUZ] [^112faSbn].

> Next, I should review noninvasive fibrosis assessment. Simple blood-based scores such as APRI and FIB-4 are recommended first-line in many chronic liver disease contexts and are favored over costlier proprietary panels in several use cases; however, wait, I must be precise: AASLD advises these tests for initial staging in diseases like HCV and cautions against using blood-based tests to monitor histologic progression over time, so I should not imply serial use to track regression or progression; for ALD specifically, evidence supports APRI/FIB-4 utility to separate mild from advanced fibrosis, but performance varies by etiology; and although strong data exist in NAFLD validating cirrhosis detection with sequential algorithms, I should confirm applicability when extrapolating to ALD since disease-specific thresholds differ [^112z9W5x] [^111eb7Gd] [^116Rf8zw] [^112a3kUE] [^116AW5EN].

> I will now examine lab monitoring for complications. Thrombocytopenia can flag portal hypertension risk; for ascites, if present, I need to ensure diagnostic paracentesis with cell count, albumin for SAAG, culture, and cytology when indicated; for suspected hepatic encephalopathy, ammonia can be obtained, but I should confirm diagnosis clinically rather than rely on levels; for renal dysfunction and diuretic safety, creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes — particularly sodium — require close follow-up; given infection risk in cirrhosis, I should have a low threshold for CRP/procalcitonin and cultures when infection is suspected [^116VZBsx] [^115Gumis] [^1147QQ6P] [^117JDhKB] [^114sQhYt].

> Let me consider coexisting etiologies and contributing factors; even when alcohol is primary, I should exclude other causes. Viral hepatitis serologies for HBV and HCV, iron studies for hemochromatosis, autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, AMA) when indicated, and alpha-1 antitrypsin level in the right clinical context are prudent; I should double-check that this aligns with both abnormal liver test guidance and cirrhosis workup standards to avoid missing dual pathology [^117MpALN] [^117JDhKB] [^113z2Ems].

> Next, I should review surveillance and longitudinal monitoring. For stable outpatients, repeating LFTs, CBC, and PT/INR roughly every 3–6 months is reasonable to detect change; HCC surveillance with ultrasound, with or without AFP, every 6 months is standard; wait, I initially thought to cite an EASL 2022 HCC document here, but that specific 2022 EASL reference is about bleeding and thrombosis, so I should instead anchor HCC surveillance to general cirrhosis management sources and emphasize that real-world adherence remains suboptimal; esophageal variceal screening with baseline and periodic upper endoscopy is essential; and I need to ensure integration with alcohol use disorder care, reinforcing abstinence as the most effective disease-modifying intervention and monitoring with GGT or other biomarkers when appropriate [^117JDhKB] [^1117L8BK] [^113kVZ5f] [^116Wxnis].

> I should confirm when to add advanced noninvasive or invasive tests. Transient elastography is useful to corroborate fibrosis stage and portal hypertension risk in ALD, with reasonable diagnostic performance; imaging-based noninvasive tests are endorsed as initial staging tools before considering biopsy across chronic liver diseases; and liver biopsy is generally unnecessary in established alcohol-related cirrhosis unless diagnostic uncertainty persists or alcoholic hepatitis confirmation would change management; let me reconsider serial monitoring choices — again, serial blood-based NITs are not recommended to track histologic change [^114mQh6j] [^112MRk9T] [^114Huvyo] [^113kVZ5f] [^116Rf8zw].

> Summarizing the laboratory approach, I need to ensure the core panel includes bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, CBC with platelets, PT/INR, creatinine, and electrolytes for initial assessment and ongoing monitoring; alcohol-specific assessment incorporates GGT trends, AST/ALT ratio, MCV, and, when needed, dedicated biomarkers of recent intake; noninvasive fibrosis scoring with APRI/FIB-4 supports staging but should not be used to monitor histologic progression; complication-directed testing includes paracentesis studies for ascites, targeted ammonia for suspected encephalopathy, renal panels for hepatorenal risks, and inflammatory markers and cultures when infection is suspected; a one-time or targeted etiologic screen covers HBV/HCV serologies, iron studies, autoimmune markers, and alpha-1 antitrypsin as indicated; surveillance entails periodic labs, semiannual HCC ultrasound with or without AFP, and endoscopic variceal screening, all embedded within an abstinence-centered, integrated ALD and AUD care plan [^113z2Ems] [^117MpALN] [^117JDhKB] [^116Wxnis] [^112faSbn] [^112z9W5x] [^116Rf8zw] [^115Gumis] [^114fDbhH] [^114sQhYt] [^1117L8BK] [^113kVZ5f].

---

For a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis, order a **CBC, CMP, PT/INR, and ammonia** to assess liver function and complications [^113z2Ems] [^117MpALN]. Add **hepatitis B/C serologies, iron studies, and autoimmune markers** to exclude other causes [^113z2Ems]. Monitor **AFP for HCC surveillance** and check **ethanol, GGT, CDT, and PEth** to detect ongoing alcohol use [^112j17nt] [^112faSbn] [^116Wxnis]. Use **MELD and Child-Pugh scores** for prognosis and repeat labs every 3–6 months or as clinically indicated [^1166EQV2].

## Baseline laboratory evaluation

### Liver function tests (LFTs)

- **AST and ALT**: Typically elevated with AST/ALT ratio > 2 in alcoholic cirrhosis.
- **Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)**: May be elevated, indicating cholestasis or biliary involvement [^117MpALN].
- **Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)**: Often markedly elevated in alcohol-related liver disease [^116Wxnis].
- **Total and direct bilirubin**: Elevated levels indicate impaired hepatic conjugation and excretion [^117MpALN].
- **Albumin**: Decreased levels reflect impaired hepatic synthetic function [^112RBbyZ].
- **Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)**: Prolonged PT/INR indicates impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors [^117MpALN].

---

### Complete blood count (CBC)

- **Hemoglobin and hematocrit**: Anemia is common due to chronic blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or hypersplenism [^117JDhKB].
- **White blood cell count**: Leukopenia may occur due to hypersplenism or bone marrow suppression [^114sQhYt].
- **Platelet count**: Thrombocytopenia is common due to hypersplenism and decreased thrombopoietin production [^112hkzh2].

---

### Renal function tests

Include **serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)** to assess renal function, as renal impairment is common in advanced cirrhosis [^117CdrSP].

---

### Electrolyte panel

Assess **sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate**; hyponatremia and electrolyte imbalances are common in cirrhosis.

---

### Additional laboratory tests

Measure **serum ammonia** to assess for hepatic encephalopathy; elevated levels support the diagnosis. **Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)** may be elevated and may suggest hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common complication of cirrhosis [^112j17nt]. **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)** may also be elevated due to hepatic injury.

---

## Evaluation of complications

### Ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)

In patients with ascites or suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), perform a **diagnostic paracentesis** and obtain **ascitic fluid analysis**, including cell count, differential, albumin, total protein, culture, and sensitivity [^115Gumis] [^114qbwPX].

---

### Hepatic encephalopathy

Assess hepatic encephalopathy with **serum ammonia** measurement; elevated levels support the diagnosis.

---

### Coagulopathy

Obtain **PT/INR and fibrinogen** to assess coagulation status.

---

### Renal impairment

Monitor **serum creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes** to assess renal function and detect hepatorenal syndrome.

---

## Monitoring alcohol consumption

- **Ethanol levels**: To detect recent alcohol consumption [^112faSbn].
- **Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT)**: Marker of chronic alcohol consumption [^116Wxnis].
- **Phosphatidylethanol (PEth)**: Sensitive marker of recent alcohol intake [^112faSbn].

---

## Frequency of laboratory monitoring

Monitor **stable patients** every 3–6 months, whereas **decompensated patients** require more frequent monitoring, typically every 1–3 months or as clinically indicated.

---

## Prognostic scoring systems

The **Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score** uses bilirubin, creatinine, and INR to assess disease severity and prioritize liver transplantation, while the **Child-Pugh score** uses bilirubin, albumin, PT/INR, ascites, and encephalopathy to assess prognosis [^1166EQV2].

## Summary table of recommended laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| - AST <br/> - ALT <br/> - ALP <br/> - GGT <br/> - Bilirubin <br/> - Albumin <br/> - PT/INR | Liver function and synthetic capacity |

### Predictors of clinical outcomes in cirrhosis patients [^1166EQV2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The review aims to explain the different systems available to clinicians for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis represents the final stage of chronic liver disease and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

The most commonly utilized tools to predict outcomes in patients with cirrhosis include:

- **Assessing severity of portal hypertension**: Using hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements provides valuable prognostic information, yet it is costly, time-consuming, and invasive.

- **Using scoring systems**: Systems such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores can be calculated quickly. They not only assess liver function but also yield predictive information. However, they represent only one point in time and do not take into account the full clinical picture.

- **Clinical staging systems**: These have traditionally focused on compensated and decompensated stages, with newer models assessing the influence of cirrhosis-related complications. Despite their potential, these newer models are not commonly utilized.

Predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis is challenging. It is likely best accomplished with a combination of objective data, such as that provided by MELD and HVPG, in addition to an understanding of the clinical course of cirrhosis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Initial investigations**: Investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months (level 2b, grade B).

- **Research recommendation**: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended (level 5, grade D).

- **Interpretation of results**: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after reviewing previous results, past medical history, and medical condition (level 5, grade D).

- **Significance of abnormalities**: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context (level 5, grade D).

- **Investigation with a liver aetiology screen**: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation regardless of the level and duration of abnormality. 'Abnormal' refers to analytes that are outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B).

- **Components of a standard liver aetiology screen in adults**: A standard screen should include an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and serum immunoglobulins.

### Non-invasive tests for alcohol-associated liver disease [^112faSbn]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Alcohol consumption is a global phenomenon and a major contributor to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Detecting individuals at risk of ALD has been challenging, with only a small fraction of patients being identified at early stages compared to other chronic liver diseases. In response to this challenge, non-invasive tests (NITs) have become essential tools for the detection of ALD, offering opportunities for early identification and intervention to mitigate the disease burden.

Noninvasive alcohol consumption biomarkers are crucial in estimating individuals' recent alcohol intake, providing valuable insights into their drinking patterns. Various NITs have been investigated for the initial screening of asymptomatic individuals at risk of ALD, as well as for identifying specific stages of the disease. These NITs are applied in two main clinical scenarios: population-based stratification for identifying and predicting liver-related symptoms and diagnosing and prognosticating compensated cirrhosis or advanced chronic liver disease in secondary or tertiary care settings.

Moreover, NITs play a significant role in the prognostic assessment of patients with various manifestations of ALD, including alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), decompensated cirrhosis, and metabolic-associated and ALD. These tests guide appropriate treatment decisions and predict outcomes. In this review, various NITs for the early detection and monitoring of alcohol consumption were discussed. Additionally, the evaluation of NITs for screening and predicting ALD and liver complications was addressed.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, specifically with respect to liver function tests (LFTs), the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). These are standard tests to define liver damage and liver dysfunction in patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI).

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114qbwPX]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology, in collaboration with the British Association for the Study of the Liver, has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarize the evidence that guides the clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Since the publication of the last guideline in 2007, substantial advances have been made in this area.

These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and include systematic reviews in key areas such as diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses are available, these have been updated with additional studies.

In addition, the document incorporates results from prospective and retrospective studies, evidence from expert committee reports, and, in some instances, from case series reports. Where possible, judgment has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines, and specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practicing clinicians, with an expectation of revision in 3 years' time.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^117FSHDR]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, particularly concerning patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis and grading acute-on-chronic liver failure based on the assessment of organ function, as defined by the CLIF-C Organ Failure score.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Selected noninvasive markers in diagnosing liver diseases [^114pMe2X]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of certain noninvasive liver-damage markers in predicting liver diseases and the clinical severity of liver cirrhosis, we tested serum specimens from 57 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, 30 with nonalcoholic cirrhosis, and 22 with toxic hepatitis (TH). The Bonacini, King, and Göteborg University Cirrhosis Index (GUCI) scores were calculated using specific formulas.

The values of the Bonacini and King scores significantly differ between liver diseases. The Bonacini score was higher in alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis than in TH, and the King score was higher in alcoholic cirrhosis than in TH. All tested scores varied according to the severity of liver damage and were higher in Child-Pugh class C than in classes A and B.

We conclude that the Bonacini and King scores differ between liver diseases and that all tested scores reflect the severity of liver cirrhosis.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^116Wxnis]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

In its early stages, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a silent disease and can only be detected by laboratory tests or imaging techniques. There are few programs aimed at early detection of ALD at its asymptomatic stages. Some patients with early ALD can show stigmata of alcohol abuse such as bilateral parotid gland hypertrophy, muscle wasting, malnutrition, Dupuytren's sign, and signs of peripheral neuropathy.

In patients with cirrhosis, most physical findings are not specific to the etiology. However, some signs, such as gynecomastia and extensive spider angiomas, may be more frequently seen in those with alcohol as the main cause of liver disease. The diagnosis of ALD is frequently suspected upon documentation of excessive alcohol consumption (> 40–50 g/day) and the presence of clinical and/or biological abnormalities suggestive of liver injury.

Laboratory blood tests, such as mean corpuscular volume, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), can indicate early ALD. Advanced ALD is suspected if there is decreased albumin, increased INR, elevated bilirubin level, or low platelet count. There are several laboratory markers that estimate persistent alcohol intake; among them, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and GGT are the most frequently used markers to detect previous alcohol consumption. In patients with ALD, the AST/ALT ratio typically is greater than 1. This ratio is typically greater than 2 in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and can also be found in patients with advanced cirrhosis regardless of the etiology.

### Cirrhosis: Diagnosis and management [^117JDhKB]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that early cirrhosis may be reversible. Only one in three people with cirrhosis knows they have it. Most patients with cirrhosis remain asymptomatic until the onset of decompensation. When clinical signs, symptoms, or abnormal liver function tests are discovered, further evaluation should be pursued promptly.

The most common causes of cirrhosis are viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Initial workup includes viral hepatitis serologies, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and abdominal ultrasonography, as well as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, if not already ordered. Additional testing is based on demographics and risk factors.

Common serum and ultrasound-based screening tests to assess fibrosis include the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index score, Fibrosis 4 score, FibroTest/FibroSure, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, standard ultrasonography, and transient elastography. Generally, noninvasive tests are most useful in identifying patients with no to minimal fibrosis or advanced fibrosis.

Chronic liver disease management includes directed counseling, laboratory testing, and ultrasound monitoring. Treatment goals are preventing cirrhosis, decompensation, and death. Varices are monitored with endoscopy and often require prophylaxis with nonselective beta blockers. Ascites treatment includes diuresis and salt restriction.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason, threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and the context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this, consider two patients: a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval. Yet, 10 years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C, if not investigated and diagnosed, is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease.

Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example, ALT) may be too high. This is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### Care of the cirrhotic patient [^114sQhYt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of cirrhotic liver disease encompass a broad spectrum of conditions that reflect the consequences of high portal pressures resulting from fibrosis and diminished hepatic synthetic reserve. Patients with cirrhosis are at heightened risk for developing infections. While the use of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy may be considered lifesaving in the setting of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, controversy remains regarding its application in managing cirrhotic ascites. Infectious disease specialists are becoming increasingly familiar with managing viral hepatitis, which includes screening for hepatocellular carcinoma and maintaining vigilance for infectious complications from antiviral therapy.

### Prognostic performance of 7 biomarkers compared to liver biopsy in early alcohol-related liver disease [^114qM7Jk]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

In this prospective, single-etiology cohort of 462 patients with biopsy-proven alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and up to 7 years of follow-up, we found that elastography and the ELF test predict liver-related events with excellent prognostic accuracy, superior to fibrosis stage. Other, cheaper, blood-based tests are valid alternatives with good prognostic accuracies. Our findings suggest that widely known cut-offs for transient elastography (TE) can be used to separate patients into three groups with distinctly different risk profiles. Compared to patients with a liver stiffness below 10 kPa, those with liver stiffness between 10 and 15 kPa had an 8-fold higher hazard for liver-related events, and those with liver stiffness greater than 15 kPa had a 28-fold higher hazard. Our results furthermore highlight the importance of excessive drinking, which significantly worsened prognosis in patients at high and moderate risk of progressing to liver-related events. Finally, our data indicate that liver biopsy can be substituted with non-invasive testing for prognostication purposes.

This is the first study to comprehensively report on the prognostic ability of several non-invasive tests to predict liver-related events, all-cause mortality, and infections requiring hospitalizations in a population of patients with biopsy-verified ALD at mostly early stages of fibrosis. By ascertainment of events from manual review of the electronic health records of every study participant, we were able to obtain a detailed follow-up with a negligible number of losses to follow-up and extensive subgroup analyses.

### A model to identify heavy drinkers at high risk for liver disease progression [^115oKkob]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) causes chronic liver disease. We investigated how information on patients' drinking history and amount, stage of liver disease, and demographic features can be used to determine the risk of disease progression.

- **Methods**: We collected data from 2,334 heavy drinkers (50 g/day or more) with persistently abnormal results from liver tests who had been admitted to a hepato-gastroenterology unit in France from January 1982 through December 1997. Patients with a recorded duration of alcohol abuse were assigned to the development cohort (n = 1,599; 75% men) or the validation cohort (n = 735; 75% men), based on the presence of a liver biopsy. We collected data from both cohorts on patient history and disease stage at the time of hospitalization.

	- For the development cohort, the severity of the disease was scored by the METAVIR (due to the availability of liver histology reports); in the validation cohort, only the presence of liver complications was assessed. We developed a model of ALD progression and the occurrence of liver complications (hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver decompensation) in association with exposure to alcohol, age at the onset of heavy drinking, amount of alcohol intake, sex, and body mass index.

	- The model was fitted to the development cohort and then evaluated in the validation cohort. We then tested the ability of the model to predict disease progression for any patient profile (baseline evaluation). Patients with a 5-year weighted risk of liver complications greater than 5% were considered at high risk for disease progression.

### Alcohol consumption by cirrhotic subjects: Patterns of use and effects on liver function [^113LmmUZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

We investigated patterns of use of alcohol and its clinical effects among cirrhotic subjects who participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of a transjugular intravenous portosystemic shunt and a distal splenorenal shunt.

- **Methods**: There were 132 cirrhotic subjects, 78 with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), who were followed for a median of 49 months (range 2–93 months). Alcohol use was assessed by patient questionnaire, with corroboration by family members.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight subjects (21%) were drinking at study entry and 60 subjects (45%) drank during follow-up. Heavy drinking (> 4 drinks/day) was recorded in 25 ALD subjects but in no non-ALD subjects (P < 0.0001). Drinking by ALD subjects was associated with a 153% increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (P < 0.0001). The frequencies of death (46% vs 30%), ascites (33% vs 20%), encephalopathy (56% vs 42%), and variceal bleeding (11% vs 3%) were greater in the ALD group. In a Cox proportional hazards model, only "ever heavy drinking" was associated with death (P = 0.0099), while recent heavy drinking increased the hazard of variceal hemorrhage dramatically (odds ratio 10.85).

- **Conclusions**: Whereas most cirrhotic subjects, alcoholic or not, did not drink during 5 years of observation, heavy alcohol use occurred exclusively in ALD patients. Alcohol use by ALD subjects was associated with elevations in GGT and was linked to death and rebleeding from shunt dysfunction.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^112a3kUE]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

For the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with ALD, non-invasive methods including serum markers and liver stiffness measurements are available. Most non-invasive tests have been largely validated in patients with hepatitis C, while few studies have included patients with ALD. Thus, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI), FibroTest®, Fibrometer®, Hepascore®, and Fibrosure® can be useful in patients with ALD. They are effective in distinguishing between mild and severe fibrosis but have limited utility for intermediate degrees of fibrosis.

In terms of prognostic value, FibroTest® (AUROC for survival = 0.79 ± 0.04), Fibrometer® (0.80 ± 0.04), and Hepascore® (0.78 ± 0.04) had prognostic values equivalent to liver biopsy (0.77 ± 0.04). Transient elastography (FibroScan®) is commonly used to assess fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. FibroScan® calculates an estimate, expressed in kPa (kilopascals), for stiffness by measuring wave velocity. The diagnostic threshold with the optimal diagnostic value for detecting cirrhosis varies between 12.5 and 14.6 kPa in studies involving chronic hepatitis C.

The diagnostic value of FibroScan® for detecting cirrhosis has been evaluated in excessive drinkers in two independent studies. In these studies, elasticity correlated with fibrosis stage, and the diagnostic value of FibroScan® was confirmed by AUROC close to 0.9. The optimal thresholds for diagnosing cirrhosis were 19.5 and 22.6 kPa, respectively. It is important to note that these thresholds, although close together, differ significantly.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked frequently in both primary and secondary care. This is done in an attempt to exclude liver disease, monitor potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and investigate generally unwell patients. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases, they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and the likelihood of liver disease. Additionally, the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons, such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly leads to a cycle of additional liver blood testing in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Notably, most patients referred to hospitals with abnormal liver tests do not have significant liver disease evidence.

For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130,849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016 from 82 general practices, with 38,636 (30%) containing at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period, 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkable.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112hVa6M]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The EASL 2018 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis of acute-on-chronic liver failure in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation, which is defined as the acute development or worsening of ascites, overt encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, nonobstructive jaundice, and/or bacterial infections, when organ failures associated with high short-term mortality develop.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

A liver blood test consists of readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. Historically, they have been referred to as liver function tests (LFTs), yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. Therefore, this guideline refers to liver blood tests to more accurately capture their usage in clinical practice.

- **Hepatobiliary enzymes**: When interpreted in isolation, these convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function. Platelets convey information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as a value outside the standard reference interval, although emerging literature suggests that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the heme component of hemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms: unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually due to hemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises both the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

The toll of liver disease continues to rise, and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies, including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Management and treatment of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension: Recommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Resource Center Program and the National Hepatitis C Program [^112j17nt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis represents the end stage of any chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C and alcohol are currently the main causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Although initially cirrhosis is compensated, it eventually becomes decompensated, as defined by the presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and/or jaundice.

These management recommendations are divided according to the status, compensated or decompensated, of the cirrhotic patient, with a separate section for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as this applies to patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In the compensated patient, the main objective is to prevent variceal hemorrhage and any practice that could lead to decompensation.

In the decompensated patient, acute variceal hemorrhage and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are severe complications that require hospitalization. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a severe complication of cirrhosis but one that usually occurs in patients who are already in the hospital and, as it represents an extreme of the hemodynamic alterations that lead to ascites formation, it is placed under treatment of ascites.

Recent advances in the pathophysiology of the complications of cirrhosis have allowed for a more rational management of cirrhosis and also for the stratification of patients into different risk groups that require different management. These recommendations are based on evidence in the literature, mainly from randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses of these trials.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In the case of abnormal liver blood tests, as detailed in Figure 1, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. For all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is critical to take a thorough history and perform a targeted clinical examination to identify the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally elevate due to an inter-current illness. However, when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% remained abnormal on retesting after one month, and 75% were still abnormal at two years. Thus, for a patient with abnormal liver blood tests, it is not advisable to simply repeat the same panel of tests; rather, the underlying cause should be determined unless there is a strong clinical suspicion of a transient finding.

In pediatric cases, there should be a low threshold for referral to a pediatrician for further investigation, as the common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less prevalent in children, and there is a broader differential diagnosis.

- **Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: Figure 1 illustrates the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Yellow boxes indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with significantly deranged liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be urgently referred to secondary care (denoted by a red box). For others, a clinical history and evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will guide the choice of pathway.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1156cwYb]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, particularly in the evaluation of variceal hemorrhage, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend considering the administration of pre-endoscopy erythromycin (250 mg IV 30–120 minutes before), in the absence of contraindications such as QT prolongation, to facilitate the procedure.

---

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1163SZ3e]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

As with the extent of liver blood test derangement, there are also assumptions that the duration is a reflection of clinical significance, thus necessitating routine repeat testing for patients with mildly abnormal liver blood tests. This is predicated on the belief that many liver blood test abnormalities may be transient and incidental and will normalize, thus precluding any significant liver disease. While this may be true of some acute liver diseases, it is manifestly not the case for many chronic liver diseases such as HCV and NAFLD, where even normalized liver blood tests do not necessarily imply absence or resolution of disease.

Moreover, as demonstrated by the BALLETS study, 84% of adults still had abnormal tests when repeated 1 month later. When repeating blood tests to see if they have normalized, the whole cost of the investigation must be borne in mind, which includes recalling the patient as well as obtaining and transporting the blood sample to the laboratory and the cost of the laboratory analysis. Therefore, a strategy of simply repeating abnormal tests can only be justified where there is a high degree of certainty that the abnormality will resolve in response to an identified acute insult. In other cases, detection of the first abnormality should trigger investigation of the etiology, or repeat testing to assess progression or disease severity where there is a suspicion that the underlying cause may require urgent referral or admission.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^111eb7Gd]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, especially in the evaluation of fibrosis in hepatitis C, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining simple blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessments. Tests such as the APRI or FIB-4 Index should be utilized as initial tests to detect significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. This approach is recommended for adult patients with chronic HCV infection undergoing fibrosis staging before initiating antiviral therapy.

### Transient elastography for diagnosis of stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease [^114mQh6j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The presence and progression of hepatic (liver) fibrosis into cirrhosis is a prognostic variable impacting survival in people with alcoholic liver disease. Liver biopsy, although an invasive method, is the recommended 'reference standard' for diagnosing and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with liver diseases. Transient elastography is a non-invasive method for assessing and staging hepatic fibrosis.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography for diagnosing and staging hepatic fibrosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared to liver biopsy. Additionally, to identify the optimal cut-off values for differentiating the five stages of hepatic fibrosis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Registers, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Science Citation Index Expanded were searched, with the last search conducted in August 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Diagnostic cohort and diagnostic case-control study designs assessed hepatic fibrosis in participants with alcoholic liver disease using transient elastography and liver biopsy, irrespective of language or publication status. The study participants could be of any sex and ethnic origin, above 16 years old, hospitalized or managed as outpatients. We excluded participants with viral hepatitis, autoimmunity, metabolic diseases, and toxins.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed the guidelines in the draft Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy.

Five retrospective and nine prospective diagnostic cohort studies were included.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^113Gk3wa]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although several translational studies have evaluated the risk of cirrhosis, the natural history of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains only partially explored due to the lack of prospective studies of large cohorts designed to assess the progression of liver damage. A translational study comprising over 2000 hospitalized excessive heavy drinkers, with modified liver laboratory test results investigated by liver biopsy, showed that 34% of these subjects presented with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, 46% with fatty liver with or without fibrosis, 9% with acute alcohol-induced hepatitis, and 11% with a normal liver.

When the progression of fibrosis was expressed in terms of duration of exposure, it was estimated by dividing the fibrosis score by the time of exposure. In heavy drinkers, the risk of cirrhosis reached 50% at 61 years of age, with the likelihood of developing cirrhosis in 50% of cases observed after 35 years. A shorter time of progression to cirrhosis was noted among women than men. Based on an analysis of all the published data, cirrhosis occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with excessive alcohol consumption.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. It includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include the following:

- **Correction of the underlying risk factors**: Address lifestyle and medical issues contributing to the development of the disease.

- **Avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease**: Identify and limit exposure to elements that could exacerbate liver damage.

- **Specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis**: Implement therapies directly targeting the condition.

### Moving diagnosis of liver fibrosis into the community [^116ED1vY]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a leading cause of death worldwide, with alcohol consumption and metabolic risk factors accounting for the majority of cases of CLD in many developed countries. Currently, specific strategies for the early diagnosis of CLD are lacking, and consequently, most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, which is associated with negative consequences for disease management and prognosis.

Screening for CLD is based on either the detection of chronic viral hepatitis B and C, or the detection of liver fibrosis in patients with steatotic liver disease related to alcohol or metabolic dysfunction. Non-invasive tools, including serological and imaging-based tests, can be used to detect liver fibrosis. Clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for liver fibrosis using algorithms that combine different non-invasive tests, with widely available but low-accuracy tests, such as FIB-4, recommended as a first screening step in the primary care setting. Other tests with lower availability but higher accuracy, such as transient elastography or the enhanced liver fibrosis test, are recommended as a second step.

There are different pathways for the early detection of patients with CLD from primary to specialized care, with primary care providers being key for early detection, management, and referral of patients. In addition, interventions targeting metabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption should be carried out in collaboration between specialists and primary care. In this review, we describe liver fibrosis from the community perspective, highlighting gaps in knowledge.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available).

- **Patients flagged with the AUDIT-C**: Individuals consuming more than 100 U/L should be considered for an assessment of liver fibrosis, similar to the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD who are at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112J3ukT]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, particularly for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (diagnosis), the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend investigating potential precipitating factors. These factors can be either hepatic, such as heavy alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), or extrahepatic, including infections, hemodynamic derangements following hemorrhage, and surgery. It is important to recognize that in a significant proportion of patients, a precipitating factor may not be identified.

### Adding inflammatory markers and refining National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria improve diagnostic accuracy for alcohol-associated hepatitis [^116GwnEu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Although histology is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), it is not required for entry into therapeutic studies if patients meet National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) consensus criteria for probable AH. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of NIAAA criteria against liver biopsy and to explore new criteria to enhance diagnostic accuracy for AH.

A total of 268 consecutive patients with alcohol-related liver disease with liver biopsy were prospectively included: 210 and 58 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. NIAAA criteria and histological diagnosis of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) were independently reviewed by clinical investigators and pathologists from Hospital Clínic and Mayo Clinic. Using biopsy-proven ASH as a gold standard, we determined the diagnostic capability of NIAAA criteria and proposed the new improved criteria.

In the derivation cohort, the diagnostic accuracy of NIAAA for AH was modest (72%) due to low sensitivity (63%). Subjects who did not meet NIAAA with ASH at liver biopsy had lower 1-year survival compared with subjects without ASH (70% vs. 90%; P < .001). NIAAAm-CRP criteria, created by adding C-reactive protein and modifying the variables of the original NIAAA, had higher sensitivity (70%), accuracy (78%), and specificity (83%). Accuracy was also higher in a sensitivity analysis in severe AH (74% vs. 65%). In the validation cohort, NIAAAm-CRP and NIAAA criteria had a sensitivity of 56% vs. 52% and an accuracy of 76% vs. 69%, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels compared with AST and ALT levels.

The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females; levels above these should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medications should be sought.

For the evaluation of alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be conducted.

### Practical diagnosis of cirrhosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using currently available non-invasive fibrosis tests [^116AW5EN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Blood fibrosis tests were conducted using fasting blood samples taken within a week of the liver biopsy. The following blood fibrosis tests were calculated according to published or patented formulas: FIB4, NAFLD fibrosis score, FibroMeter V3G (FMV3G), and CirrhoMeter V3G (CMV3G). CMV3G is a blood test that combines the same variables as the FMV3G but in a formula with coefficients specifically calculated for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. All blood assays were performed in the laboratories of the investigating centers. We have previously demonstrated the excellent inter-laboratory reproducibility of blood fibrosis tests. The diagnostic thresholds used for blood tests are detailed in supplementary materials. When diagnostic thresholds were not available in the literature, we calculated them in the derivation set of the study, with further validation in the validation set.

### Surveillance of patients with cirrhosis remains suboptimal in the United States [^1117L8BK]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Regular monitoring and surveillance for liver complications are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. While recommendations from professional societies are available, adherence to these guidelines is not well-studied, particularly outside academic centers. This study aimed to determine the frequencies and factors associated with laboratory monitoring, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and esophageal varices (EV) surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.

We identified 82,427 patients with cirrhosis (43,280 compensated and 39,147 decompensated) from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database®, spanning 2007–2016. The proportion of patients undergoing various procedures and testing frequencies, namely laboratory tests (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and prothrombin time), HCC, and EV surveillance, was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine factors associated with the probability of undergoing these procedures.

The findings indicated that the proportions of patients undergoing regular HCC surveillance (8.78%), laboratory testing (29.72%) at least every 6–12 months, and EV surveillance (10.6%) at least every 1–2 years were suboptimal. The majority of patients did not receive HCC (45.4%) or EV (80.3%) surveillance throughout the study period.

- **Patient demographics and healthcare factors**: On multivariable regression, factors associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing procedures included:
	- Age 41–55 compared to those under 41 years
	- Enrollment in preferred provider organization versus health maintenance organization insurance plans
	- Specialist care compared to primary care or other specialties
	- A diagnosis made between 2013–2016 versus 2007–2009
	- Decompensated cirrhosis compared to compensated cirrhosis
	- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to viral hepatitis

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^111STtod]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Noninvasive tests (NITs) are used in all aspects of liver disease management. Their most prominent breakthrough since the millennium has been in advancing early detection of liver fibrosis, but their use is not limited to this. In contrast to the symptom-driven assessment of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis, NITs provide not only opportunities for earlier diagnoses but also accurate prognostication, targeted treatment decisions, and a means of monitoring disease. NITs can inform disease management and decision-making based on validated cutoffs and standardized interpretations as a valuable supplement to clinical acumen.

The Baveno VI and VII consensus meetings resulted in tangible improvements to pathways of care for patients with compensated and decompensated advanced chronic liver disease, including the combination of platelet count and transient elastography to diagnose clinically significant portal hypertension. Furthermore, circulating NITs will play increasingly important roles in assessing the response to interventions against ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), acute kidney injury, and infections. However, due to NITs' wide availability, there is a risk of inaccurate use, leading to a waste of resources and flawed decisions.

In this review, we describe the uses and pitfalls of NITs for hepatic decompensation, from risk stratification in primary care to treatment decisions in outpatient clinics, as well as for the in-hospital management of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. We summarize which NITs to use, when to use them, for what indications, and how to maximize their effectiveness in clinical practice.

- **American College of Physicians Manual**: This manual is for assessing health practices and designing practice guidelines.
- **Guideline policies**: Including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) policy on the development and use of practice guidelines and the AGA policy statement on guidelines.
- **Authors' experience**: Experience in the specified topic.

Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, contrasting with the standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

To more fully characterize the quality of evidence supporting the recommendations, the Practice Guideline Committee of the AASLD requires a Class (reflecting the benefit vs. risk) and Level (assessing the strength or certainty) of evidence to be assigned and reported with each recommendation.

### Alcohol-associated liver disease: Integrated management with alcohol use disorder [^111g1tAh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in many regions worldwide. Around 75% of patients with cirrhosis are unaware of their disease until they are referred to the emergency department. An innovative, noninvasive screening approach is required for an earlier diagnosis of liver fibrosis. In patients with ALD, the physician is inevitably dealing with two major disorders: the liver disease itself and the alcohol use disorder (AUD). Focusing only on the liver disease will inevitably lead to failure because transient improvements in liver function are rapidly overturned if the patient returns to alcohol consumption.

For this reason, integrated models of care provided by hepatologists and addiction specialists are an effective approach, which are, however, not widely available. There are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies for AUD. Progress has recently been made in the management of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), who have improved survival through better understanding of the concept of response to medical treatment, improved survival prediction, and the advent of early liver transplantation. The emerging concept is that listing for transplantation a patient with severe ALD could lead to adjusting the duration of abstinence according to the severity and evolution of liver dysfunction and the patient's addictive profile.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^116bPbMD]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. While unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses, and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease; however, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated (Recommendation 3, Table 1).

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focused history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease, including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors, and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests by providing a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis, and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost-effective.

### Towards a new definition of decompensated cirrhosis [^111aziZc]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

There is universal agreement that the occurrence of clinical complications, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and jaundice, marks the transition from the compensated to the decompensated stage of cirrhosis. Decompensation is associated with a substantial worsening of patient prognosis and is therefore considered the most important stratification variable for the risk of death. However, this classification is an oversimplification, as it does not discriminate between the prognostic subgroups that characterize the course of decompensation, which depends on the type and number of decompensating events.

A deeper insight into the clinical course of decompensated cirrhosis is provided by observational studies characterizing acute decompensation (AD), which occurs mostly in patients who have already experienced decompensating events. Decompensation presents as AD in a portion of patients, while in many others it presents as a slow development of ascites, mild grade 1 or 2 hepatic encephalopathy, or jaundice, not requiring hospitalization. Thus, we propose that decompensation of cirrhosis occurs through two distinct pathways: a non-acute and an acute (which includes acute-on-chronic liver failure) pathway. Moreover, while non-acute decompensation is the most frequent pathway of the first decompensation, AD mostly represents further decompensation.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113ySWPf]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with NAFLD or liver disease of unknown etiology, it is essential to assess the likelihood of liver fibrosis. An initial evaluation includes the calculation of a FIB-4 or NAFLD fibrosis score. Values below 1.3 and 1.455, respectively, indicate a low risk of advanced fibrosis. For individuals over 65 years old, higher threshold values, below 2.0 and 0.12 respectively, should be applied.

- **Second-line tests**: Consider serum markers such as ELF and imaging modalities such as ARFI elastography or FibroScan. Cut-off points for ARFI vary by manufacturer and should be tailored to the specific device used.

For pediatric cases, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendations. ARFI stands for acoustic radiation force impulse, and ELF refers to enhanced liver fibrosis. Additional abbreviations include FIB-4 for fibrosis-4, and NFS for NAFLD fibrosis score.

### Tasmar [^113ev5jH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Laboratory tests:

A program of frequent laboratory monitoring for evidence of hepatocellular injury is essential. However, it is not clear that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes will prevent the occurrence of fulminant liver failure. It is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury, along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug, enhances the likelihood of recovery. Accordingly, the following liver monitoring program is recommended.

Before starting treatment with Tasmar, the physician should conduct appropriate tests to exclude the presence of liver disease. In patients determined to be appropriate candidates for treatment with Tasmar, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT/ALT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST) levels should be determined at baseline and periodically (i.e. every 2 to 4 weeks) for the first 6 months of therapy. After the first six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant. Although more frequent monitoring increases the chances of early detection, the precise schedule for monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment.

If the dose is increased to 200 mg tid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose, and then be conducted every 2 to 4 weeks for the following 6 months of therapy. After six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant.

Discontinue Tasmar if SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST levels exceed 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms indicate possible liver injury.

Noninvasive biomarkers of liver fibrosis represent an intense area of research with the goals of improving patient care, disease stratification, and aiding the development of future antifibrotic therapies. Despite the rapid progress in recent years, there remain questions about how diagnostic studies are designed, statistical methods to account for spectrum bias, clinically relevant thresholds of fibrosis that should be delineated, how diagnostics can be improved, and strengthening the reference test to judge emerging biomarkers. This review discusses the methods to address these issues and where further progress is needed.

Other tests used to detect fibrosis are proprietary indices that perform well for the detection of fibrosis and cirrhosis, such as FibroSure, which measures indirect markers of fibrosis, and the enhanced liver fibrosis test and FIBROSpect II, which are direct measurements of extracellular matrix turnover. These are valuable tests to aid in the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis. However, while point-of-care (POC) tests for AST, ALT, and complete blood cell count are available, there are unfortunately no such tests for the proprietary indices — which require central laboratory processing.

As an alternative, the use of other calculated indices that rely on widely available peripheral blood tests, such as the Fibrosis-4 index (incorporating AST, ALT, platelet count, and patient age) or the AST-platelet ratio index (incorporating platelet count, AST, and AST upper limit of normal), may be an efficient means of staging patients at the POC.

Imaging evaluation of advanced fibrosis can be performed with ultrasonography (US), using transient or shear-wave elastography to assess liver stiffness. Sensitivities for the detection of advanced fibrosis are 0.78 and 0.74, while specificities are 0.87 and 0.84, respectively. This involves the measurement of an induced shear wave or acoustic radiation force impulse to measure the speed of an acoustically generated signal.

### Does this patient with liver disease have cirrhosis [^112hkzh2]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Among adult patients with liver disease, identifying those most likely to have cirrhosis noninvasively is challenging. **Objective**: The objective is to identify simple clinical indicators that can exclude or detect cirrhosis in adults with known or suspected liver disease.

- **Data sources**: A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE, spanning from 1966 to December 2011. Reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks were also utilized.

- **Study selection**: Eighty-six studies of adequate quality were included, which evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying histologically proven cirrhosis.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data, including sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs), and assessed methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary LRs across studies.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis included 19,533 patients, among whom 4,725 had biopsy-proven cirrhosis, resulting in a prevalence rate of 24% (95% CI, 20%-28%). Many physical examinations and simple laboratory tests increase the likelihood of cirrhosis. However, the presence of ascites (LR, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.9–12) and a platelet count of 7 (LR, 9.4; 95% CI, 2.6–37) are the most frequently studied, reliable, and informative results. For lowering the likelihood of cirrhosis, the most useful finding is a Lok index of less than 0.2, a score derived from the platelet count and serum aspartate aminotransferase.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114ehLt6]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Contemporary data from an NHS hospital serving a population of 700,000 found 164 adults with a new diagnosis of ascites over a period of five years. Of these, 55% had cirrhosis: alcohol-related liver disease (58%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (21%), chronic viral hepatitis (4%), autoimmune liver diseases (3%), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (4%). Additionally, 29% had malignancies: gynecological (12%), gastrointestinal (25%), and others (11%). Other cases included 6% cardiac failure (CF), 3% end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 7% due to other etiologies.

The development of ascites is an important milestone in the natural history of cirrhosis. About 20% of patients with cirrhosis have ascites at their first presentation, and 20% of those presenting with ascites die in the first year of the diagnosis. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarize the evidence that guides the clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis.

### Validation of a model for identification of patients with compensated cirrhosis at high risk of decompensation [^116oCYPw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

It is important to rapidly identify patients with advanced liver disease. Routine tests to assess liver function and fibrosis provide data that can be used to determine patients' prognoses. We tested the ability of combined data from the ALBI and FIB-4 scoring systems to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at highest risk for decompensation.

- **Methods**: We collected data from 145 patients with compensated cirrhosis (91% Child A cirrhosis and median MELD scores below 8) from a cohort in Nottingham, United Kingdom, followed for a median of 4.59 years. We collected baseline clinical features and recorded decompensation events. We used these data to develop a model based on liver function (assessed by the ALBI score) and the extent of fibrosis (assessed by the FIB-4 index) to determine the risk of decompensation. The model was validated in two independent external cohorts: one in Dublin, Ireland, and one in Menoufia, Egypt, comprising 234 patients.

- **Results**: In the development cohort, 19.3% of the patients developed decompensated cirrhosis. Using a combination of ALBI and FIB-4 scores, we developed a model that identified patients at low versus high risk of decompensation. The hazard ratio (HR) for decompensation in patients with a high-risk score was 7.10. When the scoring system was tested in the validation cohorts, the HR for decompensation in patients with a high-risk score was 12.54 in the Ireland cohort and 5.10 in the Egypt cohort.

- **Conclusion**: We developed a scoring system, based on a combination of ALBI and FIB-4 scores, that identifies patients with compensated cirrhosis at high risk of decompensation.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: Part I. Diagnosis and evaluation [^114Huvyo]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension.

Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal.

Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only following a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^116VZBsx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding). Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding) are important, given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis (e.g. increased odds of short-term mortality). Hepatic encephalopathy can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication, and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy (e.g. rifaximin plus lactulose) in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### A stepwise algorithm using an at-a-glance first-line test for the non-invasive diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis [^115617SR]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver diseases (CLD) are common and are primarily managed by non-hepatologists. These physicians lack access to the best non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis, which hampers accurate assessment of disease severity. Consequently, referral to a hepatologist is often required. The aim of this study was to implement an algorithm featuring a new first-line test accessible to all physicians for detecting advanced liver fibrosis in patients with CLD.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic study involved 3754 CLD patients with liver biopsy, randomized into derivation and validation sets in a 2:1 ratio. The prognostic study entailed a longitudinal follow-up of 1275 CLD patients tested for baseline fibrosis.

- **Results**: In the diagnostic study, the easy liver fibrosis test (eLIFT) was developed to diagnose advanced fibrosis. It comprises a point system based on age, gender, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), platelets, and prothrombin time. In the validation set, eLIFT and fibrosis-4 (FIB4) shared similar sensitivity (78.0% vs. 76.6%, p = 0.470); however, eLIFT yielded fewer false positives, particularly in patients aged ≥ 60 years (53.8% vs. 82.0%, p < 0.001), making it more appropriate as a screening test. FibroMeter combined with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) was the most accurate of the eight fibrosis tests evaluated. The sensitivity of the eLIFT-FM VCTE algorithm (using eLIFT as the first line and FibroMeter VCTE as the second line) was 76.1% for advanced fibrosis and 92.1% for cirrhosis. In the prognostic study, patients categorized as having "no/mild fibrosis" by the algorithm exhibited excellent liver-related outcomes.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^114hRj1D]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In the alcohol-related liver disease algorithm, if alcohol is suspected to be the main injurious factor, the extent of consumption significantly influences early decision-making. For women drinking at harmful levels, defined as ≥ 35 units/week, and men at ≥ 50 units/week, an assessment of liver fibrosis becomes the critical next step. For other patients, administration of the AUDIT C questionnaire alongside a brief intervention is initially recommended. Patients who continue to drink at hazardous levels should be assessed as per the higher-risk category through liver fibrosis evaluation. This is particularly pertinent for those with a GGT of > 100 U/L. As cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer, they should be tailored to the specific device used. Acronyms: ARFI, acoustic radiation force impulse; ELF, enhanced liver fibrosis; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

The aim of treatment in alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is for patients to cease harmful drinking, usually implying complete abstinence. Referral to alcohol services should be considered for patients with alcohol dependency, defined by an AUDIT score of > 19, and also for those with a score of ≥ 8. Importantly, a liver diagnosis alone can be a highly effective intervention for changing behavior and may suffice for many individuals. However, the provision of such brief interventions in primary care is inconsistent and should receive greater emphasis.

- **Recommendation 8**: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with ARLD with evidence of alcohol dependency.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcoholic liver disease [^113kVZ5f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression.

AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute-on-chronic liver failure. The risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at one month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH. Long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol.

- **Management in hospitalized patients**: General measures include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder.

- **Liver transplantation**: A definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases who do not respond to medical therapy.

There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.
