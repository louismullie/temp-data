## Question

What type of insulin is used first for diabetic keto acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which insulin type should be used first for diabetic ketoacidosis and how to choose the route and dose based on severity and context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and severity classification. Then, I should verify the standard of care for moderate-to-severe DKA. Next, I will consider alternatives for mild DKA and resource-limited settings. After that, I need to check the role and timing of basal insulin, including any emerging evidence for early basal dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note special situations like euglycemic DKA and pediatrics.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and severity because the choice of insulin hinges on it. DKA severity is typically defined by venous pH and bicarbonate, with mild DKA as pH 7.25–7.30 and bicarbonate 15–18 mmol/L, moderate as pH 7.00– < 7.24 and bicarbonate 10– < 15 mmol/L, and severe as pH < 7.00 or bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L, and this stratification guides route and intensity of insulin therapy [^116mHPx6] [^117Lu9uo].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe DKA, I should confirm the standard of care. The first-line insulin is continuous intravenous infusion of short-acting human regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h, with consideration of a one-time 0.1 units/kg IV bolus only if there is a delay in starting the infusion, and the infusion should be continued until ketonemia resolves, not just until glucose normalizes [^117Lu9uo] [^113aX4rv]. Wait, let me verify the bolus point because I recall older protocols favored routine boluses; contemporary guidance de-emphasizes routine boluses and suggests a bolus only if the infusion cannot be started promptly, so I should not overstate bolus use here [^117Lu9uo] [^114DnzPQ].

> I need to ensure the insulin infusion is titrated appropriately as glucose falls. When plasma glucose drops below about 150–200 mg/dL, the infusion should be reduced to 0.05 units/kg/h and dextrose added to allow continued insulin until acidosis clears, maintaining glucose roughly 150–200 mg/dL until resolution, because glucose often normalizes before ketonemia resolves [^117Lu9uo] [^113aX4rv]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence; electrolytes and acid-base status should be checked frequently, with potassium measured about 2 hours after insulin starts and then every 4 hours until resolution to mitigate hypokalemia risk [^112qkDfR].

> For mild DKA, let me consider whether subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin can be used safely. The ADA allows subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs such as lispro or aspart as an alternative in selected, uncomplicated mild cases, typically 0.1 units/kg SC every 1 hour or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours, with dose reduction when glucose falls below 150 mg/dL and maintenance of glucose 150–200 mg/dL until resolution, provided there is close monitoring and no contraindications [^117Lu9uo] [^1163TwTf]. I should double-check the evidence base; randomized trials and meta-analyses suggest SC rapid-acting insulin achieves comparable times to resolution versus IV regular insulin in mild-to-moderate DKA, though most studies are small and exclude severe or complex cases, so patient selection is key [^115GLxpD] [^114BnDRC] [^116rXrvD].

> But wait, what if resources are constrained or ICU access is limited. In resource-limited or surge settings, ISPAD and related guidance support SC rapid-acting insulin protocols for mild-to-moderate pediatric and adult DKA when IV infusion is not feasible, with structured monitoring and safety checks, reinforcing that route can be adapted to context without sacrificing outcomes in appropriately selected patients [^113mVCnH] [^112ATS29].

> Next, I should review the role of basal insulin. Traditionally, long-acting basal insulin is initiated after DKA resolution and the patient can eat, with overlap of IV insulin for 1–2 hours to prevent rebound hyperglycemia, which remains standard bridging practice [^1164uV6V] [^1163TwTf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; emerging evidence suggests that early addition of subcutaneous basal insulin within the first few hours of IV therapy may shorten time to DKA resolution and reduce total IV insulin requirements without increasing hypoglycemia or hypokalemia, with RCTs of glargine and degludec showing approximately 2.9–3.3 hour faster resolution when started early, though this is not yet universally adopted in all guidelines [^1171A7j8] [^111aJa5y] [^115SDHC2] [^112fAa9r]. I should confirm dosing; typical early basal doses used in trials are around 0.3 units/kg SC, with dose adjustments for renal impairment, and results appear consistent across studies [^1143hAvE].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. For moderate-to-severe DKA, start with continuous IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h promptly after fluids, avoid routine bolus unless there is a setup delay, reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h and add dextrose when glucose falls below 150–200 mg/dL, and continue until ketonemia and acidosis resolve, with close electrolyte and acid-base monitoring [^117Lu9uo] [^113aX4rv] [^112qkDfR]. For mild DKA in carefully selected patients, subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs every 1–2 hours can be a safe alternative with appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments as glucose declines [^117Lu9uo] [^115GLxpD] [^114BnDRC]. In all cases, identify and treat precipitating causes, and transition to maintenance subcutaneous insulin with overlap to prevent recurrence [^1117ZCKL] [^1164uV6V].

> I should also address special situations. In euglycemic DKA, insulin is still required and dextrose should be infused from the outset to allow adequate insulin delivery for ketone clearance, with attention to slower acid-base correction relative to glucose normalization [^116vxCdp] [^112sJP4K]. In pediatrics, avoid insulin boluses due to cerebral edema risk and use 0.05–0.1 units/kg/h IV infusion after initial fluid resuscitation, with national pediatric guidance supporting early potassium in fluids and structured monitoring plans [^117V2pjs] [^113u3pne]. For SGLT2-associated DKA, maintain or increase dextrose to permit higher insulin dosing and suppress ketogenesis, as insulin needs may be higher despite lower glucose values [^1153MQAr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the transition plan is explicit. Before stopping the IV insulin, give subcutaneous basal insulin 1–2 hours prior and continue the infusion until the patient is metabolically stable and able to eat, to reduce rebound hyperglycemia and DKA recurrence, and provide structured education prior to discharge to mitigate future risk [^1164uV6V] [^1163TwTf] [^115U7is3].

---

The first insulin used for DKA is **regular insulin** [^1117ZCKL] administered as a **continuous intravenous infusion** at 0.1 units/kg/hour [^117Lu9uo], started after initial fluid resuscitation [^113iRuC9]. This low-dose IV insulin regimen is the standard of care because it reliably suppresses ketogenesis and corrects hyperglycemia with lower risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia than bolus dosing [^notfound]. An initial IV bolus is no longer recommended [^117Lu9uo] unless there is a delay in starting the infusion [^117Lu9uo]. If glucose falls below 150–200 mg/dL before DKA resolution, add dextrose and reduce the insulin rate to 0.05–0.1 units/kg/hour [^116CPzLg] to maintain glucose while continuing insulin until ketosis resolves [^113aX4rv].

---

## Rationale for insulin therapy in DKA

Insulin therapy is essential in DKA to **suppress ketogenesis**, reduce hepatic glucose production, and promote peripheral glucose uptake [^116VgP39]. Insulin deficiency drives hyperglycemia and ketosis; therefore, **exogenous insulin** is required to reverse these metabolic disturbances [^113iRuC9].

---

## Historical evolution of insulin therapy in DKA

Historically, insulin therapy for DKA evolved from high-dose intravenous boluses to the current **low-dose continuous infusion** approach. Early protocols used large bolus doses, which increased the risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [^114DnzPQ]. Current guidelines recommend **low-dose continuous infusion** because it achieves comparable or superior outcomes with fewer adverse events [^115LGzuF].

---

## Current standard of care: low-dose intravenous insulin infusion

The **current standard of care** for DKA management is a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin at a dose of 0.1 units/kg/hour [^117Lu9uo]. This regimen is initiated after initial fluid resuscitation and continued until ketosis resolves and metabolic acidosis corrects [^113iRuC9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low-dose insulin infusion

Multiple studies and guidelines support the use of **low-dose insulin infusion** as the initial insulin therapy in DKA:

- **Efficacy**: Low-dose insulin infusion effectively suppresses ketogenesis, reduces hepatic glucose production, and promotes peripheral glucose uptake, leading to rapid correction of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis [^117UPrdD].

- **Safety**: Low-dose insulin infusion significantly reduces the risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia compared to high-dose bolus regimens [^notfound].

- **Guideline support**: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other international guidelines recommend low-dose insulin infusion as the standard initial therapy for DKA [^117Lu9uo] [^112T3Cze].

---

## Role of insulin bolus administration

Previously, an initial **intravenous bolus** of insulin (typically 0.1 units/kg) was commonly administered before initiating continuous infusion [^116CPzLg]. However, recent evidence suggests that routine bolus administration is unnecessary and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [^111Xg7Co]. Current guidelines recommend **against routine bolus administration** unless there is a significant delay in initiating continuous infusion [^117Lu9uo].

---

## Alternative insulin therapies

While continuous intravenous insulin infusion remains the **standard of care**, alternative insulin therapies have been explored, particularly in resource-limited settings or mild cases of DKA:

- **Subcutaneous insulin**: Subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin analogs (e.g. lispro, aspart) has been studied as an alternative to intravenous insulin infusion, particularly in mild to moderate DKA [^115GLxpD]. However, evidence remains limited, and this approach is not universally recommended [^1163TwTf].

- **Early basal insulin**: Recent studies have investigated the early administration of subcutaneous basal insulin (e.g. glargine, degludec) alongside intravenous insulin infusion, suggesting potential benefits in reducing time to resolution and preventing rebound hyperglycemia [^1171A7j8] [^111JB2Pu]. However, this approach requires further validation before widespread adoption [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Low-dose insulin infusion is associated with favorable clinical outcomes, including **rapid correction of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis**, reduced risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, and shorter hospital length of stay [^114AUQnN]. However, close monitoring is essential to detect and manage potential complications, such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and rebound hyperglycemia [^1164uV6V].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended insulin therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard DKA | Continuous intravenous insulin infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hour | - Standard of care <br/> - Effective and safe [^1163TwTf] |
| Delay in initiating infusion | Initial intravenous bolus of 0.1 units/kg (optional) | Rapid insulin effect if infusion delayed [^117Lu9uo] |
| Mild to moderate DKA (alternative) | Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs | Alternative in resource-limited settings [^113mVCnH] |
| Early basal insulin (investigational) | Subcutaneous basal insulin alongside intravenous infusion | Potential benefits under investigation [^111JB2Pu] |

The first insulin used for DKA is **regular insulin** administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hour [^117Lu9uo]. This approach is supported by robust evidence and international guidelines, providing effective and safe management of DKA [^1163TwTf]. Routine insulin bolus administration is no longer recommended unless there is a delay in initiating continuous infusion [^117Lu9uo]. Alternative therapies, such as subcutaneous insulin administration, may be considered in specific clinical scenarios but require further validation [^116rXrvD].

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Utility of initial bolus insulin in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^114Jo9Cw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) recommend administration of an intravenous bolus dose of insulin followed by a continuous infusion. This study was designed to investigate whether the initial bolus dose is of significant benefit to adult patients with DKA and if it is associated with increased complications. This was a non-concurrent, prospective observational cohort study of adult patients who presented with DKA in a 12-month period. Charts were divided into two groups depending on whether they received an initial bolus dose of insulin. Data on glucose levels, anion gap (AG), intravenous fluid administration (IVF), and length of stay (LOS) were collected. Primary outcome was hypoglycemia (need for administration of 50% dextrose). Of 157 charts, 78 received a bolus of insulin and were designated the treatment group, the remaining 79 formed the control group. Groups were similar at baseline and received equivalent IVF and insulin drips. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of hypoglycemia (6% vs. 1%, respectively, p = 0.12), rate of change of glucose (60 vs. 56 mg/dL/h, respectively, p = 0.54) or AG (1.9 vs. 1.9 mEq/L/h, respectively, p = 0.66), LOS in the Emergency Department (8 vs. 7 h, respectively, p = 0.37) or hospital (5.6 vs. 5.9 days, p = 0.81). Equivalence testing revealed no clinically relevant differences in IVF change, rate of change of glucose, or AG. Administration of an initial bolus dose of insulin was not associated with significant benefit to patients with DKA and demonstrated equivalent changes in clinically relevant endpoints when compared to patients not administered the bolus.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium <br/> - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

### Putting SQuID on the menu: a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^1146gFoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beginning in 2021, we developed and implemented the SQuID (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) protocol for low to moderate severity (LTM) DKA, treating these patients on a single inpatient Hospitalist-run observation floor and demonstrating reductions in emergency department (ED) length of stay of over 3h compared with LTM DKA patients treated in the ED with intravenous (IV) insulin and subsequently admitted to the medical floor. We expanded bed eligibility to a second Hospitalist-only floor from March 2023 to March 2024. We demonstrated equivalent safety and effectiveness of SQuID in LTM DKA compared with treatment on IV insulin, reducing intensive care unit (ICU) utilization for LTM DKA by over 33%, and maintaining high clinician acceptability ratings. Here we discuss lessons learned, keyinsights and pitfalls for the implementation of this innovation.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours <br/> - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe DKA <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe DKA|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

### Is subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin as effective as intravenous insulin for treating diabetic ketoacidosis? [^116VssMi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To determine whether intermittent subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin is as effective as intravenous infusion of regular insulin for treating uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis, we performed a MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library search, using the key words "subcutaneous insulin AND intravenous insulin AND diabetic ketoacidosis; LIMIT humans and English". We also searched the references in these articles for additional studies. This search yielded a total of 35 articles, 4 of which directly addressed the question at hand. According to this review of the available evidence; subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin analogs such as lispro is as effective and safe as intravenous infusion of regular insulin for the management of uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis. In addition, use of insulin analogs may confer an overall cost savings, obviating the need for infusion pumps and ICU admissions in certain institutions. Therefore, it would be safe and effective to use subcutaneously administered rapid-acting insulin analogues instead of intravenous regular insulin infusions for patients with uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis.

Effect of various doses of insulin on recovery parameters

Table 3 demonstrates the outcome recovery data for DKA, depicting the time that predetermined values were reached for glucose, HCO₃⁻, and pH. The results suggested no significant differences in these values for the three doses of insulin, but 5 of 12 patients in the no load group required additional insulin for control of their blood glucose. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups, there were no complications in any of the groups, and no deaths occurred in this cohort. No hypokalemia was noted in any treatment group. The potassium nadirs were 4.3, 4.2, and 3.7 mEq/l in the load, no load, and twice no load groups, respectively (Fig. 2).

Table 4 shows estimates of the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, FFAs, bicarbonate, and cortisol during the first 8 h of therapy in the three insulin therapy groups. The response of serum bicarbonate and cortisol showed no differences among the treatment groups. However, the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, and FFAs varied among treatment groups.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^112afjcy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous insulin in people with euglycemic DKA. Only one study in this systematic review included patients with severe DKA. The majority of studies conducted so far on this topic have mainly focused on the use of subcutaneous insulin in managing mild to moderate DKA.

Limitations

Our study has some potential limitations. First, the present data is only applicable to patients with mild-to-moderate DKA without severe illness given that most of the studies excluded patients who were critically ill with multiple co-morbidities. Second, there were no documented cases of euglycemic DKA in the included studies. However, in one retrospective study, the authors included a protocol to treat euglycemic DKA. Thus, further studies are required to clarify the safety of using subcutaneous insulin for the management of DKA in this specific patient population. Third, the studies included individuals with DKA and did not perform sub-analyses for causes of DKA or underlying type of diabetes. It is unclear whether the efficacy and safety of using subcutaneous insulin compared to a continuous IV insulin varies among individuals with different precipitants of DKA and varying forms of diabetes. Fourth, even though Rao et al. had a relatively large sample size with noteworthy reductions in direct ICU and hospital readmissions by using subcutaneous insulin, the number of DKA cases in the subcutaneous insulin group is significantly smaller than that of the IV insulin treatment group (subcutaneous insulin group: 420 DKA cases versus IV insulin group: 7569 DKA cases). There remains a need for larger-scale studies to better understand the effectiveness and feasibility of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA. Finally, this systematic review only included a total of ten studies, most of which had a relatively small sample size and no documented close follow-up. Hence, larger RCTs with established protocols and regular follow-up are needed to confirm the clinical significance of using subcutaneous insulin compared to IV insulin and to explore optimal dosing and administration strategies for subcutaneous insulin in the management of DKA.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^116VgP39]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an endocrine emergency, involving hyperglycaemia, elevated ketones, and metabolic acidosis. Urgent management requires reversal of metabolic derangement, correction of electrolyte imbalance and volume depletion through the administration of intravenous fluids, electrolytes and short acting insulin, as well as investigation and correction of any underlying precipitants. There is variability across different hospitals and societies regarding the specifics of acute DKA management, including rates of insulin administration, fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement.

Insulin therapy suppresses ketogenesis and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, and as such is a vital part in the management of DKA. Continuous insulin infusion is widely accepted as the standard of care for moderate and severe DKA. International guidelines support the use of a fixed insulin rate of 0.1 units/kg/h during the initial stage of management, with a rate reduction step following normoglycaemia.

One of the main concerns regarding the insulin infusion rate is hypoglycaemia, which has been associated with increased length of stay in hospital and increased mortality in hospitalised patients. Recent data from a retrospective analysis by Mårtensson et al. conducted across intensive care units (ICU) in New Zealand and Australia, determined that intensive early correction of hyperglycaemia, when compared with partial early correction according to DKA‐specific guidelines, was independently associated with hypoglycaemia, hypo‐osmolarity and death.

Although fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) protocols are widely endorsed, they have been associated with higher rates of hypoglycaemia when compared to variable‐rate protocols. In the United Kingdom National Survey in 2013, 27.6% of people experienced hypoglycaemia < 4.0 mmol/L on the FRIII protocol of 0.1 units/kg/h. A retrospective cohort study by Bohach et al. found 50% of participants on a fixed‐rate protocol to have severe hypoglycaemia to < 2.8 mmol/L compared to 7% in the variable‐rate group. The high rates of hypoglycaemia in fixed‐rate protocols have been shown to be reduced with a rate reduction step after normoglycaemia is achieved. Analysis of variable‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) protocols revealed lower hypoglycaemia rates between 6% and 8%.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115ma6vd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

DKA Treatment, Process Measures, and Outcomes

We identified all insulin treatments administered during hospitalization using the EHR medication administration record and focused on the first dose administered, as well as the total and weight-adjusted insulin dosage units of any type within the first 12, 24, and 48 hours of hospitalization. We identified insulin administration routes as either IV or SQ. We identified IV fluids administered to patients, including 5% dextrose, 10% dextrose, normal saline, or lactated ringer solution. We quantified the time from hospital arrival to the first glucose value less than 250 mg/dL and to anion gap closure (based on a value < 16 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0], the upper limit of normal in the KPNC laboratory), which are measures frequently used to determine the response to the treatment of DKA. Finally, we assessed the incidence of hypoglycemia, defined as any serum glucose value less than 70 mg/dL, over the entire hospitalization. We also evaluated the frequency of ICU admission either directly from the ICU or later during the DKA hospitalization. Our outcomes of interest included mortality within 30 days of hospital admission, hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge, and overall hospital length of stay.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours <br/> - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL <br/> - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116GQpYB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not identify important differences in overall mortality and adverse outcomes following treatment of mild-to-moderate DKA with subcutaneous insulin compared to a continuous IV insulin infusion. Studies conducted to date have demonstrated that subcutaneous insulin is associated with a decreased length of hospital stay and hospitalizations costs when compared to a continuous IV insulin infusion. However, the sample sizes of the retrieved studies were relatively small with no follow-up data available to assess outcomes after discharge. Further studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness and safety of using subcutaneous insulin in the treatment of DKA in specific populations, including DKA during pregnancy, euglycemic DKA, severe DKA, DKA from various precipitants and among individuals with different forms of diabetes.

### International consensus on risk management of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors [^116NrJ3V]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115QkyvZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The primary strength of this study was that we were able to examine relative changes resulting from protocol implementation at the intervention site against a large and diverse set of comparator sites. This approach allowed us to address challenges commonly seen with before-and-after studies, which fail to account for ongoing secular changes in practice. In this study, we found that practice at the standard care sites remained largely unchanged in the postimplementation period, suggesting that our findings were the result of changes in practice unique to the intervention site. We were also able to evaluate posthospital outcomes, because patients with DKA are frequently rehospitalized over time, and we found a reduction in readmission rates at the intervention site. Our integrated health care delivery system and comprehensive single EHR system facilitated the identification and tracking of patients after DKA; thus, the protocol's default consultation for endocrinology follow-up and population management among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes may have played a role in reducing readmissions.

There are several limitations that should be noted. First, our study included patients with DKA based on principal diagnosis codes and, thus, represented a subset of all patients who might have received treatment for DKA. Also, although we used clinical EHR data to establish DKA and its severity, it is possible that patients may have been misclassified. Second, our study was conducted within a single regional integrated health care delivery system that incorporates numerous regional care protocols, which may differ from those in place in other hospital and health systems. Thus, additional study will be needed to assess the generalizability of this protocol, particularly in locales where SQ insulin use in DKA is more common. Third, although we did identify an association with the intervention, this was a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented protocol arising from a quality improvement effort; thus, the results should be confirmed with prospective studies. Fourth, the endocrine outpatient follow-up used in the protocol was directed toward patients with type 1 diabetes, and care for patients with type 2 diabetes could still be improved after DKA with careful care coordination. Fifth, we did not examine all adjunctive treatments given to patients with DKA (eg, fluid type and volume, and bicarbonate or potassium treatment), which could impact outcomes. Sixth, a minority of patients at standard care sites before implementation underwent initial SQ insulin treatment, which likely reflects ongoing variability in DKA treatment patterns. Seventh, although we did adjust for patient-level factors, we did not examine variability in practice and outcomes at the comparator sites that might contribute to residual confounding.

### How can cerebral edema during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis be avoided? [^117Q57Pn]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare complication but it can be devastating, with significant mortality and long-term morbidity. Certain risk factors have been teased out with some large case-control studies, but more research needs to be done to make management guidelines safer. This article will discuss how DKA might be prevented from occurring in the first instance, known risk factors for cerebral edema, fluid and insulin management, the importance of careful monitoring during DKA treatment, and the importance of recognizing and acting on the earliest symptoms to prevent long-term harm.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116CPzLg]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total of 74 patients with DKA were randomly assigned in this study. Of them, six patients were excluded because four withdrew consent before or shortly after initiation of insulin therapy, one patient received glargine insulin before resolution of DKA, and one patient was treated with intravenous aspart insulin instead of regular insulin. The remaining 68 patients served as the study population. The diagnosis of DKA was established by standard criteria. We excluded patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after the administration of 1 l of normal saline, patients in a comatose state, and patients with acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, dementia, and pregnancy. This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, and at Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was approved by dual institutional review boards.

Patients with DKA were randomly assigned in the emergency department to receive treatment with regular (n = 34) or glulisine (n = 34) insulin intravenously until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to receive subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily. Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to glargine once daily and glulisine before meals.

Treatment protocols

Patients were managed by members of the internal medicine residency programs of the respective institutions, who received copies of the assigned treatment protocol (supplementary Table A in an online appendix, available at). Orders for intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were similar in both groups and followed current American Diabetes Association guidelines. Initial orders for intravenous regular and glulisine insulin included an initial bolus of 0.1 unit/kg, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion calculated to deliver 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 until blood glucose levels decreased to < 250 mg/dl (< 13.8 mmol/l). At that time, intravenous fluids were changed to dextrose-containing solutions, and the insulin infusion rate was decreased to 0.05 unit · kg −1 · h −1 to maintain blood glucose of ∼200 mg/dl (∼11.1 mmol/l) until resolution of DKA. DKA was considered resolved when blood glucose was < 250 mg/dl, the serum bicarbonate level was ≥ 18 mmol/l, and venous pH was > 7.30.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^114u2tnt]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis management and short-term insulin use — Of adolescents in whom T2DM is subsequently diagnosed, 5% to 25% present with ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis must be treated with insulin and fluid and electrolyte replacement, and patients in whom ketoacidosis is diagnosed require immediate treatment with insulin and fluid replacement in an inpatient setting under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in treating this complication. Youth and adolescents with T2DM and poor glycemic control (BG concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dl or HbA1c > 9%) but lacking evidence of ketosis or ketoacidosis may also benefit from initial treatment with insulin, at least on a short-term basis, and many patients with T2DM can be weaned gradually from insulin therapy and subsequently managed with metformin and lifestyle modification. When diabetes type is uncertain, these patients are best managed initially with insulin therapy while appropriate tests are performed to differentiate between T1DM and T2DM, and the care of such patients should be supervised by a physician experienced in treating diabetic patients with insulin.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^1122g9Te]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This RCT evaluated the effectiveness and safety of early SC administration of ultralong‐acting basal insulin, insulin degludec, in addition to standard DKA treatment with IVII. The results demonstrated that early degludec administration in combination therapy with IVII was associated with faster DKA resolution compared with the control group. Exploratory analyses of patients with classic T1DM and severe DKA showed a trend toward shorter time to resolution, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, patients in the early degludec group had significantly lower CBG at 72 h after DKA resolution compared to the control group. The early combination of degludec within the first 3 h after DKA diagnosis was safe, as evidenced by similar rates of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia compared with the control group. LOS and in‐hospital mortality were not different between the groups.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

Conclusions A significant proportion of DKA occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes. The time-tested therapy for DKA of intravenous insulin with concomitant glucose as the plasma level decreases, sufficient fluid and electrolyte replacement, and attention to associated problems remains the standard of care, irrespective of the type of diabetes. The insulin-glucose infusion algorithm shown in Figure 1 was used in most admissions. Overall, patients had cleared their urine ketones at an average of 31. 7 ±
11. 1 hours after presenting to the emergency department and 21. 5 ±
10. 5 hours after being initiated on an insulin infusion protocol. The patients with a known history of type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes achieved a negative urine ketone status at similar times following initiation of the intravenous insulin infusion protocol. Patients newly diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes required 31. 7 ±
13. 3 hours to achieve negative urine ketones after initiating the intravenous insulin protocol. With regard to complications associated with treatment of DKA, 4 patients had a blood glucose level of less than 70 mg/dL at some point during the insulin infusion. Three of these episodes occurred after the patient received a subcutaneous injection of insulin in anticipation of discontinuing the intravenous insulin infusion but failed to tolerate the associated meal, attesting to the adequacy of the insulin-glucose infusion. Patients who used insulin before the admission for DKA were taking significantly less insulin preceding the admission compared with their discharge dose. Our results also show that the insulin-glucose infusion algorithm outlined in Figure 1 can be used safely in the management of patients who present with DKA irrespective of the type of diabetes.

Complications that have been reported with management of DKA were infrequent in our population in part because of the age of our patients but also because of the inclusion of a variable glucose infusion algorithm in the treatment protocol. Through our continuation of the insulin-glucose infusion protocol until the urine was ketone free, we have shown successful use of ketonuria as a marker of resolution of DKA in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Finally, given our results of the successful, almost uneventful management of DKA, we hav.

### Efficacy and safety of commonly used insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a Bayesian indirect treatment comparison [^111D8xun]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Insulin analogues (IAs) are the mainstay for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, the relative efficacy of newer IAs is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IAs for the management of DKA using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC).

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-, rapid-, and long-acting IAs in patients with DKA. The primary outcomes of interest were time taken to normalize DKA and time taken to normalize blood glucose levels. The secondary outcomes of interest were the amount of insulin needed to normalize DKA, the length of hospital stay, and the number of hypoglycemic events in the intervention and comparator groups. Bayesian ITC was performed by using the gemtc package in the R program. Continuous outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD), and binary outcomes are reported as odds ratios (ORs), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Findings

Ten RCTs randomizing 435 participants to treatment were included in this ITC. A total of 5 interventions (lispro, glargine with regular insulin [RI], glulisine, aspart, and regular insulin) were compared for both safety and efficacy outcomes in DKA. Glargine co-administered with regular insulin showed superiority for clinical outcomes compared with regular insulin: consuming less time (MD, -3.1 h; 95% CrI, -7.9 to 1.8), amount of insulin required (MD, -32 U; 95% CrI, 83.0 to 18.0), and the length of hospitalization (MD, -0.82 day; 95% CrI, -2.7 to 1.0) to normalize DKA. However, these results were not statistically significant. Insulin aspart had fewer reports of hypoglycemic events (OR, 1.7; 95% CrI, 0.34 to 9.3) than regular insulin.

Implications

Newer IAs were found to be equally effective and safe as regular insulin in the treatment of DKA. Thus, administering these IAs can be considered a safe and cost-effective alternative for DKA management in non-ICU settings. Cost-effective analysis of the newer IAs is needed because these agents are expensive compared with regular insulin.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^1132uyns]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we examined the outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin treatment protocol for DKA at a single intervention site compared with 20 standard care sites over a 9-year period. After implementation, the use of SQ insulin as the first treatment in DKA increased from 13.4% to 80.3% at the intervention site while it remained unchanged at standard care sites. This change in practice had no impact on the mean total insulin dosage received by patients with DKA within their first 48 hours of treatment. Overall, the protocol was associated with a 57% relative decrease in ICU admissions at intervention sites and a 50% relative decrease in 30-day readmissions compared with standard care sites. The use of an SQ insulin-driven protocol appeared to be safe, with no associated increases in the incidence of hypoglycemic events during hospitalization or 30-day mortality.

DKA is the most common acute hyperglycemic emergency among people with diabetes and is associated with significant morbidity and health care cost. Hospitalizations for DKA are also resource-intensive in the US, requiring ICU admission and reportedly costing as much as $26 566 per admission. In the United Kingdom, where ICU utilization for DKA may be lower, the cost of DKA hospitalizations has been reported to be lower. The ICU is a scarce resource that can become critically strained during seasonal influenza surge or as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, many US critical care specialists have routinely identified DKA as a diagnosis well-suited for treatment in non-ICU settings if the right patients can be identified and appropriate treatment and monitoring can be put in place. Despite guidelines recommending non-ICU treatment of DKA, evidence from the general population in the US confirms that many patients are treated in ICU settings.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^1143hAvE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedures

After exclusions (Figure 1), 80 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer‐generated sequence with variable block sizes of 2–8. Allocation was concealed using sealed, opaque envelopes, and participants were assigned to either the early degludec or control group. The early degludec group received SC degludec at a dose of 0.3 units/kg within 3 h of DKA diagnosis, with a dose reduction to 0.15 units/kg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft–Gault equation), in addition to the standard IVII protocol. The selected dose was based on prior prospective studies of glargine U‐100, which reported doses ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 units/kg, as well as the 2022 UK guideline, which recommends a basal insulin dose of approximately 0.25 units/kg. Together, these findings provide both pharmacologic and clinical rationale for selecting 0.3 units/kg of degludec. The control group was administered only the standard IVII for DKA and did not receive placebo injections. Orders for intravenous insulin bolus, fixed‐dose IVII regimen, intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were consistent in both groups and followed the 2009 ADA recommendations, with the full protocol detailed in Appendix S1. A fixed IVII regimen of 0.1 units/kg/h was used until the capillary blood glucose (CBG) dropped below 200 mg/dL. Once CBG fell below 200 mg/dL, the insulin infusion rate was adjusted to 0.02–0.05 units/kg/h according to the patient's CBG level, aiming to maintain CBG between 150 and 200 mg/dL until DKA resolution. CBG was measured hourly, and serum electrolyte levels were monitored every 4 h in both groups. DKA resolution was defined as CBG of less than 200 mg/dL, in combination with a normalised serum anion gap (≤ 12 mEq/L), a venous pH above 7.30, or a serum bicarbonate greater than 15.0 mEq/L. After resolution, patients were transitioned to a SC insulin regimen as soon as they could tolerate oral or enteral intake, using a newly calculated weight‐based total daily dose of approximately 0.6 units/kg/day in both groups. SC insulin aspart was injected 5 to 15 min before meals in both groups as prandial insulin. For basal insulin, the control group received insulin glargine U‐100 SC with the first dose of insulin aspart, while the intervention group received a second dose of insulin degludec approximately 24 h after the first dose. IVII was discontinued 1 h after transitioning to full SC insulin. Following DKA resolution, while patients remained hospitalised, the internal medicine and endocrinology teams primarily adjusted multiple daily injections of basal‐bolus SC insulin as part of standard inpatient care, and CBG was routinely monitored four times daily (before meals and at bedtime). In the event of hypoglycaemia, patients received 15 g of oral glucose or 25 g of intravenous glucose, depending on their level of consciousness and ability to tolerate oral intake. CBG was rechecked 15 min later, and treatment was repeated as necessary until levels exceeded 70 mg/dL. A meal or snack was subsequently provided to prevent recurrence. Insulin doses were individually adjusted based on CBG trends and the patient's clinical status. Continuous glucose monitoring was not included in the study protocol.

### Early subcutaneous basal insulin with intravenous insulin infusion for diabetic ketoacidosis management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111aJa5y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early initiation of subcutaneous (SC) basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII), compared with IVII alone, for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early initiation of long- or ultra-long-acting basal insulin plus IVII versus IVII alone in DKA management. Studies published up to 6 September 2025, were included. Meta-analysis was performed using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, both with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included total intravenous insulin use, rebound hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. A one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was also conducted when individual-level data were available.

Results

Eight RCTs including 468 participants (256 receiving early SC basal insulin plus IVII; 212 receiving IVII alone) were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable across studies. Early SC basal insulin significantly reduced time to DKA resolution (MD -4.02h, 95%CI -5.52 to -2.52, p < 0.001) and total intravenous insulin dose until DKA resolution (MD -19.2units, 95%CI -28.99 to -9.26, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups for rebound hyperglycemia, safety outcomes, LOS, or in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Early SC basal insulin in combination with IVII significantly accelerates DKA resolution and reduces total IVII requirements, without increasing the risk of adverse events, including hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116rXrvD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the current literature to determine the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin compared to an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion in managing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

We searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception to April 26, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed the use of subcutaneous compared to intravenous insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers and disagreements were resolved through further discussion or by a third reviewer. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 was used to evaluate the RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS)-I tool was used to evaluate the observational studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting our findings.

Results

Six RCTs (245 participants) and four observational studies (8444 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Some studies showed a decreased length of stay (Mean Difference [MD] in days: -0.39; 95% CI: -2.83 to 2.08; I²: 0%) among individuals treated with subcutaneous insulin compared to intravenous insulin. There was no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality, time to resolution of DKA (MD in hours: 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.45 to 3.79; I²: 0%) and hypoglycemia (Risk Ratio [RR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.19; I²: 0%) between the two groups.

Conclusion

Treatment of DKA with subcutaneous insulin may be a safe and effective alternative to IV insulin in selected patients. The limited available evidence underscores the need for further studies to explore optimal dosing, patient selection criteria and long-term outcomes.

### Comparison of computer-guided versus standard insulin infusion regimens in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116A4oYx]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of Glucommander (GM) (Glytec®), a computer-based algorithm versus standard (paper form-based) continuous insulin infusion (CII) in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This was a retrospective multicenter study involving 2665 patients with DKA treated with either GM (n = 1750) or standard protocols (n = 915) across 34 institutions in the United States. GM estimates the rate of CII using an insulin sensitivity factor referred to as a "multiplier" that ranges between 0.01 and 0.03. Outcomes of interest were differences in time to resolve DKA (blood glucose [BG] < 200 mg/dL and bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L) and number of hypoglycemic events defined as a BG < 70 mg/dl.

Results

Treatment with GM was associated with lower rates of hypoglycemia during the time of the insulin drip (12.9% vs 35%, P = 0.001), faster time to normalization of blood glucose (9.7 ± 8.9 vs 10.97 ± 10.2 hours, P = 0.0001) and resolution of metabolic acidosis (13.6 ± 11.8 vs 17.3 ± 19.6 hours, P = 0.0001), and shorter hospital length of stay (3.2 ± 2.9 vs 4.5 ± 4.8 days, P = 0.01) compared to standard care. Best treatment outcomes were achieved with an initial multiplier of 0.01 and a glucose target range between 120 and 180 mg/dl.

Conclusion

The GM algorithm in DKA treatment resulted in lower rates of hypoglycemia and faster DKA resolution over standard paper-based algorithms. Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy and cost of computer-based algorithms versus standard CII regimens are warranted.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^115ubJrG]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Demographic and initial clinical data

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of patients in the three treatment groups, with the following findings: 1) none of the patients were obese, 2) the majority of the patients were African Americans and were receiving insulin therapy, 3) omission of insulin (47%) and infection (33%) were the major precipitating factors for DKA, and 4) within the load group there were twice as many men as women, within the no load group there were three times as many women as men, and within the twice no load group men and women were equally distributed. However, in all of these groups, the majority of subjects were African American.

### Efficacy and safety of dual SGLT 1 / 2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114XDibV]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis was the most common relevant adverse event, observed in 61 (3.1%) of 1912 sotagliflozin treated patients and inducing treatment discontinuation in 38% (supplementary table 5). While SGLT2 inhibitor associated diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported to occur often at uncharacteristically normal or mildly elevated levels (< 250 mg/dL) of blood glucose (euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis), over two thirds of occurrences of sotagliflozin related diabetic ketoacidosis happened at high blood glucose levels (supplementary table 5). Notably, our data indicate that a lower initial HbA1c and a greater reduction in basal insulin dose during sotagliflozin treatment could increase the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (supplementary figure 8; supplementary table 3), possibly because patients with less deteriorated baseline glycaemic control experienced a more rapid down-titration of insulin dose with sotagliflozin. The extent of basal insulin down-titration seems central for diabetic ketoacidosis development by allowing unrestricted fasting induced lipolysis and ketogenesis on a background of negative glucose balance. Consistently, insulin dose reduction of more than 20% has been found to increase ketone levels and diminish the glucose lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^113V2hAx]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion versus two continuous infusions without a priming dose.

Research Design and Methods

This prospective randomized protocol used three insulin therapy methods: 1) load group using a priming dose of 0.07 units of regular insulin per kg body weight followed by a dose of 0.07 unit × kg⁻¹ × h⁻¹ i.v. in 12 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); 2) no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.07 unit. kg body weight⁻¹ × h⁻¹ without a loading dose in 12 patients with DKA, and 3) twice no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.14 × kg⁻¹ × h⁻¹ without a loading dose in 13 patients with DKA. Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA.

Results

The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 microU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 microU/ml in 60 min. The twice no load group reached a peak (200 microU/ml) at 45 min. The no load group reached a peak (60 microU/ml) in 60–120 min. Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10%; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not. Except for these differences, times to reach glucose ≤ 250 mg/dl, pH ≥ 7.3, and HCO₃⁻ ≥ 15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.

Conclusions

A priming dose in low-dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit × kg body weight⁻¹ × h⁻¹ (about 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is given.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^113mVCnH]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1164uV6V]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to inpatient monitoring, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable. Initiate subcutaneous multi-dose insulin plan after resolution of DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and when patient is able to eat and drink. Continue intravenous insulin infusion for 1–2 hours after subcutaneous insulin when transferring from intravenous to maintenance subcutaneous insulin.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: the paradox of delayed correction of acidosis [^112sJP4K]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness of standard treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in "euglycemic DKA" (EuDKA, blood glucose (BG) ≤ 250 mg/dL) was evaluated with respect to the time to correction of BG ≤ 200 mg/dL, anion gap (AG) ≤ 12 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate [HCO3] ≥ 18 mmol/L.

Methods

Data were retrieved from an electronic health record (EPIC) for "diabetic ketoacidosis". Patients were categorized by initial BG as EuDKA, middle range DKA (MrDKA, > 250 < 600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolar DKA (HyperDKA ≥ 600 mg/dL).

Results

There were 56 patients (27men, 29women; age 45.8 ± 15.6 (SD) years. The initial 8-h insulin infusion rate (0.05 ± 0.02, 0.09 ± 0.03, 0.14 ± 0.05units/kg/h, p < 0.001) and the time to correction of BG (3.4 ± 1.9, 6.1 ± 2.9 and 9.6 ± 3.9 h, p < 0.001), differed for EuDKA, MrDKA and HyperDKA. There were no differences in the time to correction of AG or [HCO3]. The earlier time to correction of BG in EuDKA resulted in paradoxical longer lag times for correction of [HCO3] (p = 0.003) and AG (p = 0.048). Changes in BG, AG and [HCO3] correlated with insulin infusion rates of 0.08–0.1units/kg/h whereas in EuDKA the insulin infusion rate was 0.05 ± 0.02 units/kg/h.

Conclusion

In EuDKA, correlation analyses suggest that higher glucose and insulin infusion rates than what would be projected for the level of blood glucose are required to reverse ketoacidosis. Prospective trials are required to optimize the levels of glucose and insulin infusions in EuDKA.

### Does management of diabetic ketoacidosis with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin reduce the need for intensive care unit admission? [^114X6xHz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the last 20 years, rapid-acting insulin analogs have emerged on the market, including aspart and lispro, which may be efficacious in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when administered by non-intravenous (i.v.) routes.

Clinical Question

In patients with mild-to-moderate DKA without another reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, is the administration of a subcutaneous (s.c.) rapid-acting insulin analog a safe and effective alternative to a continuous infusion of i.v. regular insulin, and would such a strategy eliminate the need for ICU admission?

Evidence Review

Five randomized controlled trials were identified and critically appraised.

Results

The outcomes suggest that there is no difference in the duration of therapy required to resolve DKA with either strategy.

Conclusion

Current evidence supports DKA management with s.c. rapid-acting insulin analogs in a non-ICU setting in carefully selected patients.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^112T3Cze]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

### Review of subcutaneous insulin regimens in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults and pediatrics [^117BGft5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Summarize the studies evaluating the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults and pediatrics.

Data Sources

A PubMed literature search was conducted for articles published between 2000 and the end of May 2024 which contained the following terms in their title: (1) subcutaneous, glargine, or basal and (2) ketoa*.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, guidelines, meta-analysis, commentaries, studies not related to the acute management of DKA, studies evaluating continuous SQ insulin, animal studies, if the time to DKA resolution was not clearly defined, and studies where basal insulin was administered greater than 6 hours after the insulin infusion was started were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The electronic search identified 58 articles. Following the initial screening 38 articles were excluded and 3 were added after bibliography review. Of the 23 articles assessed for eligibility, 7 were excluded. Sixteen articles were included. Five studies compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and intravenous (IV) insulin infusions in adults, 4 compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and IV insulin infusions in pediatrics, 4 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in adults, and 3 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in pediatrics.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

In comparison with IV insulin infusions, rapid/short-acting SQ insulin regimens were associated with reduced ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. IV insulin infusion regimens that included a single SQ basal insulin dose upon therapy initiation were associated with reduced concurrent IV insulin infusion durations.

Conclusion

Studies reviewed suggest that SQ insulin regimens may be as effective and safe as IV insulin infusions in the management of DKA and are associated with the conservation of resources. Providers may refer to this review when establishing or modifying their DKA management protocols.

### Is diabetic ketoacidosis a good predictor of 5-year metabolic control in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes? [^112PAs68]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study population included people treated in the Department of Pediatric Diabetology and Pediatrics, Pediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital of the Medical University of Warsaw due to newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes complicated by DKA between 2010 and 2014. The inclusion criteria were: newly recognized diabetes type 1 with DKA at the onset of the disease and a complete follow-up for 5 consecutive years. No restrictions on participation were imposed as regards the type of insulin therapy. Participants treated both with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily injections (MDI) were recruited. Treatment with insulin pumps providing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has been available to children with diabetes mellitus in Poland since 2008. The service is covered by the National Health Fund (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia, NFZ) from the catalogue of public-funded services under separately commissioned healthcare services. The patients had the access to two types of insulin pump brands: Medtronic (MiniMed) and Roche - Accu Check. A tender for insulin pumps is conducted annually by the hospital and the access to the devices depends on its results. Most participants had CSII implemented at diabetes diagnosis. Personal continuous glucose monitoring devices have been widely available in Poland since 2018 (70% of the price of the devices was paid by the national health insurance system covered by public funds). Closed loop pumps were not available for any study participants.

We excluded participants diagnosed and initially treated in another Pediatric Department who were finally transferred to our Department and those with an incomplete follow-up. Subsequently, individual 1:1 matching was performed: every participant with DKA was matched with a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes person without DKA. The participants were matched for age, gender and Body Mass Index (BMI) to minimize the influence of residual confounding. Moreover, no differences were revealed in health insurance status. Polish citizens have equal and unpaid access to healthcare services provided by the national health insurance system covered by public funds and managed by NFZ. DKA was defined as pH below 7.3 with concomitant hyperglycemia exceeding 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) and ketonemia or ketonuria. The autoimmune origin of diabetes was confirmed with typical autoantibody testing and C-peptide level measurement. The onset was defined as the first 2 weeks after T1D manifestation. The obligatory part of the first hospitalization was a 2-week intensive educational course with a diabetic educator.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^111DV83z]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes in adolescents — initial pharmacologic therapy and insulin indications: Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacologic agent in adolescents presenting with mild hyperglycemia and without ketonuria or severe hyperglycemia. If the diagnosis is unclear (for example, an obese youth with ketosis), the adolescent must be treated with insulin until the T2DM diagnosis is confirmed, and the presence of either ketosis or ketoacidosis dictates an absolute initial requirement for insulin replacement. Children with more modest hyperglycemia (random blood glucose [BG] of 200–249 mg/dL) or asymptomatic T2DM present additional therapeutic choices, and in such cases, metformin alone, insulin alone, or metformin with insulin all represent reasonable options. Although metformin and insulin are the only antidiabetic agents currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, both thiazolidinediones and incretins are occasionally used in adolescents younger than 18 years.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^115GLRMT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111XAae5]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pharmacotherapy), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer SC or IV insulin in patients with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement. Initiate metformin once acidosis is resolved while SC insulin therapy is continued.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116yT14n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3units/kg SC within 3h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25h (7.75h, IQR 6.00–9.00h vs. 11.00h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in-hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^111rizkt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a subcutaneous insulin protocol implemented at a hospital level associated with use of intensive care and other outcomes among adults with diabetic ketoacidosis?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 7989 hospitalizations over a 9-year period, implementation of a subcutaneous insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis at a single intervention site, compared with 20 standard care sites, was not associated with increased hypoglycemia but was associated with a relative reduction of direct intensive care unit admission of 57% and a 50% reduction in hospital readmission, with no change in hospital length of stay.

Meaning

These findings suggest that a subcutaneous insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with reduced hospital resource utilization but was not associated with increased hypoglycemia.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114BnDRC]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is commonly treated with intravenous (IV) regular insulin. However, patients with less severe DKA may benefit from a subcutaneous (SC) scheme.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SC rapid-acting insulin analogue (RAIAs) with IV regular insulin. Risk ratios (RR) were used to compare treatment effects for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We used the R version 4.3.2 for statistical analyses.

Results

Our meta-analysis included eight RCTs encompassing 415 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between RAIAs and IV regular insulin in the treatment of mild to moderate DKA in the pediatric and adult population in the primary outcome of time until DKA resolution (MD 0.00 h; 95% CI -1.27 to 1.28; P = 1.00). Both treatments showed comparable results in the secondary outcomes total insulin usage (P = 0.65), time until hyperglycemia resolution (P = 0.22), length of hospital stay (P = 0.11), the incidence of hypoglycemia (P = 0.15) and DKA recurrence (P = Not estimable). There were no reports of death, cerebral edema, or venous thrombosis in the studies.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis of eight RCTs we found that SC RAIAs and regular IV insulin are comparable in resolving mild to moderate DKA in children and adults. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023485032.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^115LGzuF]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to decrease insulin infusion rate to 0.05 unit/kg/hr when blood glucose values reach 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia.

---

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^114DnzPQ]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although numerous studies have effectively used low-dose insulin in the treatment of DKA, there are no data from a prospective randomized study evaluating an insulin bolus (0.07 U/kg) compared with no bolus in conjunction with an infusion of low-dose insulin (0.07 vs. 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1). Previous studies have demonstrated that although 0.1 unit/h of insulin in patients with DKA can effectively inhibit lipolysis, this dose will only suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by 50%.

We had previously shown that an intermediate dose of insulin of 0.1 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 (equivalent of 7 units/h of insulin in a 70-kg patient) by intravenous infusion was much more effective than a dose by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route. In these studies we used a priming dose. In addition, in a selected case report we have used as little as 6 units/h for a patient with modest DKA with further maintenance of euglycemia by 1–2 units/h. However, a bolus dose of insulin preceded the low-dose infusion. Furthermore, a priming dose has not been used for pediatric patients with DKA and has not been recommended in the pediatric age-group in the latest ADA consensus report. Deleterious outcomes with the use of bolus insulin in this group may include hypokalemia as well as possible cerebral edema.

In summary, our study suggests that the use of a bolus or priming dose of insulin is not necessary when an adequate continuous insulin infusion such as 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 (or 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is used. However, a dose of 0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without priming is not adequate to obtain desired changes in glucose without supplemental doses of insulin.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^115Xw1jv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes. DKA most commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes; however it can also present among people with type 2 diabetes with concomitant insulin deficiency and among people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes, DKA is a common presentation in the emergency room and an indication for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Ramphul et al. recently showed that the incidence of hospitalizations due to DKA in the United States increased from 2003 to 2017, with the incidence per 10,000 admissions rising from 32.04 in 2003 to 61.60 in 2017 according to the 2017 National Inpatient Sample.

The diagnostic criteria for DKA includes the triad of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, increased total serum ketone concentration and metabolic acidosis. DKA commonly presents with a precipitating cause, such as an acute illness or increased physiological stress. DKA management includes treating the precipitating cause, correcting dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids, managing electrolyte abnormalities, and administering insulin to correct the ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. The standard of care for managing DKA is through the administration of a continuous IV insulin infusion. DKA is usually treated in a monitored setting, such as the resuscitation area in the emergency department or the ICU. As per Diabetes Canada, IV insulin is the standard of care for DKA management. On the other hand, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends IV insulin administration for moderate-to-severe DKA and suggests the possibility of using subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin for mild and uncomplicated DKA.

There are few observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of using a subcutaneous insulin protocol in managing DKA outside of a monitored setting. To our knowledge, the last systematic review conducted on this topic was done by Andrade-Castellanos et al. in 2016. The studies presented in this previous review demonstrated that insulin therapy is effective in managing DKA regardless of the route of administration in selected patients. However, it only included RCTs, excluding observational studies. Given that additional studies have been conducted on this topic since 2016, we performed an updated systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA compared to IV insulin. The main purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin among adult patients with mild to moderate DKA.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116mHPx6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^11265aVb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first prospective randomized trial to compare the use of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with DKA. During the initial treatment phase, we observed no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of intravenous insulin administration until resolution of DKA between regular and glulisine insulin. After resolution of ketoacidosis, the transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine insulin resulted in glycemic control similar to that for NPH and regular insulin; however, treatment with glargine and glulisine insulin is safer and is associated with a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemia. A total of 14 patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had one or more episodes of hypoglycemia (P < 0.03).

The comparable response to intravenous glulisine and regular insulin during the acute resolution of DKA in this study is in line with previous reports of generally equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs (glulisine, aspart, and lispro) and regular insulin in animal and human studies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic studies comparing the intravenous administration of glulisine and regular insulin have shown a similar onset of action within 20 min, a similar distribution and elimination profile, and equivalent glucose utilization and disposal on a molar, unit-per-unit basis. The present study confirms these observations and provides evidence of the equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs and regular insulin in patients with severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Their comparable in vivo potency is attributable to their similar receptor binding affinity and receptor-mediated clearance. Our study and these previous reports indicate that treatments with intravenous glulisine and regular insulin are equally safe and efficacious in the acute management of patients with DKA. However, intravenous regular insulin is more cost-effective and should be preferred over rapid-acting insulin analogs during the acute intravenous treatment phase of DKA.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112svsDJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^113u3pne]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111Xg7Co]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although positive therapeutic responses to low-dose insulin therapy have been established in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), none of these studies and guidelines for the treatment of DKA, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus and Position Statements, has ever assessed or addressed the use of a continuous insulin infusion without a loading dose of insulin. In the current study, we used a dose of 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose instead of the recommended 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 with a loading dose. This insulin regimen was chosen because one study in a pediatric population used a dosing regimen of 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose that resulted in a total plasma insulin level of 50–60 μU/ml. This level proved to be too low for optimal suppression of hepatic glucose output and optimal glucose uptake. In addition, bolus doses of insulin may result in hypokalemia as well as other undesirable effects, especially when used in a routine hospital setting.

The efficacy of low-dose insulin without a priming dose has not been established in a prospective randomized study. Thus, the following questions have remained unanswered in the treatment of DKA: 1) Is an insulin bolus needed before a continuous insulin infusion? 2) What is the optimal insulin infusion rate if a bolus dose is not used? and 3) What is the dose response of continuous insulin infusion used alone in regard to decremental changes in glucose, metabolic parameters, cortisol, and free fatty acids (FFAs)? Therefore, we evaluated responses to three low-dose insulin regimens in 37 consecutive patients with DKA in a prospective randomized fashion to address these issues. Changes in plasma free insulin, serum potassium levels, and outcome recovery measures were assessed using a higher infusion dose (0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose) compared with a lower infusion dose (0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1) with and without a loading dose (0.07 unit/kg) of insulin.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^113iRuC9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^117V2pjs]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Both BSPED and NICE recommend the following fluid maintenance requirements, using 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose, and the Holliday-Segar formula:

100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg (0–10 kg body weight).
50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg (10–20 kg body weight).
20 mL/kg for each subsequent kilogramme (> 20 kg body weight).
When calculating the total fluid replacement, subtract any initial bolus volumes from the total fluid deficit (unless the child or young person is in shock).

For insulin and electrolyte replacement requirements, both recommend:

The addition of 40 mmol/L potassium chloride to all fluids (apart from the initial intravenous bolus) unless the patient is anuric or hyperkalaemic. Include this before starting the insulin infusion if hypokalaemia is observed at presentation.
0.9% sodium chloride should be used without added glucose unless the plasma glucose is < 14 mmol/L.
Initially assess for the presence of hyponatraemia, continue to monitor throughout treatment and treat as soon as blood glucose falls. Monitor sodium levels throughout treatment and calculate sodium initially to identify if hyponatraemia is present. This should be treated as soon as blood glucose falls. It is important to monitor as hyponatraemia and rapidly increasing sodium levels can both be signs of CO.
Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to CYP with DKA unless they have compromised cardiac contractility caused by life-threatening hyperkalaemia or severe acidosis, and you have discussed with paediatric intensivist.
A soluble insulin infusion of between 0.05 units/kg/hour and 0.1 units/kg/hour, 1–2 hours after intravenous fluids have been commenced. BSPED stated that the 0.05 units/kg/hour should be sufficient unless the patient is suffering from severe DKA or is an adolescent. If they are attached to a 'continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion', disconnect when starting intravenous insulin therapy. For patients already on long-acting insulin, it may be continued, and in new patients consider commencing long-acting subcutaneous insulin alongside intravenous. Similarly, the NICE guidelines state that continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before DKA may be continued in discussion with a diabetes specialist.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^116Twbr3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that the implementation of an SQ insulin-driven protocol for treating DKA was associated with substantial changes in practice, including a significantly decreased need for intensive care and reduced rates of readmission, with no increase in hypoglycemia or mortality. Our results suggest that an SQ insulin-driven protocol including the selection of optimal patients can be used effectively in treating DKA, although these results should be confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111wL2rY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Research Design and Methods

In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with DKA to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of DKA. After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34). Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).

Results

There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin. After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of DKA. A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of DKA resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin. Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in COVID-19: unique concerns and considerations [^112ATS29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

While individuals with diabetes appear to be at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without diabetes, they are more likely to suffer severe consequences, including death. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and potentially lethal acute complication of diabetes arising from a relative insulin deficiency, which occurs more often in those with type 1 diabetes and in the setting of moderate to severe illness. Early reports indicate that among patients with pre-existing diabetes, DKA may be a common complication of severe COVID-19 and a poor prognostic sign.

Case Description

This clinical perspective explores the key elements of caring for individuals with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic through 2 cases. Topics addressed include diagnosis, triage, and the fundamental principles of treatment with a focus on the importance of characterizing DKA severity and medical complexity to determine the best approach.

Conclusions

As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy. Finally, DKA is often a preventable condition. We include evidence-based strategies and guidance designed to empower clinicians and patients to avoid this serious complication when possible.

### Pediatric non-diabetic ketoacidosis: a case-series report [^113r4axW]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common cause of metabolic acidosis. However, ketoacidosis is not always accompanied with high blood glucose and diabetes. Some patients with ketoacidosis may have no medical history of diabetes and have normal or low blood glucose levels. These patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis may also experience severe complications or even death. There has been very limited research involving patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis, especially those in the pediatric age-group.

Diabetic ketoacidosis requires intravenous fluid replacement, insulin injection, correction of electrolyte imbalance, and possible bicarbonate administration in patients with severe acidosis, as well as prompt treatment for its etiology such as infection or insufficient insulin administration. Patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis also have increased ketone bodies, but they usually have normal or low blood glucose levels. Currently, there is no general consensus on the treatment for non-diabetic ketoacidosis. Several previous case reports have described non-diabetic ketoacidosis, but they usually focused on the exploration of original disorders, while failing to describe the initial treatment for stabilization of these patients. We believe that the initial treatment for stabilization of ketoacidotic patients is a critical step that allows for further investigation of underlying cause of the disorder.

Herein, we present a case-series comprising of five children with non-diabetic ketoacidosis, with the purpose to explore the clinical characteristics, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment outcomes in pediatric patients with non-diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Low-dose vs standard-dose insulin in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized clinical trial [^11596cU4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The standard recommended dose (0.1 U/kg per hour) of insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) guidelines is not backed by strong clinical evidence. Physiologic dose-effect studies have found that even lower doses could adequately normalize ketonemia and acidosis. Lowering the insulin dose may be advantageous in the initial hours of therapy when a gradual decrease in glucose, electrolytes, and resultant osmolality is desired.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose insulin against the standard dose in children with DKA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prospective, open-label randomized clinical trial conducted in the pediatric emergency department and intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India from November 1, 2011, through December 31, 2012. A total of 50 consecutive children 12 years or younger with a diagnosis of DKA were randomized to low-dose (n = 25) and standard-dose (n = 25) groups.

Interventions

Low-dose (0.05 U/kg per hour) vs standard-dose (0.1 U/kg per hour) insulin infusion.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the rate of decrease in blood glucose until a level of 250 mg/dL or less is reached (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). The secondary outcomes included time to resolution of acidosis, episodes of treatment failures, and incidences of hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.

Results

The mean (SD) rate of blood glucose decrease until a level of 250 mg/dL or less is reached (45.1 [17.6] vs 52.2 [23.4] mg/dL/h) and the mean (SD) time taken to achieve this target (6.0 [3.3] vs 6.2 [2.2] hours) were similar in the low- and standard-dose groups, respectively. Mean (SD) length of time to achieve resolution of acidosis (low vs standard dose: 16.5 [7.2] vs 17.2 [7.7] hours; p = 0.73) and rate of resolution of acidosis were also similar in the groups. Hypokalemia was seen in 12 children (48%) receiving the standard dose vs 5 (20%) of those receiving the low dose (P = 0.07); the tendency was more pronounced in malnourished children (7 [88%] vs 2 [28%]). Five children (20%) and 1 child (4%) receiving standard- and low-dose infusion (P = 0.17), respectively, developed hypoglycemia. Treatment failure was rare and comparable. One child in the standard-dose group developed cerebral edema, and no deaths occurred during the study period.

Conclusions and Relevance

Low dose is noninferior to standard dose with respect to rate of blood glucose decrease and resolution of acidosis. We advocate a superiority trial with a larger sample size before 0.05 U/kg per hour replaces 0.1 U/kg per hour in the practice recommendations.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112fAa9r]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and methods

This prospective, open‐label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18 years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3 units/kg SC within 3 h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in‐hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25 h (7.75 h, IQR 6.00–9.00 h vs. 11.00 h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72 h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8 mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0 mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12 h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48 h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in‐hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72 h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^115qY15W]. PES (2023). High credibility.

New onset diabetes triage — type 2 diabetes pathway and initial therapy specify that after the BMI check "BMI > 95%ile?", patients on this branch are to "Treat as T2D unless suspicion for T1D high" with listed type 1 diabetes risk factors ("Autoimmunity history", "Lack of FHx of T2D or gestational diabetes", and "Presence of ketones or DKA"), and "If ≥ 2 of these T1D risk factors are present, treat with insulin". Initial treatment is then determined by "HbA1c ≥ 8.5% or ketosis present": if present, start "• Start LA insulin 0.5 units/kg
- Start metformin titration"; if not present, start "Start metformin titration to 2000 mg daily".

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^112jcM2e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute hyperglycemic emergency with the potential for serious morbidity and mortality if not treated promptly. It is a serious complication of diabetes caused by a decreasein effective circulating insulin and elevations in counter-regulatory hormones, often leading to hyperglycemia, ketone body formation, osmotic diuresis, acid-base and electrolyte derangements, and hypovolemia. The tenets of management of DKA are the administration of insulin and the correction of the fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Standard therapy in the US has included continuous intravenous (IV) regular insulin until the resolution of ketoacidosis, with patients typically managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. As a result, DKA treatment can be costly in the US, resulting in an estimated annual cost of more than $5 billion.

There is growing interest in DKA treatment that can be achieved safely outside the ICU with non-IV insulin administration. In the United Kingdom, for example, national guidelines recommend the early initiation of fixed rate intravenous insulin infusionalongside the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. A recent review, suggested that there were no substantial advantages or disadvantages of using SQ rapid-acting insulin analogs over IV insulin on the basis of the low quality of the evidence. Some studies, have suggested that SQ short-acting insulin analogs may be as effective as IV insulin. Long-acting insulin glargine was also found to be effective and safe compared with IV regular insulin infusion in a small prospective study. Despite guideline recommendations for treatment in general medical-surgical wards, ICU treatment of DKA remains common in US health system and hospital settings.

In this study, we examined the outcomes of patients with DKA treated with an SQ insulin protocol including the early use of both rapid-acting and long-acting insulin, in place of IV insulin infusion, followed by rapid-acting insulin injections given over longer periods than previously studied. This SQ DKA protocol was implemented at a single intervention hospital as a quality improvement effort, and we compared outcomes against those from 20 other standard care hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: a current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Having an understanding of its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, delineates the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. The newer management modalities are discussed that include the need for intensive laboratory workup, meticulous monitoring of the insulin, and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. The new insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113jRNy5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters to the editor and commentaries, and animal studies were excluded. However, prior systematic reviews and literature reviews were assessed for potential studies that were eligible for inclusion. Finally, we excluded conference abstracts as they did not contain sufficient information to properly assess the study quality. After removing duplicates, two independent reviewers (AA and TM) screened the titles and abstracts of identified publications, and any publication deemed potentially relevant by either reviewer was carried forward to a full-text review. Discrepancies during full-text review between reviewers were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (OY).

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed for all included studies by two independent reviewers (AA and TM), and disagreements were resolved through further discussion or by a third reviewer (OY). First, we extracted information regarding the study design, population characteristics (population size, location of the study, study period, body mass index [BMI]), precipitants of DKA, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and outcomes of interest (length of hospital stay, time to resolution of DKA, cost of hospitalization, complications). The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 was used to evaluate the RCTs and the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS)-I tool was used to evaluate observational studies.

Risk of Bias Assessment in Included Studies

We assessed the risk of bias for RCTs using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2), the tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. We judged the "Risk of Bias" criteria as "low risk", "some concerns" or "high risk" and evaluated different bias items as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 6). We assessed the following domains: the risk of bias arising from the randomization process, the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention and adhering to intervention), missing outcome data, the risk of bias in measurement of the outcome, and the risk of bias in selection of the reported result. We synthesized an overall risk of bias judgement based on the outcomes within each domain.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^1153MQAr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In treatment of SGLT2i DKA, a tendency toward euglycemia results in clinically relevant reduction in the amount of insulin administered over the first 24 hours of treatment. It remains unclear whether the protracted duration of SGLT2i DKA is a result of inadequate insulin dosing or the ongoing effect of SGLT2i. It would be reasonable, based on the evidence presented and the safety profile of intravenous dextrose, to increase dextrose infusion rates and concentration to allow increased insulin administration and suppression of ketosis. The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and size. Prospective randomized clinical trial evidence is lacking.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^1149FtW3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

How to initiate diabetes therapy and advance interventions

Except in rare circumstances, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or patients who are extremely catabolic or hyperosmolar or who are unable to hydrate themselves adequately (seebelow), hospitalization is not required for initiation or adjustment of therapy. The patient is the key player in the diabetes care team and should be trained and empowered to adjust medications with the guidance of health care professionals to achieve glycemic goals and to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. Many patients may be managed effectively with monotherapy; however, the progressive nature of the disease will require the use of combination therapy in many, if not most, patients over time, to achieve and maintain glycemia in the target range.

The measures of glycemia that are initially targeted on a day-to-day basis are fasting and preprandial glucose levels. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important element in adjusting or adding new interventions and, in particular, in titrating insulin doses. The need for and number of required SMBG measurements are not clear and are dependent on the medications used. Oral glucose-lowering regimens that do not include sulfonylureas or glinides, and are therefore not likely to cause hypoglycemia, usually do not require SMBG. However, SMBG may be used to determine whether therapeutic blood glucose targets are being achieved and for adjustment of treatment regimens without requiring the patient to have laboratory-based blood glucose testing. Insulin therapy requires more frequent monitoring.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Subcutaneous insulin versus traditional intravenous insulin infusion in treatment of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis [^113QCagc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) insulin infusions are the current standard of care for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin, however, may also be a safe and effective alternative.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare patient-centered outcomes related to the treatment of mild to moderate DKA using two different protocols: an SQ insulin protocol and an IV insulin infusion protocol with an initial bolus (IVB) or without a bolus (IVNB).

Methods

We retrospectively conducted a multicenter cohort study evaluating SQ vs. IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included time to glucose correction, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, hypoglycemia events, readmission rates, and IV insulin use.

Results

Within the study time frame, 257 patients were included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. There was no significant difference in the time to DKA resolution between the IVB (p = 0.603) or IVNB (p = 0.269) groups compared with the population who received SQ insulin only. Hospital LOS was significantly longer when comparing the SQ group with the IVNB group (p < 0.001), but not when comparing it with the IVB group (p = 0.259). The IV protocols had significantly more hypoglycemic events compared with the SQ protocol (IVB vs. SQ, p < 0.001; IVNB vs. SQ, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

SQ insulin may be an effective alternative option for treating mild to moderate DKA with fewer hypoglycemic effects.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111JB2Pu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Early administration of insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting basal insulin analogue, in combination with IVII within 3 h of DKA diagnosis resulted in faster DKA resolution and lower CBG levels at 72 h among patients experiencing rebound hyperglycaemia after transitioning to full SC insulin treatment, without increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia. This approach may reduce the utilisation of personnel, laboratory testing, and intensive care resources in DKA management. It may be considered for all types of diabetes and DKA severity, particularly in patients with prior degludec use and insulin‐naïve individuals experiencing DKA for the first time who are planned to receive degludec for long‐term glycaemic control.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^112zo74N]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The object of this review is to provide the definitions, frequency, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic considerations, and management recommendations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents, and to convey current knowledge of the causes of permanent disability or mortality from complications of DKA or its management, particularly the most common complication, cerebral edema (CE). DKA frequency at the time of diagnosis of pediatric diabetes is 10%-70%, varying with the availability of healthcare and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the community. Recurrent DKA rates are also dependent on medical services and socioeconomic circumstances. Management should be in centers with experience and where vital signs, neurologic status, and biochemistry can be monitored with sufficient frequency to prevent complications or, in the case of CE, to intervene rapidly with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion. Fluid infusion should precede insulin administration (0.1 U/kg/h) by 1–2 hours; an initial bolus of 10–20 mL/kg 0.9% saline is followed by 0.45% saline calculated to supply maintenance and replace 5%-10% dehydration. Potassium (K) must be replaced early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is contraindicated. The prevention of DKA at onset of diabetes requires an informed community and high index of suspicion; prevention of recurrent DKA, which is almost always due to insulin omission, necessitates a committed team effort.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Ux9sA]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with DKA to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of DKA. After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34). Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).

RESULTS

There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin. After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS

Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of DKA. A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of DKA resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin. Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

### Use of a flexible catheter for the administration of subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis: a feasibility controlled clinical trial [^113GxVpE]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intravenous insulin administration is the standard of care in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), subcutaneous insulin administration could be a suitable alternative in resource-limited settings, but pain caused by hourly insulin applications are limiting factors for using it, especially in children. We aimed to assess whether the use of a flexible subcutaneous catheter improves comfort in patients with DKA compared with the usual hourly injections' treatment. We also compared the evolution of metabolic variables in patients with DKA using both insulin administration systems.

Methods

Randomized feasibility controlled open trial, comparing 2 ways (flexible catheter and steel needle) for the initial insulin administration in children with DKA, who were randomly selected to receive subcutaneous insulin by a flexible catheter or using standard needles. The main outcome was pain, assessed hourly and secondary outcome time to achieve ketoacidosis resolution.

Results

Twenty subjects were included (10 by group). There were no differences between groups in baseline lab values (glycemia, urea, sodium, bicarbonate and pH). Pain assessment at first insulin administration was significantly lower in the intervention group (4.5 vs 0 points; P = 0.001). Similar differences between both treatment arms were observed in every pain assessment. There were no differences between groups regarding the time elapsed to achieve ketoacidosis resolution. (11.4 ± 4.3 vs 16 ± 8.4; P = 0.12). No adverse events or DKA complications were observed.

Conclusions

The use of a flexible catheter reduced the pain associated with subcutaneous insulin administration in nonsevere DKA. The flexible subcutaneous catheter could be a safe alternative for the treatment of uncomplicated DKA in resource-limited settings.

### Joint British diabetes societies guideline for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^111nVy84]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### The 2021–2022 position of Brazilian diabetes society on insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes: an evidence-based guideline to clinical practice [^115Fkuqz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin therapy regimens for people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) should mimic the physiological insulin secretion that occurs in individuals without diabetes. Intensive insulin therapy, whether by multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), constitutes the fundamental therapy from the initial stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D), at all ages. This review is an authorized literal translation of part of the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD) Guidelines 2021–2022. This evidence-based guideline supplies guidance on insulin therapy in T1D.

Methods

The methods were published elsewhere in earlier SBD guidelines and was approved by the Internal Institutional Steering Committee for publication. Briefly, the Brazilian Diabetes Society indicated fourteen experts to constitute the Central Committee, designed to regulate the method review of the manuscripts, and judge the degrees of recommendations and levels of evidence. SBD Type 1 Diabetes Department drafted the manuscript selecting key clinical questions to do a narrative review using MEDLINE via PubMed, with the best evidence available, including high-quality clinical trials, metanalysis, and large observational studies related to insulin therapy in T1D, by using the Mesh terms [type 1 diabetes] and [insulin].

Results

Based on extensive literature review the Central Committee defined ten recommendations. Three levels of evidence were considered: A. Data from more than one randomised clinical trial (RCT) or one metanalysis of RCTs with low heterogeneity (I² < 40%). B. Data from metanalysis, including large observational studies, a single RCT, or a pre-specified subgroup analysis. C: Data from small or non-randomised studies, exploratory analysis, or consensus of expert opinion. The degree of recommendation was obtained based on a poll sent to the panellists, using the following criteria: Grade I: when more than 90% of agreement; Grade IIa if 75–89% of agreement; IIb if 50–74% of agreement, and III, when most of the panellist recommends against a defined treatment.

Conclusions

In PWT1D, it is recommended to start insulin treatment immediately after clinical diagnosis, to prevent metabolic decompensation and diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin therapy regimens should mimic insulin secretion with the aim to achieve glycemic control goals established for the age group. Intensive treatment with basal-bolus insulin therapy through MDI or CSII is recommended, and insulin analogues offers some advantages in PWT1D, when compared to human insulin. Periodic reassessment of insulin doses should be performed to avoid clinical inertia in treatment.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113VRPBo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the progress made in the in-hospital management of diabetes over the past decades, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a serious hyperglycemic emergency accompanied by significant rates of mortality and morbidity and high financial burden for health care systems and societies. Most national and international guidelines advocate continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of regular human insulin as the standard of care for the treatment of DKA. However, subcutaneous (sc) administration of rapid-acting insulin analogues has recently emerged as an alternative for patients with DKA of mild or moderate severity.

An IV insulin infusion is traditionally preferred over other routes of administration because of the rapid onset of insulin action that is necessary for the effective resolution of the hyperglycemic crisis and the suppression of ketogenesis. In addition, the short half-life of IV regimens enables an easy titration to achieve glycemic targets. However, IV administration of insulin usually requires patients to receive treatment in the emergency room or to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) to be closely monitored. Despite the fact that IV insulin infusion is acceptable for many countries to administer in general wards, the safety of such an approach has not been adequately studied. On the other hand, data from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group show that ICU admission in patients with DKA is related to a high-risk of long-term mortality and also substantial economic costs.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^1118kjCT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 4
Description of incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia, safety outcome, and other secondary outcomes.

Three participants in the early degludec group received an initial dose of 0.15 units/kg due to CrCl < 30 mL/min. One had end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and was prescribed a total daily SC insulin dose of 0.3 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with an average CBG of 182 mg/dL during the rebound hyperglycaemic episode 72 h after transition from IVII. The other two participants had acute kidney injury with CrCl recovering to > 30 mL/min the following day after fluid replacement; both were transitioned to SC insulin at 0.6 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with average CBGs of 264.5 and 205 mg/dL at 72 h post‐IVII. Additional clinical outcomes are presented in Table S1.

Regarding safety outcomes, the incidence of hypoglycaemia (CBG < 70 mg/dL) and level 2 hypoglycaemia (CBG < 54 mg/dL) was comparable between groups (12.5% vs. 10.0%; p = 1.0 and 2.5% vs. 2.5%; p = 1.0, respectively). One patient with ESRD in the early degludec group who received a reduced dose of insulin degludec developed hypoglycaemia (CBG 58 mg/dL) within 24 h after transition to the full SC insulin regimen (Table S1). The incidence of hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was common in this study and showed no significant difference between the groups (50.0% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.369). The serum potassium levels during hypokalaemic events were mild and comparable between groups (3.22 ± 0.19 mEq/L vs. 3.24 ± 0.18 mEq/L; p = 0.715) (Table 4). Additional information on hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia is provided in Table S2. None of the participants developed symptomatic cerebral oedema.

LOS and in‐hospital mortality were also not significantly different between groups (5.23 days [3.65–8.04] vs. 6.63 days [4.04–13.32]; p = 0.218, and 0% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.241, respectively).

### Abstract… [^117UPrdD]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level. 9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. When the blood glucose concentration is approximately 250 mg per dL, glucose should be added to the hydration fluid. This allows continued insulin administration until ketonemia is controlled and also helps to avoid iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Another important aspect of rehydration therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is the replacement of ongoing urinary losses. INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin.

This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. When a blood glucose concentration of 250 mg per dL has been achieved, the continuous or hourly insulin dosage can be reduced to 0. 05 unit per kg per hour. The insulin and fluid regimens are continued until ketoacidosis is controlled. This requires the achievement of at least two of these acid-base parameters: a serum bicarbonate concentration of greater than 18 mEq per L, a venous pH of 7. 3 or greater and an anion gap of less than 14 mEq per L. BICARBONATE THERAPY In general, supplemental bicarbonate therapy is no longer recommended for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, because the plasma bicarbonate concentration increases with insulin therapy.

1, 4, 8, 16, 17 Insulin administration inhibits ongoing lipolysis and ketone production and also promotes the regeneration of bicarbonate. Immediate Posthyperglycemic Care When diabetic ketoacidosis has been controlled, subcutaneous insulin therapy can be started. The half-life of regular insulin is less than 10 minutes. Therefore, to avoid relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis, the first subcutaneous dose of regular insulin should be given at least one hour before intravenous insulin is discontinued.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a comprehensive review [^1168HEhM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM, or it can occur with established type 1 DM, during the increased demands of an acute illness or with decreased insulin delivery due to omitted doses or insulin pump failure. In addition, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in a known diabetes patient with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^115SDHC2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting insulin analogue, provides up to 42 h of peakless basal insulin coverage to control plasma glucose and suppress ketogenesis. Due to these pharmacodynamic properties, the early use of SC degludec alongside IVII for DKA treatment may decrease the requirement for intravenous insulin, facilitate faster DKA resolution, and prevent excessively high glucose levels after transitioning to a SC insulin regimen. Although prior prospective studies of glargine U‐100 have revealed the benefits of early use of SC basal insulin in DKA treatment, no studies on ultralong‐acting degludec were conducted before this one.

Compared to the previous RCT of glargine U‐100, which showed that early use of glargine significantly reduced the time to DKA resolution by 2.87 h, our study of degludec demonstrated a comparable benefit, shortening the time to DKA resolution by 3.25 h. Furthermore, early use of glargine U‐100 showed potential benefits in decreasing the incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12 and 24 h, depending on the study. In our study, the benefit of blood glucose control was observed 72 h after transitioning to the full SC regimen. One possible explanation for this delayed effect, compared to the more rapid response seen in the glargine U‐100 trial, is that insulin degludec reaches steady‐state levels around days 3–4 after initiation. Assessment using CBG rather than venous plasma glucose, along with non‐strict control of dose and timing of full SC insulin initiation after DKA resolution, may have reduced the precision of this secondary outcome.
