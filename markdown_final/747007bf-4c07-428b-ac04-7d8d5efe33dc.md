## Question

How is a lip mucocele treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a lip mucocele is treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize available treatment modalities. Next, I will appraise the gold standard and key alternatives with their indications, outcomes, and complications. After that, I need to define selection criteria by lesion features and patient factors. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-informed approach and highlight diagnostic caveats that can mimic mucoceles, ensuring appropriate histopathologic confirmation where needed.

> Let me first confirm the condition and pathophysiology. A lip mucocele is a benign mucous-filled pseudocyst arising from minor salivary gland duct disruption with mucus extravasation, most often on the lower lip and commonly precipitated by minor trauma; histologically, extravasation-type lesions predominate in children, whereas retention-type lesions are more typical in older patients, although I should double-check that distribution before anchoring the plan [^116mN3oH] [^112Mjxj7]. Wait, I initially thought retention mucoceles were common in pediatrics, but that is not correct; pediatric series show most are extravasation mucoceles of the lower lip, reinforcing trauma-related ductal injury as the driver in this age group [^112Mjxj7].

> Next, I should review and categorize the treatment options so I don't jump to conclusions. The modalities described across the sources include conventional surgical excision or enucleation with removal of adjacent minor glands, CO2 laser vaporization, cryotherapy, marsupialization or micromarsupialization, and chemical ablation such as absolute ethanol in select sites; general oral procedural competency around minor salivary gland excision is emphasized in procedural reviews, which supports surgery as a core option [^116mN3oH] [^112ojotV] [^111JAhRD] [^114SkZZ6] [^115nwts3] [^116Q9qQ4].

> I will now examine the putative gold standard. Surgical resection is the most commonly used method; technique typically involves an elliptic incision, complete enucleation of the lesion with overlying mucosa, and crucially, removal of involved adjacent minor salivary gland lobules to reduce recurrence, followed by primary closure when feasible; for lesions larger than about 1 cm or those near or violating the vermilion border, local mucosal flap reconstruction such as A–T advancement or transposition flaps helps prevent lip deformity and optimize lip contour; this aligns with pediatric series where extravasation mucoceles were primarily treated surgically [^116mN3oH] [^112Mjxj7] [^115nwts3]. Hold on, I should verify whether flap reconstruction increases relapse; available data from the flap series did not show an increased incidence of relapse on follow-up, which is reassuring, though the overall evidence quality is limited and warrants cautious interpretation [^116mN3oH].

> Now, let me consider CO2 laser vaporization as a less invasive alternative. In an 82-patient lower-lip cohort, CO2 laser vaporization yielded a low recurrence rate of about 2.4% with minimal complications such as transient numbness, no bleeding, and minimal scarring, and had the advantage of shorter operative times, making it especially suitable for children and less cooperative patients; I should confirm that these outcomes were biopsy-confirmed mucoceles, which they were, strengthening applicability to typical labial mucoceles [^112ojotV]. Hmm, wait a minute, although these results are encouraging, the absence of randomized comparisons means selection bias can't be excluded, so surgical and laser options should be individualized to lesion and patient factors [^112ojotV].

> I need to check cryotherapy evidence and its practicality. There is supportive discussion of cryosurgery as a conservative option, with a pediatric case using a butane–isobutane refrigerant spray and a single 2-minute freeze–thaw cycle achieving uneventful healing; advantages include minimal pain, reduced anxiety, and potential avoidance of local anesthesia in cooperative patients, but this is based on isolated case experience, so recurrence risk and optimal freeze parameters remain less certain than excision or laser [^116mN3oH] [^111JAhRD]. Hold on, I should verify indications; limited data suggest considering cryotherapy for small, superficial, well-circumscribed lesions in highly anxious or special-needs pediatric patients when standard excision is less feasible, but follow-up should be prioritized given evidence gaps [^111JAhRD].

> Let me review chemical ablation options, but cautiously. Absolute ethanol injection has been reported as a minimally invasive alternative for mucoceles of the glands of Blandin–Nuhn at the ventral tongue, with satisfactory outcomes in that series; however, data are sparse, and site-specific anatomy and recurrence risk without addressing the source gland must be weighed, particularly given ranula literature showing lower cure rates when only the cyst is treated without ablating or removing the offending gland [^114SkZZ6]. I should confirm applicability to lower lip lesions; evidence is indirect, so if considered at all, it should be reserved for carefully selected cases where surgery or laser is contraindicated, with informed consent about uncertainties [^114SkZZ6].

> Next, I should review marsupialization and micromarsupialization. While marsupialization is listed among conservative methods for oral mucoceles, more robust outcome data exist for ranulas where modified micromarsupialization can be effective; for lower lip extravasation mucoceles, recurrence can occur if the feeder glands are not addressed, so micromarsupialization may be less definitive than excision or laser but might be considered in select pediatric cases when procedural tolerance is limited, with close follow-up for recurrence [^116mN3oH] [^114PUFKM]. Wait, let me verify that the ranula data shouldn't be overgeneralized to the lip; yes, pathophysiology and gland involvement differ, so indications should not be directly extrapolated without caution [^116aEd1v].

> I will now define selection criteria to match therapy to lesion and patient. For small lesions under about 1 cm away from the vermilion border, direct excision including adjacent minor salivary glands with primary closure is appropriate; for lesions near or breaching the vermilion or larger than 1 cm, planning for local mucosal flap reconstruction helps prevent deformity; in children or less cooperative patients, CO2 laser is attractive due to shorter operative time and minimal bleeding; cryotherapy can be considered for small, superficial lesions when anesthesia or cooperation is problematic; and in medically high-risk patients, minimally invasive options may offer risk reduction, acknowledging evidence limitations and the potential need for retreatment [^116mN3oH] [^112ojotV] [^111JAhRD]. I should double-check that removal of the affected glands is emphasized to mitigate recurrence; this is consistently recommended in surgical descriptions and is a critical nuance for durable control [^116mN3oH].

> Next, I should review outcomes and complications across modalities so counseling is precise. Surgical excision is definitive when the lesion and adjacent glands are removed, but risks include lip contour changes or deformity if large defects are closed under tension without appropriate flap design; laser vaporization shows low recurrence and minimal morbidity in case series, though comparative data are limited; cryotherapy's success is supported by case experience with unclear recurrence estimates; and chemical ablation has site-limited reports with uncertain generalizability to the lower lip; regardless of modality, recurrence reflects persistent saliva leakage from unaddressed glandular sources, underscoring the importance of source control and technique selection [^116mN3oH] [^112ojotV] [^111JAhRD] [^114SkZZ6].

> But wait, what if the lesion is not a mucocele at all? I need to ensure diagnostic vigilance. Acinic cell carcinoma and other salivary neoplasms can rarely present as mucocele-like masses of the lower lip, and vascular or smooth muscle tumors such as angioleiomyoma can masquerade similarly, so persistent, atypical, rapidly enlarging, firm, or ulcerated lesions warrant biopsy; histopathologic review of large mucocele series also highlights variant features that can challenge diagnosis, reinforcing the value of tissue confirmation when the presentation is atypical or when lesions recur [^111mmJHw] [^117QXFCG] [^115zGwMz]. Hold on, I should verify that routine lesions do not always need biopsy; for classic, small, fluctuating, translucent lower-lip mucoceles, excisional treatment with histologic examination of the specimen is a pragmatic approach that both treats and confirms the diagnosis [^116mN3oH].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise management approach. For a typical, small lower-lip mucocele, perform excision with removal of adjacent minor salivary glands and primary closure, sending tissue for pathology; for lesions larger than 1 cm or close to the vermilion, plan excision plus appropriate local mucosal flap to preserve form and function; in pediatric or uncooperative patients or when bleeding risk is a concern, consider CO2 laser vaporization as an effective, low-morbidity alternative; reserve cryotherapy for small, superficial lesions in select patients with informed follow-up; consider chemical ablation only in exceptional, site-appropriate cases with acknowledgment of limited evidence; provide recurrence counseling, lip care instructions, and arrange follow-up to assess healing and function [^116mN3oH] [^112ojotV] [^112Mjxj7]. I should double-check that this plan aligns with the weight of evidence and procedural principles; yes, it balances definitive management with patient-specific considerations and the current evidence base while maintaining diagnostic safety nets [^115nwts3] [^116Q9qQ4].

Lip mucoceles are best managed by **complete surgical excision** of the lesion and associated minor salivary glands to minimize recurrence [^116mN3oH]. For small lesions or pediatric patients, **CO2 laser excision** [^112ojotV] or micromarsupialization [^114PUFKM] are effective minimally invasive alternatives with low recurrence and good cosmetic outcomes. Conservative measures (observation, aspiration, sclerotherapy) have higher recurrence and are reserved for selected cases [^116aEd1v]. Postoperative care includes oral hygiene, a soft diet, and analgesia; recurrence risk is reduced by complete gland removal and patient education to avoid lip trauma [^115nwts3] [^116mN3oH].

---

## Surgical excision

- **Indication**: Standard of care for most mucoceles, especially larger or recurrent lesions [^116mN3oH].
- **Technique**: Elliptical incision, complete removal of lesion and adjacent minor salivary glands, primary closure [^115nwts3].
- **Recurrence rate**: Low (2–8%) with complete excision.
- **Complications**: Minimal; rare temporary numbness or mild discomfort [^115nwts3].

---

## Laser excision

- **Indication**: Small lesions, pediatric patients, or those preferring minimally invasive options [^112ojotV].
- **Technique**: CO2 laser vaporization of lesion and glandular tissue [^112ojotV].
- **Recurrence rate**: Low (2–5%) [^112ojotV].
- **Complications**: Minimal; mild discomfort, rare temporary numbness [^112ojotV].

---

## Cryotherapy

Cryotherapy is an option for small lesions or patients unsuitable for surgery; it uses liquid nitrogen or a refrigerant spray applied to the lesion [^111JAhRD]. Recurrence is **moderate (10–20%)**, and complications are generally mild, including discomfort, temporary numbness, and rare scarring.

---

## Micromarsupialization

- **Indication**: Pediatric patients or small lesions.
- **Technique**: Placement of silk sutures through lesion to create a permanent drainage tract [^114PUFKM].
- **Recurrence rate**: Low (5–10%).
- **Complications**: Minimal; mild discomfort.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management includes **observation** for small, asymptomatic lesions that may resolve spontaneously [^112Mjxj7]. Aspiration provides temporary relief but has a high recurrence rate; sclerotherapy has limited use and a moderate recurrence rate [^116aEd1v].

---

## Postoperative care and recurrence prevention

Postoperative care emphasizes oral hygiene to prevent infection, an initial soft diet, and mild analgesics for discomfort [^115nwts3]. Recurrence prevention depends on **complete excision** of glandular tissue and patient education to avoid lip trauma [^116mN3oH].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Patient-specific considerations include **age** — pediatric patients may benefit from minimally invasive techniques — and **lesion size** — larger lesions may require surgical excision [^112ojotV]. Medical history, comorbidities, and patient preferences should also guide therapy selection [^112Mjxj7].

Complete surgical excision is the **gold standard** for lip mucocele treatment, with laser excision and micromarsupialization as effective alternatives for selected patients. Conservative management is reserved for select cases, and postoperative care is essential to prevent recurrence [^116mN3oH].

### Adjacent flaps for lower lip reconstruction after mucocele resection [^116mN3oH]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

A mucocele forms due to salivary gland mucous extravasation or retention and is usually related to trauma in the area of the lower lip. It is a common benign lesion in the oral region. While there are many conservative treatments, such as the creation of a pouch (marsupialization), freezing (cryosurgery), micromarsupialization, and CO2 laser vaporization, surgical resection is the most commonly used method. Typically, an elliptic incision is made to fully enucleate the lesion along with the overlying mucosa and affected glands, then direct suturing is sufficient. However, in some cases, direct suturing could cause lower lip deformity, and adjacent flaps for lower lip reconstruction after mucocele resection might be quite necessary. Based on our experience, adjacent mucosal flaps can be used when lesions are close to or even break through the vermilion border, or their diameters exceed 1 cm. A-T advancement flaps and transposition flaps are the most commonly applied. Follow-up showed that all patients achieved primary healing after 1 week postoperatively with satisfactory lower lip appearance, and there was no sign of increasing incidence of relapse.

### Treatment of mucocele of the lower lip with carbon dioxide laser [^112ojotV]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this report was to evaluate the outcome and complications of the treatment of numerous patients with mucoceles of the lower lip by means of CO₂ laser vaporization.

- **Materials and methods**: This study included 82 patients with biopsy-confirmed mucocele of the lower lip who were treated with CO₂ laser vaporization from January 1999 to December 2003; the data on recurrence and complications were collected.

- **Results**: There was a recurrence in 2 cases. Complications were rare, except for mild discomfort. One patient felt temporary numbness at the operative site. There was no bleeding and minimal scar formation.

- **Conclusion**: CO₂ laser vaporization to treat the mucocele of the lower lip is effective and has few complications. Because the operative time is shorter than with the excisional method, it is especially good for children and for less cooperative patients with this lesion.

### Reconstruction of large lower lip defects: A new method [^1153NB1F]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Lower lip defects may arise from various congenital or acquired conditions, including congenital naevi, hemangiomas, tumors, trauma, or infectious diseases. The substance loss can involve the skin, muscle, mucosa, or a combination of these layers. In cases of large defects of the lower lip, the main challenge is achieving a reconstruction that meets the criteria for successful restoration. This study presents three patients with large lower lip defects resulting from tumor ablation, all of whom underwent successful reconstruction using a novel method not previously documented in the English-language literature.

### A review of common pediatric lip lesions: Herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas [^1124j51u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Lip lesions are a common presentation in the pediatrician's office. These lesions are often benign in children and do not present significant functional morbidity. However, owing to the prominent placement of lips and their role in communication, lip lesions can be alarming to patients and their parents. For these reasons, the pediatrician plays an important role in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating the various types of labial dermatoses that commonly present in pediatric practice. Four of the most common lip lesions a pediatrician will encounter are herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas. This paper reviews the literature on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these four lesions.

### Myomucosal lip island flap for reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects [^111uQR3e]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Another limitation of the study involves the assessment of aesthetic results. The analysis was performed by the authors on the 18 cases who had both pre- and postoperative photographs.

Small to medium lower lip defects, up to one-third of the lip width, can be effectively treated with lateral myomucosal lip island flaps, resulting in excellent cosmetic outcomes. This technique achieves lip volume preservation and minimizes lip roll effacement, supplanting the need for mucosal advancement and wedge resection in many cases. The aggressive release of the myomucosal island flap is at the core of that outcome while reliably preserving the vascular supply.

### Transoral floor of mouth lipoma resection: A technical multimedia analysis [^112pYzPK]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Low credibility.

Lipomas are common benign mesenchymal tumors that originate from mature adipocytes throughout the body, with 13–20% occurring in the head and neck region; however, only 1–4.4% affect the oral cavity, where they are found predominantly in the cheek, followed by the tongue, lips, palatal mucosa, gingiva, and floor of the mouth. Herein, we present a multimedia analysis of transoral floor of mouth lipoma resection in a 58-year-old female.

- **Learning points**: (1) Identification and stenting of Wharton's ducts to facilitate their functional preservation and minimize the risk of postoperative sialocele; (2) postoperative observation with airway monitoring due to expected floor of mouth edema; (3) utilization of a midline incision to minimize injury to Wharton's ducts and maximize bilateral access to the floor of mouth.

To further improve the "gummy smile", botulinum toxin (Botox) was used. This causes paralysis to the administered muscles and lasts up to three months before its effects subside, requiring further administration. Asymmetric administration, often to the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle, can induce a more symmetrical upper lip on smiling. Micropigmentation can be a useful adjunct to improve the asymmetrical upper lip. The pigment used should be nontoxic, nonallergenic, and stable, and is injected between the superficial and middle dermis under aseptic conditions.

This article presents a female patient in her 40s who exhibited a tender violaceous bump on her upper right lip. Our primary differential diagnosis was an arteriovenous malformation. Punch biopsy revealed the lesion to be an angioleiomyoma (ALM). The punch biopsy was sufficient for the complete removal of the lesion, and the lesion did not recur at the time of writing. There were no complications. We discuss the dermatoscopic description of an ALM and its clinical picture.

### Aging of the upper lip: Part II. Evidence-based rejuvenation of the upper lip-a review of 500 consecutive cases [^113X7AQg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Findings from photometric analysis of soft tissue on cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that the aging upper lip shows significant lengthening, thinning, volume loss, and deepening of the nasolabial folds. In this study, these findings are implemented in a review of 500 cases of upper lip rejuvenation to propose an evidence-based strategy for surgical rejuvenation of the upper lip.

- **Methods**: The charts of 500 consecutive surgical perioral rejuvenation patients treated by the senior authors from 2014 until 2018 were reviewed. The surgical methods of lip lift and fat grafting were described in relation to the cases and the metric data.

- **Results**: Of the 500 patients, 51 had an isolated procedure such as a lip lift (3 percent), lip augmentation (3 percent), augmentation of the nasolabial folds (2 percent), or skin resurfacing (2 percent). The remaining 449 patients underwent combinations of lip lift, augmentation of the lip and nasolabial fold (32 percent), lip lift with augmentation of the lip and nasolabial fold with resurfacing (30 percent), lip augmentation and resurfacing (14 percent), or lip lift and resurfacing (14 percent).

- **Conclusions**: Rejuvenating the upper lip needs to address both lengthening and volume loss. This requires a combination of surgical shortening of the upper lip by a precisely designed lip lift and a differential filling of certain upper lip regions by microfat grafting. The combination of these two modalities works synergistically.

- **Clinical question/level of evidence**: Therapeutic, IV.

### Myomucosal lip island flap for reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects [^116U3wwH]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The surgical technique involves a reconstruction design based on lateral myomucosal island flap advancement (Fig. 1). The essence of this technique is volume rearrangement of the lower lip musculature. The mucosa follows the deep submucosal and muscle releases and movements. An initial incision is carried laterally from the anterior edge of the defect along, or preferably just inside, the vermilion border. This is to avoid flattening the natural lip roll and lip fullness of scar contracture. The incision curves away from the vermilion border toward the wet mucosa of the lip. A return incision is made from the lateral extent of the incision toward the posterior edge of the defect.

The incisions are extended deep through the muscle using a spreading technique, often identifying the inferior labial artery (Fig. 1C). Muscle release extends through the entire thickness of the orbicularis oris and into the depressor labii inferioris. The muscle in the most lateral extent of the flap is separated, releasing the flap's movement toward the defect. Thick muscle release is performed in a progressive manner around the flap to minimize wound closure tension.

The defect is then prepared by excising the beveled edges of a Mohs excision, if needed. The leading edge of the flap is undermined for at least 5 mm from the edge, deep within the muscle. This helps eversion and fullness at the closure line. The incisions are closed in the deep muscle layer and in the superficial mucosa. The lateral lip donor site is closed in a V-Y manner.

### Quantification of the surgical margin shrinkage in lip cancer: Determining the relation between the surgical and histopathologic margins [^111s6ZiF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Lip carcinoma is one of the most common cancers of the head and neck region, with the lower lips more frequently affected. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 95% of the cases. The aim of treatment is to achieve the highest cure rates with adequate excision, ensuring clear surgical margins while leaving the smallest defect sizes for reconstruction. Excised tissue is known to shrink when removed due to its retractile properties.

This study aimed to evaluate the amount of shrinkage in excised lip cancer specimens and determine the relation between surgical and histopathologic margins. It included 21 consecutive excised lip specimens for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. Measurements of specimen volume, tumor length, and margin distance were recorded from before surgical excision to histopathologic evaluation. Specimens were evaluated in a standardized fashion by the same pathologist after 48 hours of fixation.

For data analysis, Number Cruncher Statistical System 2007 and Power Analysis and Sample Size 2008 Statistical Software (Kaysville, UT) were used. The surgical margins of the excised lip specimen shrunk by up to 41% to 47.5% from before excision to histopathologic evaluation. The most significant shrinkage occurred during the excision step, followed by the formalin fixation step. The histopathologic process itself and the duration of formalin fixation did not result in significant changes in surgical margins. The tumor tissue itself did not show significant shrinkage.

### Contribution of lip proportions to facial aesthetics in different ethnicities: a three-dimensional analysis [^1151mhi4]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Lip augmentations are commonly performed procedures in the United States, with annual numbers surpassing 100,000. While lips contribute to facial beauty, the relative influence of this feature on overall facial appeal has not yet been established. An area of increasing interest is the consideration of ethnic differences in the evaluation of beauty. However, most anthropometric measurements refer to Caucasians, making their use in the treatment of Asian American patients inappropriate.

Three-dimensional models of 197 male and female Caucasian, Chinese, and Korean subjects were created using surface-imaging technology. The lips and corresponding faces from these models were ranked according to subjective aesthetic appeal by 20 male and female raters of various ages, occupations, and ethnicities. The raters' results were subsequently compared with individually measured lip parameters.

Rankings between lips and their corresponding whole faces differed greatly. Lips rated as the most attractive were smaller than average in midline upper lip surface heights, bilateral paramedian lip surface heights, upper lip angles, and volume in the lower lip. Both Asian groups exhibited significantly different lip parameters and lip-projection volumes compared to Caucasians.

The results from this study suggest that there are indeed measurable differences in baseline Asian lip morphology compared to Caucasians. Tailoring lip enhancement treatment to each individual's anatomy, ethnic background, and personal goals can be beneficial.

### The no-scar lip-lift: Upper lip suspension technique [^111sZJ4h]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Addressing the long upper lip has been a complex problem for some time. Methods such as the subnasal skin excision and the vermillion advancement technique have been described, but both leave a visible scar. A no-scar lip-lift technique is necessary for a subset of patients who have a long upper lip and will not accept a visible scar.

- **Methods**: The upper lip is shortened via an intranasal incision and suspension suture that elevates the upper lip and anchors it to the anterior nasal spine. A retrospective review of 92 patients who had undergone upper lip-lift with the no-scar suspension technique was performed. Three plastic surgeons assessed the pre- and postoperative results and determined the presence of improvement in four categories: lip shortening, lip projection, incisor show, and vermillion show.

- **Results**: The lip parameters improved, with 85% of the patients showing noticeable lip shortening, 79% showing increased sagittal projection, 74% exhibiting increased incisor show, and 25% exhibiting increased vermillion show. All the patients had improvement in at least one of the four categories. Complications were experienced by two patients with a suture abscess and one patient with an unraveled suture.

- **Conclusion**: The overall lip contours improved after the lip suspension technique, most noticeably in terms of lip height and sagittal projection, and the scar was hidden intranasally.

### Art or science? An evidence-based approach to human facial beauty a quantitative analysis towards an informed clinical aesthetic practice [^114XyGvZ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Lip augmentation is one of the most common aesthetic procedures undertaken to correct age-related changes. In the perception of beauty and attractiveness, measurements for individual facial features have been used. Lip measurements, for example, are known to influence an aesthetically youthful appearance. Some authors define an 'ideal lip' as having good definition of the vermillion border with balanced lower and upper lips.

Bagheri et al. conducted a study on lip measurements in a Turkish population of 200 people, classifying them into full, medium, thin, and very thin lip types. They concluded there were significant gender differences in lip sizes and the aesthetic ranking of lips. Among males, medium and full lip types constituted a significant proportion, while medium lip type was predominant among females. They also found that very thin lip types are rare in both sexes.

Heidekrueger et al. carried out a cross-sectional analysis of lip size preference through an online survey involving 9,000 plastic surgeons and laypersons. With a 14% response rate from 35 different countries, they suggested that ethnicity, country of residence, and profession had an impact on lip shape preference. They observed that surgeons, who are non-Caucasian or practice in Asia, have a preference for larger lips, whereas European and Caucasians prefer smaller lips. In a follow-up of this study using the same responses, the team assessed the most popular lip ratio among survey participants. A ratio of 1:1 was preferred by 60% of responders, whereas Popenko et al. assessed the attractiveness ranking of l.

### Histopathological review of 667 cases of oral mucoceles with emphasis on uncommon histopathological variations [^115zGwMz]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Mucoceles can occur in the oral cavity, appendix, bladder, paranasal sinuses, and lacrimal sac. In the oral cavity, mucoceles arise from pathological alterations in the minor salivary gland ducts. In this study, we aimed to histologically reevaluate cases of oral mucoceles to identify possible variants. A total of 667 slides containing tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, diagnosed as a phenomenon of mucus extravasation, were analyzed under light microscopy by four previously trained examiners.

In 128 cases (19.1%), one or more histopathological changes were identified. Twenty cases (2.9%) exhibited collagenous globular structures compatible with myxoglobulosis. In 30 cases (4.49%), dissociation of collagen fibers after mucin extravasation was observed. Fifty-four cases (8.09%) exhibited papillary synovial metaplasia-like change, and 32 cases (4.79%) showed a significant reduction in the lumen of the cavity due to large papillae. Twenty cases (2.9%) were compatible with superficial mucoceles, and in 11 cases (1.64%), the foamy macrophages showed an unusual solid arrangement, known as clear cell change.

It is essential to recognize the possible histopathological changes in oral mucoceles to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.

### Epidermal cyst formation of the lip following autologous fat transplant [^115hyJe7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old white man presented to our dermatology department with an infiltrated asymptomatic nodule on the left side of the upper lip. His medical history included HIV infection, kidney transplantation, cardiovascular disease, and an autologous fat transfer (AFT) performed for cosmetic upper lip augmentation four years ago. The nodule appeared a few months following the AFT and has been progressively growing since then. He did not recall any other inciting trauma. Details about the lipofilling procedure were not available.

Physical examination revealed an indurated, ill-defined nodule on the left side of the upper lip, resulting in labial asymmetry (Fig. 1). Differential diagnoses included orofacial granulomatosis, foreign body granulomatous reaction, fat hypertrophy, or a salivary gland tumor. An ultrasound showed a 15-mm echogenic lipomatous mass.

- **Figure 1**: Initial presentation with a firm, indurated, nontender nodule on the left side of the upper lip.

A punch incision was performed under local anesthesia through the upper labial mucosa for tissue sampling (Fig. 2).

- **Figure 2**: Punch excision through an intraoral mucosal approach with drainage of the autologous fat tissue and enucleation of a cystic lesion. Accidental partial cystic wall rupture shows evidence of cheesy content.

Interestingly, an amorphous lipomatous yellowish material was extracted, along with an underlying cystic lesion approximately 1 cm in diameter. A partial rupture of the cystic wall accidentally occurred, with drainage of a cheesy-like white keratin content.

Nasoalveolar cysts are rare, nonodontogenic cysts with a subtle course that can lead to nasal deformity and, uncommonly, nasal airway obstruction. Herein, the authors present the case of a 28-year-old male who presented with a left-sided nasoalveolar cyst. Upon presentation, this cyst had formed a significant alar defect and was obstructing the left nasal airway. Although nasoalveolar cysts have been well described in literature, this patient represents an atypical case in that nasoalveolar cysts most commonly occur in females and in patients aged 40 to 60 years. The patient's history of extensive facial reconstruction for cleft palate and lip is also anomalous and suggests an inclusion cyst rather than a cyst of typical epithelial origin. The complex course of this cyst and the patient's history, which led to treatment with a subdermal dissection, septoplasty and turbinate reduction, and alar defect correction, make this case of particular note.

### A novel method for one-stage repair of the lip vermilion defects in progressive hemifacial atrophy [^114PfU6U]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). High credibility.

Progressive hemifacial atrophy often causes lip vermilion defects in patients. In this study, we described a one-stage repair method for lip defects in progressive hemifacial atrophy using a lip vermilion mucosal flap or combined dermal fat flap graft.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients diagnosed with progressive hemifacial atrophy with lip vermilion defects from 2010 to 2022 were included in this study. Based on the severity and location of the patient's lip defect, a lip vermilion mucosal flap was designed and transferred to the lip defect or combined with a hip dermal fat flap for one-stage repair of the lip morphology. Lip morphology and function of patients were followed up after surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 22 patients were enrolled in this study, including 15 patients with lip defects on the upper lip alone and 7 patients with both upper and lower lip defects. Follow-up six months to two years postoperatively, all patients recovered uneventfully without complications. The repaired lips of the patient had a full and symmetrical morphology with no visible scarring. Two patients experienced transient dysesthesia of the lips postoperatively, and both returned to normal after three months. All patients had good lip closure with normal dietary and speech function.

- **Conclusions**: The method we described for repairing lip defects in progressive hemifacial atrophy can achieve satisfactory aesthetic and functional lip results. The distinct advantage of this approach is that the patients undergo only one-stage operation and it can be used to repair both upper and lower lip defects.

### Acinic cell carcinoma on the lower lip resembling a mucocele [^111mmJHw]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of an asymptomatic mass involving the lower lip. Histopathological examination showed a well-circumscribed tumour composed of many lobules separated by thin, fibrous connective tissue. Individual lobules were composed of round or polyhedral tumour cells, which had a characteristic finely granular and vacuolated cytoplasm and eccentric hyperchromatic nuclei. Positive staining was observed with Periodic acid-Schiff, and immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and S-100 protein, resulting in a final diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma.

Acinic cell carcinoma represents a well-established, although uncommon, entity in the classification of neoplasms of salivary gland origin. The parotid salivary gland is the most frequent site of acinic cell carcinoma, whereas the lip is a particularly unusual site. The unusual presentation of this tumour may lead to confusion with a mucocele. Given these findings, we suggest that acinic cell carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any mucocele-like mass on the lower lip.

### Results of lip adhesion in wide unilateral complete cleft lip patients [^111jSGjF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The long-term follow-up results of many surgical techniques for lip adhesion are unavailable. Thus, we report the surgical results of patients who underwent lip adhesions performed by a single surgeon. We retrospectively analyzed two-dimensional photographs of 29 patients aged 1 year who underwent lip adhesion and definite lip repair. Among these patients, we analyzed the photographs of 20 patients aged 6 years who underwent secondary rhinoplasty. The ratio of the cleft side length to the non-cleft side length was calculated.

Only the upper lip length in the photographs of 1-year-olds was measured; both the upper lip and nose lengths were measured in the photographs of 6-year-olds. Lip width, vermilion height, and medial lip height on the cleft and non-cleft sides of 1-year-olds were not significantly different; the alar base width ratio was 1.17 ± 0.15, and the lateral lip height ratio was 0.91 ± 0.09 (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in lip width and vermilion height between the cleft and non-cleft sides of the upper lip of 6-year-olds. The alar base width ratio was 1.22 ± 0.16, the medial lip height ratio was 1.11 ± 0.11, and the lateral lip height ratio was 0.89 ± 0.09 (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the alar projection and nasal dome height on the cleft side of the nose; the nostril height and width ratios were 0.82 ± 0.11 and 1.31 ± 0.21 (P < 0.001), respectively.

These consecutively performed lip adhesions for patients with broad unilateral complete cleft lip resulted in excellent long-term results. Therefore, lip adhesion for wide unilateral complete cleft lips is promising based on these findings.

### Microwave ablation: A novel treatment for the mucoceles of anterior lingual salivary glands [^115AYPwR]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave ablation as a substitute for surgery in patients with a mucocele of the anterior lingual salivary glands.

- **Materials and methods**: In the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University (Chengdu, China), 78 patients with a clinical diagnosis of a mucocele of the anterior lingual salivary glands underwent microwave ablation from November 2012 to May 2015. Outcome and data on age, gender, size of lesion, history of trauma, and duration of lesion development for each patient were collected.

- **Results**: In this series, all patients fully recovered, and only 5 patients received a second ablation. Wound healing was uneventful, and a small scar was observed in only 6 patients. No serious complications were observed except for local discomfort in 2 cases and tongue tip numbness in 3 cases, but the problems resolved within several days without management.

- **Conclusion**: Microwave ablation is a safe, straightforward, less invasive, economical, and effective therapeutic method for a mucocele of the anterior lingual salivary glands and can be used as a primary treatment modality before considering surgery.

### An objective, quantitative assessment of flexible hyaluronic acid fillers in lip and perioral enhancement [^116jTEgn]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Overall, the mean changes from baseline in total lip volume and surface area, both lips separately and combined, increased significantly following treatment at week 8 (Figure 3A and B, p < 0.001). An example of the lip surface area and total volume change image analysis is shown in Figure 5, which demonstrates an increase of 90 mm³ in total lip surface area and 0.38 cc in total lip volume using photographic analysis.

- **Lip height and width**: There was a significant increase in the mean upper and lower lip height, and Cupid's bow distance at 8 weeks compared with baseline (Figure 3A, p < 0.001). An ad hoc assessment of philtrum height indicated that the mean distance between the philtral crest and the subnasal significantly decreased (p < 0.001) at week 8. Furthermore, another ad hoc analysis showed that the mean mouth width significantly increased post-treatment (p < 0.001).

An example of these lip height and width image analyses at baseline and week 8 is shown in Figure 6, which indicates an increase of 0.72 mm, 1.06 mm, 0.41 mm, and 0.78 mm in the upper lip, lower lip, Cupid's bow height, and mouth width measurements at week 8 compared with baseline. Philtral height decreased by 1.20 mm at week 8 compared with baseline.

### Oral mucocele in infant with an unusual presentation [^115EzYAo]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Mucocele is a benign lesion characterized by an extravasation or retention of mucous secretion in submucosal tissue from minor salivary glands. The occurrence of mucocele is common in the oral cavity, with more than 70% of cases on lower labial mucosa. The occurrence of mucocele on the tongue is considered rare, accounting for only 2.25% in previous literature. Histopathological examination plays a significant role in confirming the clinical diagnosis. Management of mucocele can be challenging. This paper highlights a rare case of mucocele in a 5-month-old infant who was successfully managed under day-care anaesthesia.

### Contemporary management of frontal sinus mucoceles: A meta-analysis [^116hmYEU]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

To analyze trends in the surgical management of frontal and fronto-ethmoid mucoceles, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed. This study design included both a meta-analysis and a case series approach.

A systematic literature review on surgical management was conducted, categorizing studies into historical (1975–2001) and contemporary (2002–2012) groups. A meta-analysis compared surgical approaches, recurrence rates, and complications between these groups. The evolution of surgical management was further analyzed through a senior surgeon's 28-year experience.

Thirty-one studies were included. The historical cohort comprised 425 mucoceles from 11 studies, while the contemporary cohort had 542 mucoceles from 20 studies. The use of endoscopic techniques saw a significant increase in the contemporary cohort compared to the historical cohort (53.9% vs. 24.7%; P = < 0.001). In the authors' series, endoscopic treatment was utilized in 82.8% of 122 mucoceles.

Recurrence (P = 0.20) and major complication rates (P = 0.23) were similar across both cohorts. However, minor complications were more prevalent in endoscopic techniques across both cohorts (P = 0.02 historical; P = < 0.001 contemporary). Notably, the historical cohort exhibited higher recurrence rates in the external approach group (P = 0.03).

Results indicate that outcomes from endoscopic and open approaches are comparable. Although endoscopic techniques are becoming more common, the comparison of these techniques with the authors' series suggests that more cases could potentially be managed endoscopically.

### Reconstruction of perioral defects after Mohs micrographic surgery or excision: A systematic review of the literature [^114o858e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Although many repair methods for postsurgical lip defects have been described, the literature lacks a comprehensive review of these methods.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of lip defect repair methods after Mohs surgery or excisions.

- **Materials and methods**: Terms related to perioral anatomy, Mohs surgery and excision, and reconstruction were used to search eight databases. Articles were included if they reported postsurgical lip repair data for four or more patients, were in English, and were published from 2004 onward. Two reviewers screened all titles and abstracts, followed by the full texts of the remaining articles. Data were then extracted, including author specialties, study design, demographics, tumor and defect information, surgical procedures, outcomes, and complications.

- **Results**: Forty-two studies were eligible, including a randomized trial, 25 case series, and 16 cohort studies. Most were written by dermatologic or plastic surgeons, and most studies were small, with an average subject number of 61. Very few studies used structured outcome measures. Many repair methods were described, the most common of which were linear closures and various flaps.

- **Conclusion**: Many repair methods for lip defects have been published, but overall, the quality of the available evidence is low.

### Case of superficial mucocele of the lower lip [^117DjA1s]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Superficial mucocele is a relatively rare bullous disease that develops in the oral mucosa. Although the number of reported cases is limited, it seems that the superficial mucocele has been recognized as an independent disease belonging to a single entity. We report a 48-year-old woman who repeatedly developed superficial mucocele in the oral mucosa. When she was admitted to our hospital, she had a tense vesicle on her lower lip. A skin biopsy was taken from the vesicle; a blister containing neutrophils and erythrocytes was present in the mucous epithelium.

- **Histological findings**: There was a dermal infiltrate comprising neutrophils, mononuclear lymphocytic cells, and eosinophils. Dilated salivary gland excretory ducts were seen in the lamina propria mucosae. Eosinophilic and amorphous materials, which were periodic acid-Schiff positive after digestion with diastase and alcian blue positive, were deposited in the blister.

Direct immunofluorescence was negative for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, IgA, C1q, C3, and C4. These histological findings led us to make a diagnosis of superficial mucoceles.

### Reconstruction of perioral defects post-Mohs micrographic surgery: A dermatological surgeon's approach [^11288Cok]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The perioral location holds significant functional, aesthetic, and social importance. Over 100 procedures have been documented for lip reconstruction, highlighting the challenges reconstructive surgeons encounter with such defects.

- **Objectives**: To outline the surgical reconstruction techniques for perioral defects following Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).

- **Methods**: The design and surgical techniques for reconstructing perioral defects post-MMS are detailed.

- **Results**: The outcomes of the described surgical techniques are demonstrated.

- **Conclusions**: We describe the nuances of reconstructive techniques found useful in repairing perioral defects post-MMS.

### Surgical correction of congenital lower lip sinuses in Van der Woude syndrome [^115K27Af]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2007). Low credibility.

To review the clinical outcome for patients with Van der Woude syndrome undergoing surgical excision of congenital lip sinuses, a retrospective chart review was conducted. The study was set within a multidisciplinary cleft-craniofacial team in a tertiary care hospital.

Seventeen patients with Van der Woude syndrome were identified from hospital records as having cleft lip and/or palate surgery performed at the University of Iowa, and six of these patients underwent simple surgical excision of lower lip sinuses.

- **Main outcome measures**: The incidence of postoperative complications and the number of surgeries required per patient for correction of the lower lip defect were assessed.

All six patients undergoing surgical excision of lip sinuses experienced postoperative mucocele formation, which required one or two additional surgeries for correction. No other complications were associated with the procedures, and no patient had a pre- or postoperative whistling deformity. The cosmetic outcome was deemed satisfactory in all cases.

Despite the overall improvement in cosmetic appearance following simple surgical excision of congenital lower lip sinuses, the high rate of mucocele formation and the need for repeat surgery have led to cautious preoperative counseling regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure.

### Oral mucoceles in children — analysis of 56 new cases [^112Mjxj7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Mucoceles are common cystic lesions of the oral mucosa. Extravasation mucoceles (EMs) are mainly found in the lower lip of young patients, whereas retention mucoceles (RMs) are usually located in the cheek or palate of older patients. This study was undertaken to more fully characterize the clinicopathologic features of mucoceles in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: The records of 56 pediatric patients with mucoceles were included in the study. Age, sex, history of trauma, intraoral site, size, and method of treatment were evaluated. Histopathologically, the lesions were classified as being EMs or RMs.

- **Results**: The age range was 1.5 to 16 years (mean age 11.2 years). Of the 56 patients, 24 (43%) were males and 32 (57%) were females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.33. A history of trauma was recorded in 32 (57%) patients of the lower lip. The intraoral sites were the lower lip (38 [68%]), tongue (10 [18%]), and floor of the mouth (8 [14%]). Of the 56 patients, 44 (79%) were EMs and 12 (21%) were ranulas. No RMs were found. Mucoceles ranged from 0.3 to 3.8 cm in diameter (mean 0.9 cm). The treatment of EMs was surgical excision. Cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and carbon dioxide laser were also used.

- **Conclusion**: In contrast to adults, where EM and RM types can be found, among children, all cases are of the EM type. The disparate site and age incidences of EMs and RMs of the oral mucosa suggest that these two types are not related and possibly have a different etiopathogenesis.

### Modified micromarsupialization as treatment of ranula in a pediatric patient [^114PUFKM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Ranulas are mucoceles located on the floor of the mouth. The main form of treatment for these lesions is surgical excision, but this can lead to complications such as hemorrhage, recurrence of the lesion, and damage to the lingual nerve. Thus, other therapeutic modalities are indicated, such as modified micromarsupialization. This is a simple technique not associated with recurrences and does not require new interventions in the postoperative period.

An 11-year-old nonwhite female child presented with a bubble-shaped lesion located on the floor of the mouth on the left side. The lesion exhibited exophytic growth, a sessile base, bluish coloration, measured about 4.0 cm in diameter, and had well-defined limits, well-delimited contours and borders, a smooth surface, and a softened consistency. Under the diagnostic hypothesis of the ranula, a modified micromarsupialization was performed. After 90 days of observation, complete regression and repair of the lesion were observed, without recurrence.

Modified micromarsupialization is a simple, low-cost therapeutic modality that is well-tolerated by patients, particularly pediatric ones. It is considered very effective in the treatment of lesions that are difficult to manage clinically, such as ranulas.

### An objective, quantitative assessment of flexible hyaluronic acid fillers in lip and perioral enhancement [^1136NoZZ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The ideal lip is difficult to define but is believed to include a good definition of the vermilion border and a balance of lower and upper lip fullness and projection. After lip enhancement, it is also important to maintain the naturalness of facial expressions.

In this study, the goal for lip augmentation was to use flexible XpresHAn technology dermal fillers (HA RK, HA RR, and HA RD) to achieve natural-looking fullness to the lips with appropriate projection of the vermilion and balanced proportions of both the lower and upper lip.

A reduction in lip wrinkles and significant improvement in lip texture (lip roughness) and lip color (redness) was observed. Interestingly, enhanced lip redness was a secondary effect of HA RK volumization in this study and has previously been associated with attractiveness in female faces. In addition, a significant increase in lip fullness for both upper and lower lips was observed. This included significant enhancement of lip projection, lip surface area and volume, lip and Cupid's bow height, and mouth width, as evidenced by 3D image analysis. Two examples of aesthetic improvement of the lip and perioral region are shown in Supplemental Digital Contents 1 and 2 (see Videos 1 and 2), which are videos of subject results from baseline to Week 8.

Interestingly, lip projection assessments showed that treatment with HA RK resulted in increased lip projection closer to ideal lip profiles: B-line projection of the upper lip at 3–4 mm and lower lip at 2–3 mm; E-line projection of the upper lip around 3–4 mm behind the ideal profile.

### Percutaneous treatment of ranulas: Ultrasound-guided drainage with salivary gland chemical ablation [^116aEd1v]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

A ranula is a mucus-filled salivary pseudocyst in the floor of the mouth. It arises from a salivary gland or duct after trauma or blockage. Ranulas most commonly originate from the sublingual gland, but they can also arise from the submandibular gland. A simple or intraoral ranula is located within the floor of the mouth, while a plunging or cervical ranula extends inferiorly to the mylohyoid muscle, often herniating through a defect in the muscle.

Ranulas are differentiated from other floor-of-mouth fluid collections based on clinical presentation and imaging. Symptoms include fluctuating degrees of swelling and pain, intermittent spontaneous leakage into the mouth, and difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, and chewing.

Historically, ranulas were surgically marsupialized or excised, but both practices resulted in high recurrence rates. Recommended surgical management includes the removal of the offending salivary gland combined with excision or drainage of the ranula. While these procedures are usually effective, they can result in complications. Surgical techniques continue to evolve to minimize these complications.

Alternative practices such as sclerotherapy have been introduced. Similar to early surgical techniques, sclerotherapy of the cyst without treatment of the offending gland can have high recurrence rates. In a recent report, only a 45% complete cure rate was achieved when the ranula sac alone was injected with ethanol. We hypothesized that ablating the offending salivary gland in addition to draining the ranula would improve the efficacy of treatment.

### Myomucosal lip island flap for reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects [^1165rxWQ]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects commonly includes mucosal advancement and wedge excision with primary closure, resulting in aesthetic complications such as lip flattening, shortening, and loss of the vermilion roll. The myomucosal lip island flap offers an alternative that preserves lower lip appearance and function.

- **Objective**: To describe the lateral myomucosal lip island flap and its indications for the reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective chart analysis of patients from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Participants included all consecutive patients of the senior author who had the myomucosal lip island flap employed in the lower lip from 2014, when the senior author began employing this technique, including 20 patients.

- **Patient demographics**: Surgical indications, surgical defect bridging distances, flap advancing distances, functional complications, and aesthetic outcomes were reported. IRB approval was obtained from St. Joseph Health Center for Clinical Research, and surgeries were performed at a private tertiary referral center — Skin Cancer and Reconstructive Surgery Center — by the senior author in a multispecialty practice.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Location and flaps utilized to reconstruct the defect were reported. Lateral advancing distance and overall bridging distance were measured. Functional complications, if any, were reported. Appearance rating after the first stage was assessed.

- **Results**: This case series included 20 patients with lower lip defects reconstructed with myomuco…

### Treatment of a ranula using an Er, Cr:YSGG laser [^117FjtG3]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A ranula is an extravasational cyst arising from the sublingual gland. The "cyst" cavity does not have an epithelial lining, which makes it notoriously difficult to eliminate. Usual treatment requires complete excision of the sublingual gland or exteriorizing the gland through the establishment of a secondary ductal structure by placing a long-term indwelling catheter or packing, all of which require patient compliance. Unroofing alone is often followed by recurrence due to resealing or the formation of a new roof. The accompanying scarring and damage to additional ducts may also result in recurrence.

Combining unroofing with a technique that prevents resealing of the remaining portion, scars the base of the ranula to eliminate residual glandular acini, and is more comfortable and non-interfering with the daily activity of the patient, is an acceptable treatment objective. The use of a water-based laser system to accomplish these goals appears to be a desirable and simple method.

### Patient reported outcome following the Skoog unilateral cleft lip repair among adults- a long-term cohort study and comparison to a non-cleft population [^116isP1i]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The study primarily aimed to compare satisfaction with lip appearance among adults treated for unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) with Skoog's primary lip repair procedure to those without clefts. The secondary aim was to determine whether satisfaction with lip appearance and the desire to change the lip/face appearance correlated with the number of secondary lip revisions performed.

- **Design**: Long-term follow-up.

- **Patients/settings**: All UCLP patients treated at the Uppsala University Hospital born between 1960 and 1987 (n = 109) were invited. At an average of 37 years following the primary lip repair, the participation rate was 76% (n = 83). A control group of adults without cleft (n = 67) completed the same study protocol for comparison.

- **Main outcome measures**: Satisfaction with appearance was measured with The Satisfaction with Appearance Questionnaire (SWA), and a modified version of the Body Cathexis Scale was used to assess the desire to change the lip and facial appearance.

UCLP patients were less satisfied with their lip, face, and overall appearance and reported a greater desire to change the appearance of their lips and face than non-cleft controls (p < 0.001). Dissatisfaction with lip appearance correlated to a greater willingness to change the appearance of the lip and face. No correlation was found between satisfaction with appearance and the number of previously performed secondary lip revisions.

Adults treated for UCLP are less satisfied with the appearance of their lips compared to the non-cleft population.

### The upper lip squamous cell carcinoma: The role of wedge excision [^1173uy6A]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Lip cancer is the most common malignant lesion of the oral cavity. Most tumors are presented in the lower lip as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), whereas the upper lip SCC is rare. Surgical excision with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for lip SCC. The author presents a patient with upper lip SCC treated by wedge surgical excision. Primary reconstruction of the large upper lip defects can be successfully used in appropriately selected patients.

### Myomucosal lip island flap for reconstruction of small to medium lower lip defects [^112c3jxJ]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Horizontal lip shortening and vermilion line effacement are the primary negative consequences of traditional reconstructive techniques of the lower lip. Raschke quantified that effect with cephalometric analysis. Vermilion line lip roll effacement is least tolerated in the central lip, whereas the lateral lip is often naturally flat and is not as affected by lip shortening techniques.

Tissue economy is the hallmark of island flaps. The lateral myomucosal island flap avoids additional muscle and mucosal tissue loss, achieving a high level of lip aesthetics. By design, the island flap distributes the defect across a much larger area, avoiding a localized impact of a tissue defect.

In 15 of the 20 patients, bilateral subtotal island flaps were used to redistribute the defect over a larger volume than a single island flap would provide. Five patients were reconstructed with a total island flap. For larger central defects, bilateral subtotal island flaps are preferred. For lateral defects, total island flaps are optimal. The small myomucosal bridge of the subtotal island flap does little to limit the deep flap release. Limiting the surface release of the subtotal flap is possible because of mucosal elasticity. This affords surface incision efficiency when used with another flap. Total island flaps can be used in all the cases where subtotal island flaps were used. In cases of inelastic mucosa, full mucosal incisions were required, creating a total island flap. The goal is to minimize surface incisions and utilize the pliability of the mucosa.

### Mucomuscular elastic flap for lower lip vermilion reconstruction: Experience in a series of cases in pediatric patients [^114g3HgU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The mucocutaneous line and the lip vermilion are important structures from an esthetic standpoint, but also in relation to the functionality of the mouth. In the literature, several types of flaps have been described for the repair of labial defects in adults. In this study, the authors analyze the results of surgical reconstruction of the lower lip in the pediatric population using unilateral or bilateral mucomuscular elastic flaps for labial reconstruction.

A retrospective analysis of 10 patients operated on between 2003 and 2018 at our institution was conducted. The following demographic and clinical data were collected: age, sex, diagnosis, type of flap, follow-up, results, and complications. The Strasser scale was chosen for assessment of postoperative photographic results. The average age was 8.1 years (range 3–18). The most frequent etiology was arteriovenous malformation, seen in 60% of cases. All cases corresponded to a defect of the lower lip. The average percentage of lip compromised was 44%, and the largest length of compromise observed was 60% of the lip. Follow-up was on average 2.4 years.

Esthetic results according to the Strasser method were as follows: 1 patient presented an excellent esthetic result, 5 good, 4 regular, and 0 poor. Considering the esthetic outcomes and low incidence of complications of the mucomuscular elastic flap, it is an acceptable and recommended technique of choice for lip vermilion reconstruction.

### Use of butane-isobutane refrigerant spray in the management of a mucocoele in a visually impaired child [^111JAhRD]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Mucocoeles are commonly observed lesions in children and young adults. Conventional management using a scalpel aims at enucleation, requiring psychological preparation of both the parent and the child due to the inherent fear and apprehension towards surgery. This is even more complex in children with visual impairment. Other management techniques include laser, cryotherapy, and micromarsupialisation. These strategies, being painless and tolerable, reduce the child's anxiety and are therefore more acceptable.

The basic technique of cryotherapy emphasizes rapid cooling, gradual thawing, and repeated freezing to ensure tissue destruction. We report a case of a 13-year-old boy with visual impairment, presenting with a mucocoele on the lower lip, which was managed using butane-isobutane refrigerant spray. This spray is otherwise routinely employed for pulp vitality testing. A single, 2-minute freeze/thaw cycle was used, and the healing was uneventful.

### Congenital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face: Case report and literature review [^113Dpe81]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The blood examination of this patient showed nothing unusual, as did the ultrasound and electromyography test results. The 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) examination reported a symmetrical skull without any external malformation or asymmetry; however, an abnormal, large left upper canine was observed, leading to the absence of the left upper lateral incisor and a dislocation of the left upper incisor (Fig. 2A). The teeth CT examination also reported these relatively larger left teeth, which confirmed the presence of macrodontism (Fig. 2B). Additionally, bone asymmetry of the maxillary alveolar ridge was evident (Fig. 2B). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed hyperplasia of the subcutaneous tissue of the left face. Based on the density and characteristics of the mass, it was suspected to be subcutaneous lipomatosis (Fig. 2C). Thus, an admitting diagnosis of subcutaneous tissue accumulation in the left maxillofacial region, with a probability of lipomatosis, was made.

- **Figure 2**: The preoperative image examinations of the patient include the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the CT scan of the skull, with an arrow pointing to the abnormal large left upper canine (A), the CT scan of the teeth (B), and the MRI examination (C).

The patient underwent surgical treatment involving subcutaneous lipectomy of the left maxillofacial lipomatosis on December 13, 2016. During the operation, large fat granules were observed under the patient's skin, and the buccal fat pad was very thick (Fig. 3A). The postoperative pathological analysis identified the mass as mature fat tissue without any abnormalities.

### The application of absolute ethanol in the treatment of mucocele of the glands of Blandin-Nuhn [^114SkZZ6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Mucoceles, which are mucus-filled cavities, are the most common benign, soft, painless masses in the oral cavity, except for irritation fibroma. These cystic lesions usually occur in the accessory salivary glands and range in color from deep blue to normal pink.

Trauma is the primary etiological factor for mucoceles involving the glands of Blandin–Nuhn. Histologically, these mucoceles are of the extravasation type, and their incidence seems prevalent next to mucoceles of the lower lip. Most patients are younger than 20 years, with a predominance among females. Clinically, the mucocele can present as an exophytic mass resembling a vascular lesion, pyogenic granuloma, polyp, or squamous papilloma. Rapid onset, variations in size, bluish color, and fluid-filled consistency assist in diagnosis. The proposed treatment is the surgical excision of the lesion, including all the Blandin–Nuhn glands, by completely unroofing the lesion along its periphery to prevent recurrence.

In search of a minimally invasive alternative to surgery, absolute ethanol was applied for the treatment of mucocele of the glands of Blandin–Nuhn in this study, achieving satisfactory results.

### Long-term results in the bilateral cleft lip repair by Mulliken's method [^111xPByq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of bilateral cleft lip repair using Mulliken's method. Anthropometric measurements were employed to assess the growth of the nose and upper lip post-operation, with comparisons made to 30 children without bilateral cleft lip.

- **Materials and methods**: Forty-four patients underwent simultaneous repair of bilateral cleft lip and nasal deformity with Mulliken's method from July 1997 to December 2007. Among these patients, 15 had bilateral complete cleft lip, 17 had bilateral incomplete cleft lip, and 12 had a mixed type of complete and incomplete bilateral cleft lip. To monitor post-operative growth of the lips and nose, six anthropometric measurements were analyzed: nasal tip protrusion, nasal width, columellar length, upper lip height, cutaneous lip height, and vermilion mucosa height.

- **Results**: In most patients, nasal length, nasal tip projection, columellar length, and upper lip shape were appropriate. Nasal tip protrusion, nasal width, upper lip height, and vermilion-mucosal height were within normal limits. However, columellar length and cutaneous lip height were relatively shorter than the average values of children without bilateral cleft lip.

- **Conclusions**: Mulliken's method can result in a natural lip and nasal shape, a harmonious Cupid's bow, appropriate nasal projection, and a natural philtrum.

### Reconstruction of the upper lip and philtrum [^116iUySm]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The procedure used to repair upper lip defects depends on various factors: size and location of the defect, the conditions of neighboring tissues, and the aetiology of the deformity. A single-stage procedure rarely gives a satisfactory cosmetic outcome in patients who have also lost the philtrum or a philtral crease. Here, we describe a single-step procedure for the reconstruction of the upper lip and philtrum that resulted in a good aesthetic appearance.

### Lower lip reconstruction with a hard palate mucoperiosteal graft [^1127DRXr]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of a lower lip deformity associated with leakage of saliva (drooling) and food spillage is challenging. To achieve complete closure of the mouth, the lips must have sufficient and uniform thickness. Here, we report a patient with a lower lip deformity secondary to the resection of a malignant tumor, in whom reconstruction was done using a hard palate mucoperiosteal graft. Perfect mouth closure without any leakage of saliva and a natural contour of the reconstructed lower lip were obtained, providing good aesthetic and functional results. This is the first report on the repair of a lower lip deformity with a hard palate mucoperiosteal graft. This type of graft seems to be a useful option for reconstructing lip deformities and can be widely applied to treat deformities caused by tumor resection, trauma, or cleft lip.

### Lip tenting: A simple technique for better lip enhancement [^111CF844]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Lip augmentation is practiced with increasing frequency by cosmetic practitioners using a variety of different filling substances. Often, the result is less than optimal, with a duckbill lip that only serves to discourage other patients from requesting lip enhancement. The authors present a simple technique to enhance or augment the lip by injecting almost vertically from the white roll, rather than injecting parallel to the lip contour. This fashion of lip enhancement is called "lip tenting".

It is a simple way to have optimal control over both shape and volume in enhancement, especially in patients with asymmetrical lips, lip pockets, and in those who require correction from previous suboptimal lip augmentations. Moreover, the aesthetic result obtained by this technique is a more natural appearance of the lip than is frequently achieved using conventional methods.

### Zovirax [^115wtW4v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Zovirax is only for topical use on herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions on the external aspects of the lips and face. Zovirax cream should not be applied on mucous membranes, including in the eye, inside the mouth, or nose.

- **Warnings and precautions**: There is a potential for irritation and contact sensitization when using Zovirax.

- **General**: Zovirax cream is intended only for use on the affected external areas of the lips and face in patients with herpes labialis. Its application to human mucous membranes is not recommended due to a lack of available data. The cream is exclusively for cutaneous use and should not be applied in the eye or inside the mouth or nose.

- **Contact sensitization**: Zovirax cream may cause irritation and contact sensitization, as noted in the adverse reactions section [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The effect of Zovirax cream has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

### Functional reconstruction of the oral cavity [^116fnN2U]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of the oral cavity is an intricate subject that reflects the complexity of the oral cavity itself. There is no perfect reconstruction. Presented here are the optimal choices for the various regions within the oral cavity. We are constantly seeking to improve these reconstructions in an effort to restore optimal function to patients unfortunate enough to require surgical excision of this most elaborate of anatomic structures.

### 3d stereophotogrammetry quantitative lip analysis [^116L31dD]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Reduction in lip volume is a stigma of the aging face. There are many lip augmentation techniques, but few studies analyze how these techniques change the three-dimensional structure of the lips. Furthermore, there is no consensus about whether the lip position should be standardized to either the lips closed or parted. The aim of this study was to obtain a three-dimensional quantitative analysis of the lips in adults to look for sexual dimorphism, and to compare whether more consistent measurements of the oral region can be obtained with the mouth open compared to it closed.

- **Methods**: Seventy young Caucasian volunteers underwent lip dimension analysis using 3D stereophotogrammetry with lips parted and closed. Parameters measured for consistency of results were linear distances (e.g. mouth width, total lip height, upper lip height), surface distances (e.g. upper vermilion), areas (e.g. vermilion upper and lower lip, total vermilion), and volumes (upper and lower lip volume, total lip volume). The analysis also compared lip dimensions between male and female subjects.

- **Results**: Consistent and reproducible results were seen with the lips closed compared with lips apart. All lip parameters (distances, areas, and volumes) were larger in men than in women. The following measurements had significant differences between males and females: mouth width, upper lip height median, upper white lip height median, upper white lip height lateral, lower vermilion surface distance, and area of vermilion (p < 0.05).

### Microcystic lymphatic malformation presenting as firm, skin-colored papules of the lips [^113KDLqy]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

A healthy 6‐year‐old white female with an unremarkable birth and developmental history presented with a crop of asymptomatic, skin-colored papules on the lower vermilion lip, and a small, solitary skin-colored papule on the upper vermilion lip (Figure 1). These lesions were present since birth and would intermittently enlarge and regress without resolution. There were no abnormalities of the labial mucosa or floor of the mouth.

The physical examination revealed a crop of six pink, skin-colored papules at the lower vermilion lip and a small, solitary papule at the upper vermilion lip.

A punch biopsy of a lower lip papule demonstrated increased thin-walled, ectatic endothelial spaces within the dermis (Figure 2A, B). Immunohistochemistry staining with CD31 and podoplanin (Figure 2C) confirmed the lymphatic origin of this lesion. The patient underwent MRI with and without contrast, which demonstrated subtle T2 hyperintensity with mild enhancement in the midline and left side of both the upper and lower lips. A diagnosis of microcystic lymphatic malformation was made, and the patient was treated with carbon dioxide laser (150 mJ, 1.5 W, 2 passes) and intralesional bleomycin in one visit. She returned 6 months later and was found to have significant improvement in the upper lip and moderate improvement in the lower lip. She was subsequently lost to follow-up.

### Aesthetic reconstruction of a superficial defect of the upper lip using a hairy preauricular free flap [^112QPvJj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The excision of a wide cutaneous lesion of the lateral upper lip poses a dilemma. Closure of a partial-thickness excision of the lip distorts lip contour. Aesthetically and functionally, the upper lip is an important part of the face. Its aesthetic reconstruction is difficult because symmetrical reconstruction of the free border is required. Gonzalez-Ulloa developed a concept of aesthetic units or subunits of the face. Scars that match the aesthetic unit or subunits are the least conspicuous. The upper lip is divided into medial and lateral aesthetic subunits. The lateral aesthetic subunit is bordered by the philtral column, nostril, alar base, and nasolabial crease.

Whether the defect is the result of trauma or tumor, the lip can be reconstructed using a variety of techniques with skin grafts or local flaps. Reconstruction of a beard-bearing area of the upper lip uses a hair-bearing, full-thickness scalp graft to migrate the follicle into the corium after preoperative epilation to induce the catagen phase of the hair cycle. For partial-thickness defects of the lip, a perialar crescent-shaped advancement flap, V-Y subcutaneously pedicled flap, nasolabial flap, and hatchet flap have been the main methods used for reconstruction. The hatchet flap and V-Y subcutaneously pedicled flaps are adaptable for a defect measuring up to 20 mm in diameter without causing a conspicuous distortion of the mouth. These local flaps can develop a trapdoor deformity and/or a hair shape distortion on the upper lip in male patients. Despite refinements in technique, the reconstructed upper lip often presents challenges.

### A rare case report of graft-versus-host disease-related cutaneous horns of the lower lip [^116tLrk7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Cutaneous horns can present as asymptomatic lesions and are benign in almost 2 out of 3 cases; however, the risk of underlying malignancy should not be underestimated. Standard treatment should consist of excision with 3–10 mm margins and histopathological examination, as lip shaves often leave the base of the lesion intact, leading to recurrence and inadequate pathologic examinations. At the time of writing, few cases could be found in the literature on cutaneous horns associated with GVHD, let alone their extended presence on the lower lip, as described in this case.

### Congenital upper lip sinus [^115jBnJT]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Congenital upper lip sinus (CULS) is an extremely rare anomaly. The aim of the study is to present a new case and compile the present knowledge of CULS to help foster a deeper understanding of this disease. A 9-year-old girl with a midline CULS, a prolonged maxillary labial frenulum, and a palatal epulis is presented.

Thirty-nine papers met the eligibility criteria, and 45 cases were included in the systematic review. CULS shows typical clinical and pathologic characteristics. It tends to occur at the midline region horizontally (n = 35; 78%) and the upper part of the white lip (n = 23; 51%) vertically. No ethnic predilection is found, but it tends to show a female predilection (n = 28; 62%). Twenty-six cases (58%) are symptomatic, and thirteen cases (29%) are accompanied by other maxillofacial defects. In all cases, the sinus was lined with stratified squamous epithelium.

The etiology remains unknown, but three theories have been put forward: the fusion theory, the merging theory, and the invagination theory. The authors believe that CULS shows homogeneity with cleft lip to some extent and may be a microform of it. Primary treatment is surgical excision, and the prognosis is favorable, with no complications or recurrence.

### Lip augmentation with Saypha LIPS lidocaine: A postmarket, prospective, open-label, randomized clinical study to evaluate its efficacy and short- and long-term safety [^1131jyKm]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Before and after treatment photographs of a 45-year-old female patient are presented. LFS scale grades were assessed by the investigator at various intervals: (A) Day 0: baseline upper lip grade 2, lower lip grade 2; (B) Week 6: upper lip grade 3, lower lip grade 3; (C) Month 6: upper lip grade 3, lower lip grade 3; (D) Month 12: upper lip grade 3, lower lip grade 3; and (E) Month 18: upper lip grade 3, lower lip grade 3. On Day 0, the injected volume for the upper lip was 0.9 mL and for the lower lip was 1.1 mL, using a 27-gauge 1/2-inch needle and bolus technique. At Week 3, during a touch-up treatment, the injected volume for the upper lip was 0.3 mL and for the lower lip was 0.1 mL, again using a 27-gauge 1/2-inch needle and bolus technique. LFS denotes the lip fullness scale.

- **Secondary effectiveness endpoints**: At Month 6, the LFS continued to exhibit an improvement of ≥ 1 grade compared to baseline in approximately 90% of patients for both lips. The proportion of responders was 89.1% (95% CI, 81.72–94.2) for the lower lip and 90.0% (95% CI, 82.81–94.9) for the upper lip. At Month 12, responders were approximately 70%, with a slightly higher number for the lower lip (70.0%, 95% CI, 60.52–78.37) compared to the upper lip (67.3%, 95% CI, 57.67–75.92). At Month 18, more than 40% of patients remained responders, with a higher percentage in the lower lip (46.4%, 95% CI, 36.80–56.12) than in the upper lip (39.1%, 95% CI, 29.93–48.86).

With photographs taken at the baseline visit and each follow-up, the independent photography reviewer also evaluated the LFS scores. The LFS responder rates resulting from the independent photography reviewer's assessment aligned with the findings.

### Lip augmentation with Saypha LIPS Lidocaine: A postmarket, prospective, open-label, randomized clinical study to evaluate its efficacy and short- and long-term safety [^1155bsUk]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). High credibility.

On Day 0, a total of 114 patients received SLL; at Week 3, 54 (47.4%) patients had a touch-up treatment.

- **Injection volume, technique, and equipment at baseline and week 3 touch-up treatment**:

The mean volume of implant gel applied at the initial treatment was approximately 0.8 mL per lip, and it was comparable for both the upper and lower lips (upper lip: 0.79 mL; lower lip: 0.8 mL). In general, for the touch-up treatment, a lower volume (≈0.5 mL/lip) was applied than for the initial treatment (upper lip: 0.51 mL; lower lip: 0.50 mL).

Furthermore, the volume injected depended on the size of the area to be corrected and the desired level of soft tissue augmentation. The mean volume of product applied in both lips at the initial treatment was 1.59 mL, whereas at the touch-up treatment the volume was lower (0.85 mL). Overall, the mean total volume of product applied in both lips during both treatments was approximately 2.0 mL (range: 0.6–4.0).

- **Injection techniques**:

Different injection techniques were employed based on the characteristics of the defect under correction and the investigator's preference. For both initial and touch-up treatments, the most frequent injection technique was the retrograde technique (upper lip: 67.5%, lower lip: 66.7%). In total, 32.5% of the patients were treated with the bolus technique for both the upper and lower lips.

- **Injection devices**:

A 27-gauge 1/2-inch needle, a 25-gauge × 50-mm cannula, or a 22-gauge × 70-mm cannula was utilized to inject the product. At the initial treatment, 27-gauge 1/2-inch needles were employed.

### The lip in lupus erythematosus [^111Wcqm8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lupus erythematosus (LE) frequently compromises the skin, lips, and oral mucosa. There is a large body of medical and dental literature about the cutaneous and mucosal lesions of LE, but very little has been written specifically about labial lupus. The lip has a peculiar anatomical and histological architecture, and LE lesions at this site may have some distinct features. This article reviews the existing data and adds some new concepts to the issue of labial lupus in all of its presentations, comparing such lesions to the well-established characterization of cutaneous LE (in acute, subacute, and chronic lesions) and highlighting some special clinical features that may enable a better diagnosis and differential diagnosis of lip diseases.

### Comparison of approaches for oral cavity cancer resection: Lip-split versus visor flap [^115XUrxG]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

To compare lip-split and visor flap approaches to the oral cavity in terms of morbidity, margins, and locoregional recurrence, a retrospective case series was conducted at the University of Washington, Seattle.

Seventy patients undergoing resection of advanced (T4) anterior oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma requiring fibula reconstruction were grouped according to the surgical access procedure performed, either lip-split (LS) or visor flap (VF). Data on surgical morbidity, margin status, and outcomes were compared.

Recurrence rates and positive margins were similar for both groups. Rates of postoperative fistulae were 6.8% for the LS group versus 0% for the VF group, and rates of oral incompetence were 14.6% for the LS group versus 6.9% for the VF group. Most fistulas (37.5%) occurred in irradiated patients, and neither group had any malunions.

In conclusion, there was no significant difference in pathological margins or rates of local recurrence when using either the lip-split or the visor approach. However, the lip-split approach has a higher rate of postoperative fistula formation than the visor flap approach; fistula formation may be associated with previous irradiation.

### Lip movement in patients with a history of unilateral cleft lip [^1178k1sJ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The influence of a repaired cleft lip on the stability of coordination between the upper and lower lips in nonspeech and speech tasks was investigated.

- **Design**: First, the effects of a secondary cleft lip repair were examined in three individuals. Second, a comparison was made between subjects with a history of repaired unilateral cleft lip and those with no history of cleft lip (controls). Lip coordination was measured using continuous estimates of relative phase.

- **Participants**: Subjects included nine children and adolescents with a primary unilateral cleft lip and palate repair, and four participants without cleft, matched for age across different age categories.

- **Results**: In general, the averaged relative phase angle (RPA) values were smaller than 180 degrees, indicating an upper lip lead for lip closure. Controls showed a tendency toward a more symmetric type of coordination (close to 180 degrees) compared with subjects with a repaired unilateral cleft lip. Controls also exhibited less variation in coordination between the lips. For more complex speech tasks, a general increase in variability of the RPA values for all subjects was observed, likely suggesting a more flexible type of coordination. Regarding the effect of a secondary cleft lip repair, only one of the three patients showed a clearly less symmetric and less stable type of coordination compared with pre-operation results.

- **Conclusions**: There appear to be differences in lip coordination between speakers without and those with a repaired unilateral cleft lip. Furthermore, it seems that the stability of lip coordination may be affected by the history of cleft lip repair.

### Diseases of the lips [^116Q9qQ4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Healthcare providers should be comfortable with both normal and pathological findings in the lips because the lips are highly visible and may display clinical manifestations of local, as well as systemic inflammatory, allergic, irritant, and neoplastic alterations. Fortunately, the lips are easily accessible. The evaluation should include a careful history and physical examination, including visual inspection and palpation of the lips, along with an examination of associated cervical, submandibular, and submental nodes. Pathologic and microscopic studies and a review of medications, allergies, and habits may further highlight possible etiologies.

Many lip conditions, including premalignant changes, are relatively easy to treat when the abnormalities are detected early. However, advanced disease and malignancies are challenging for both the patient and clinician. Treatment should focus on eliminating potential irritants or allergens and on the treatment of the primary dermatosis. This paper reviews physiological variants as well as pathological conditions of the lips.

### Lipoma on the lower lip [^115cWZud]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat tissue, frequently found in subcutaneous tissues; however, oral manifestations are relatively rare. This case illustrates the successful treatment of a lipoma through complete excision of the lesion. A 75-year-old female patient presented with a lesion in the right oral vestibule, where an excisional biopsy was performed. It is critical for professionals to diagnose this type of injury as soon as possible and treat it promptly to prevent it from reaching large proportions, which could result in aesthetic and functional sequelae for the patient.
