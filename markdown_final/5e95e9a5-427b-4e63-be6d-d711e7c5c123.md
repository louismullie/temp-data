## Question

Evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate pulsatile tinnitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and physical examination to classify pulsatility and identify red flags. Then, I should verify the role and timing of audiologic testing. Next, I will categorize the likely etiology into venous, arterial, or structural/metabolic to guide imaging. After that, I need to select the appropriate first-line imaging based on exam findings and reconcile guideline differences. Then, I will review advanced imaging and when to escalate to catheter angiography. I should also consider adjunctive tools like ear-canal sound measurements and labs for IIH. Finally, I will outline management pathways by etiology, follow-up, and special populations, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: pulsatile tinnitus is not a diagnosis but a symptom that warrants a structured workup because it often signals treatable vascular, neoplastic, or structural disease, and a thorough history and physical can identify the cause in more than 70% of cases when combined with targeted imaging, so I need to ensure I do not jump straight to imaging without clinical stratification [^115o4Ahw] [^115TXcEq].

> I will now examine the history elements I must capture: onset and tempo, laterality, exact rhythmicity with the heartbeat, positional modulation, associated otologic symptoms, neurologic deficits, visual symptoms, headache, and systemic features such as hypertension, obesity, hyperthyroidism, anemia, pregnancy, and medication or substance exposures including ototoxins, caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. I should also ask about prior trauma, neck manipulation, or Valsalva-like activities and screen for mood disturbance and sleep impact because these shape urgency and referral needs [^113ZRK5C] [^116DJv6c] [^116GiXry].

> Wait, let me verify the physical examination priorities: I need targeted otoscopy for retrotympanic vascular masses or middle ear disease, auscultation over the periauricular region, mastoid, orbit, and neck for bruits or venous hums, palpation of the mastoid and neck for transmitted pulsations, and focused cranial nerve and neurologic exams. I should also check blood pressure, perform a cardiovascular exam, and consider fundoscopy if IIH is suspected, because these findings immediately narrow the differential and the imaging pathway [^116GiXry] [^114RvRVj].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of audiometry: even when patients do not report hearing loss, guidelines recommend a prompt comprehensive audiologic evaluation for unilateral, persistent, or bothersome tinnitus, and this is especially important in pulsatile tinnitus to detect asymmetric sensorineural loss or conductive components that may coexist with vascular or structural disease. I need to ensure audiometry is obtained early in the pathway [^116F2enP] [^11212NDE].

> Next, I should review how to categorize the likely etiology because this drives imaging choice: venous causes include idiopathic intracranial hypertension, sigmoid sinus wall anomalies, jugular bulb variants, and venous sinus stenosis. Arterial causes include carotid stenosis, dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, persistent stapedial artery, and arteriovenous shunts such as dural AV fistulas. Structural/metabolic causes include paragangliomas, other skull base neoplasms, semicircular canal dehiscence, and systemic high-output states. I should double-check that my categorization aligns with contemporary reviews and series showing venous etiologies predominate and that shunting lesions, though less common, carry hemorrhagic risk [^115o4Ahw] [^114NkeQf] [^116XL5h4].

> I need to ensure I identify red flags that mandate urgent action: objective bruit, unilateral high-pitched "machinery" quality suggesting a shunt, cranial neuropathies, focal neurologic deficits, sudden severe headache suggesting dissection, papilledema or visual obscurations suggesting IIH, and known malignancy. These features should prompt expedited imaging and specialty referral rather than routine scheduling [^1179TRQ2] [^114DRvgj] [^114RvRVj].

> Now, regarding imaging, I initially thought to apply the ACR 2017 tinnitus criteria broadly, but wait, I should verify the most current guidance. The ACR 2023 update is the authoritative source and recommends obtaining combined parenchymal and vascular imaging for pulsatile tinnitus when no retrotympanic lesion is seen, typically MRI/MRA/MRV of the head or CTA/CTV of the head and neck, whereas if otoscopy reveals a retrotympanic vascular-appearing mass, temporal bone CT is first-line to characterize glomus tumors or vascular variants. I should correct my earlier inclination and align with the 2023 criteria rather than 2017 [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4].

> Let me consider MRI-first versus CT-first in undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus without a retrotympanic mass. MRI with contrast plus MRA and MRV avoids radiation, detects tumors, dural AV fistulas, venous sinus stenosis, and IIH-related signs, and is increasingly favored as initial screening, though CT angiography/venography can be a reasonable alternative when MRI is contraindicated or when bony detail is paramount. I should confirm that local expertise and patient factors guide the choice, and I must remember that a negative first study does not exclude disease, especially venous or shunting lesions [^116V9A83] [^115fh5BT] [^116mmKTr].

> But wait, what if I suspect a dural AV fistula or other shunt? I should double-check escalation criteria: objective bruit, high-pitched quality, inability to suppress with neck maneuvers, or concerning MRI/MRA findings should prompt catheter angiography because it remains the gold standard for shunt detection and characterization, and dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT can serve as a high-sensitivity screening tool for DAVF in selected centers. I need to ensure I do not delay appropriate endovascular consultation when risk is nontrivial [^114NkeQf] [^111B1UTV] [^113ebB3m].

> Next, I should review adjunctive diagnostic tools. Ear canal sound measurements can objectify pulsations and, in experienced hands, have shown high sensitivity for detecting DAVF and can help triage the need for DSA, while laboratory testing for IIH should include funduscopy and, when indicated, lumbar puncture with opening pressure. I need to check that these adjuncts complement, not replace, clinical examination and imaging [^117XdcnL] [^111U9F1M] [^114RvRVj].

> I will now examine management by etiology to ensure alignment with evidence: for venous causes such as IIH, weight loss, acetazolamide, and ophthalmology co-management are foundational, and for select venous sinus stenosis or diverticula, endovascular stenting or surgical repair can provide durable symptom relief. For arterial stenosis, medical optimization and revascularization when indicated are standard. For dural AV fistulas with cortical venous reflux, endovascular embolization is curative in the vast majority. For glomus tumors, surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery are effective. For idiopathic or non-remediable PT, sound therapy and CBT remain evidence-based palliative strategies. I should confirm that each pathway is individualized and risk-stratified [^114NkeQf] [^116qhSd1] [^11212NDE].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and special populations. Patients with normal initial workup may still have intermittent or positional venous turbulence, so I should provide reassurance, counsel on triggers, and arrange reassessment if symptoms evolve. In children and adolescents with obesity and headaches or visual symptoms, I need a high index of suspicion for IIH. In patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, pulsatile tinnitus is common and should prompt vascular imaging of the cervical arteries. I should double-check that my follow-up plan includes patient education and timely re-imaging if new red flags emerge [^114RvRVj] [^116UHnpQ] [^112ePkF2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall algorithm remains disciplined: start with meticulous history and physical to classify pulsatility and identify red flags, obtain early audiometry, categorize likely etiology into venous, arterial, or structural/metabolic, select imaging based on otoscopic findings and risk with MRI/MRA/MRV or CTA/CTV as appropriate, escalate to catheter angiography when shunt is suspected, and tailor therapy to the proven cause while integrating adjuncts like sound measurements and IIH labs. I should confirm that each branch point is supported by guideline-concordant evidence to minimize missed serious disease and avoid unnecessary testing [^11353XiU] [^115o4Ahw].

Pulsatile tinnitus requires a **structured, stepwise approach** [^115o4Ahw] to identify treatable causes and avoid missed serious disease [^114GeG41]. Begin with a **targeted history and exam** (including otoscopy, auscultation, and neurologic assessment) [^116GiXry] to classify PT as arterial, venous, or nonvascular, and obtain a **comprehensive audiologic evaluation** [^116F2enP]. Imaging is guided by exam and audiometry: temporal bone CT for retrotympanic lesions [^1129JRm4]; CTA/CTV or MRI/MRA/MRV for vascular causes [^11353XiU]; and DSA if a dural arteriovenous fistula is suspected [^111B1UTV]. Common etiologies include venous sinus stenosis, paraganglioma, carotid stenosis, and dural arteriovenous fistula [^114NkeQf]; management is etiology-specific, ranging from observation to endovascular or surgical intervention [^111wBZvf].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough **history and physical examination** are essential to classify PT and guide testing [^116mmKTr]:

- **Onset and duration**: Sudden onset suggests vascular events (e.g. dissection, thrombosis); chronic symptoms suggest benign or structural causes [^notfound].

- **Associated symptoms**: Headache, visual changes, cranial neuropathies, or neurologic deficits suggest intracranial pathology [^1178QAVj].

- **Otoscopic examination**: Identify retrotympanic masses (e.g. paraganglioma) or middle ear disease [^1129JRm4].

- **Auscultation**: Bruits over the skull base, orbit, or neck suggest arterial or venous flow abnormalities [^116GiXry].

- **Neurologic examination**: Cranial nerve deficits or focal findings indicate intracranial disease [^116GiXry].

---

## Audiologic evaluation

A **comprehensive audiologic assessment** is recommended for all patients with PT to identify hearing loss or middle ear pathology that may guide further evaluation [^112zctsg] [^115rUd3n].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging selection is guided by **clinical findings and suspected etiology**:

| **Clinical finding** | **Recommended imaging modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Retrotympanic mass on otoscopy | Temporal bone CT | Identifies paraganglioma, aberrant carotid artery, jugular bulb anomalies [^1129JRm4] |
| Suspected arterial or venous abnormality | CTA/CTV or MRI/MRA/MRV | Evaluates carotid stenosis, dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), venous sinus stenosis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) [^112WNEU5] |
| Suspected DAVF or complex vascular malformation | Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) | Gold standard for DAVF diagnosis and treatment planning [^114NkeQf] |

---

## Common etiologies and diagnostic features

PT has diverse causes; **common etiologies and their features** include:

- **Venous sinus stenosis**: Often associated with IIH; MRI/MRV shows venous narrowing [^116V9A83].

- **Paraganglioma**: Retrotympanic mass on otoscopy; temporal bone CT shows enhancing mass [^1129JRm4].

- **Carotid stenosis**: Bruit on auscultation; CTA/MRA shows stenosis [^112WNEU5].

- **DAVF**: Objective tinnitus, bruit, neurologic deficits; DSA confirms diagnosis [^111B1UTV].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Observation**: Benign venous hums or mild venous sinus stenosis without symptoms [^notfound].

- **Medical therapy**: Acetazolamide for IIH; anticoagulation for carotid dissection [^115G8bM5].

- **Endovascular therapy**: Stenting for venous sinus stenosis; embolization for DAVF or paraganglioma [^114NkeQf].

- **Surgical therapy**: Resection of paraganglioma or vascular lesions [^116qhSd1].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor symptom progression, treatment response, and complications. Patients should be educated about **red flags** (e.g. sudden hearing loss, neurologic deficits) that require urgent evaluation [^115KT5j4].

---

A structured approach to pulsatile tinnitus — history, exam, audiometry, and targeted imaging — enables accurate diagnosis and management. This stepwise strategy improves outcomes and reduces the risk of missed serious disease [^115o4Ahw].

### CT arteriography and venography in pulsatile tinnitus: preliminary results [^1134gHyD]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT), a common disorder, can be caused by a variety of otologic and vascular lesions. Various imaging modalities, including CT, MR imaging and angiography, and conventional angiography, have been used in the assessment of PT. Ideally, a single imaging study to evaluate for the largest variety of etiologies would be optimal. In our study, we examine the potential for CT arteriography and venography (CTA/V) in the evaluation of PT.

Methods

Sixteen patients with PT were prospectively evaluated by an otolaryngologist, had a normal otologic examination, and were referred for a CTA/V. All examinations were performed on a 16-section multidetector CT. The carotid bifurcations, internal carotid artery course, transverse and sigmoid sinuses, jugular foramen, internal jugular vein, sella turcica, and temporal bones were evaluated.

Results

Seven of the 16 patients had lesions on CTA/V that could account for their PT. Examples of pathologic conditions in the series included a significantly dominant venous system, a venous diverticulum with stricture, and a transverse sinus stenosis.

Conclusions

Preliminary findings indicate that CTA/V can be a valuable imaging tool in the assessment of PT. With this technique, arterial, venous, middle, and inner ear causes of PT can be excluded.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: a harbinger of a greater ill? [^115G8bM5]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon otologic symptom, which may be the presenting complaint of a potentially devastating pathology. Understanding this manifestation as a possible symptom of a significant vascular abnormality is crucial to guide management and treatment.

Methods and Results

We describe a 38-year-old woman with sudden-onset right-sided pulsatile tinnitus. A right extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection was diagnosed with MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and treated with anticoagulation. Follow-up MRI/MRA demonstrated complete resolution. Two months later, left-sided pulsatile tinnitus evolved. An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated left-sided extracranial ICA dissection. She was treated in a similar fashion and a repeat MRI/MRA demonstrated its resolution.

Conclusion

Spontaneous extracranial ICA dissection may present with pulsatile tinnitus as the only symptom in 4% to 50% of patients. Subsequent evolution of a contralateral dissection is even more uncommon. Generally, treatment of this phenomenon is conservative utilizing anticoagulation or aspirin; however, surgical intervention may be necessary.

### Evaluation and management of tinnitus: are there opportunities for improvement? [^115B6tRF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review current information about diagnosis and management of tinnitus aiming to identify opportunities for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, evidence-based approach that meets the needs of tinnitus sufferers.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE.

Review Methods

In total, 249 relevant published reports were reviewed. Pertinent keywords and MeSH terms identified reports via PubMed and EMBASE. Acknowledged experts were consulted on ways to improve tinnitus management.

Conclusions

There may be opportunities to improve evaluation and management of patients with tinnitus using modern modes of communication and a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.

Implications For Practice

Tinnitus can adversely affect quality of life while being time-consuming and costly to evaluate and manage. Based on both personal experience and the reports of others, patients with tinnitus who choose to see a physician primarily want to know two things: (1) that the tinnitus that is so distressing will not remain at the same level of severity forever and (2) that something can be done to help cope with the tinnitus that is so annoying. Recent advancements in internet communications, social media, information technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, holistic medical care, mind-body integrative health care, and multidisciplinary approaches in medical therapeutics may be possibly making new ways of meeting the needs of patients with tinnitus.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^1166KYbe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

There is no universally accepted guideline for neuroimaging, especially for headaches. A physician must exercise excellent clinical judgement in order to reduce the amount of unnecessary neuroimaging.

MRIs are notoriously overused. They do not use ionising radiation, which decreases risks of stochastic effects, have better soft tissue resolution, and the contrast agents have less risk of allergic reactions when compared with CTs.

In the case above, the positive finding of pulsatile tinnitus was an indication for use of MRI/MRA rather than starting with CT angiography. Moreover, the neurovascular surgeon requested an MRI/MRA, so regardless of the findings on CT the former would be needed regardless. Given the patient's physical exam findings and rather than subjecting the patient to two procedures, we decided to expedite the process by skipping the CT.

It is important to remember that patient disposition ought to be contingent on performing a comprehensive exam. Cultivating a conscientious style of medicine would lead towards improved clinical judgement and yield less expenditures and better quality of healthcare overall.

Learning points

A thorough history and physical is a necessity and should not be taken lightly.
Imaging modalities are purely adjunctive; they should not dictate treatment until after a thorough history and physical.
Decreasing unnecessary imaging will decrease both institutional and patient costs while concurrently increasing quality of healthcare.

### Toward a diagnostic imaging algorithm for undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus [^116mmKTr]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Decisions around the diagnostic evaluation for pulsatile tinnitus (PT) remain challenging. We describe the usage patterns and diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities and propose an evidence-based diagnostic approach for undifferentiated PT.

Study Design

Retrospective.

Setting

Single otology/neurotology clinic.

Subjects

Patients with PT presenting between 2009 and 2020.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic yield, and diagnostic accuracy.

Results

A total of 315 subjects met inclusion criteria (74% female, mean ± SD age = 52 ± 17 years). Subjects were divided into four cohorts based on exam findings: normal (n = 229), venous cohort (n = 34), arterial cohort (n = 16), and outer/middle ear pathology cohort (n = 40). In total, 53% of patients received a nonidiopathic diagnosis for PT. The most common identifiable cause was sigmoid sinus dehiscence (78%) in the venous cohort, carotid stenosis (36%) in the arterial cohort, and glomus tumor (56%) in the outer/middle ear pathology cohort. There was a higher diagnostic rate among patients with positive exam findings compared to those with unrevealing exams (p = 0.04). Imaging studies with the highest diagnostic yield were computed tomography (CT) venography (44%), formal angiography (42%), and magnetic resonance venography (40%); studies with the highest specificity were formal angiography (0.82), CT angiography (0.67), and CT venography (0.67). A diagnostic algorithm is proposed.

Conclusions

Reaching a diagnosis in patients with PT requires a systematic approach, taking into account both clinical and radiographic information. Physical examination is a key first step for differentiating patients into venous, arterial, and other cohorts to narrow down the likely pathology and determine which radiographic studies have the highest yield and accuracy.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111wXfVK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Data were queried from the US Registry for FMD, the design of which has been previously published. Enrollment in the Registry began in January 2009. Each participating center obtained approval from its respective institutional review board. Subjects provided informed consent for enrollment in the US Registry for FMD. Eligibility for enrollment was determined on the basis of identification of the characteristic appearance of FMD from vascular imaging in at least 1 vascular bed. Data for baseline demographic characteristics, past medical history, presenting signs/symptoms, physical exam, and vascular bed involvement for patients enrolled in the Registry as of December 23, 2020, who were aged ≥ 18 years at the time of enrollment were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t tests and Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests on continuous variables, and χ² and Fisher's exact tests on categorical variables to evaluate the differences between patients with and without PT. All P values reported were 2‐sided, with a significance level of 0.05 throughout. Statistically significant variables from the univariable analysis were further examined with multivariable logistic regression. Variables included in the final model were those consistently statistically significant (P < 0.05). In addition, because of potential clinical relevance, vertebral artery involvement was kept throughout model selections despite its statistical nonsignificance.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^112ePkF2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

PT is common among patients with FMD. These patients have higher rates of neurovascular symptoms and extracranial carotid artery involvement compared with those without PT. Additional studies are required to better understand the mechanisms of PT in FMD and to delineate optimal treatment strategies. These data also support investigation of the prevalence of FMD among people who present with PT and awareness of FMD as a cause of PT among providers who evaluate patients with this symptom.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^116UHnpQ]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Headache and pulsatile tinnitus in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are common; significant headache was reported in 67.5% of patients, with migraines the most frequent type (38% of patients in the US Registry; 28% in ARCADIA), and pulsatile tinnitus was reported as a presenting symptom in 32% of patients. For migraine in FMD, management may include lifestyle modification, preventive therapies, and abortive medications, but particular caution is advised in prescribing triptans, ergots, and other vasoconstrictive agents, especially in those with prior cervical artery dissection (CeAD) or SCAD in whom these agents may be contraindicated; consultation with audiology and otolaryngology may help evaluate hearing and other causes of pulsatile tinnitus.

Statement 3. Imaging studies — tinnitus: Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate the tinnitus, unless they have 1 or more of the following: tinnitus that localizes to 1 ear, pulsatile tinnitus, focal neurological abnormalities, or asymmetric hearing loss. Strong recommendation (against) based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid overuse of imaging in patients with a low likelihood of any significant benefit from the imaging. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies, with Level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid testing with low yield; avoid harms of unnecessary tests (radiation, contrast, cost); avoid test anxiety; avoid detecting subclinical, incidental findings. Risks, harms, costs: Slight chance of missed diagnosis; relatively high costs and limited access to certain types of imaging studies. Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments: The GDG made this a strong recommendation against, instead of a recommendation against, based on consensus regarding the importance of avoiding low-yield, expensive tests with potential adverse events in patients with tinnitus. Intentional vagueness: Specific imaging studies are specified in the supporting text, including computerized tomography (CT), computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Role of patient preferences: None. Policy level: Strong recommendation (against).

### Cerebrovascular pulsatile tinnitus: causes, treatments, and outcomes in 164 patients with neuroangiographic correlation [^114NkeQf]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can cause significant detriment to quality of life and may herald a life-threatening condition. Endovascular evaluation is the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of PT and facilitates treatment. However, no large study has determined the distribution of causes and treatment outcomes of PT evaluated endovascularly.

Methods

Consecutive patients evaluated at a multidisciplinary PT clinic from a single academic center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a suspected cerebrovascular etiology of PT based on clinical and/or non-invasive imaging, who were evaluated by endovascular techniques (arteriography, venography, manometry, and/or balloon test occlusion), were included in analysis. Baseline clinical features and treatment results by final etiology of PT were compared.

Results

Of 552 patients referred for PT evaluation, 164 patients (29.7%) who underwent endovascular evaluation of PT were included. Mean (± SD) age at first clinical evaluation was 54.3 ± 14.1 years (range 25–89 years); 111 patients (67.7%) were female. PT causes were 75.6% vascular and 24.4% non-vascular. Arteriovenous shunting lesions caused 20.7% of cases, venous etiologies 48.2%, and arterial etiologies 6.7%. Of patients with a shunting lesion treated with endovascular embolization, 96.9% had lasting significant improvement or resolution in PT. Endovascular stenting for venous sinus stenosis gave 84.6% of patients lasting improvement or resolution in PT. Arterial and non-vascular PT had fewer patients treated endovascularly and less improvement in PT symptoms.

Conclusion

PT with a suspected vascular cause is most often attributable to venous etiologies. PT caused by arteriovenous shunting or venous sinus stenosis may be effectively treated endovascularly.

Methods

Patients

Institutional approval (project number 15888) was obtained, and patient consent was waived. This was a retrospective case-controlled cross-sectional study undertaken in a tertiary referral centre. Consecutive patients undergoing MRI for the investigation of PT were identified from a search of a radiology imaging system database between 1/1/2012 to 31/07/2021. The Boolean search terms comprised the keywords tin* AND whoos* OR pulsa*. Patient demographics, laterality of PT, otoscopic findings, other audiovestibular symptoms or diagnoses, and other medical conditions were recorded. The mean air (0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, and 8 kHz) and bone conduction thresholds (0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz) were recorded from the pure tone audiogram performed at the shortest interval from the MRI study.

Exclusion criteria were bilateral tinnitus or insufficient details on lateralisation of PT, absent or degraded 3D HR T2w sequences, alternative causes of PT on imaging or medical assessment, abnormal otoscopy, air-bone gap on audiometry indicating conductive hearing loss, absent audiogram, and significant intracranial/ear pathology, trauma, or surgery. The study flowchart shown in Fig. 1 summarises the patient selection process.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113kWrQJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus — etiologies and evaluation emphasize vascular and neoplastic causes and specify when comprehensive workup is warranted. Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by intracranial hypertension, neoplasms, and vascular disorders and deserves special attention during the directed history and examination. Although most of these tumors are in the abdomen, 3% of nonadrenal paragangliomas are in the head and neck, and glomus tumors are rare but are the most common tumor of the middle ear. Patients with glomus tumors commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus (80%), whereas some present with hearing loss (60%), and tinnitus from these lesions is usually unilateral. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and fistulae can cause tinnitus, and serious consequences, including intracerebral hemorrhage, may occur without treatment. Although debated, a systematic review found vascular loop compression of the eighth cranial nerve was 80 times more common in patients with pulsatile tinnitus than those with nonpulsatile tinnitus. Less serious phenomena can also cause pulsatile tinnitus, including venous hums, aberrant carotid arteries, and carotid transmissions, many of which are unilateral; venous hums are caused by turbulent blood flow through the jugular bulb and can be associated with sigmoid sinus diverticulum or dehiscence, and carotid transmission can result from stenosis or transmitted heart murmurs. In light of these issues, the patient with pulsatile tinnitus should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out systemic cardiovascular or neurologic disease.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^112F1nwL]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external stimulus. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is perceived as a rhythmic sound at the rate of the cardiac cycle and is thought to represent 4–10% of tinnitus. Imaging is performed in order to identify the aetiology of PT, which may aid prognostication and target therapy. Evaluating the diagnostic yield of imaging in PT is challenging due to the heterogeneity of study designs, with rates of positive findings ranging from 44% to 91%. The most frequent abnormalities include paragangliomas, dural arteriovenous fistulae, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous anatomical variants and atheromatous disease. Both CT and MRI-based protocols with vascular imaging are recommended for the investigation of PT.

Previous authors have proposed that normal internal auditory meatus (IAM) vascular loops (VLs) may also be responsible for PT. Proposed mechanisms include neurovascular contact (NVC) and demyelination of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN8), reduced vascular perfusion and increased transmission of pulsatile sound from turbulent blood flow through the cerebrospinal fluid. The IAM internal auditory meatus vascular loop (IVLs) usually arise from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and may be seen as an anatomical variant in 10%. IVLs and CN8 NVC are optimally evaluated with three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo or gradient echo high-resolution (HR) T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequences, and this may be a justification for the inclusion of these sequences in PT MRI protocols.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114DRvgj]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Clinical diagnostic challenges and symptom profile — because symptoms are often nonspecific, diagnosis is challenging; in a statewide study, 31% of patients were seen in the emergency department for possible related symptoms in the 14 days preceding diagnosis. Evaluation for suspected cervical artery dissection should include a detailed symptom history, questions about minor trauma, and a detailed neurological examination. Common initial symptoms include facial pain, headache (< 65%), and neck pain (≈50%), and isolated pain without cerebral ischemia occurs in 8% to 12% of diagnosed cases. In carotid dissection, pain may be associated with a (partial) Horner syndrome (≈25%) and cranial nerve palsies (≈12%), and both carotid and vertebral dissection can be associated with pulsatile tinnitus (≈8%). A partial Horner syndrome with new or worsening headache may suggest a carotid dissection diagnosis, and headache characteristics are not specific but can rarely be acute and of thunderclap nature.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with tinnitus [^115rUd3n]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Tinnitus, a common symptom encountered in family medicine, is defined as the perception of noise in the absence of an acoustic stimulus outside of the body. Because tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease, its underlying cause must be determined to best help patients. Although tinnitus is often idiopathic, sensorineural hearing loss is the most common identified cause. It can also be caused by other otologic, vascular, neoplastic, neurologic, pharmacologic, dental, and psychological factors. More serious causes, such as Meniere disease or vestibular schwannoma, can be excluded during the evaluation. History and physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, and neurologic system guide subsequent evaluation. Almost all patients with tinnitus should undergo audiometry with tympanometry, and some patients require neuroimaging or assessment of vestibular function with electronystagmography. Supportive counseling should begin during the initial evaluation to help patients cope with tinnitus. Counseling may also improve the chances of successful subsequent treatment.

Pulsatile tinnitus — vascular and neoplastic causes and evaluation are detailed. "Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by intracranial hypertension, neoplasms, and vascular disorders" and "Paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, can cause tinnitus", with distribution noted as "3% of nonadrenal paragangliomas are in the head and neck". Presentation data include "Patients with glomus tumors commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus (80%), whereas some present with hearing loss (60%)", and "Tinnitus from these lesions is usually unilateral". Regarding vascular loops, a systematic review "showed that such loops were 80 times more common in patients with pulsatile tinnitus than those with nonpulsatile tinnitus". In light of these issues, "the patient with pulsatile tinnitus should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out systemic cardiovascular or neurologic disease", with examples including "hyperthyroidism, hypertriglyceridemia, vascular stenoses and aneurysms, and coronary artery disease".

### Occipital artery anastomosis to vertebral artery causing pulsatile tinnitus [^116NVjLr]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus can result from various vascular etiologies that cause transmission of pulsatile turbulent flow into the inner ear. Less commonly, non-vascular sources cause increased blood flow and transmission of sound perceived as tinnitus. Thorough clinical examination leads to appropriate imaging evaluation and therapeutic planning. Most pulsatile tinnitus results from expected mechanisms, such as dural arteriovenous fistula, jugular bulb dehiscence, or paraganglioma; however, the literature contains reports of numerous rare causes, particularly variant anatomic morphologies. We present the case of a novel cause of pulsatile tinnitus in which collateral vascular flow compensated for decreased normal intracranial cerebral arterial supply and might have caused catastrophic consequences if intervened upon after assumptions based on an incomplete evaluation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^112WNEU5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is abnormal perception of sound and has many subtypes. Clinical evaluation, audiometry, and otoscopy should be performed before ordering any imaging, as the choice of imaging will depend on various factors. Type of tinnitus (pulsatile or nonpulsatile) and otoscopy findings of a vascular retrotympanic lesion are key determinants to guide the choice of imaging studies. High-resolution CT temporal bone is an excellent tool to detect glomus tumors, abnormal course of vessels, and some other abnormalities when a vascular retrotympanic lesion is seen on otoscopy. CTA or a combination of MR and MRA/MRV are used to evaluate arterial or venous abnormalities like dural arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous malformation, carotid stenosis, dural sinus stenosis, and bony abnormalities like sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities in cases of pulsatile tinnitus without a vascular retrotympanic lesion. MR of the brain is excellent in detecting mass lesions such as vestibular schwannomas in cases of unilateral nonpulsatile tinnitus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Intraparotid superficial temporal artery arteriovenous malformation causing persistent pulsatile tinnitus [^111U7Wwp]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This article discusses the diagnosis, imaging workup, and management of a rare cause of pulsatile tinnitus: intraparotid arteriovenous malformation.

Patient

A single patient with a superficial temporal arteriovenous malformation diagnosed by carotid duplex causing pulsatile tinnitus that failed initial surgical management. Repeat imaging failed to identify a cause for the persistent tinnitus.

Intervention

Reoperation with a parotid approach based on physical exam findings.

Results

Removal of a more proximal arteriovenous malformation in the parotid gland resulted in long-term resolution of the patient's pulsatile tinnitus.

Conclusions

Physical examination is essential in the workup and management of pulsatile tinnitus. Imaging is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of pulsatile tinnitus but should not be solely relied upon.

### ESR essentials: diagnostic strategies in tinnitus-practice recommendations by the European society of head and neck radiology [^115fh5BT]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is common, with approximately 1/4 of the elderly population experiencing chronic tinnitus. While non-pulsatile tinnitus usually has no structural cause, pulsatile tinnitus is more likely to have an identifiable aetiology, and imaging plays a key role in the search for treatable and life-threatening causes. Since the characteristics of the tinnitus guide the diagnostic strategy, a detailed clinical assessment should always be performed before imaging is considered. In the setting of non-pulsatile tinnitus, imaging with MRI should only be performed if it is unilateral or asymmetric, or when it is associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or asymmetric hearing loss. In contrast, imaging investigation is always required in the presence of pulsatile tinnitus. Whilst there are specific clinical features in which temporal bone CT will be the initial imaging strategy for pulsatile tinnitus (e.g., retrotympanic mass or conductive hearing loss), most patients will require either CT or MRI with arterial and venous imaging. The clinical categorisation of pulsatile tinnitus as "arterial" or "venous" may guide the radiological search and help understand the significance of certain imaging findings (e.g., venous variants). Significant pathology (e.g., dural arteriovenous malformation) must be excluded in the context of objective pulsatile tinnitus and may require additional cross-sectional imaging; conventional angiography is now rarely indicated. KEY POINTS: In patients with unilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus, MRI should be performed to rule out retrocochlear disease. All patients with pulsatile tinnitus should be imaged and the clinical assessment guides the selection of the most appropriate imaging technique. If the first imaging study does not reveal the suspected cause of objective pulsatile tinnitus, additional imaging investigations should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy. When a vascular cause of pulsatile tinnitus has been established, attention must be focused on the patient's risk of hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, or blindness, as well as the risks of the available treatment options, in order to guide decision-making. Herein we review our approach to management of the vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus and provide a literature review while highlighting gaps in our current knowledge and evidence basis.

Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy. Observations. An underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus can be identified in more than 70% of patients with a thorough evaluation. We advocate categorizing the myriad causes of pulsatile tinnitus into structural, metabolic, and vascular groups. Structural causes of pulsatile tinnitus include neoplasms and temporal bone pathologic abnormalities. Metabolic causes of pulsatile tinnitus include ototoxic medications and systemic causes of high cardiac output.

Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. This categorization facilitates a practical evaluation, referral, and treatment pattern. Conclusions and Relevance Categorizing the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus ensures that dangerous causes of pulsatile tinnitus are not missed, and that patients receive the appropriate care from the proper specialist when needed.

### Detecting causes of pulsatile tinnitus on CT arteriography-venography: a pictorial review [^1155TBgH]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can be a mild or debilitating symptom. Following clinical examination and otoscopy, when the underlying aetiology is not apparent, radiological imaging can be used to evaluate further. CT arteriography-venography (CT A-V) of the head and neck has recently been introduced as a single 'one catch' modality for identifying the many causes of PT including those which are treatable and potentially serious whilst also providing reassurance through negative studies or studies with benign findings. CT A-V is performed as a single phase study allowing both arterial and venous assessment, hence limiting radiation exposure. Additional multiplanar reformats and bone reconstructions are desirable. Understanding the limitations of CT A-V is also required, with an awareness of the scenarios where other imaging modalities should be considered. The causes of PT can be divided into systemic and non-systemic categories. Non-systemic aetiologies in the head and neck should be carefully reviewed on CT A-V and include a variety of vascular causes (arteriovenous malformations/fistulas, venous or arterial aetiologies) and non-vascular causes (tumours and bony dysplasias). Venous causes (dominant, aberrant, stenosed or thrombosed venous vessels) are more common than arterial aetiologies (aberrant or stenosed internal carotid artery, aneurysms or a persistent stapedial artery). Glomus tumours that are not visible on otoscopy and osseous pathologies such as bony dehiscence and otospongiosis should also be excluded. Careful assessment of all the potential vascular and non-vascular causes should be reviewed in a systematic approach, with correlation made with the clinical history. A structured reporting template for the reporting radiologist is provided in this review to ensure all the potential causes of PT are considered on a CT A-V study. This will help in providing a comprehensive radiological evaluation, hence justifying the radiation dose and for patient assessment and prognostication.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^115z2BC2]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus — referrals: Based on the case history, audiological evaluation, and patient needs, the audiologist should develop a follow-up action plan to include specialized audiological testing. Patients may be referred to other appropriate health care providers or services as needed but should be evaluated urgently by an otolaryngology provider or referred to the emergency department if they report sudden onset hearing loss with or without accompanying sudden onset tinnitus. If a medical risk factor is identified or if tinnitus is unilateral or pulsatile, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngology provider, although not all patients with tinnitus require an evaluation by an otolaryngology provider. The otolaryngology provider will obtain a thorough case history, examine the ear (using an otoscope or microscope), and might perform auxiliary examinations to screen hearing status, such as tuning fork tests. Patients who report risk factors for a behavioral/mental health disorder should be referred to a behavioral/mental health provider, and patients who report suicidal ideation should be referred immediately to a behavioral/mental health provider or an emergency department in the absence of available behavioral/mental health support. A non-urgent referral to a dental provider, an orofacial provider, or both is suggested for patients with TMD, and a non-urgent referral to a physical therapist or physiotherapist is suggested for patients with neck complaints or a whiplash-like trauma preceding the onset of tinnitus.

### Sigmoid sinus diverticulum: a new surgical approach to the correction of pulsatile tinnitus [^116qhSd1]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus represents a bothersome symptom not infrequently encountered in an otology practice. Tinnitus can be the harbinger of identifiable middle or inner ear abnormality; but more frequently, tinnitus stands alone as a subjective symptom with no easy treatment. When a patient complains of tinnitus that is pulsatile in nature, a thorough workup is indicated to rule out vascular abnormality. We report of a new diagnostic finding and method of surgical correction for select patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Setting

Tertiary care, academic referral center.

Patients

Among patients seen for complaints of unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus, five were identified with diverticula of the sigmoid sinus. All patients had normal in-office otoscopic, tympanometric, and audiometric evaluations. Patients with paragangliomas or benign intracranial hypertension were excluded. Auscultation of the pinna or mastoid revealed an audible bruit in most patients. All patients underwent computed tomographic angiography of the temporal bone. In all cases, this finding was on the side coincident with the tinnitus.

Intervention

Three of five patients underwent transmastoid reconstruction of the sigmoid sinus.

Main Outcome Measure

Patients were evaluated clinically for presence or absence of pulsatile tinnitus after reconstructive surgery.

Results

All patients electing surgical reconstruction had immediate and lasting resolution of the tinnitus.

Conclusion

Surgical reconstruction can provide lasting symptom relief for patients with pulsatile tinnitus and computed tomographic evidence of a sigmoid sinus diverticulum.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaTinnitus [^115Y4HDL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. It is a common symptom that can be related to hearing loss and other benign causes. However, tinnitus may be disabling and can be the only symptom in a patient with a central nervous system process disorder. History and physical examination are crucial first steps to determine the need for imaging. CT and MRI are useful in the setting of pulsatile tinnitus to evaluate for an underlying vascular anomaly or abnormality. If there is concomitant asymmetric hearing loss, neurologic deficit, or head trauma, imaging should be guided by those respective ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® documents, rather than the presence of tinnitus. Imaging is not usually appropriate in the evaluation of subjective, nonpulsatile tinnitus that does not localize to one ear. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^1124owhq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Referral — entry points, triage, and guidance — Patients with tinnitus might enter the health care system from diverse points of service. Some patients initially seek services from primary care providers, although others might seek care at an emergency department, walk-in/urgent care clinic, or specialty care provider, and patients reporting bothersome tinnitus should be triaged for appropriate referral, with triage, the referral plan of tinnitus care, or both a collaboration between the health care provider and the patient. The National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) created referral recommendations for any health care provider to use when evaluating patients with tinnitus, and the NCRAR referral recommendations are part of the PTM protocol referred to as Level 1 Referral and are applicable regardless of the health care system point of entry; refer to the Algorithm for more information on referral and triage.

### Electrocochleography in chronic tinnitus: correlations with audiological profiles and psychological distress [^111No4JE]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to explore the electrophysiological characteristics of patients with chronic tinnitus through electrocochleography (ECochG) findings and determine if these findings correlate with specific audiological patterns that could differentiate tinnitus patients from those without this condition.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis of medical records from patients who visited a tinnitus clinic at a tertiary university hospital between March 2020 and December 2023 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were non-pulsatile subjective tinnitus lasting over three months, and ECochG performed at initial evaluation. Audiological assessments and ECochG results were analyzed, with the SP/AP ratio being a focal point.

Results

Among 256 patients, an elevated SP/AP ratio was observed in 37.5% of patients. No significant difference in ECochG outcomes was noted based on tinnitus laterality. Patients with an elevated SP/AP ratio reported more sleep disturbances, higher depression scores, attention problems, and aural fullness. These patients also exhibited lower loudness discomfort levels and low-frequency hearing losses. Significant correlations were found between elevated SP/AP ratios and DPOAE responses.

Conclusions

The findings highlight the SP/AP ratio in ECochG as a valuable biomarker for assessing clinical and psychological aspects of tinnitus, indicating its potential utility in tailoring treatment strategies. Elevated SP/AP ratios were associated with sleep disturbances, depression, attention problems, aural fullness, hyperacusis, and low-frequency hearing loss, suggesting a complex interplay between cochlear pathology and tinnitus perception. This study underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of ECochG results in the clinical evaluation of tinnitus, potentially guiding more personalized management approaches.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^114RvRVj]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) — risk, symptoms, evaluation, and vigilance in youth with obesity: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (previously known as pseudotumor cerebri) is a neurologic condition with serious long-term morbidity. It occurs most often in females of childbearing age, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. In a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of IIH among adult females aged 15 to 44 years with obesity was 3.5-fold higher than that of all females in that age group. Typical symptoms are persistent headaches, pulsatile synchronous tinnitus, and visual changes or loss, although the history can be variable. Physical examination includes a fundoscopy for papilledema and a thorough neurologic evaluation for cranial nerve deficits such as sixth nerve palsy. The serious sequelae for IIH is vision loss. Thus, a review of system should be obtained to evaluate any child with obesity who has significant or progressive headaches. There should also be a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset headaches and significant weight gain (5% to 15% of body weight), particularly when it occurs in the prior 12 to 18 months. Initial evaluation for IIH involves conducting comprehensive evaluation by the neurologist and ophthalmologist or at an integrated IIH clinic. Consensus recommendation: Maintain a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset or progressive headaches in the context of significant weight gain, especially for females.

Conclusion

BHAG are an underrecognized entity and are prevalent in patients with PT. The presence of BHAG is strongly associated with IIH, therefore, these lesions are an important neuroimaging finding which should prompt expedited clinical workup. Future work is needed to clarify the mechanistic relationship underlying this association.

### A compartment-based approach for the imaging evaluation of tinnitus [^112uTyZB]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus affects 10% of the US general population and is a common indication for imaging studies. We describe a sequential compartment-based diagnostic approach, which simplifies the interpretation of imaging studies in patients with tinnitus. The choice of the initial imaging technique depends on the type of tinnitus, associated symptoms, and examination findings. Familiarity with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tinnitus and the imaging findings is a prerequisite for a tailored diagnostic approach by the radiologist.

### Imaging of tinnitus [^115WgiYw]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

From a radiologic workup perspective, tinnitus is classified into pulsatile, which can be objective, and nonpulsatile, which is typically subjective. There is considerable discrepancy within the literature regarding the percentage of positive findings in patients with pulsatile tinnitus. The authors discuss the overlap in the radiographic findings detected in association with tinnitus in both asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients and the importance for imaging to detect treatable causes. They discuss imaging related to diagnosis and treatment and provide an imaging workup algorithm.

### Pulsatile tinnitus [^112rVkkS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon otologic symptom, which often presents a diagnostic and management dilemma to the otolaryngologist. This symptom always deserves a thorough evaluation to avoid disastrous consequences from potentially life-threatening associated pathology. In most pulsatile tinnitus patients a treatable underlying etiology can be identified.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^1112D4ci]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Modern medicine often leaves the history and physical by the wayside. Physicians instead skip directly to diagnostic modalities like MRI and angiography. In this case report, we discuss a patient who presented with migraine symptoms. Auscultation revealed signs of pulsatile tinnitus. Further imaging concluded that it was secondary to a type I dural arteriovenous fistula. Thanks to a proper and thorough history and physical, the patient was streamlined into an accurate and efficient work-up leading to symptomatic relief and quality of life improvement. Imaging is a powerful adjunctive technique in modern medicine, but physicians must not rely on machines to diagnose their patients. If this trend continues, it will have a tremendous negative impact on the cost and calibre of healthcare. Our hope is that this case will spread awareness in the medical community, urging physicians to use the lost art of a history and physical.

### Metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as unilateral pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^116HJzrF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare symptom, yet it may herald life-threatening pathology in the absence of other symptoms or signs. Pulsatile tinnitus tends to imply a vascular cause, but metastatic disease also can present in this way. Clinicians should therefore adopt a specific diagnostic algorithm for pulsatile tinnitus and always consider the possibility of metastatic disease. A history of malignant disease and new cranial nerve palsies should raise clinical suspicion for skull base metastases. We describe the case of a 63-year-old woman presenting with unilateral subjective pulsatile tinnitus and a middle ear mass visible on otoscopy. Her background included the diagnosis of idiopathic unilateral vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsies 4 years previously, with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Repeat MRI and computed tomography imaging were consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. This case raises important questions about imaging protocols and the role of serial scanning in patients at high risk of metastatic disease.

### The incidence of cranial arteriovenous shunts in patients with pulsatile tinnitus: a prospective observational study [^113ebB3m]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Finding the underlying cause for pulsatile tinnitus can be challenging. We aimed to determine the incidence of arteriovenous shunts, i.e., arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs), in patients referred for catheter angiography (digital subtraction angiography [DSA]). Furthermore, we assessed which clinical features were predictive for the presence of such a lesion.

Study Design and Methods

Fifty-one patients with pulsatile tinnitus, who were referred to us for DSA to exclude an arteriovenous shunt, were enrolled, prospectively.

Main Outcome Measures

DSA determined the presence of a dAVF or AVM. Clinical characteristics were recorded systematically and all patients underwent a physical examination.

Results

Fifty patients were included in the final analyses. While no AVMs were found, a dAVF was found in 12 cases (24%). Three of these demonstrated cortical venous reflux, thus requiring treatment due to the risk of hemorrhage. In three cases (6%), DSA demonstrated a non-arteriovenous-shunt abnormality, likely causing the tinnitus. The odds of having a dAVF were significantly raised by unilaterality, objective bruit, and the ability to influence the tinnitus with compression. Unilaterality even had a negative predictive value of 1 and, if used as selection criterion, would have raised dAVF prevalence from 24 to 32%.

Conclusion

In a tertiary care setting, the prevalence of dAVFs in patients with pulsatile tinnitus is not negligible. Thus, patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus should be offered dynamic vascular imaging to rule out a dAVF. Especially, since some of these patients are at risk of intracranial hemorrhage and treatment options exist.

Module A: Initial evaluation of tinnitus — adult patients presenting with a complaint or seeking care undergo history and physical examination, then assessment of symptom duration; if the patient does not have sounds that last for at least five minutes, this is classified as transient ear noise with no need for further evaluation; if yes, assess for red flags and, when any red flags are identified, refer the patient for appropriate specialty urgent/emergent evaluation and continue referral to appropriate care until red flags are resolved; once red flags have been addressed, refer to audiology as appropriate for evaluation of hearing and tinnitus impact, noting that if the patient has already been referred to audiology and does not indicate a need for care, then referral to audiology is unnecessary.

### Diagnostic approach to tinnitus [^115cUJuX]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is a common disorder with many possible causes. Most cases of tinnitus are subjective, but occasionally the tinnitus can be heard by an examiner. Otologic problems, especially hearing loss, are the most common causes of subjective tinnitus. Common causes of conductive hearing loss include external ear infection, cerumen impaction, and middle ear effusion. Sensorineural hearing loss may be caused by exposure to excessive loud noise, presbycusis, ototoxic medications, or Meniere's disease. Unilateral hearing loss plus tinnitus should increase suspicion for acoustic neuroma. Subjective tinnitus also may be caused by neurologic, metabolic, or psychogenic disorders. Objective tinnitus usually is caused by vascular abnormalities of the carotid artery or jugular venous systems. Initial evaluation of tinnitus should include a thorough history, head and neck examination, and audiometric testing to identify an underlying etiology. Unilateral or pulsatile tinnitus may be caused by more serious pathology and typically merits specialized audiometric testing and radiologic studies. In patients who are discomforted by tinnitus and have no remediable cause, auditory masking may provide some relief.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: a phase 1 / 2 study [^112ubYnf]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Phase 1/2 Study Part B: Safety and Exploratory Efficacy Cohort

Part B objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OTO-313 (primary), assess plasma pharmacokinetics of gacyclidine (secondary), and assess preliminary efficacy of OTO-313 measured by change from Baseline visit in tinnitus functional index (TFI) (secondary). Exploratory objectives were to evaluate efficacy of OTO-313 on tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance using patient reported numeric rating scales (NRS) and on tinnitus global status with patient global impression of change.

Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years, were consistently aware of their tinnitus throughout much of the waking day, had tinnitus that was likely of cochlear origin (e.g. associated with acute hearing loss from noise trauma, barotrauma, blast trauma, middle ear surgery, age-related hearing loss, resolved otitis media, ototoxic drug exposure) and had an onset of tinnitus of 1 to 6 months before signing informed consent. Exclusion criteria included pulsatile tinnitus, tinnitus resulting from traumatic head or neck injury, active middle ear disease including Menière's disease, abnormality or perforation of the tympanic membrane, any ongoing therapy known to be potentially tinnitus-inducing, severe or untreated depression or anxiety, and systemic or intratympanic steroids within 6 weeks before screening. Stable previous treatments (≥ 1 month before screening) of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, over-the-counter supplements or medications for tinnitus, or use of hearing aids, noise generators, sound therapy devices, and any behavioral therapy for tinnitus were allowed.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a first symptom of essential thrombocythemia [^116mYCXo]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of sound inside the head and is a common symptom encountered daily by otorhinolaryngologists. Pulsatile tinnitus sufferers hear rhythmical noise at the same rate as a heartbeat and can present a diagnostic challenge. In this report, we present a 32-year-old patient with pulsatile tinnitus that led to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The symptom of pulsatile tinnitus allowed an early diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia and a more favorable prognosis. The case demonstrates the importance of blood tests for all patients who present with pulsatile tinnitus of unknown origin.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus [^114GeG41]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is a common complaint that approximately three-fourths of adults will experience at some point in their life. While for many it is a mild nuisance, for some it can be debilitating, affecting cognition and quality of life, increasing stress, and leading to anxiety, depression, and in severe circumstances even suicide. Pulsatile tinnitus refers to the perception of a heartbeat-like sound without external stimulus. Although less common than nonpulsatile tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus raises concern for underlying disease that can have a high risk of causing the patient harm if undiagnosed, and most of these patients will have positive findings at imaging. While these findings are often subtle, identifying them can have a meaningful impact on the patient's quality of life. The literature on pulsatile tinnitus is changing rapidly with improved imaging techniques and novel minimally invasive treatment options. A careful history and physical examination together with appropriate imaging are therefore critical in identifying the underlying cause. With emerging surgical, endovascular, and supportive technologies, the vast majority of patients with bothersome pulsatile tinnitus can be cured or have their symptoms ameliorated. The objective of this narrative review is to present a comprehensive analysis of the currently available literature on pulsatile tinnitus, with a focus on understanding its pathophysiologic mechanisms, diagnostic pathways, imaging findings, and the spectrum of available management strategies and ultimately to propose a structured framework that aids radiologists as well as clinicians in identifying an underlying diagnosis and guiding management of these patients. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1153WrAR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

### Noninvasive treatment of venous pulsatile tinnitus with an internal jugular vein compression collar [^113uNuZ8]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mild internal jugular (IJV) compression via an FDA approved compression collar for symptomatic treatment of venous pulsatile tinnitus.

Methods

This is a prospective study that recruited 20 adult patients with venous pulsatile tinnitus. Participants completed the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), were fitted with the collar, and rated symptom intensity on a 10-point tinnitus intensity scale before and during collar use. Once weekly for 4weeks, they answered a survey quantifying days used, average tinnitus intensity before and after wearing the collar each day of use, and any safety concerns. Lastly, they completed an exit interview. The primary outcome was symptomatic relief, with secondary outcomes of safety, effect of treatment setting, effect of time, and quality of life assessed via nonparametric testing.

Results

18 participants completed the study, and 276 paired daily before use/during use intensity scores were submitted. The median symptom intensity without the collar was 6 (IQR 4, 7), whereas with the collar it was 3 (IQR 2, 5), for a median symptomatic relief of 50%. The collar had a significant effect in reducing symptom intensity (p < 0.0001) and burden of illness via the THI (p < 0.0001). There was no effect of setting, frequency, or time on symptomatic relief with the collar. There were no adverse safety events reported aside from minor discomfort upon initial application.

Conclusions

Venous compression collars offer acute symptom relief for patients with venous pulsatile tinnitus. Further study is needed to assess safety and efficacy of longitudinal use.

### Diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus: a review of 251 patients [^116XL5h4]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the underlying etiologies, presenting characteristics, and diagnostic workup of patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT).

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

All patients who received a diagnostic workup for PT from January 01, 2015 and May 31, 2020.

Main Outcome Measure

Diagnostic rate of imaging studies.

Results

Among 251 patients with PT, the most common etiologies included neoplasms (16%), arteriopathies (14%), venopathies (8.5%), middle/inner ear pathology (9.0%), or idiopathic (50%). Patients with identifiable etiologies of PT more often had hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination. Only 18.5% of patients without those characteristics had an identifiable etiology of PT. The most commonly ordered diagnostic studies were magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (n = 146), MR angiography (MRA) (n = 105), CT angiography (CTA) (n = 84), computed tomography (CT) without contrast (n = 76), and MR Venogram (MRV) (n = 62). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and CT without contrast preferentially identified patients with nonvascular etiologies of PT, while MRA and CTA identified patients with vascular etiologies of PT. MRV did not demonstrate high diagnostic rate for either type of PT. No difference in diagnostic rate was found between MR-based or CT-based imaging.

Conclusions

Patients who lack a history of hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination are less likely to have an identifiable cause for PT. In cases where a specific etiology was identified, MR-based imaging (MRI with contrast and MRA) or CT-based imaging (CT without contrast and CTA) were equally efficacious in identifying that etiology. MR-based imaging is preferred for neoplasms, while CT-based imaging is preferred for semicircular canal dehiscence.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as the primary symptom in IIH: a distinct clinical entity [^113aiVeU]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) who present with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) to the Otolaryngology service with those with IIH who present with more classical symptoms to non-otolaryngologists.

Methods

Chart query confirmed all patients diagnosed with PT and IIH (by modified Friedman criteria). Cohort 1: Those who presented with PT as their chief complaint were evaluated by one of the otology team members, referred to neuro-ophthalmology, and subsequently diagnosed with IIH. Cohort 2: Those who presented initially with headaches and/or visual abnormalities to a nonotolaryngologist where they were diagnosed with IIH syndrome and subsequently referred to and evaluated by an otologist for associated PT. Demographic data recorded included age, sex, and BMI. Analyzed symptoms included the presence of headache and visual disturbances. Clinical findings such as papilledema and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurements and imaging findings were also examined.

Results

Forty (20 in each group) consecutive patients were included for analysis. All were female. Patients in Cohort 1 were statistically less likely to have visual symptoms (25% vs. 90%, p < 0.001) or papilledema (40% vs. 85%, p < 0.003). There was no difference in headache prevalence, though those in Cohort 1 were more likely to be mild. CSF opening pressure was lower in patients presenting with PT (29.2 ± 6.39 vs. 35.1 ± 10.8, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Patients with IIH presenting with PT are a distinct entity from those with classic IIH. Clinicians must be aware so that appropriate management can be initiated.

### Non-invasive imaging modalities for diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus: a comprehensive review and recommended imaging algorithm [^116V9A83]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a challenging diagnostic condition arising from various vascular, neoplastic, and systemic disorders. Non-invasive imaging is essential for identifying underlying causes while minimizing risks of invasive diagnostic angiography. Although no consensus exists on the primary imaging modality for PT and currently CT, ultrasound, and MRI are used in the diagnostic pathway, MRI is increasingly preferred as the first-line screening test for its diagnostic efficacy and safety. MRI protocols such as time-of-flight, magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and arterial spin labeling can identify serious causes, including vascular shunting lesions, venous sinus stenosis, and tumors. In this narrative review of the current literature we discuss the benefits and limitations of various non-invasive imaging modalities in identifying the characteristic imaging findings of the most common causes of PT and also provide an algorithm that clinicians can use to guide the imaging evaluation.

Objective

Patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) are often referred for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to exclude cranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). Because DSA is not without risk, the authors studied the sensitivity and specificity of an automated detection algorithm that analyses external ear canal sound measurements to evaluate the presence of DAVF in PT patients.

Methods

Between 2015 and 2021, external ear canal sound measurements of 72 PT patients were collected prospectively at our tertiary tinnitus clinic preceding referral of these patients to the neurosurgical department for counseling about DSA. The measurements were analyzed with an algorithm that objectifies a pulsatile sound as a PT coherence index (PTCI) per frequency band.

Results

Ultimately, DSA was performed in 49 PT patients. DAVF was revealed in 15 patients (31%). PTCI cutoff values of 0.7 (at 250 Hz) and 0.6 (at 1000 Hz) resulted in sensitivity of 100% (78%-100%) and specificities of 62% (44%-78%) and 68% (49%-83%), respectively, for detecting DAVF on DSA.

Conclusions

Analysis of external ear canal sound measurements in PT patients showed 100% sensitivity for detecting DAVF on DSA. This analysis can potentially be used as a screening tool to help clinicians and PT patients to decide on the necessity of DSA. Retrospectively, the use of sound measurement in our cohort would have narrowed the indication for DSA to 23 of 49 cases (47%) without missing a DAVF.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus: a review of 74 patients [^112gZAr4]. Clinical Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of imaging modalities in detecting the underlying pathologies in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-four patients with pulsatile tinnitus were radiologically evaluated. All patients except two are evaluated on a thin-section bone algorithm computed tomography scan covering the temporal bone and skull base, 14 patients with or without contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography, 7 patients with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, 5 patients with digital subtraction angiography, and 12 patients with Doppler ultrasonography.

Results

The underlying pathology of tinnitus was detected in 50 patients (67.6%), and 24 patients were normal with radiologic studies. The most common cause was high jugular bulbus (21%) followed by atherosclerosis, dehiscent jugular bulbus, aneurysm of internal carotid artery, dural arteriovenous fistula, aberrant internal carotid artery, jugular diverticulum, and glomus tumor.

Conclusion

It was concluded that radiologic imaging methods are effective in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus.

### Dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT evaluation of dural arteriovenous fistula in patients with pulsatile tinnitus as an initial symptom [^111B1UTV]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) can cause pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT (DP-CECT) for DAVF in PT patients compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).

Method

From February 2015 to April 2021, PT patients undergoing routine DSA examination were prospectively analyzed. Patients with and without DAVF diagnosed by DSA were included. In DP-CECT, the radiological signs related to DAVF were assessed as follows: asymmetric external carotid artery (ECA) branches, asymmetric enhancement of intracranial or extracranial veins, asymmetric venous collaterals in extracranial space, and shaggy tentorium or venous sinus on CTA; asymmetric enhancement of intracranial or extracranial veins on CTV; numerous transcalvarial channels and asymmetric size of foramen spinosum on high-resolution CT (HRCT).

Results

253 PT patients receiving DSA were enrolled, and these patients had previously been screened by DP-CECT. Forty-six patients were diagnosed as DAVF by DSA. Therefore, the prevalence of DAVF was 18% (46/253) in patients with PT as the initial symptom. The sensitivity and specificity of DP-CECT for diagnosis of DAVF were 96% and 100%. The sensitivity of individual CTA signs ranged from 65% to 93%, and specificities ranged from 83% to 100%. The sensitivity of CTV sign was 80%, and specificity was 100%. The sensitivity of individual HRCT signs ranged from 48 to 52% and specificities from 61 to 100%.

Conclusions

DAVF is not rare in patients with PT as the initial symptom. DP-CECT can be used for screening DAVF in patients with PT.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^116GiXry]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — general examination approach specifies core components and associated comorbidity assessment. A routine examination of the head and neck, including careful otoscopy, is the focus of such an examination, and a focused neurologic examination should exclude motor and/or sensory deficits as well as cranial nerve issues that may accompany central nervous system lesions. When pulsatile tinnitus is reported, the examination should focus on identification of cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions, and a full head and neck examination, a general cardiovascular examination, and auscultation/palpation of the head and neck, the skull and mastoid prominences, and orbits should be part of this evaluation. The examination may find treatable otologic conditions that cause tinnitus; cerumen impaction or other ear canal obstructions are diagnosed with otoscopy. Tinnitus can occur in patients with middle ear disease, with or without resultant conductive hearing loss, such as that caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, or otosclerosis, and disorders of the cochlear or vestibular apparatus, such as Ménière's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) and superior canal dehiscence, can cause tinnitus. Vestibular schwannoma can cause tinnitus as well, and tinnitus can occur with medical conditions not directly associated with the ear, including vascular tumors, palatal/middle ear myoclonus, intracranial hypertension, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Emotional distress and/or disturbance of sleep are often associated with severe tinnitus, and the initial history and physical examination should also include assessment of possible associated emotional disturbance or psychiatric illness, which is crucial for patients who may be severely depressed.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^112Xtja1]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case is a prime example of the importance of using physical diagnosis before any adjunctive techniques. The patient had seen several doctors before and none could reason out her condition. However, after auscultating her right retroaural region, the bruit was extremely distinct and pathognomonic for pulsatile tinnitus, mostly likely secondary to some sort of anatomical vascular issue. So clear, in fact, that even a medical student could discern something was amiss. This further emphasises the importance of utilising basic techniques such as auscultation, palpation and others. After performing a thorough physical exam, we reasoned that additional techniques such as MRI, MRA and MRV were necessary to further the diagnosis so the patient could receive the best care possible.

Before metals and electronics, a physician's diagnosis was based solely on history and what they could feel with their hands. According to Roguin, centuries later the stethoscope was invented by Laënnec in 1816. Since then, it has become one of the hallmark symbols of medicine. Every physician is taught to use this instrument, and as a result needs to actually examine the patient himself or herself. Since then, there has been an explosion of technological development in the field of medicine. All of it is extremely beneficial, but it has driven physicians to rely on what technology perceives rather than their own senses.

For instance, the MRI. Since its invention, it has rapidly risen to become a staple imaging and diagnostic technique in many fields of medicine. The beginnings of MRI stemmed from Bloch and Purcell, the winners of the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics, for their novel methods of using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for precision measurements. Later on, Damadiantweaked the concept on NMR after scanning tumour tissue, noticed it had a prolonged T1 relaxation time compared with normal tissue. Damadian et al would then go on to perform the first full body scan using magnetic resonance technology in 1977. A few years later, the MRI would be further improved both in practicality and functionality. Lauterburwas able to combine a series of rotating one-dimensional NMR images into one 2D or 3D image. Ordidge et al tempered the technique by inventing 'slice selection' and developed the MRI protocol called 'echo-planar imaging', making functional MRI more feasible.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^116fK8r2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Our opinion is that it would interest the readership of BMJ Case Reports because it describes an important clinical lesson regarding performing a thorough history and physical before using adjunctive radiographic modalities. Examining the patient is the basis of medicine and should not be forgotten. It is an elementary but significant fact that has long-lasting implications. Our hope is that by urging those in medicine to continue to utilising skills such as auscultation, it will decrease patient costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

### Improving diagnostic yield in patients with pulsatile tinnitus: a ten-year analysis [^1165KkKM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the yield of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and to review the common etiologies and present clinical pears for their diagnosis.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients with PT from 2013 to 2023. Charts were reviewed for demographic data (age, sex, BMI), side of PT (or bilateral), specialty clinic of initial evaluation, coexistent symptoms in addition to PT, and final diagnosis (or non-diagnosis). Clinical, audiometric, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Putative chart diagnoses were reviewed by the authors and deemed likely or unlikely to be the source of the patient's PT. Those with "unlikely" were grouped in the "idiopathic" cohort. The diagnostic algorithm is presented in detail.

Results

Two hundred and 90 patients were included for analysis. The overall diagnostic yield was 90.7% for all patients and 95.6% for those patients who completed the recommended workup - a substantial improvement over published rates. Twenty-nine etiologies were identified with the most common etiology was idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Twenty-one diagnoses comprised no more than 5% of patients. Seventy-three patients (25.2%) had more than one pathology as a potential source for their PT.

Conclusions

PT can present a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. The findings of this study, however, reveal that proper evaluation based on obtaining a thorough history, performing a physical examination, coupled with properly directed imaging studies and blood testing can accomplish a high diagnostic yield of at least one potential etiology.

Another popular imaging modality is angiography. Early trailblazers in angiographyfocused on developing fluoroscopy and radiography techniques while studying cardiac diseases from 1899 to 1902. Tan and Yip cite Monizeas the first to use the technique in 1927 for contrasted X-ray cerebral angiography to diagnose nervous diseases such as tumours and arteriovenous malformations. From there, angiography further evolved through the efforts of Forsmannin 1929 with his attempts at cardiac catheterisation and angiocardiography. These advances paved the way for many clinicians to continue honing the technique during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1941, Cournanddemonstrated that cardiac catheterisation was safe to use on the human body. As the years rolled on, more advances such as rapid filming, demonstration of coronary anatomy and balloon angioplasty came into being.

With the inception of both the MRI and angiography, physicians began to use these techniques more and more, eventually merging both into MRA and MRV. However, there were two large issues that made MRA and MRV techniques suboptimal procedures in many situations: the inability to produce simultaneous bilateral images and the long time it took to produce images. Then, during 2003 and then 2004, the advent of parallel imaging coupled with new pulse sequencesreduced the total time of imaging by one-third to half the original time.

In the present, due to their wide availability, modern physicians oftentimes overuse imaging techniques. Hawasli et al state that headaches consist of 1.5% of all chief complaints in a primary care setting. Irrespective of many neuroimaging guidelines, expenditures for neuroimaging of headaches and migraines in the USA reached nearly US$1.2 billion. This exorbitant cost is attributed to the practice of 'defensive medicine', which results in neuroimaging solely done to reduce malpractice liability and medical errors. It has been shown that discovery of certain diseases earlier, such as brain tumours, improves outcomes. Moreover, with certain criteria such as the Choosing Wisely guidelines, false-negatives have been shown to be anywhere from 3% to 7%. However, even taking these facts into account, this is not an excuse for performing a haphazard history and physical, and skip directly to neuroimaging.

### Diagnostic approach to pulsatile tinnitus: a narrative review [^115o4Ahw]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy.

Observations

An underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus can be identified in more than 70% of patients with a thorough evaluation. We advocate categorizing the myriad causes of pulsatile tinnitus into structural, metabolic, and vascular groups. Structural causes of pulsatile tinnitus include neoplasms and temporal bone pathologic abnormalities. Metabolic causes of pulsatile tinnitus include ototoxic medications and systemic causes of high cardiac output. Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. This categorization facilitates a practical evaluation, referral, and treatment pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Categorizing the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus ensures that dangerous causes of pulsatile tinnitus are not missed, and that patients receive the appropriate care from the proper specialist when needed.

Clues from the history

Headaches are common and can be highly variable (see later). They may be of new onset or more chronic, particularly in those with previous migraine. Visual symptoms include blurred or double vision. Patients can describe transient loss of vision and/or 'greying out' of vision: so-called 'transient visual obscurations'. They usually relate to postural changes; and are usually brief, typically only seconds. Patients may report horizontal diplopia from a false-localising abducens nerve palsy. There may be pulsatile tinnitus — a rhythmic 'whooshing' sound heard in either or both ears synchronous with the patient's heartbeat, and often present only on lying down. Many patients do not volunteer this symptom unless directly asked.

Tinnitus may be continuous or pulsatile. Vascular lesions are the most frequent radiologically demonstrable cause of pulsatile tinnitus. These include congenital vascular anomalies (which may be arterial or venous), vascular tumours, and a variety of acquired vasculopathies. The choice of imaging depends on the clinical findings. If a mass is present at otoscopy, thin-section computed tomography (CT) is indicated. In the otoscopically normal patient, there is a range of possible imaging approaches. However, combined CT angiography and venography is particularly useful.

### Clinical evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus: history and physical examination techniques to predict vascular etiology [^1179TRQ2]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) may be due to a spectrum of cerebrovascular etiologies, ranging from benign venous turbulence to life threatening dural arteriovenous fistulas. A focused clinical history and physical examination provide clues to the ultimate diagnosis; however, the predictive accuracy of these features in determining PT etiology remains uncertain.

Methods

Patients with clinical PT evaluation and DSA were included. The final etiology of PT after DSA was categorized as shunting, venous, arterial, or non-vascular. Clinical variables were compared between etiologies using multivariate logistic regression, and performance at predicting PT etiology was determined by area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).

Results

164 patients were included. On multivariate analysis, patient reported high pitch PT (relative risk (RR) 33.81; 95% CI 3.81 to 882.80) compared with exclusively low pitch PT and presence of a bruit on physical examination (9.95; 2.04 to 62.08; P = 0.007) were associated with shunting PT. Hearing loss was associated with a lower risk of shunting PT (0.16; 0.03 to 0.79; P = 0.029). Alleviation of PT with ipsilateral lateral neck pressure was associated with a higher risk of venous PT (5.24; 1.62 to 21.01; P = 0.010). An AUROC of 0.882 was achieved for predicting the presence or absence of a shunt and 0.751 for venous PT.

Conclusion

In patients with PT, clinical history and physical examination can achieve high performance at detecting a shunting lesion. Potentially treatable venous etiologies may also be suggested by relief with neck compression.

### Sound measurements in pulsatile tinnitus: a review in 171 patients [^117XdcnL]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic application of external ear canal sound measurements in pulsatile tinnitus (PT).

Study Design

Retrospective chart review on a prospective series of sound measurements.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

A cohort of 171 PT patients with sound measurements during diagnostic workup for PT (2016–2023).

Main Outcome Measure

The percentages of PT patients per pathology and diagnosis, with PT objectified by sound measurements.

Results

In 57% of the patients, an identifiable etiology that could explain the PT was identified using various imaging modalities. The PT could be detected with a sound measurement in the ear canal in 48% of these patients. In absence of an identifiable etiology, an objective PT was found in only 15% of the cases. PT was more often detected for patients with arterial pathologies than venous or nonvascular pathologies (73% vs 50% and 22%, respectively). Particularly, in PT patients with a DAVF, an objective PT was found for all patients (100%). The sound measurements were found to be more sensitive than auscultation in detecting bruits in PT patients.

Conclusion

A sound recording can objectify PT in almost half of the cases with a diagnosis as determined by imaging. In patients where the PT cannot be detected, arterial pathologies (particularly DAVFs) are less likely. Combined with a thorough clinical evaluation and proper imaging studies, sound measurements can be of added value in the clinical pathway of PT patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AAO-HNS 2014 guidelines recommend to elicit a targeted history and perform a focused physical examination in the initial evaluation of patients with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that, if promptly identified and managed, may relieve tinnitus.
