## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after being found unresponsive at home. On arrival, he is actively convulsing with generalized tonic-clonic movements. His wife reports that he has been seizing for at least 15 minutes. The paramedics administered oxygen and established IV access. His vital signs are: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 18, SpO2 97% on oxygen. The ED team is preparing to administer IV lorazepam. Laboratory investigations and a bedside glucose check are pending.

According to current guidelines, what are the two most important initial principles in the management of this patient with status epilepticus?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the two most important initial principles in managing a 54-year-old man with generalized convulsive status epilepticus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and why time matters. Then, I should verify the first principle of rapid seizure termination with benzodiazepines. Next, I will examine the second principle of simultaneous evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause. After that, I need to check supportive care priorities that enable these principles. Finally, I will synthesize the two principles succinctly and ensure they align with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the time-critical nature of the problem. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is defined operationally as continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity for 5 minutes or more, or recurrent seizures without recovery between episodes, because neuronal injury and pharmacoresistance emerge well before the older 30-minute threshold, which is why we treat at 5 minutes rather than waiting for 30 minutes [^0888c6a0] [^acb4668f]. Wait, let me verify the mortality signal tied to delays: mortality ranges from about 5% to 22% overall and can be markedly higher in refractory cases, underscoring the need for immediate, aggressive therapy rather than observation [^722de610].

> Now, I will state the first principle and then verify it against guidelines. The most important initial principle is rapid termination of seizures with benzodiazepines as emergent first-line therapy, ideally within the first few minutes of recognition, because early control reduces neuronal injury and improves outcomes; lorazepam is the preferred IV agent when IV access is available, with midazolam as an alternative route when IV access is delayed or unavailable [^dc45e523] [^f0cb1781] [^74b99eff]. Hold on, I should double-check comparative efficacy: randomized data show lorazepam achieves higher cessation rates than phenytoin monotherapy, reinforcing benzodiazepines as the initial therapy of choice in convulsive status epilepticus [^50232bf2] [^8670fdfe].

> Next, I should review dosing and repetition so I don't miss a practical pitfall. I initially thought lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV could be repeated once if needed, but wait, let me verify the exact guidance: the AES recommends administering initial therapy as a full, adequate single dose rather than divided small doses, and allows repeating lorazepam or diazepam once at full dose if seizures persist, which aligns with the principle of rapid, adequate dosing rather than incremental titration that risks undertreatment [^6e545d1a]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with midazolam IM, which is dosed differently and is an alternative when IV access is not available, again emphasizing early, guideline-concordant benzodiazepine administration as the priority [^dc45e523] [^c096daa9].

> I will now examine the second principle and confirm it against multiple sources. The second most important initial principle is simultaneous identification and treatment of the underlying cause, because status epilepticus is a symptom of diverse etiologies and refractoriness increases with delays in addressing reversible drivers; this means running parallel diagnostics and targeted therapies from the outset rather than sequentially after seizure control [^0a42d752] [^c6648fad]. Hold on, I should verify the scope of urgent evaluation: guidelines advise immediate fingerstick glucose, basic labs including electrolytes and AED levels, and early neuroimaging with head CT for most cases, alongside consideration of toxicology and, when indicated, lumbar puncture, all pursued in parallel with benzodiazepine administration and airway support [^815efdbd] [^c6648fad] [^a33c9fc2].

> Let me consider supportive care that enables these two principles, because I need to ensure the basics are not overlooked. Airway, breathing, and circulation must be secured simultaneously: position the head to maintain patency, provide oxygen, monitor vitals continuously, and be prepared to intubate if airway compromise or elevated intracranial pressure is suspected; obtain a bedside glucose immediately and treat hypoglycemia without delay, and establish reliable IV access for medications and fluids [^32c26d0e] [^51bab8e0]. I should confirm that these steps are recommended to occur within the first minutes alongside benzodiazepines, which they are in the NCS timeline, reinforcing parallel rather than sequential care in the opening phase [^51bab8e0].

> But wait, what if seizures persist beyond the first benzodiazepine dose; does that change the hierarchy of principles? Even then, the two principles remain unchanged: continue aggressive seizure control with escalation to second-line agents promptly and continue etiologic evaluation in parallel, because refractory status epilepticus carries substantially higher morbidity and mortality and mandates ICU-level care with continuous EEG when available [^d52d33d5] [^86094df6]. I should double-check that contemporary policies endorse early second-line therapy after benzodiazepine failure, which they do, including phenytoin or fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam, while continuing diagnostic workup and supportive measures [^e3aba785] [^a39ce1b2].

> Synthesis time: I need to ensure the two principles are concise, accurate, and reference-aligned. The two most important initial principles are, first, rapid seizure termination with guideline-concordant benzodiazepines as emergent first-line therapy, and second, simultaneous identification and treatment of the underlying cause through parallel diagnostic and therapeutic actions, both initiated within the first minutes of care to mitigate neuronal injury and reduce mortality [^dc45e523] [^0a42d752] [^b4e2c9e8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without anchoring to outcomes: delays in benzodiazepine administration and incomplete etiologic workup are repeatedly associated with worse outcomes, which is why these principles are prioritized across major guidelines and reviews [^eabf9195] [^b9911812].

The two most important initial principles in managing status epilepticus are **rapid seizure control with benzodiazepines** [^74b99eff] and **early identification and treatment of the underlying cause** [^0a42d752]. Benzodiazepines (IV lorazepam, IV diazepam, or IM midazolam) are **first-line** [^dc45e523] and should be given without delay to stop seizures and prevent neuronal injury [^b9911812]. Simultaneously, obtain a bedside glucose, check electrolytes, and start a focused workup (including CT head if indicated) to identify and treat reversible causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte disturbances, or CNS infection [^c6648fad]. These steps are time-critical and should proceed in parallel to reduce morbidity and mortality [^b4e2c9e8].

---

## Principle 1: rapid seizure control with benzodiazepines

- **First-line therapy**: Benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of initial management [^74b99eff], with IV lorazepam preferred when IV access is available [^dc45e523].

- **Alternative routes**: If IV access is delayed, IM midazolam is effective and non-inferior to IV lorazepam [^5734dcbe].

- **Timing**: Administer benzodiazepines as soon as possible; delays increase the risk of refractory status epilepticus and worse outcomes [^eabf9195].

- **Dosing**: Use adequate single doses; lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg) can be repeated once if seizures persist [^6e545d1a].

---

## Principle 2: early identification and treatment of underlying causes

- **Bedside glucose**: Check immediately and treat hypoglycemia with 50 mL of 50% dextrose IV [^notfound].

- **Electrolytes**: Correct sodium, calcium, and magnesium abnormalities promptly [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Obtain a head CT if the cause is unknown or if seizures persist despite initial therapy [^c6648fad].

- **Infection**: Suspect and treat CNS infections (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis) early with appropriate antibiotics and antivirals [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed treatment

Delayed benzodiazepine administration and failure to treat underlying causes are associated with **increased refractoriness**, higher mortality, and worse neurological outcomes [^b9911812] [^d86adfe0]. Early, aggressive management is essential to mitigate these risks [^30011d77].

## Summary of initial management steps

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Administer benzodiazepine (lorazepam or midazolam) | Rapid seizure control [^74b99eff] |
| 2 | Check bedside glucose | Identify and treat hypoglycemia [^notfound] |
| 3 | Obtain electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg) | Correct metabolic disturbances [^notfound] |
| 4 | Perform head CT if indicated | Identify structural causes [^c6648fad] |
| 5 | Initiate supportive care (airway, oxygen, IV access) | Stabilize patient [^32c26d0e] |

---

The two most important initial principles in status epilepticus are **rapid benzodiazepine administration** and **early identification and treatment of underlying causes**, both of which should proceed in parallel to optimize outcomes [^b4e2c9e8].

Status epilepticus definitions and initial management — Refractory status epilepticus (SE) should be defined as SE that does not respond to an initial benzodiazepine followed by another antiepileptic drug (AED), and the etiology of SE should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible; the principal treatment goal is to emergently stop both clinical and electrographic seizure activity, with initial strategy including airway, breathing, and circulation management, seizure abortive drug treatment, screening for the underlying cause, and immediate treatment of life‑threatening causes; treatment of SE should include appropriate elements of critical care as outlined in Table 5 and should mirror other resuscitation approaches with direct, close supervision by a treatment team including a physician and nurse.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^d52d33d5]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) management — treatment stages and timing — uses a staged approach with named phases and explicit timelines. The treatment of SE occurs in stages and is revised to emergent initial therapy, urgent control therapy, and refractory therapy. Definitive control of SE should be established within 60 min of onset. All patients presenting with SE will need emergent initial AED therapy (i.e., 1st line) and urgent control AED therapy (i.e., 2nd line) in addition to AED maintenance therapy, even if SE is immediately controlled. By definition, refractory SE therapy (i.e., 3rd and 4th line) is reserved for those failing the first 2 AEDs administered. If SE is caused by a metabolic disorder (e.g., hypoglycemia), the underlying metabolic disorder should be corrected, in which case maintenance therapy may or may not be necessary. SE patients refractory to initial therapy may be best treated in experienced, high volume centers.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^ba11592b]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus guideline methodology and GRADE approach — A PubMed/Medline search for English-language human studies published through August 2011 included clinical trials, meta-analyses, review articles, and practice guidelines, with additional literature for continual EEG and intensive care unit management drawn from committee recommendations and reference lists. Diagnosis and management recommendations were assigned using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which provides "strong" and "weak" recommendation grades and defines evidence quality categories. A strong recommendation can be made based on four factors: balance between desirable and undesirable effects, quality of evidence, values and preferences, and costs (resource allocation). All participants agreed with the recommendations, and because many management decisions lack prospective randomized controlled trials, the guideline also incorporates data from previously published surveys and a survey of an international expert panel, plus selected review articles recommended by external reviewers.

The emergent evaluation and treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus presents challenges for emergency physicians. This disease is one of the few in which minutes can mean the difference between life and significant morbidity and mortality. It is imperative to use parallel processing and have multiple treatment options planned in advance, in case the current treatment is not successful. There is also benefit to exploring, or initiating, treatment algorithms to standardize the care for these critically ill patients.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^d10884ac]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus — this guideline targets the acute treatment of critically ill patients and was developed through evidence review and expert consensus. Status epilepticus (SE) requires emergent, targeted treatment to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. Treatment strategies vary substantially across institutions due to limited comparative data, so the Neurocritical Care Society organized a writing committee to evaluate the literature and develop an evidence-based and expert consensus practice guideline. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed with studies screened by writing committee criteria, and recommendations were developed using standardized assessment methods from the American Heart Association and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation systems, supplemented by expert opinion when data were lacking. The Neurocritical Care Society Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee was established to develop evidence-based expert consensus guidelines for diagnosing and managing SE.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^722de610]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus in adult emergency department (ED) patients — incidence, mortality, definitions, and detection are detailed as follows: Status epilepticus is a life-threatening form of seizure, generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus occurs in 50,000 to 150,000 patients per year in the United States and most commonly occurs at the extremes of age, between 5% to 17% of patients will have a seizure while in the ED and up to 7% of patients in the ED will have status epilepticus, and the reported mortality rate ranges from 5% to 22% and has been reported to be as high as 65% in those patients refractory to first-line therapies. According to the World Health Organization, status epilepticus is "a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is sufficiently prolonged or repeated at sufficiently brief intervals so as to produce an unvarying and enduring epileptic condition", it has traditionally been defined as at least 30 minutes of persistent seizures or recurrent seizures without complete return to full consciousness, some authors have proposed shortening the time criteria from 30 minutes to 5 minutes, and to diagnose nonconvulsive status epilepticus and subtle convulsive status epilepticus emergency physicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^7514ebf8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2004 policy on critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with seizures in the emergency department. A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) In patients with a first generalized convulsive seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status, should antiepileptic therapy be initiated in the emergency department to prevent additional seizures? (2) In patients with a first unprovoked seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status in the emergency department, should the patient be admitted to the hospital to prevent adverse events? (3) In patients with a known seizure disorder in which resuming their antiepileptic medication in the emergency department is deemed appropriate, does the route of administration impact recurrence of seizures? (4) In emergency department patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus who continue to have seizures despite receiving optimal dosing of a benzodiazepine, which agent or agents should be administered next to terminate seizures? A literature search was performed, the evidence was graded, and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Unraveling the enigma of new-onset refractory status epilepticus: a systematic review of aetiologies [^783f0425]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The issues highlighted in this comprehensive systematic review underlie the need for better and consistent research on the topic. The following are suggested.
Further research is warranted to recognize clinical characteristics that may point early to a specific aetiology and suggest what treatment strategy will be most effective.
Analyses of larger case series where individual patient data are available may allow any associations between individual aetiologies, response to treatment and outcome to be explored.
Prospective studies based on standardized eligibility and diagnostic criteria, adopting a standardized diagnostic work‐up, and recruiting a larger population would allow the actual frequency of aetiologies of NORSE to be estimated and possible associations with clinical presentation to be identified.
Multicentre registries could offer the opportunity to speed up the prospective collection of data to analyse and interpret in a timely fashion.
Retrospective analyses may be useful to identify still unappreciated causes for NORSE and generate testable hypotheses for further scrutiny. Hospitals should be encouraged to store first obtained CSF, urine and serum for at least a month at –20°C or at –80°C, and in those cases with prolonged RSE (> 7 days) for 5–10 years to allow for retrospective analysis when new data become available.
Protocols to standardize diagnostic work‐up should be developed to increase the diagnostic yield and guarantee the prompt recognition of NORSE.
Protocols to guide therapeutic approaches according to the aetiology underlying NORSE should be implemented to allow the reliable care of patients.
Diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines should be shared across scientific communities and working groups, and dissemination of clinical decision support tools may decrease the time to diagnosis and treatment.
Planning and advancing strategies to identify barriers, facilitators and resources to make sustainable diagnostic interventions possible across healthcare settings should accompany advancing scientific knowledge.
Global cooperation and multicentre research represent priorities of the road map to improve the understanding and management of NORSE.

Wood AJ, Burke JF, Lowenstein DH, Guterman EL. Status Epilepticus Identification and Treatment Among Emergency Medical Services Agencies. JAMA Neurol. 2024; 81: 777–778. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2024.1512 eAppendix. International Classification of Disease 10 Codes Used to Identify Patients With Status Epilepticus Data Sharing Statement Seizures and status epilepticus constitute approximately 3% of emergency medical services evaluations, carrying substantial morbidity and mortality. 1 Studies suggest that unidentified SE is common during prehospital care and is likely associated with large delays in first-line benzodiazepine treatment. 2–4 However, this association has not been examined in a broad US population. This cross-sectional study used data from the ESO Data Collaborative dataset. ESO provides prehospital electronic health record software to over 600 EMS agencies across the US.

A subset of destination hospitals provide ESO with primary and secondary International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes from the subsequent emergency department stay; ESO then compiles this information into a research dataset. 5 The University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved this study and waived informed consent because the research involved no greater than minimal risk. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline. We identified patients of all ages with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis code of SE on ED discharge who were evaluated for a 911 call between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. To ensure inclusion of patients most likely in true SE, we restricted the cohort to those with a prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or lower.

We considered patients to have potentially unidentified prehospital SE if they received a primary diagnosis of SE in the ED but the prehospital diagnostic impression was not seizure-related. In ESO, prehospital clinicians must select a primary diagnostic impression and optionally select a secondary diagnostic impression. ESO also includes all administered medications, including their name, dose, and administration time. We examined prevalence of unidentified SE and performed logistic regression to estimate the association between unidentified SE and any prehospital benzodiazepine receipt. Among those receiving treatment, we performed linear regressions to estimate the association of unidentified SE with time to treatment and dose. Dose was assessed only among patients treated with midazolam. Regressions adjusted for prehospital EHR-abstracted age, sex, race and ethnicity, and suspected alcohol or substance use.

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/IC 15.

1. Among 1356 total encounters, 139 patients had unidentified SE. Most patients received a prehospital diagnosis of altered level of consciousness or stroke. Twenty-six patients with unidentified SE received any prehospital benzodiazepine treatment, compared with 948 patients with identified SE. Among those receiving treatment, patients with unidentified SE received treatment later with a lower midazolam dose. Approximately 10% of patients with SE and a GCS score of 8 or lower were unidentified during prehospital care. Given that 18.

### Diagnosis and management of status epilepticus: improving the status quo [^b9911812]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency that is characterised by prolonged or recurrent seizures without recovery between episodes and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and targeted therapy can reduce the risk of complications and death associated with status epilepticus, thereby improving outcomes. The most recent International League Against Epilepsy definition considers two important timepoints in status epilepticus: first, when the seizure does not self-terminate; and second, when the seizure can have long-term consequences, including neuronal injury. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of status epilepticus indicate that changes in neurotransmission as status epilepticus progresses can increase excitatory seizure-facilitating and decrease inhibitory seizure-terminating mechanisms at a cellular level. Effective clinical management requires rapid initiation of supportive measures, assessment of the cause of the seizure, and first-line treatment with benzodiazepines. If status epilepticus continues, management should entail second-line and third-line treatment agents, supportive EEG monitoring, and admission to an intensive care unit. Future research to study early seizure detection, rescue protocols and medications, rapid treatment escalation, and integration of fundamental scientific and clinical evidence into clinical practice could shorten seizure duration and reduce associated complications. Furthermore, improved recognition, education, and treatment in patients who are at risk might help to prevent status epilepticus, particularly for patients living in low-income and middle-income countries.

Status epilepticus — up to 5% of adults with epilepsy will have 1 episode in their lifetime, and a generalized convulsive seizure lasting for 5 minutes has been proposed as defining status epilepticus. The Neurocritical Care Society's Status Epilepticus Guideline Writing Committee recommended urgent control of seizures with valproate, levetiracetam, or phenobarbital, in addition to phenytoin/fosphenytoin, and valproate was recommended for both emergent treatment of seizures and refractory status epilepticus. The European Federation of Neurological Societies' evidence-based guideline for adults recommended anesthetic doses of midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates for status epilepticus refractory to benzodiazepines and phenytoin.

Time to diagnosis and seizure control are strongly associated with outcome: for patients diagnosed within 30 min of seizure onset, mortality was 36% compared with 75% when diagnosed ≥ 24 h after onset, and patients with NCSE treated and resolved within 10 h had 10% mortality versus 85% mortality if seizures continued longer than 20 h. Etiology also influences outcome, with mortality at hospital discharge 27% versus 3% comparing patients with versus without a known acute medical cause.

### Optimizing the diagnosis and management of dravet syndrome: recommendations from a North American Consensus panel [^60161b86]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish standards for early, cost-effective, and accurate diagnosis; optimal therapies for seizures; and recommendations for evaluation and management of comorbidities for children and adults with Dravet syndrome, using a modified Delphi process.

Methods

An expert panel was convened comprising epileptologists with nationally recognized expertise in Dravet syndrome and parents of children with Dravet syndrome, whose experience and understanding was enhanced by their active roles in Dravet syndrome associations. Panelists were asked to base their responses to questions both on their clinical expertise and results of a literature review that was forwarded to each panelist. Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted to identify areas of consensus and strength of that consensus, as well as areas of contention.

Results

The panel consisted of 13 physicians and five family members. Strong consensus was reached regarding typical clinical presentation of Dravet syndrome, range of electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging findings, need for genetic testing, critical information that should be conveyed to families at diagnosis, priorities for seizure control and typical degree of control, seizure triggers and recommendations for avoidance, first- and second-line therapies for seizures, requirement and indications for rescue therapy, specific recommendations for comorbidity screening, and need for family support. Consensus was not as strong regarding later therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy, and for specific therapies of associated comorbidities. Beyond the initial treatment with benzodiazepines and use of valproate, there was no consensus on the optimal in-hospital management of convulsive status epilepticus.

Conclusions

We were able to identify areas where there was strong consensus that we hope will (1) inform health care providers on optimal diagnosis and management of patients with Dravet syndrome, (2) support reimbursement from insurance companies for genetic testing and Dravet syndrome-specific therapies, and (3) improve quality of life for patients with Dravet syndrome and their families by avoidance of unnecessary testing and provision of an early accurate diagnosis allowing optimal selection of therapeutic strategies.

### Management of status epilepticus [^5702a095]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is an increasingly recognized public health problem in the United States. Status epilepticus is associated with a high mortality rate that is largely contingent on the duration of the condition before initial treatment, the etiology of the condition, and the age of the patient. Treatment is evolving as new medications become available. Three new preparations — fosphenytoin, rectal diazepam, and parenteral valproate — have implications for the management of status epilepticus. However, randomized controlled trials show that benzodiazepines (in particular, diazepam and lorazepam) should be the initial drug therapy in patients with status epilepticus. Despite the paucity of clinical trials comparing medication regimens for acute seizures, there is broad consensus that immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this condition. Moreover, investigators have reported that status epilepticus often is not considered in patients with altered consciousness in the intensive care setting. In patients with persistent alteration of consciousness for which there is no clear etiology, physicians should be more quickly prepared to obtain electroencephalography to identify status epilepticus. Physicians should rely on a standardized protocol for management of status epilepticus to improve care for this neurologic emergency.

### Status epilepticus [^41a6d3c3]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a serious medical emergency that requires prompt and appropriate intervention. Maintenance of adequate vital function with attention to airway, breathing, and circulation; prevention of systemic complications; and rapid termination of seizures must be coupled with investigating and treating any underlying cause. In most patients with SE, the use of adequate dosages of first-line antiepileptic agents allows for the successful and rapid termination of SE and avoidance of potential neurologic complications. Refractory SE requires more aggressive treatment, often the use of intravenous anesthetic agents and intense monitoring, and therefore must be managed in a pediatric intensive care unit with a multidisciplinary approach. Large, controlled, multicenter, comparative studies are needed urgently to clarify better the optimal management of these patients.

### Emergency neurological life support: status epilepticus [^30011d77]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with prolonged or rapidly recurring convulsions lasting more than 5 min should be considered to be in status epilepticus (SE) and receive immediate resuscitation. Although there are few randomized clinical trials, available evidence and experience suggest that early and aggressive treatment of SE improves patient outcomes, for which reason this was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol. The current approach to the emergency treatment of SE emphasizes rapid initiation of adequate doses of first line therapy, as well as accelerated second line anticonvulsant drugs and induced coma when these fail, coupled with admission to a unit capable of neurological critical care and electroencephalography monitoring. This protocol will focus on the initial treatment of SE but also review subsequent steps in the protocol once the patient is hospitalized.

### Management of status epilepticus: a narrative review [^79a5ac47]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus causes prolonged or repetitive seizures that, if left untreated, can lead to neuronal injury, severe disability, coma and death in paediatric and adult populations. While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes. When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anaesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anaesthetic wean; however, it is resource-intensive, costly, only available in highly specialised centres and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications. This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented and comprehensive review of status epilepticus and its definitions, aetiologies, treatments, outcomes and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^d86adfe0]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epileptic attack and a life-threatening neurological emergency, which is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. The clinical manifestation of convulsive status epilepticus is characterised by a prolonged tonic–clonic seizure or repetitive seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them.

Epidemiological studies have documented a global annual incidence of status epilepticus of 7 to 41 cases per 100,000 population. In Europe, the annual incidence of status epilepticus lies between 10 and 16 per 100,000 population, and convulsive status epilepticus accounts for 45–74% of all cases. Incidence of convulsive status epilepticus tends to be higher in males than females. Mortality of status epilepticus has been reported to range from around 8–33% according to aetiology, with older age being a detrimental factor. A recent meta-analysis of convulsive status epilepticus in high-income countries reported pooled mortality of 15.9% and the authors noted that survival rates have not improved over the last 30 years.

The ultimate goal of treatment is to stop both clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity as soon as possible as convulsive status epilepticus can worsen with delayed or suboptimal treatment. Early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality and with a greater proportion of terminated seizures at arrival at the hospital emergency department.

The first-line treatment of status epilepticus is currently benzodiazepines. The UK NICE Clinical Guidance recommends the use of buccal midazolam in the community setting before arrival at the hospital, or the administration of rectal diazepam if buccal midazolam is not available. The Scottish SIGN guideline and the 2010 European Federation of Neurologists recommend intravenous (IV) administration of lorazepam or diazepam if IV access is already established and resuscitation available. To date, few trials have evaluated treatment options for adults and there is uncertainty about the optimal first-line treatment to control seizures before arrival at the hospital.

Objectives

The objective of this assessment was to synthesise current evidence on first-line pharmacological interventions to control seizures in adults before, or at, arrival at the hospital with the aim to inform clinical practice and future research.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review according to current methodological standards and pre-specified its methods in a research protocol (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020201953). This report adheres to the principles of the PRISMA 2020 statement.

### Pick your poison but Pick It wisely: choosing a second-line medication for the management of status epilepticus [^5734dcbe]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency with elevated mortality rates of over 20% in adults and 3% to 6% in children. The International League Against Epilepsy introduced a new definition and classification of SE in 2015, which highlights the severity of this condition, its long-term consequences in terms of neuronal death, and irreversible brain damage as well as the urgency to treat it. The operational dimensions of this classification considers generalized motor SE as more acutely threatening for long-term damage than focal or absence SE. Higher mortality rates are seen in prolonged and progressively refractory SE. Controlling ongoing clinical seizures as well as nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) in the shortest amount of time is an urgent priority.

The first-line treatment of SE is a benzodiazepine. Lorazepam has shown efficacy and ease of use superior to other anti-seizure medications (ASM). More recently, the use of intramuscular midazolam was shown to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam, to have similar rate of complications including need for intubation, and to be easier to use in the prehospital management of SE. Benzodiazepines are effective in 60% to 70% of cases when adequate doses are used; unfortunately, they are often underdosed in the emergency department setting.

### Timing is everything: where status epilepticus treatment fails [^eabf9195]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is an emergency; however, prompt treatment of patients with status epilepticus is challenging. Clinical trials, such as the ESETT (Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial), compare effectiveness of antiepileptic medications, and rigorous examination of effectiveness of care delivery is similarly warranted. We reviewed the medical literature on observed deviations from guidelines, clinical significance, and initiatives to improve timely treatment. We found pervasive, substantial gaps between recommended and "real-world" practice with regard to timing, dosing, and sequence of antiepileptic therapy. Applying quality improvement methodology at the institutional level can increase adherence to guidelines and may improve patient outcomes. Ann Neurol 2017;82:155–165.

In this case, the patient has RSE and it is recommended to immediately start additional agents". Because there is "no well defined period of observation that has been determined to be safe", the authors state "we recommend proceeding with additional treatment immediately, in combination with critical care treatment as described in Table 5".

Strengths and limitations

This review was conducted following current methodological standards, including comprehensive literature searches of relevant sources and transparent methods throughout. In addition, we had access to the individual participant data for the largest trial. Limitations of the assessment include the identification of only a few published trials in the adult population, with small sample sizes and inadequate power to detect clinically important differences between active treatments. Differences across trials, in terms of the type of treatment administered and the choice and definition of outcome measures, hampered the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis.

### Unraveling the enigma of new-onset refractory status epilepticus: a systematic review of aetiologies [^b7de6b4e]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

New‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a clinical presentation, neither a specific diagnosis nor a clinical entity. It refers to a patient without active epilepsy or other pre‐existing relevant neurological disorder, with a NORSE without a clear acute or active structural, toxic or metabolic cause. This study reviews the currently available evidence about the aetiology of patients presenting with NORSE and NORSE‐related conditions.

Methods

A systematic search was carried out for clinical trials, observational studies, case series and case reports including patients who presented with NORSE, febrile‐infection‐related epilepsy syndrome or the infantile hemiconvulsion‐hemiplegia and epilepsy syndrome.

Results

Four hundred and fifty records were initially identified, of which 197 were included in the review. The selected studies were retrospective case–control (n = 11), case series (n = 83) and case reports (n = 103) and overall described 1334 patients both of paediatric and adult age. Aetiology remains unexplained in about half of the cases, representing the so‐called 'cryptogenic NORSE'. Amongst adult patients without cryptogenic NORSE, the most often identified cause is autoimmune encephalitis, either non‐paraneoplastic or paraneoplastic. Infections are the prevalent aetiology of paediatric non‐cryptogenic NORSE. Genetic and congenital disorders can have a causative role in NORSE, and toxic, vascular and degenerative conditions have also been described.

Conclusions

Far from being a unitary condition, NORSE is a heterogeneous and clinically challenging presentation. The development and dissemination of protocols and guidelines to standardize diagnostic work‐up and guide therapeutic approaches should be implemented. Global cooperation and multicentre research represent priorities to improve the understanding of NORSE.

### Update on the management of status epilepticus [^bb14d41c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Randomized controlled trials investigating the initial pharmacological treatment of status epilepticus have been recently published. Furthermore, status epilepticus arising in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest has received increasing attention in the last years. This review offers an updated assessment of status epilepticus treatment in these different scenarios.

Recent Findings

Initial benzodiazepines underdosing is common and correlates with development of status epilepticus refractoriness. The recently published ESETT trial provides high-level evidence regarding the equivalence of fosphenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam as a second-line option. Myoclonus or epileptiform transients on electroencephalography occur in up to 1/3 of patients surviving a cardiac arrest. Contrary to previous assumptions regarding an almost invariable association with death, at least 1/10 of them may awaken with reasonably good prognosis, if treated. Multimodal prognostication including clinical examination, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials, biochemical markers, and neuroimaging help identifying patients with a chance to recover consciousness, in whom a trial with antimyoclonic compounds and at times general anesthetics is indicated.

Summary

There is a continuous, albeit relatively slow progress in knowledge regarding different aspect of status epilepticus; recent findings refine some treatment strategies and help improving patients' outcomes. Further high-quality studies are clearly needed to further improve the management of these patients, especially those with severe, refractory status epilepticus forms.

Emergency electroencephalography (EEG) in the ED — indications, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and access: Recommendations have been made to obtain an emergency EEG for persistent altered consciousness, refractory status epilepticus, pharmacologically managed sedation and coma, and for the diagnosis of viral encephalitis. The term nonconvulsive status epilepticus is used to describe seizures in which the primary manifestation is not motor; nonconvulsive status includes absence status epilepticus and complex partial status epilepticus, and EEG is the definitive test. A recent trial using early EEG in generalized convulsive status epilepticus found that 25% of patients had continuing electrical seizures despite apparent termination by bedside observation; others noted persistence after control and suggest that EEG monitoring be immediately available after the control of convulsive status epilepticus. Continuous EEG monitoring for patients with status epilepticus that is refractory to optimal doses of a benzodiazepine and phenytoin is recommended as well. In comatose patients without clinical signs of seizure activity, up to 8% met criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A multicenter survey reported that EEG was uncommonly performed in EDs, the average response time from request to initial EEG reading was approximately 3 hours, and no clear recommendation for ordering emergency EEG may be made on the basis of available data.

### Status epilepticus in adults [^05a247c6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency with considerable associated health-care costs, morbidity, and mortality. The definition of status epilepticus as a prolonged seizure or a series of seizures with incomplete return to baseline is under reconsideration in an effort to establish a more practical definition to guide management. Clinical research has focused on early seizure termination in the prehospital setting. The approach of early escalation to anaesthetic agents for refractory generalised convulsive status epilepticus, rather than additional trials of second-line anti-epileptic drugs, to avoid neuronal injury and pharmaco-resistance associated with prolonged seizures is gaining momentum. Status epilepticus is also increasingly identified in the inpatient setting as the use of extended electroencephalography monitoring becomes more commonplace. Substantial further research to enable early identification of status epilepticus and efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs will be important to improve outcomes.

Study selection

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or active treatment for adults (≥ 16 years old) with convulsive status epilepticus. We focused on RCTs because, compared to any other study designs, they are more likely to provide unbiased information on the effects of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in the adult population. Patients with a known epilepsy syndrome or with a reversible metabolic cause of seizures were deemed eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions were any benzodiazepine regardless of their route of administration (e.g. intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), intranasal, buccal, rectal, or oromucosal) offered as first-line treatment for convulsive status epilepticus on site either by non-medical staff (i.e. caregiver) or paramedics, or at arrival at the hospital by emergency department staff. Newer antiepileptic drugs (AED) including levetiracetam, sodium valproate, and phenytoin were considered, so far as they were used as first-line treatment in the pre-hospital setting or at arrival at the emergency department. We considered first-line treatment as any immediate pharmacological treatment, which could be repeated once, and second-line treatment as any subsequent pharmacological treatment, which involved the use of another class of drug such as an anticonvulsant. Eligibility of participants was not restricted to a specific definition of status epilepticus. Traditionally, status epilepticus was defined as a seizure lasting 30 or more min, but more recent definitions indicate 5 or more minutes of either continuous seizure activity or repetitive seizures with no recovery of consciousness in between.

The main outcomes of interest were the following: seizure cessation (measured either in terms of number of people with cessation of seizure activity within 5–15 min of study drug administration [or any designated period as specified by trial investigators]; or time to seizure cessation from the time of study drug administration); recurrence of seizures (measured either as number of people with recurrence of seizures within a designated period, or time from seizure cessation to recurrence); and adverse events, namely respiratory depression and 30-day mortality.

Agencies are responsible for prehospital care within defined geographic regions. Agencies using ESO cover all 9 Census divisions in urban and rural settings.

Data are recorded during evaluation, deidentified, and available in a public use research data set. 3 We identified patients aged 18 years or older with a paramedic impression of status epilepticus treated with midazolam, lorazepam, or diazepam from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020. We excluded 164 encounters for cardiac arrest. The University of California, San Francisco, institutional review board approved the study with waiver of consent because patient data were deidentified. We examined dose and route of the first benzodiazepine administered. We created 3 binary variables indicating whether the dose, the route, and the dose-route combination were consistent with guidelines. We then calculated the proportion of encounters in which treatment was consistent with expert guidelines for each variable, along with their corresponding 95% CIs.

1 To examine whether dosing variability reflected between-agency differences as opposed to within-agency paramedic and patient differences, we focused on patients given midazolam, who made up the majority. We estimated a mixed-effects model with an agency random intercept to calculate mean dose and determine the proportion of variance in dosing at the agency level. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 15.

1. Administer 10 mg intramuscularly as a single, 1-time dose. Administer 4 mg intravenously as a single 1-time dose that may be repeated once. Administer 6 to 10 mg intravenously as a single 1-time dose that may be repeated once. a Level A evidence from the American Epilepsy Society guidelines for adults weighing 40 kg or more.
2. Of the 9176 prehospital encounters we identified for status epilepticus across 743 agencies, 7665 patients were treated with midazolam, 1264 with lorazepam, and 245 with diazepam.

Each agency had a median of 38 encounters. Patients were a mean age of 46 years, 4526 were women, and 2730 received a subsequent dose of benzodiazepine. There were 357 encounters for which initial treatment was concordant with expert guidelines in the recommended dose and route. For midazolam, treatment was guideline concordant for 310 encounters, 2641 were route concordant, and 541 were dose concordant. For lorazepam, treatment was guideline concordant for 18 encounters, 928 were route concordant, and 35 were dose concordant. For diazepam, treatment was guideline concordant for 29 encounters, 191 were route concordant, and 38 (15.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^acb4668f]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — operational definition and classification are specified as SE defined as 5 min or more of (i) continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity or (ii) recurrent seizure activity without recovery (returning to baseline) between seizures; rationale includes that most clinical and electrographic seizures last less than 5 min and that permanent neuronal injury and pharmacoresistance may occur before the traditional definition of 30 min of continuous seizure activity, and experts have suggested including seizures lasting for 5 min or longer; SE can be classified by semiology, duration, and underlying etiology, with these guidelines focusing on convulsive, non-convulsive, and refractory SE.

Intensity and duration of treatment in refractory status epilepticus: There are currently no data to support a standardized regimen for the intensity and duration of treatment for RSE; the intensity of treatment is usually dictated by electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, with the goal of treatment being cessation of electrographic seizures or burst suppression; limited data suggest that the EEG background activity does not predict seizure control; it is recommended that cEEG findings, not serum drug levels, guide therapy; the optimal duration of maintaining electrographic seizure control is not known, although customarily control is maintained for 24–48 h followed by gradual withdrawal of the continuous infusion antiepileptic drug, and patients may have recurrent RSE upon initial withdrawal requiring return to prior or higher doses for an additional period of time; there is no defined duration of electrographic seizure control or "number of trials" after which care is considered futile.

### Status epilepticus [^8f870f37]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency that requires rapid and vigorous treatment to prevent neuronal damage and systemic complications. Failure to diagnose and treat status epilepticus accurately and effectively results in significant morbidity and mortality. Cerebral metabolic decompensation occurs after approximately 30 min of uncontrolled convulsive activity, and the window for treatment is therefore limited. Therapy should proceed simultaneously on four fronts: termination of seizures; prevention of seizure recurrence once status is controlled; management of precipitating causes of status epilepticus; management of the complications. This article reviews current opinions about the classification, aetiology and pathophysiology of adult generalised convulsive status epilepticus and details practical management strategies for treatment of this life-threatening condition.

Barbiturates for status epilepticus — evidence and dosing context. Barbiturates, notably phenobarbital, have been recommended but have fallen out of favor. In the only Class I study of refractory status epilepticus, initial phenobarbital was effective in terminating seizures 58.2% of the time. Additional studies found phenobarbital as effective as a combination of diazepam and phenytoin for untreated convulsive status epilepticus, and pentobarbital (bolus 13 mg/kg; infusion of 2 to 3 mg/kg per hour) was more successful than propofol (2 mg/kg bolus; infusion of 3 to 4 mg/kg per hour) in terminating status epilepticus, 73% versus 92%. The main limitation of barbiturates is the increased adverse effects profile, particularly hypotension and respiratory depression.

Participant characteristics

The mean age of participants in the four trials ranged from 48 years to 55.9 years in the active treatment arms and from 43.8 years to 53 years in the control groups. In all four trials, about half to three-quarters of the participants were male. In three of the included trials, the most common cause of convulsive status epilepticus was a sub-therapeutic level of antiepileptic drugs, while a brain lesion was reported as the most frequent cause in the fourth trial.

Table 2 presents a summary of the characteristics of participants in the four included trials.

### Priorities in pediatric epilepsy research: improving children's futures today [^619fba81]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The Priorities in Pediatric Epilepsy Research workshop was held in the spirit of patient-centered and patient-driven mandates for developing best practices in care, particularly for epilepsy beginning under age 3 years. The workshop brought together parents, representatives of voluntary advocacy organizations, physicians, allied health professionals, researchers, and administrators to identify priority areas for pediatric epilepsy care and research including implementation and testing of interventions designed to improve care processes and outcomes. Priorities highlighted were 1) patient outcomes, especially seizure control but also behavioral, academic, and social functioning; 2) early and accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment; 3) role and involvement of parents (communication and shared decision-making); and 4) integration of school and community organizations with epilepsy care delivery. Key factors influencing pediatric epilepsy care included the child's impairments and seizure presentation, parents, providers, the health care system, and community systems. Care was represented as a sequential process from initial onset of seizures to referral for comprehensive evaluation when needed. We considered an alternative model in which comprehensive care would be utilized from onset, proactively, rather than reactively after pharmacoresistance became obvious. Barriers, including limited levels of evidence about many aspects of diagnosis and management, access to care — particularly epilepsy specialty and behavioral health care — and implementation, were identified. Progress hinges on coordinated research efforts that systematically address gaps in knowledge and overcoming barriers to access and implementation. The stakes are considerable, and the potential benefits for reduced burden of refractory epilepsy and lifelong disabilities may be enormous.

Status epilepticus pharmacotherapy — prospective nonrandomized studies report seizure control with valproate, phenytoin, and levetiracetam with specified dosing and time-to-cessation outcomes. Patients with refractory convulsive status epilepticus who failed IV diazepam and IM phenobarbital were given valproate 30 mg/kg IV at 6 mg/kg/h, with cessation of motor activity within 1 h of starting infusion and valproate controlled seizures within 1 h in 88% (95% CI 78% to 97%). In a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, controlled study of patients with status epilepticus or acute repetitive seizures receiving either IV phenytoin 18 mg/kg or valproate 30 mg/kg, the outcome was cessation of seizures within 20 min and enrolled 74 patients, with control of seizures in 88% regardless of treatment group. In a prospective nonrandomized trial assigning refractory status epilepticus to IV valproate 30 mg/kg vs levetiracetam 30 mg/kg, with cessation of seizure (electroencephalogram [EEG]) after infusion as the outcome, 82 patients entered, with equal efficacy between the 2 treatments; valproate 68% vs levetiracetam 73%.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^8040ca0c]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Two review authors (MC, MI) independently screened all citations identified by the search strategies, retrieved and assessed for eligibility all potentially relevant full-text articles. The same review authors extracted data on study design, participants characteristics (number of participants in each group, demographic information), characteristics of intervention (provider, dose, and route of administration), and comparator intervention. The risk of bias of included trials was assessed by the same review authors using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Each risk of bias domain was assessed separately for objective and subjective outcomes. For the risk-of-bias assessment, we categorised seizure cessation, recurrence of seizure, and respiratory depression (without ventilation) as subjective outcomes and mortality and respiratory depression (requiring ventilation) as objective outcomes.

At all stages of the study selection and data collection process, disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus or referred to a third review author (CC or MB).

Data synthesis

We planned to conduct random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses; however, due to the limited number of identified trials and their heterogeneity in terms of treatment comparisons and reported outcomes, this proved unfeasible. We also considered conducting a systematic review of economic evaluations but failed to identify sufficient evidence in the current literature. Results of each included study were tabulated and summarised narratively for each outcome.

### Emergency seizure management [^9f245bf0]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Seizures are a common presentation in both emergency departments and general pediatric practices. Epilepsy affects more than 3.4 million people nationwide, of which approximately 500,000 are children, with greater than 200,000 first-time seizures each year. 1 Of the affected individuals, as many as 100,000 are estimated to experience status epilepticus (SE). Both general practitioners and neurologists alike must be able to define, recognize and treat seizure emergencies. This review article defines and describes SE, discusses the emergency evaluation and management of SE that is both new-onset and breakthrough in people with epilepsy, reviews the current treatment recommendations for SE in both the home and hospital settings, and introduces special populations that may be at high risk for SE or other seizure emergencies.

### New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) [^7451fa32]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

New-onset refractory status epilepticus and its subcategory febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome are rare devastating clinical presentations in those without pre-existing relevant history, often in schoolchildren or young adults, without a clear cause on initial investigations. A cause is later identified in up to half of adults, but in many fewer children. Patients often require protracted intensive care and are at significant risk of dying. Functional disability is common and subsequent chronic epilepsy is the norm, but some people do have good outcomes, even after prolonged status epilepticus. Patients need prompt investigations and treatment. Anaesthetic and antiseizure medications are supplemented by other treatment modalities, including the ketogenic diet. Despite limited evidence, it is appropriate to try to modify the presumed underlying pathogenesis with immune modulation early, with a more recent focus on using interleukin inhibitors. Optimising management will require concerted multicentre international efforts.

### Advances in the management of generalized convulsive status epilepticus: what have we learned? [^39d8eaed]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most serious manifestation of an epileptic diathesis. In the early stages (5–30 min), there exists class A evidence to support the efficacy of benzodiazepines as first-line treatment. As status epilepticus progresses into the later stages, the evidence for treatment becomes less robust until we are depending upon short case series and case reports for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. However, the past year saw the publication of three randomized controlled trials in the setting of benzodiazepine-resistant established convulsive status epilepticus: the EcLiPSE and ConSEPT studies, compared levetiracetam to phenytoin in children; and the ESETT study compared fosphenytoin, levetiracetam and sodium valproate in adults and children. In addition, the emergence of data from the SENSE study, a multicentre multinational prospective cohort study and the publication of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the mortality of status epilepticus over the past 30 years, has brought the treatment of status epilepticus into sharp focus. In this update we provide a detailed analysis of these studies and their impact on clinical practice. We review contentious areas of management in status epilepticus where a consensus is lacking and advance the case for more research on existing and alternative treatment strategies.

### Status epilepticus and acute serial seizures in children [^dd84c58f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is defined as a seizure that persists for a sufficient length of time or is repeated frequently enough to produce a fixed and enduring epileptic condition of 30 minutes or longer. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition that often occurs in children. The degree of mortality and neurologic morbidity, as well as the risk for recurrence, is highly dependent on the etiology and duration of the seizures. Although much has been written about pediatric status epilepticus, many issues remain unresolved. A better understanding of the different types of seizures and their etiologies may help in the prevention and treatment of status epilepticus. The vast extent of status epilepticus in both children and adults mandates that new options for prevention and treatment be given a close scrutiny and high priority. This article will review the most current information on convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, including the potential for neurologic damage, changes in magnetic resonance imaging after status epilepticus, risk for recurrence, and current treatment options available for treating status epilepticus in children.

Diagnostic evaluation after stabilization of SE — testing guidance — advises that once SE is under control and vital signs are stable, specific diagnostic studies can be performed. A lumbar puncture is generally needed if there is any suspicion of a central nervous system infection, but may not be required if meningitis is not suspected, particularly in patients with AED non-compliance. A comprehensive toxicology screen should be obtained if there is no clear etiology for SE, and specific toxicology testing should be performed if the history or physical examination suggests a specific toxin. Additional critical care management may apply to those with suspected elevated intracranial pressure and/or mass effect.

For all patients, obtain fingerstick glucose, monitor vital signs, perform head computed tomography (CT) scan (appropriate for most cases), order laboratory test: blood glucose, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, calcium (total and ionized), magnesium, AED levels, and initiate continuous electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring. Based on clinical presentation, consider brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture (LP), a comprehensive toxicology panel including toxins that frequently cause seizures (i.e. isoniazid, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, cocaine, sympathomimetics, alcohol, organophosphates, and cyclosporine), and other laboratory tests: liver function tests, serial troponins, type and hold, coagulation studies, arterial blood gas, AED levels, toxicology screen (urine and blood), and inborn errors of metabolism.

Urgent control therapy selection for status epilepticus — preferred top tier agents "are IV fosphenytoin/phenytoin, valproate sodium, phenobarbital, levetiracetam, or continuous infusion midazolam". Among these, "fosphenytoin may be preferred for most patients with the exception of patients (particularly children) with a history of primary generalized epilepsy, where valproate sodium would be the best choice". The general principle is "rapid administration of an AED that will quickly reach a therapeutic level requires selection of an intravenously administered compound", and "it is reasonable to provide an IV bolus of this AED, if available, prior to initiating an additional agent", which "may include additional boluses that will result in higher than normal target concentrations of the AED to achieve the desired therapeutic response (i.e., cessation of seizure activity)".
