## Question

Who to follow for pilondial cyst

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who should be followed for pilonidal cyst disease and how follow-up should be structured. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and its phases. Then, I should verify which patients actually warrant follow-up versus those who can be discharged. Next, I will review what high-quality guidelines say about follow-up cadence, wound care, and outcome assessment. After that, I should consider special populations and procedure-specific nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified follow-up plan and highlight what to monitor and when to escalate care, making sure I anchor each point to the best available guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its phases, because I need to ensure we are talking about the same condition and stages. Pilonidal disease spans acute abscess, chronic sinus disease, and postoperative recovery, and the intensity and type of follow-up depend on which phase the patient is in and what intervention was performed, if any [^366faddd] [^73b0e1e5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal follow-up. I should verify who actually needs follow-up. Patients with symptomatic disease, those managed operatively, and those with recurrence risk generally warrant follow-up, whereas asymptomatic incidental findings or patients who have undergone definitive surgery with uneventful healing may be discharged with patient education and return precautions, consistent with guideline emphasis on tailoring follow-up to clinical context and patient goals [^be43d489] [^496423a0].

> Next, I should review what the major guidelines say about follow-up cadence and content. The ASCRS guideline advises continuing management and follow-up as clinically appropriate, which implies individualized scheduling rather than a fixed interval, while the ESCP guideline explicitly recommends using a quality-of-life assessment tool to evaluate postoperative impact, reinforcing patient-centered outcomes in follow-up planning [^be43d489] [^ded20177].

> I will now examine wound care and recurrence-prevention elements that commonly drive follow-up needs. Wait, let me verify the stance on postoperative hair removal. The ESCP recommends avoiding routine postoperative hair removal around the natal cleft to reduce recurrence, which contradicts older practices and should shape counseling and follow-up logistics, while both societies emphasize meticulous hygiene and, when used, surgeon-directed hair control strategies rather than patient-performed shaving in the immediate postoperative period [^f3bfd361] [^dda30f64] [^2cd6cd8f].

> Let me consider special populations, because I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Adolescents are generally managed per adult pathways, so follow-up principles align with adult care, whereas patients with complex or recurrent disease, obesity, smoking, or diabetes may benefit from closer surveillance and optimization of modifiable risks before and after intervention, which can extend follow-up and add preoperative counseling visits [^434cc228] [^2d762fbb] [^d40bf79b].

> Now, I should review procedure-specific nuances that change follow-up intensity. After incision and drainage of an acute abscess, recurrence risk is substantial, so follow-up should include wound checks and a plan for definitive management if disease persists, whereas after minimally invasive procedures, early follow-up focuses on wound healing and symptom control given higher failure but faster recovery, and after flap-based repairs, early checks for dehiscence and longer-term assessment of recurrence are prudent [^b41e25fb] [^186fe5b0] [^f949e658].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified follow-up plan, but I should double-check that it aligns with guideline flexibility. For low-risk patients after uneventful definitive surgery, a single visit at about 2 to 6 weeks with discharge if healed and asymptomatic is reasonable, with patient education on hygiene and return precautions. For moderate-risk patients, arrange visits at 1 to 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 to 6 months to assess wound healing, symptoms, and quality of life, and consider a 12-month check-in if recurrence risk remains. For high-risk or complex cases, schedule visits every 1 to 2 weeks until wound closure, then monthly to 3 months, and periodically to 12 months, integrating risk-factor modification and patient-reported outcomes [^be43d489] [^ded20177].

> But wait, what exactly should I monitor at each visit to make this actionable. I should confirm that we track pain, drainage, wound integrity, and functional recovery, screen for recurrence with inspection of the natal cleft for pits or tracts, and administer a quality-of-life tool such as the EQ-5D or a disease-specific instrument when available, while also reassessing modifiable risks like smoking, obesity, and glycemic control if relevant to ongoing care or planning [^ded20177] [^e4f67ce6] [^2d762fbb].

> I need to ensure I address when to escalate or change course. Persistent drainage beyond about 6 to 8 weeks, recurrent abscess, new midline pits, or failure to return to normal activities by 3 months should prompt re-evaluation of the surgical strategy, consideration of alternative techniques such as flap procedures or minimally invasive options, and optimization of risk factors, consistent with guidance to individualize operative choices in recurrence and to consider flap-based repairs for complex or refractory disease [^992ec283] [^5a556e93] [^2d762fbb].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of shared decision-making in follow-up planning, because patient preferences meaningfully influence acceptable trade-offs between recurrence risk and recovery burden. Real-world data show patients often prioritize rapid return to activities over absolute recurrence prevention, and surgeons may not always offer the full range of options, so documenting goals of care and aligning follow-up intensity with those goals improves satisfaction and may reduce decision regret [^186fe5b0] [^ca3f24cb] [^cb51d3ad].

> In summary, I should confirm that follow-up for pilonidal cyst disease is not one-size-fits-all. It should be risk-stratified, phase-specific, and patient-centered, anchored in guideline-based principles of individualized care, quality-of-life assessment, and selective surveillance for recurrence, with closer follow-up for symptomatic, complex, or postoperative patients and simpler, shorter follow-up for low-risk, asymptomatic, or definitively treated cases with uneventful healing [^be43d489] [^ded20177] [^496423a0].

For pilonidal cysts, **follow-up should be with a colorectal or general surgeon** for surgical management, and with a **primary care provider** for ongoing surveillance and wound care. Follow-up is essential after incision and drainage [^cfd07bc3] to monitor healing, prevent recurrence, and address risk factors such as hygiene and hair control [^dda30f64]. For chronic or recurrent disease, **specialist follow-up** is recommended to guide definitive procedures and minimize recurrence [^992ec283] [^2d762fbb]. Patients should return if symptoms recur or complications arise, as recurrence is common without proper follow-up [^b41e25fb] [^2746d217].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Primary care provider (PCP)**: Patients typically present to their PCP with symptoms such as pain, swelling, redness, or drainage in the sacrococcygeal region. The PCP performs an initial evaluation, including history and physical examination, to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease [^73b0e1e5].

- **Specialist referral**: If the disease is chronic, recurrent, or complicated, the PCP refers the patient to a specialist, typically a colorectal surgeon or general surgeon, for further evaluation and management [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management and follow-up

- **Colorectal or general surgeon**: Surgeons are responsible for definitive management, including incision and drainage of abscesses [^cfd07bc3], excision of chronic disease, and closure techniques such as primary closure, secondary intention, or flap procedures [^40db8312] [^5a556e93].

- **Postoperative follow-up**: Regular follow-up visits are essential to monitor wound healing, manage complications, and provide patient education on hygiene and hair control to prevent recurrence [^be43d489] [^dda30f64].

---

## Long-term surveillance and recurrence prevention

- **Primary care provider**: After surgical management, the PCP plays a crucial role in long-term surveillance, monitoring for recurrence, and managing risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle [^6a78af2d].

- **Patient education**: Patients are educated on proper hygiene, hair removal techniques [^10b97084], and lifestyle modifications to minimize recurrence risk [^2d762fbb].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

In complex or recurrent cases, a **multidisciplinary approach** may involve wound care specialists, dermatologists, and infectious disease specialists to optimize outcomes and reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Summary of follow-up care providers

| **Phase of care** | **Primary provider** | **Role** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial evaluation | Primary care provider | - Diagnosis <br/> - Initial management <br/> - Referral to specialist |
| Surgical management | Colorectal or general surgeon | - Definitive surgical treatment <br/> - Postoperative care |
| Long-term surveillance | Primary care provider | - Monitoring for recurrence <br/> - Risk factor management |
| Complex cases | Multidisciplinary team | - Comprehensive care <br/> - Recurrence prevention |

---

Patients with pilonidal cysts should follow up with a **colorectal or general surgeon** for surgical management and a **primary care provider** for long-term surveillance and recurrence prevention.

Most nodules 1 cm or smaller can be followed with ultrasonography in six months. 4, 5 Fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be considered for smaller nodules in patients with risk factors. 5 Fine-needle aspiration is recommended for nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm with hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, or intranodular vascularity. The ACR recommends MRI to further characterize pancreatic cysts. 1 Surgery is recommended for cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features. Aspiration is recommended for smaller cysts if surgery is being considered; otherwise, radiologic monitoring is suggested for lesions 1 to 3 cm in size.

The American College of Gastroenterology recommends endoscopic ultrasonography with aspiration of cysts for biochemical marker analysis to stratify risk.
18. The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted method to triage renal lesions. 1, 27 Lesions classified as category I or II do not need to be followed. Nonenhancing complex cysts larger than 3 cm have a 5% to 10% risk of malignancy and should be followed with imaging, although the frequency of monitoring is not well defined. The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound has published consensus guidelines showing images of low- and high-risk cysts, with recommendations for management. 29 Physiologic cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women and simple cysts 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women are considered normal.

For other lesions, frequency of monitoring is not well defined but may range from six to 12 weeks for more concerning lesions, or even yearly for lesions such as dermoids or endometriomas. In most cases, fibromas, benign calcifications without associated masses, hydrosalpinx, and peritoneal inclusion cysts need not be followed. Endometriomas and cystic teratomas have very low malignant transformation but should be followed with ultrasonography. Red flag characteristics for adnexal lesions include thickened walls/septa and solid components with blood flow.

Pilonidal disease — nonoperative hair removal states that elimination of hair from the gluteal cleft and surrounding skin, by shaving or laser epilation, may be used for both acute and chronic pilonidal disease in the absence of abscess as a primary or adjunct treatment measure, with the stated Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Shaving or laser epilation can serve as an adjunct treatment in active disease, as the sole agent of therapy, or as a preventative tool in the setting of chronic disease to avoid recurrent flares and abscess formation. In acute pilonidal disease, limited lateral incision and drainage (I&D) or cyst excision combined with surgeon-performed shaving along the intergluteal fold and surrounding region promotes healing and prevents disease recurrence, and shaving should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until healing occurs and used in combination with hygiene enforcement.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^b41e25fb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Operative management — acute pilonidal abscess: Patients with an abscess should be treated with incision and drainage (I&D) regardless of whether it is primary or recurrent, with a Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate‑quality evidence, 1B. For first‑episode abscesses, overall successful healing reaches 60%, but simple I&D carries an estimated 15% to 40% recurrence rate; I&D also appears to have a protective effect on recurrence after surgical excision at 20‑year follow‑up. An unroofing (lay open) and curettage procedure is a 1‑step option that potentially avoids the need for a second procedure, and in a randomized trial curettage achieved greater complete healing at 10 weeks (96% versus 79%).

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^ac6a9fb8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Pilonidal disease — chronic surgical management options are as follows: Patients who require surgery for chronic pilonidal disease may undergo excision and primary repair (with consideration for off-midline closure), excision with healing by secondary intention, or excision with marsupialization based on surgeon and patient preference; drain use should be individualized. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Compared with excision with healing by secondary intention, primary midline closure shows faster median healing (range, 23–65 d) and less time off work (≈10.48 vs 5.75 d). Recurrence with primary midline closure is higher than with secondary intention in a Cochrane review (8.7% after primary closure versus 5.3% with secondary intention), and healing by secondary intention reduced recurrence rates by 35%, with additional studies estimating a 60% reduction in recurrent disease risk; although high-volume series of primary closure have reported recurrence rates of < 6%, this is generally not the case. For marsupialization, primary closure had improved healing times (range, 3–9 wk); recurrence was similar in one study (4%–6%) but lower with marsupialization in another (1.5% versus 17.0% after primary closure), and marsupialization versus wide local excision showed a faster mean time to healing by a mean of 13 weeks with lower complication and reoperative rates.

### Evidence-based answer… [^9e461562]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the appropriate follow-up for a patient with an ovarian cyst identified on ultrasonography. A cyst identified on transvaginal ultrasonography is usually benign if it is thin-walled, unilocular, smooth-bordered, and less than 10 cm in diameter. Cyst aspiration and treatment with combined oral contraceptives do not hasten cyst resolution. A complex cyst without benign features should be aggressively evaluated for ovarian cancer. Evidence Summary Ovarian cysts are common, appearing in one in five women, and should be evaluated with high-frequency gray-scale transvaginal ultrasonography.

1 Possible diagnoses include pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, endometriosis, ruptured cyst, and ovarian cancer. 2 Women have a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk of developing a suspicious adnexal mass that requires surgery. 1 Among those who undergo surgery, 13 to 21 percent have ovarian cancer.

### The management of pilonidal disease: a systematic review [^c8f91e4f]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to derive recommendations from the medical literature regarding the management of pilonidal disease.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from 1965 through June 2017 were queried for any papers addressing operative or non-operative management of pilonidal disease. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Consensus recommendations were derived for three questions based on the best available evidence, and a clinical practice guideline was constructed.

Results

A total of 193 articles were fully analyzed. Some non-operative and minimally invasive techniques have outcomes at least equivalent to operative management. Minimal surgical procedures (Gips procedure, sinusectomy) may be more appropriate as first-line treatment than radical excision due to faster recovery and patient preference, with acceptable recurrence rates. Excision with midline closure should be avoided. For recurrent or persistent disease, any type of flap repair is acceptable and preferred by patients over healing by secondary intention. There is a lack of literature dedicated to the pediatric patient.

Conclusions

There is a definitive trend towards less invasive procedures for the treatment of pilonidal disease, with equivalent or better outcomes compared with classic excision. Midline closure should no longer be the standard surgical approach.

Type Of Study

Systematic review of level 1–4 studies.

Level Of Evidence

Level 1–4 (mainly level 3–4).

### Pilonidal disease [^6f6e0bdc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pilonidal disease is a disease of young people, usually men, which can result in an abscess, draining sinus tracts, and moderate debility for some. It probably results from hair penetration beneath the skin, for reasons that are not totally clear. Therapy should be simple, inflict minimal pain, have a short hospitalization, have a low recurrence rate, require minimal wound care, and allow rapid return to normal activity. No treatment meets all these ideal goals. Therefore, starting with a simple treatment and progressing to other treatments if failure occurs despite meticulous wound care and hair shaving is the logical approach. Table 1 depicts treatments from simple to more complex.

### Experience with pilonidal disease in children [^e4e840d7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists regarding the optimum treatment for pediatric pilonidal disease. It is a complex disease process with a high rate of recurrence. A spectrum of surgical strategies exists, including drainage, cyst marsupialization, complete cyst and sinus tract excision with primary versus secondary closure, and excision utilizing flap closure. There is little published in the pediatric literature; therefore, we reviewed our experience in an attempt to document how various interventions affect the natural history.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted in which all patients who underwent surgical intervention for pilonidal disease at our institution from January 2000 to June 2010 were identified. Data collection included demographics, surgical procedure performed, presence of wound breakdown, presence of infection, recurrence, total procedures performed, number of follow-up visits, and total hospital days.

Results

In the study period, 120 patients were identified, and 58% were female. Mean age was 14.9 y old (1–19 y). These patients were then subdivided into closed versus open groups based on the status of their operative wound. In the closed group, 74 patients underwent excision with midline closure and 18 underwent excision with flap closure. There were 28 patients left open after excision. In the closed group, wound breakdown occurred in a total of 41 patients (45%). There was no difference in breakdown between midline and flap closure. Postoperative wound infection occurred in 15% of all patients. The midline closure group had a higher infection rate (20%) compared with those with flap closures (11%), which was not significant (P = 0.30). There was no difference in recurrence rate between patients who were primarily closed and patients who were left open (20.6% versus 25%, P = 0.51). There was also no difference in their hospital length of stay (0.44 ± 2.53 d versus 1.18 ± 2.9 d, P = 0.18). Conversely, the patients who were left open had more follow-up visits (6.48 ± 7.6 versus 4.18 ± 3.3, P = 0.02) and subsequently required more operative procedures (1.71 ± 1.12 versus 1.25 ± 0.49, P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Management of pilonidal disease remains a complex problem, and operative intervention is fraught with complications, including wound breakdown, infection, and cyst recurrence. Primary closure appears to have better outcomes compared with healing by secondary intention. There does not appear to be a clear advantage of primary closure utilizing flaps over primary closure based on our early experience with flap closures.

CONCLUSION

Despite significant rates of postoperative complications, treatment failure and protracted recovery after pilonidal sinus surgery, shared decision‐making appears to be carried out very well in the UK and decision regret among patients undergoing surgery for PSD is low. Nevertheless, it is likely that patients are not always offered the full remit of available treatment options.

Pilonidal disease — management of acute abscess during definitive excision shows that local excision of the abscess and midline pits allowing secondary-intention healing has not been shown to alter recurrence, hospital stay, or overall healing time, though there was a trend toward increased days off work (14 vs 7 d; p = 0.06). When comparing total excision with secondary intention versus I&D followed by delayed excision and primary closure at 3 weeks, there was no difference in recurrence at 6 months, but at 12 months the primary closure group had significantly higher recurrence (14% vs 0%; p < 0.05), with no difference in wound infection or wound healing rates.

### Pilonidal reality calls for action [^69f1ebf5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Follow-up

Another strength of this study is the prospective data collection and the meticulous attempt to follow up, with 71% of patients available for a very short follow-up at 6 months after surgery. This may reflect selection bias or perhaps the challenges of multicentre trials, as many of the existing specialized single-centre studies on PSD present surprisingly adherent follow-up even after 5 and more years. However, a meta-analysishas highlighted the bias that long-term recurrence rates in PSD are much higher in RCTs than in non-RCTs. With more rigorous follow-up as part of the RCT design, this suggests that the abundance of retrospective trials may have contributed to a falsely deflated risk of recurrence, as these follow-ups may, in reality, be inadequate or flawed. On the other hand, RCTs may have downsides of their own.

### Pilonidal reality calls for action [^2746d217]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Endpoint

This study aimed to report patient and risk-adjusted outcomes. For the evaluation of treatment strategies, follow-up at 6 months after surgery must be considered short, representing an early outcome. The 45% complication rate aside, 20% of treatments resulted in failure within the first 6 months. Furthermore, with 25% of patients presenting with prolonged healing, more are certainly to come with a longer observation period. The authors have done readers the rare favour of defining what constitutes a failure in this study, and, although this definition may be broader than the traditionally reported 'PSD recurrence after full healing', the failure rate is still much higher than in existing literature. A meta-analysis conducted by Stauffer et al. encompassing nearly 90 000 patients with PSD from the global literature (including both RCTs and non-RCTs), revealed a 2% recurrence rate per year of follow-up, for comparison.

### Pilonidal reality calls for action [^26c5df55]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The article by Brown et al.on real-world practice and outcomes in pilonidal surgery, published in this issue, is exceptionally intriguing and highly relevant as it reveals a glaring lack of knowledge and expertise in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease (PSD).

PSD is an acquired inflammatory condition in the upper natal cleft primarily affecting young individuals in education or employment. Although considered straightforward by most, high-risk subpopulations appear to exist, characterized by early onset, family history, stiff hair, and co-morbidities. The burden on both patients and society is substantial, yet very little is being done to improve — or even understand — outcomes. The efforts of the National Institute for Health Research and the PITSTOP management group to enhance understanding of PSD management and to guide future research are therefore highly commendable.

Abstract

Background

Numerous surgical approaches exist for the treatment of pilonidal disease. Current literature on treatment is of poor quality, limiting the ability to define optimal intervention. The aim of this study was to provide real-world data on current surgical practice and report patient and risk-adjusted outcomes, informing future trial design.

Methods

This UK-wide multicentre prospective cohort study, including patients (aged over 16 years) who had definitive treatment for symptomatic pilonidal disease, was conducted between May 2019 and March 2022. Patient and disease characteristics, and intervention details were analysed. Data on patient-reported outcomes, including pain, complications, treatment failure, wound issues, and quality of life, were gathered at various time points up to 6 months after surgery. Strategies were implemented to adjust for risk influencing different treatment choices and outcomes.

Results

Of the 667 participants consenting, 574 (86.1%) were followed up to the study end. Twelve interventions were observed. Broadly, 59.5% underwent major excisional surgery and 40.5% minimally invasive surgery. Complications occurred in 45.1% of the cohort. Those who had minimally invasive procedures had better quality of life and, after risk adjustment, less pain (score on day 1: mean difference 1.58, 95% c.i. 1.14 to 2.01), fewer complications (difference 17.5 (95% c.i. 9.1 to 25.9)%), more rapid return to normal activities (mean difference 25.9 (18.4 to 33.4) days) but a rate of higher treatment failure (difference 9.6 (95% c.i. 17.3 to 1.9)%). At study end, 25% reported an unhealed wound and 10% had not returned to normal activities.

Conclusion

The burden after surgery for pilonidal disease is high and treatment failure is common. Minimally invasive techniques may improve outcomes at the expense of a 10% higher risk of treatment failure.

Pilonidal disease without abscess — phenol application — is endorsed with strong recommendation and moderate-quality evidence, with reports of low complication and recurrence rates and high healing. The guideline states that phenol application is effective with a Grade of Recommendation 1B. Reported outcomes include minor complications in < 15% of patients, resolution of disease in 67% to 100%, and elimination of recurrence in ≥ 80%; the procedure typically uses 1 to 3 mL of crystallized phenol and most often requires One to 4 procedures. Studies note 100% healing when laser epilation preceded phenol, and a randomized trial found healing in 100% of patients in both phenol and surgery groups with recurrence 19% and 13% (p = 0.92). In recurrent disease, phenol injection with weekly depilatory use showed low subsequent recurrence rates of 0%–11% at extended follow-up.

Pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa are common problems that affect young adults. The surgical management of pilonidal disease should be tailored to the individual clinical presentation and its goal is the resolution of pilonidal disease with low recurrence and low morbidity.

Treatment for both conditions needs to be individualized to the clinical presentation.

Recurrent skin abscesses — appropriate treatment includes the following recommendations: A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). Culture recurrent abscess and treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

Pilonidal disease — evaluation and risk factors guidance indicates to evaluate for concomitant fistulous disease, Crohn's disease, or other anorectal pathology; if skin lesions have a suspicious appearance, biopsy should be performed. Risk factors associated with pilonidal disease include obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, repetitive trauma or irritation to the gluteal cleft skin, familial history of pilonidal disease, and a hirsute body habitus, and a positive family history of pilonidal disease is a risk factor for disease and may be associated with a higher recurrence rate after surgery. Adjunctive laboratory or radiological examinations are not routinely necessary.

### Minimal excision and primary suture is a cost-efficient definitive treatment for pilonidal disease with low morbidity: a population-based interventional and a cross-sectional cohort study [^a70ca6d6]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that the consistent use of the mLM operation for treating pilonidal disease is cost-efficient with low post-operative morbidity and long-term results comparable with more extensive methods, both compared with historical controls and in comparison of the treatment of pilonidal disease between three hospitals. The method also consumes less resources for the health care system and the society. The operation is performed as an outpatient procedure at the office under local anaesthesia with no need for hospital admission or sick leave. Most patients can return to work or school the same day.

In the original method the wounds after the excisions were left open for healing by secondary intention, in accordance with traditional surgical principles not to close an infected cavity. The disadvantage is prolonged time to healing. It also leaves an entrance for contagious material and hairs with risk for recurrent sinus. Bascom, in his similar pit-picking procedure, closed the wounds after the excision of the sinuses in the midline but added a lateral incision for excision of inflamed tissue and drainage, which was left open. This wound may take up to several months to heal.

Our modification consists of suturing the wounds. This will shorten the healing time, stop further contamination and prevent the formation of new sinuses. Although we did not prescribe any antibiotics we did not observe any adverse effects. There was no early abscess formation. Most wounds were healed when the sutures were removed after 10 days, as shown by the few number of post-operative visits.

Our estimated recurrence rate of 32% may seem high but is similar to many others using more extensive methods, although the reported recurrence rate after surgical treatment for pilonidal cyst varies considerably between studies. Possible explanations are differences in definitions and method and length of follow as recurrences may come after many years. We have made an effort to reach all our patients for follow-up, and all patients having symptoms suggesting recurrence were clinically assessed.

Minimally invasive pilonidal disease — endoscopic or video-assisted techniques may be used but require specialized equipment and expertise, and are graded as follows: Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. Initial reports indicated a short-term recurrence rate of 0% to 3% at 6 to 12 months of follow-up with rapid return to work or normal activities; a prospective multicenter endoscopic series enrolled 250 patients and revealed a 94% healing rate by 26 days with a 5% recurrence rate. A randomized controlled trial comparing video-assisted ablation of pilonidal sinus (VAAPS) with the Bascom cleft-lift in 145 patients with follow-up of 12 months showed faster time to return to work with lower pain scores, fewer complications, lower infection rate, and increased patient satisfaction, but the authors did not report any long-term success rate or recurrence rate, stating that a 12-month follow-up was too short from which to draw conclusions. A small prospective study of VAAPS plus phenol achieved a 100% success rate at 22 months of follow-up in 23 patients. The guideline adds that video-assisted techniques may prove to be effective over the long term but require specialized equipment and expertise, and that we lack large-scale definitive data on which to make definitive recommendations regarding the superiority of these techniques over any other.

Classification and treatment

As expected, a broad spectrum of treatments was offered across different PSD categories. This variety in types of procedure considered appropriate for patients with different disease characteristics suggests lack of a standardized and well defined treatment strategy. Almost half of patients presented with type 2 manifestations, which represent disease with lateral extension (International Pilonidal Society classification). This is a very heterogeneous group covering a wide spectrum of PSD ranging from simple to potentially complex disease (for example, bilateral extension or extension(s) far from the midline). This calls for further subclassification to study outcomes and tailor treatments.

Drivers of surgical decision-making were examined in this study, which, besides the identified factors, are influenced by the level of training/expertise, surgical experience with PSD, available guidelines, local practice, and perhaps resources allocated to the field. There is no information on the level of training and expertise among the surgeons participating in this trial, besides the fact that their annual caseload was low. Tools to support or guide decision-making are highly warranted. As such, treatment guidelines exceeding the Italianand Germanguidelines are currently being developed within the European Society of Coloproctology.

Return to normal activity and wound healing

Nearly all participants had returned to normal activity by the end of follow-up, but only 75% reported complete wound healing (Fig. 2). The median time to return to normal activity was shorter among those who had minimally invasive procedures compared with patients who had major excisional procedures (7 versus 32 days) (Table 2). At 6 months, 12% of participants who had major excisional procedures and 4% of those who had minimally invasive procedures were yet to return to normal activity (assuming that patients lost to follow-up before 6 months had the same rate of return to normal activity as the observed group) (Fig. 3). If a best-case scenario was used, in which patients lost to follow-up were assumed to have recovered completely, the proportion of participants who had not returned to normal activity at 6 months would have been 4% for major excisional procedures and 2% for minimally invasive procedures.

Treatment failure

Major excisional procedures were associated with a significant reduction in treatment failure of around 10–12% (adjusted risk difference −9.6 (95% c.i. −17.3 to −1.9)%) (Table 2). Other risk-adjusted models are presented in Table S4. Pairwise comparisons of those undergoing asymmetric versus minimally invasive procedures produced results similar to those of the analysis that included all major excisional procedures (Table S5).

Pilonidal disease without abscess — fibrin glue — may be effective as primary or adjunctive therapy, but overall benefit remains uncertain. The guideline states: in chronic pilonidal disease without abscess, fibrin glue may be effective, with a Grade of Recommendation 2B. Observational series included 6 to 50 patients and described healing at 2 to 6 weeks, with most patients able to return to normal activities within 2 weeks. A randomized trial of 32 patients reported that all in the fibrin glue group healed without evidence of recurrence at 8 months and had decreased wound drainage and hospital stay. Another randomized trial of 50 patients showed equal efficacy but decreased hospital stay (2 vs 4 d) and increased wound fluid collections (24% vs 8%) in the fibrin group. A 2017 Cochrane review concluded that the evidence for benefit is uncertain.

CONCLUSIONS

BPE is an effective, disease‐targeted and inexpensive MIS way to treat PD, simple to perform but better handled by surgeons with experience in this technique, especially when early 'recurrences' (or 'failures') are considered. Its low cost, low recurrence rate, short operating time and rapid postoperative recovery all recommend BPE. Finally, after surgery for PD, at least 5 years of follow‐up are needed to determine the surgical outcome.

### A survey of treatment preferences of UK surgeons in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease [^d7ec2d3a]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Pilonidal sinus is a common surgical condition which impacts a young and economically active population. There are limited data to guide treatment in this condition. The aim of this work was to assess current practice.

Method

A survey was developed as part of the PITSTOP study. It included questions on volume of practice, treatment preferences and training. The survey was delivered to consultant surgeons with a UK practice through social media, specialty surgical societies and through PITSTOP sites. Descriptive statistics were reported.

Results

Of the 200 people who received a link to the questionnaire, 109 completed it (response rate 54.5%). Respondents treated a median of 15 patients per year, with 20% of these having recurrent disease. Estimates of recurrence were higher than reported in the literature and higher than in a survey 10years ago. Nearly 50% of surgeons advocate nonsurgical treatment in some patients despite limited evidence. Two thirds practised interventions not favoured by guidelines, including excision and leave open and midline closure techniques. Invasive procedures tended to be favoured when minimally invasive procedures may be appropriate. Surgical training programmes were the key training setting for commonly offered procedures, with few other training opportunities reported. For some procedures, no formal training had been given.

Conclusion

This survey highlights issues with quality in pilonidal surgery in the UK, with persistence of potentially outdated techniques, no consistent treatment escalation plan, a suggestion of under- or overtreatment of disease and a high perception of failure. This may relate to the current system of training and lack of evidence-based guidance.

### Pilonidal cyst involving the clitoris: a case report [^f35c9c20]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A periclitoral pilonidal cyst or sinus is an exceedingly infrequent occurrence. Diagnostic criteria consist of a sinus tract or cyst containing hair follicles and inflammatory reaction in one or more partially or completely epithelialized sinus tracts. Follow-up of patients reported in the literature has been too short to provide a consensus in regard to the extent of surgery required to provide permanent cure.

Case

A 30-year-old patient was seen in consultation for evaluation of a chronic, draining periclitoral abscess that had been treated for approximately 2 years with multiple rounds of antibiotics and local incisions. Treatment consisted of a wide local excision of the cyst and multiple sinuses extending into the periclitoral area and labia minora. The shaft and glans of the clitoris were preserved. Primary closure and healing were accomplished.

Conclusion

Diagnosis and curative therapy of a pilonidal cyst of the clitoris require a thorough resection which can be accomplished with preservation of the clitoris.

The differential diagnosis of lipomas also includes liposarcomas; risk factors for malignancy are size greater than 10 cm, older age, rapid lesion growth, location on the thigh, and invasion into deeper tissue, such as nerve or bone, leading to a firm or fixed feeling on examination. Lesions concerning for malignancy should be imaged with computed tomography or contrast magnetic resonance imaging.
11. Pyogenic Granulomas Pyogenic granulomas are rapidly growing nodules that bleed easily. Their name is a misnomer, however, as these lesions are neither pyogenic nor granulomas. They are an acquired benign tumor often found on mucous membranes. They tend to occur on the head or neck, or at sites of previous penetrating trauma. They are common in infancy and childhood, and approximately 2% of women develop a mucosal lesion in the late first to second trimester of pregnancy. 17 Pyogenic granulomas are yellow to purplish, pulpy vascular lesions often surrounded by a scaly collarette.

They are usually removed because of their rapid growth and tendency to bleed. The differential diagnosis includes Spitz nevi, amelanotic melanoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma. Treatment options include shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base, and laser ablation 18. Multiple epidermal inclusion cysts are associated with Gardner syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition associated with colon cancer. Cysts that are unusual in number or location warrant screening for colon cancer. Malignancies can develop in cysts, but this is rare. 22 Diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cysts is based on appearance and palpation of a discrete, freely movable cyst or nodule. Careful inspection often reveals a central punctum.

Treatment is unnecessary unless desired by the patient, and can be accomplished via simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Inflamed or ruptured cysts often resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur. Intralesional steroid injections can hasten resolution of inflamed cysts and should be followed by interval excision.

### Real-world practice and outcomes in pilonidal surgery: pilonidal sinus treatment studying the options (PITSTOP) cohort [^d0325caa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients took a long time to heal. One-quarter of patients had not healed or had persistent disease at 6 months. Furthermore, around 10% of patients in this study had not resumed normal activities by 6 months, and around 20% reported treatment failure. This is in contrast to many other, mainly single-centre, studies, which reported extremely low treatment failure rates.

Confusion arises around the definition of recurrence. Although this could be considered as wound healing with disease then re-arising, studies often include disease that never heals after surgery. True recurrence is probably uncommon and requires a protracted length of time to detect precisely. It was not possible to evaluate this outcome within the limitations of the present study design and funding envelope. The definition used here included a composite of patient-reported recurrence and/or evidence of further intervention at least 6 months after surgery.

This work has limitations. Data were available for analysis for just 71.5% of patients at 6 months despite dedicated central research follow-up support. Recruitment and follow-up intervals crossed multiple COVID-19 waves, which doubtless had an impact, enhancing difficulties in retaining the demographic of the study as discussed above. Other limitations include heterogeneity related to the range of treatments: 12 in total. The small numbers of some procedures made analysis of individual interventions statistically unsound. To address this issue, interventions were categorized into two groups with similar underlying surgical principles; minimally invasive procedures focus on destruction/removal of the pit/underlying cavity, whereas major excisional procedures remove the disease and surrounding skin with or without closure of the remaining wound. This broad categorization may be criticized, particularly for the major excisional group, where excision and leave open or closure in the midline techniques may result in inferior outcomes compared with asymmetric closure techniques. However, meaningful statistical analysis was possible for the asymmetric group, and similar differences were observed.

### Comparison of common surgical procedures in non-complicated pilonidal sinus disease, a 7-year follow-up trial [^214e5b53]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pilonidal disease is a common problem in primary health care which may require immediate surgical referral. Although various management options have been proposed, so far there is no gold standard treatment. The aim of the present study was to determine which of the following techniques was superior as regards postoperative complications and recurrence, midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap.

Methods

A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Department of General Surgery. Patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled in the study from April 2009 to January 2012. All patients were randomized the day of surgery at the coordinating center by means of a computer program. Patients were randomized to receive midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and patients were discharged 6 h after surgery. Demographic characteristics, skin color, body hair type, family history, preoperative complaints and duration of symptoms, cyst size, intraoperative iatrogenic cyst rupture, the presence of a tuft of hairs in the cyst, surgical techniques, duration of drainage, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and recurrence were evaluated.

Results

One hundred and ninety-two patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled. Seventy-two patients were randomized to midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, 67 patients to midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap and 53 patients to Karydakis flap. The mean age was 25.66 ± 7.67 years. At 76-month follow-up, the overall complications and recurrence rates were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

In cases of non-complicated pilonidal sinus, we recommend surgical management using local anesthesia, outpatient surgery and the surgical approach with which the surgeon is most familiar.

### Noninfectious penile lesions | AAFP… [^5b136671]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

LICHEN SCLEROSUS Penile lichen sclerosus, also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans, occurs in males of all ages. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent malignant transformation. 13 Lichen sclerosus can be treated with moderate to ultrapotent fluorinated topical corticosteroids. Biopsy is indicated if squamous cell carcinoma is suspected. 20 Surgery is needed in patients with persistent disease or a history of squamous cell carcinoma. 18 Circumcision may be indicated in patients with lichen sclerosus limited to the glans penis and prepuce. Severe cases may require reconstructive surgery, 16, 19 although conservative management may be appropriate if the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits. 16 Systemic agents, such as retinoids, are reserved for severe cases of lichen sclerosus and when local therapy fails. 19 Long-term follow-up is appropriate to monitor for malignant transformation.

These lesions should be distinguished from pearly papules, which have a ring-like distribution on the coronal sulcus. Lichen nitidus papules may occur on the penis, as well as the upper limbs and abdomen. 31, 33 Patients are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. 31, 33 Patients rarely experience pruritus. 32, 33 The course of lichen nitidus is variable and can resolve spontaneously. 31 When treatment is indicated for cosmesis, options include corticosteroids, vitamin A analogues, cyclosporine, itraconazole, and phototherapy. 33 Laser ablation should be avoided because of the potential for scarring.
31. 34 One fourth of patients with lichen planus have lesions on the genitalia, and most patients also have extra-genital involvement. 35 Lichen planus lesions are raised, violaceous, flat-topped, polygonal papules 36. Fine white streaks may appear on the surface of the lesions.

The response to treatment of lichen planus is variable. 37, 38 Daily potent topical corticosteroids are usually effective but carry a risk of atrophy; however, weekend dosing of ultrapotent topical corticosteroids may be effective. For isolated lichen planus of the prepuce, circumcision is indicated when medical management fails. 39.

### Management of pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa [^a04c137d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa affect healthy young adults, causing discomfort and pain that leads to loss of work productivity and should be approached in a personalized manner. Patients with pilonidal disease should engage in hair removal to the sacrococcygeal region and surgical options considered. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be a morbid and challenging disease process. Medical management with topical agents, antibiotics, and biologics should be used initially but wide local excision should be considered in severe or refractory cases of the disease.

### Sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease [^53b6884b]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sacrococcygeal pilonidal is a common disease in active young adults. Many surgical methods have been proposed, although no clear consensus as to the optimal treatment has been reported. This review looks at the different surgical techniques available and examines the reported results of primary healing, recurrent disease and complications (including delayed healing).

Method

A literature search using the Medline database was performed to locate English language articles on surgery for pilonidal disease. Further articles were obtained from the references cited in the literature initially reviewed.

Results

Management should be tailored according to the individual and whether the disease is acute or chronic. Treatment should take into consideration hospital stay and return to work. Simple excision, curettage, partial lateral wall excision, or marsupialisation, are simple techniques with good results. They can be used for the initial surgery but their use is not recommended for recurrent disease. The modified rhomboid flap for recurrent disease has consistently shown positive results in terms of complication rates and recurrence.

Conclusion

We would recommend tailored treatment with simple excision for initial presentation and the modified rhomboid flap for recurrent disease.

Pilonidal disease — cleft-lift technique demonstrates high healing rates and quality-of-life benefit in limited randomized comparison. Bascom and Bascom reported successful healing in all patients in a series of 28 recurrent complicated cases, and a follow-up study of 69 patients with refractory nonhealing wounds reported a 96% healing rate. Additional case series report healing rates of > 80% to 97% in both primary and recurrent settings. Additional data indicate improved rates of healing and similar recurrence compared with lateral I&D with midline pit excision and closure, and a single randomized study showed improved short-term quality of life when compared with the Limberg flap.

Pilonidal disease — other flap options include V-Y advancement and Z-plasty with differing outcomes. Case series of V-Y advancement report minor wound complications, universal healing, and no disease recurrence, although these results are likely not typical. The Z-plasty technique has generally higher rates of wound complications and disease recurrence than other flap methods, yet randomized data show a significantly decreased need for additional surgical treatment after Z-plasty compared with healing by secondary intent, and additional randomized data show lower rates of surgical site infections, lower recurrence rates, and lower overall morbidity versus excision and secondary healing.

### Decision regret following surgical management of pilonidal disease [^23913591]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

One possible explanation for the inconsistency in favouring operations with a higher recovery burden is that surgeons may prioritize disease cure over symptom control and thus offer more invasive excisional approaches. Patients can only make treatment decisions based on the information they are given and if minimally invasive procedures are not offered, this may be inadvertently compromising the shared decision‐making process. An incomplete range of treatment options being presented to patients may reflect the lack of training received by surgeons on the management of PD. The apprentice style of UK surgical training for PD means that surgeons may only be exposed to one or two techniques, which they are then likely to use throughout their career. Consequently, shared decision making becomes difficult if a surgeon only specializes in one technique. Clinical teams should ensure that patients are provided with sufficient information on the range of surgical procedures available, and manage their expectations regarding aftercare, complications and recurrence. In this study we did not categorize thesurgeon, with regards to operative experience or surgical techniques offered to patients, in the decision‐making dyad. Further modelling, taking into account surgeon skill set or operative volume, would be an interesting approach but unfortunately, we were not able to model for this in the present study.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^2d762fbb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Management of recurrent pilonidal disease — operative strategies for recurrent pilonidal disease should distinguish between the presence of an acute abscess and chronic disease, considering the experience and expertise of the surgeon. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Proper hygiene, to include a trial of shaving, may remain a cornerstone in the outpatient management of recurrent disease, and recurrent abscesses should be surgically drained as if they were sentinel presentations; in the face of nonacute recurrence or chronically recurring pilonidal sinus disease, the goal should be a treatment strategy that allows the patient to resume a normal lifestyle as quickly as possible. Definitive flap-based procedures may be indicated if previous local excisions or multiple drainage procedures have been performed previously or if a minimally invasive approach may be entertained, with no strong evidence for either strategy; randomized data in recurrent patients comparing a modified asymmetric flap with a classical rhomboid flap demonstrated a lower wound infection rate (3% vs 23%), lower recurrence rate, shorter hospital stay, and faster return to work using the asymmetric flap. Thus, we recommend that patients be managed based on both the underlying presentation (ie, acute abscess, cellulitis, sinus, or subcutaneous tracts) and the goals, experience, and expertise of the surgeon, and it is recommended that known modifiable risk factors for surgical site occurrence, such as nutritional status, smoking cessation, glycemic control, and obesity, be optimized before embarking on repeat procedures.

### Choosing the correct side for karydakis flap [^7e3b3254]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Choosing the correct side for Karydakis flap in treatment of pilonidal disease in certain cases.

Method

When the cyst or diseased tissues appear deep into the opposite side it may create some annoying problems, like too thin skin edge, dead space and wound failure. Herein, a simple modification of skin incision marking to over-come this potential problem is described.

Conclusion

This simple technical offer could be useful when dealing with sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease in daily surgical practice.

Initial evaluation of pilonidal disease — history and examination: "A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and presence of secondary infection. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C". The guideline notes that "The diagnosis of pilonidal disease is most often a clinical one", urges distinction from "alternative diagnoses, such as hidradenitis suppurativa, infected skin furuncles, Crohn's disease, perianal fistula, and infectious processes, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and actinomycosis", and states that on exam patients "will almost always have characteristic midline pits in the gluteal cleft". Acute presentations may include "cellulitis or a painful, fluctuant mass indicating the presence of an abscess", whereas chronic disease is "most often associated with chronic draining sinus disease in the intergluteal fold". It adds, "Special attention should be directed toward identification of concomitant cellulitis or an acute abscess to direct additional therapy".

### An international survey exploring the management of pilonidal disease [^14c018d2]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Pilonidal disease (PD) is a common debilitating condition frequently seen in surgical practice. Several available treatments carry different benefit/risk balances. The aim of this study was to snapshot the current management of PD across European countries.

Method

Members affiliated to the European Society of Coloproctology were invited to join the survey. An invitation was extended to others via social media. The predictive power of respondents' and hospitals' demographics on the change of therapeutic approach was explored.

Results

Respondents (n = 452) were mostly men (77%), aged 26-60years, practising in both academic and public hospitals and with fair distribution between colorectal (51%) and general (48%) surgeons. A total of 331 (73%) respondents recommended surgery at first presentation of the disease. Up to 80% of them recommended antibiotic therapy and 95% did not use any classification of PD. A primary closure technique was the preferred procedure (29%), followed by open technique (22%), flap creation (7%), sinusectomy (7%) and marsupialization (7%). Approximately 27% of subjects would choose the same surgical technique even after a failure. Almost half (46%) perform surgery as office based. A conservative approach was negatively associated with acutely presenting PD (p < 0.001). Respondents who were not considering tailored surgery based on patient presentation tended to change their approach in the case of a failed procedure.

Conclusion

With the caveat of a heterogeneous number of respondents across countries, the results of our snapshot survey may inform the development of future guidelines.

### Real-world practice and outcomes in pilonidal surgery: pilonidal sinus treatment studying the options (PITSTOP) cohort [^3d85bbf5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pilonidal disease (PD) is an acquired disease driven by the embedding of loose hair within hair follicles usually located in the natal cleft. This triggers an inflammatory response leading to the formation of midline pits, sinuses, or abscesses. Individuals present with a painful abscess or develop a chronic cycle of pain and discharge from openings of interconnected subcutaneous tracts. Symptoms cause significant disruption to education, employment, relationships, and quality of life. The condition is common worldwide, and affects at least 26 per 100 000 of the population — predominantly young people in education or employment.

Management of PD is usually surgical; many interventions have been described, the majority involving excision of varying amounts of skin and subcutaneous tissue around the pits, with or without primary skin closure with sutures or flaps. Ideal outcomes include early return to normal activity and minimal complications related to infection, bleeding, recurrence, or healing. There is no consensus on what interventions offer the best outcomes, with the available literature reporting results from mostly low-quality, single-centre, retrospective cohorts. Studies are limited by inconsistent reporting of outcomes, lack of disease stratification, and absence of patient-reported outcomes. The limited data make it difficult to progress patient care and impair ability to design high-quality randomized studies.

This lack of consensus and the poor quality of current research was recognized by the National Institute for Health Research, which commissioned the PITSTOP study with the aim of improving understanding of disease management and guiding future research. PITSTOP comprised a multimethod assessment of current practice and outcomes in the treatment of PD, with a multicentre prospective cohort study at its centre. The cohort study aimed to provide real-world data on surgical interventions used in current UK practice, and report patient and risk-adjusted outcomes of these interventions, providing data to inform the design of pragmatic randomized trials.

### Research and practice priorities in pilonidal sinus disease: a consensus from the PITSTOP study [^ca3f24cb]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This priority‐setting exercise has identified a series of policy and research statements that can be immediately acted upon by the surgical community. These consensus statements provide a foundation for the necessary improvement of research into the care of those with PD.

All the policy recommendations are in a way complimentary. The recommendation with by far the highest sum score recommends efforts to ensure a treatment does not make the patient's condition worse than their baseline. This statement is consistent with the second recommendation that minimally invasive, skin‐preserving approaches should be considered more frequently. These recommendations draw directly from the PITSTOP cohort, mixed‐method studies of regret and discrete choice experiments. Data from the cohort study show that complications are more likely with more major skin excisional approaches and recovery is longer. Whilst treatment failure and recurrence are lower, data from the discrete choice experiment suggests that many patients would trade this higher risk of failure for more rapid recovery. This is consistent with the fifth policy recommendation, which stresses return to work as a key metric when considering the surgical approach.

One of the reasons why some surgeons do not offer minimally invasive techniques is lack of training. Our survey of practice suggests that many surgeons favour one 'go to' operation and do not have the training to vary the approach according to the degree of disease and patient outcome preference. Specific technical requirements for PD are absent from the current UK training programme. Training relies mainly on the preferences of the trainers, leading to the perpetuation of older, possibly obsolete, interventions. Access to opportunities to learn newer techniques is highlighted in the third policy recommendation.

If an armamentarium of approaches for PD are to be recommended there is a need to classify the disease, potentially helping the surgeon and patient to decide the optimum approach for the desired outcome. Several such tools exist for PD, although none are in mainstream use. Work from PITSTOP demonstrated the properties of the International PIlonidal Sinus (Berlin) classification, and this may be an appropriate tool to use in clinical settings.

Pilonidal disease — hair removal and laser epilation — shaving can be used around wound healing with timing and frequency qualified, and laser epilation shows low recurrence but lacks sufficient evidence for a general recommendation. Surgeon-performed hair shaving every 1 to 2 weeks until healing and subsequent patient-performed shaving after healing have been reported as beneficial, but patient-performed shaving in the immediate postoperative period has been associated with increased pilonidal recurrence; given uncertainty in optimal frequency, we suggest at least weekly. As an adjunct to surgical treatment, laser epilation has resulted in minimal (≤ 13%) recurrence, and as a primary treatment has achieved durable healing in 44% to 100% of patients, yet current evidence is insufficient to provide a general recommendation for this technique.

Population-based data

A major strength of this study is the large number of hospitals participating, generating what the authors refer to as 'real-world data'. Although the data presented in this study are certainly more diverse than those in the average PSD study, it is unclear whether these data are indeed population-based, as some patients in the catchment area of a participating hospital may be treated elsewhere. As outlined, most PSD studies are retrospective and from a single centre, representing an 'in my hands' experience. Randomized trials exist, but population selection bias may be significant.

### Research and practice priorities in pilonidal sinus disease: a consensus from the PITSTOP study [^1ec0eec3]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to this consensus. There were 65 participants in round 1, many of whom were involved in the PITSTOP study. Results may therefore reflect the opinions of enthusiasts rather than generalists. The study did, however, take a robust methodological approach. Item generation was structured and based on recent real‐world data. Iterative voting was undertaken with minimal attrition and patient participation at all stages. Finally, the consensus statements are broad and easy to convert into practice. In particular, the research recommendations highlight methodology issues needed to improve on the current poor standard of PD research.

Impacts of this research are clear. Clinicians and commissioners of services should implement policy recommendations into their standard operating procedures and guidance. Relevant speciality associations should consider methods for delivering additional training for surgeons, potentially supported by industry. Routine metrics should be collected for services including rates of minimally invasive techniques and time to return to work. Research funders and researchers should consider action on the methodological aspects of the research recommendations first and, once these are addressed, support the delivery of a major trial or cohort study.

Pilonidal disease — rhomboid or Limberg flap outcomes indicate low recurrence and infection rates but concern for wound dehiscence. Overall results are favorable with respect to disease recurrence (0%–6%) and patient tolerance. Data from several randomized trials found low (0%–6%) overall rates of surgical site infections, but a recent randomized controlled trial shows a very high rate of wound dehiscence associated with this type of flap, and although many of these dehiscences were minor and the majority healed without recurrence, they required ongoing wound care.

### Adoption of a standardized treatment protocol for pilonidal disease leads to low recurrence [^bf9d2e70]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pilonidal disease may present as acute abscesses or chronic draining sinuses. There is no standardized treatment and recurrence rates can be as high as 30%. Within our five-hospital network we have established a standardized treatment protocol including minimally invasive surgical trephination and aggressive epilation. We hypothesize that such a treatment protocol can be established across different hospital settings and lead to low overall recurrence.

Methods

Patients with pilonidal disease were enrolled in the study on presentation to our hospital network. Those that underwent initial surgery outside our hospital system or were noncompliant with our treatment protocol were excluded. Patients were grouped based on surgeon and treating facility. Frequency of recurrence per surgeon and per hospital was calculated and compared.

Results

Out of 132 patients, 80 patients were included (45 female, 35 male) while 52 were excluded because of initial surgery at a non-network hospital or for protocol noncompliance. Median age was 17 (16–19) years and median length of follow-up was 352 (261–496) days. There were 6 patients who experienced at least one recurrence. There was an overall 8% recurrence rate with no significant difference noted between surgeons or hospitals (p = 0.15, p = 0.64, respectively).

Conclusions

We have successfully implemented a standardized treatment protocol for pilonidal disease across different hospital settings and by different surgeons, with an overall low recurrence rate. Our findings suggest that adoption of a standardized protocol for treatment of pilonidal disease can lead to low recurrence.

### Acute pilonidal abscess: prospective nationwide audit in the Netherlands [^e4f67ce6]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria and outcome measures

This prospective observational study only included patients aged 16 years or older with symptomatic PSD who underwent surgery and provided written informed consent. Primary outcomes included the rate of recurrent abscesses and symptomatic chronic PSD within 1 year, for which patients returned to the hospital. Secondary outcomes included pre‐ and postoperative symptoms, type of anaesthesia, wound healing rates (defined as complete wound closure with no residual discharge at the last outpatient visit), time to wound healing in days, time to resume daily activities in days and the occurrence and type of postoperative complications.

One year after surgical treatment for PSD, patients were invited to fill out questionnaires automatically sent by email through the electronic database Castor EDC© using the day of surgery as the reference date. A single reminder email was sent when patients had not completed the questionnaires within 2 weeks. The questionnaires inquired about recurrent abscesses treated by I&D, symptomatic chronic PSD (defined as patients undergoing additional surgery), quality of life (QoL) as measured with the EQ‐5D‐5L and patient‐reported experience measures (PREMs). EQ‐5D‐5 contains five questions about five dimensions of QoL: mobility, self‐care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ‐5D levels were dichotomized into 'no problems' (level 1) and 'any problems' (levels 2, 3, 4 and 5). Five study‐designed questions assessed PREMs: (1) I am satisfied with the outcome of my surgery (yes/no); (2) I would recommend this surgery to other patients (yes/no); (3) I had no problems with my wound after the surgery (yes/no); (4) I was happy with the follow‐up after my surgery (yes/no); (5) I would again choose the same surgical procedure (yes/no).
