## Question

What is the defiof low vitamin d

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to define "low vitamin D" and how to apply thresholds in practice, including screening and treatment implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biomarker used to define vitamin D status. Then, I should verify the historical and current consensus thresholds for deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency. Next, I will examine the evolution of guideline positions, especially the Endocrine Society's 2024 shift away from fixed targets. After that, I need to consider population-specific nuances and assay variability. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations for screening, treatment, and monitoring, while double-checking areas of controversy and uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the biomarker. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the accepted functional indicator of vitamin D status because of its longer half-life and stable concentration, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is tightly regulated and not suitable for assessing stores. I should double-check that this is consistent across major guidelines, and yes, both USPSTF and Endocrine Society align on 25(OH)D as the preferred test [^116GMwd2] [^1123HSa4] [^112zzYJM].

> Now, I need to review the traditional thresholds. Historically, deficiency has been defined as 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L), and sufficiency as at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These cut points are rooted in bone health endpoints and were endorsed by the 2011 Endocrine Society guideline, which I should verify and, yes, that is accurate [^115TEChd] [^1144Ymwq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal targets. The 2024 Endocrine Society guideline explicitly withdraws endorsement of fixed 25(OH)D thresholds for "sufficiency", "insufficiency", or "deficiency", citing insufficient trial evidence linking specific 25(OH)D levels to outcome benefits; I should confirm that this applies broadly and not just to skeletal outcomes, and the panel's communication confirms a blanket withdrawal of numeric targets for population-level prevention [^11535HZz] [^1113S3oR].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale behind that shift. The panel notes that most large RCTs enrolled participants with adequate baseline 25(OH)D, used modest doses, and were not powered for subgroup analyses by baseline level, which biases results toward the null and limits inference about thresholds; this methodological constraint undermines attempts to define outcome-linked cut points, reinforcing the move away from fixed targets [^114yJPbG] [^112cezVV].

> I should also reconcile this with public health guidance. The USPSTF concludes that no single 25(OH)D cutpoint defines deficiency and that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening in asymptomatic adults. They note that bone health risks increase below about 12–20 ng/mL, and that an intake sufficient to keep most people at or above 20 ng/mL meets population needs, which is a different question than individual therapeutic targets [^1159T71R] [^111UJRQk].

> Let me consider population-specific contexts. In chronic kidney disease, many nephrology guidelines continue to operationalize deficiency as less than 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20–29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as at least 30 ng/mL, with periodic measurement and supplementation per general-population strategies. I should confirm that KDOQI and contemporary summaries reflect this, and they do, albeit with acknowledgment of low-quality evidence for frequency of testing [^111jHwZu] [^116m7yn8].

> Next, I should review assay issues because thresholds are only as good as the measurement. There is persistent between-lab and between-method variability in 25(OH)D assays, and lack of standardization has historically confounded cut point consensus. The Vitamin D Standardization Program has advanced reference methods, but clinical heterogeneity remains, so I need to ensure results are interpreted with method awareness and, when possible, LC-MS/MS-based values [^111hjMCj] [^1172k3oe].

> I will now examine clinical consequences tied to different ranges to avoid overgeneralization. Severe deficiency, often less than 10–12 ng/mL, is linked to rickets or osteomalacia and, in pregnancy, neonatal hypocalcemia. Deficiency less than 20 ng/mL is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and adverse bone outcomes. Insufficiency 20–29 ng/mL may carry increased fracture risk in some analyses, though benefits of supplementation to higher levels are inconsistent in replete populations. These associations guide treatment urgency rather than fixed population targets [^117E4Y9W] [^114JzkK3] [^116Q4h2v].

> But wait, what about screening and who to test. The USPSTF issues an I statement for screening asymptomatic adults, emphasizing risk-based testing rather than routine population screening; high-risk groups include older adults, people with obesity, limited sun exposure, darker skin pigmentation, malabsorption, chronic liver or kidney disease, and certain medications; I should confirm that recent Endocrine Society guidance similarly discourages routine screening outside well-established indications, and it does [^112a2CfF] [^1173FY29] [^11535HZz].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical actions. For patients with risk factors or symptoms suggestive of deficiency, I should measure 25(OH)D and treat confirmed deficiency, typically using cholecalciferol with loading if needed followed by maintenance, aiming to correct deficiency and prevent osteomalacia. For most adults, 600–800 IU/day maintains bone health per DRI, whereas 1,500–2,000 IU/day is often required to raise and sustain levels above 30 ng/mL in those who are low, though I should avoid implying a universal target and instead individualize to clinical context and response [^114Hfpqn] [^116uJcoA] [^1156xH9f].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing safety and formulation. Daily dosing is generally preferred over intermittent high-dose regimens because large bolus doses may increase falls in older adults. Cholecalciferol is typically favored over ergocalciferol for repletion. And while 4,000 IU/day is the general UL, short-term higher doses can be used with monitoring in select cases, with attention to calcium and 25(OH)D trends to avoid toxicity [^117Va2Uq] [^115dbSJP] [^1156xH9f].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pregnancy, very low 25(OH)D is associated with neonatal complications, and many experts support empiric supplementation or targeted correction of deficiency, even though high-quality RCT evidence for perinatal outcomes is mixed. In older adults aged 75 years and above, empiric vitamin D may modestly reduce mortality, so a low-risk daily supplement can be reasonable in this group [^117E4Y9W] [^113h9V6a].

> Let me reconsider the core message to avoid misinterpretation. There is no universally accepted numeric definition of "low vitamin D" for all clinical purposes; historically, less than 20 ng/mL denotes deficiency and 20–29 ng/mL insufficiency, but the 2024 Endocrine Society withdraws endorsement of fixed thresholds for population prevention, and USPSTF finds insufficient evidence for routine screening; clinically, I should prioritize risk-based testing, treat confirmed deficiency to prevent osteomalacia and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and individualize maintenance strategies while acknowledging ongoing uncertainty about extraskeletal benefit thresholds [^11535HZz] [^1159T71R] [^1113S3oR].

---

Low vitamin D is defined as **25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)** [^115TEChd] by the Endocrine Society and IOM, with **< 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L)** indicating severe deficiency [^116Q4h2v] [^116Q4h2v]. Insufficiency is **20–29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L)** [^115TEChd], and sufficiency is **≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L)** [^116pPHVn]. These thresholds are based on bone health outcomes [^1159T71R], and there is no consensus on optimal levels for extraskeletal benefits [^1113S3oR] [^11535HZz]. Measurement of 25(OH)D is the standard for assessing vitamin D status [^1123HSa4] [^1172k3oe].

---

## Biochemical definition of low vitamin D

Vitamin D status is best assessed by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] [^1123HSa4], the main circulating form with a half-life of ~2–3 weeks [^112zzYJM]. The Endocrine Society and Institute of Medicine (IOM) provide widely accepted thresholds:

| **Category** | **Serum 25(OH)D level** |
|-|-|
| Severe deficiency | < 12 ng/mL (< 30 nmol/L) [^116Q4h2v] |
| Deficiency | < 20 ng/mL (< 50 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Insufficiency | 20–29 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Sufficiency | ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) [^116pPHVn] |

---

These thresholds are primarily based on bone health outcomes, including prevention of rickets and osteomalacia, and maintenance of calcium homeostasis [^1159T71R] [^1138uGfi].

---

## Clinical implications of low vitamin D

Low vitamin D status has **well-established skeletal consequences**, including:

- **Rickets**: A childhood disease characterized by impaired bone mineralization, leading to skeletal deformities [^116wNRwz].

- **Osteomalacia**: A adult disease characterized by defective bone mineralization, causing bone pain, muscle weakness, and increased fracture risk [^114JzkK3].

- **Osteoporosis**: Reduced bone mineral density, increasing fracture risk, particularly in older adults [^114tNev4].

Beyond skeletal health, low vitamin D has been associated with **increased risk of chronic diseases**, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, although causality remains uncertain [^116VnVxH] [^1113S3oR].

---

## Factors influencing vitamin D status

Several factors influence **individual vitamin D status**:

- **Sun exposure**: Limited UVB exposure due to latitude, season, clothing, or sunscreen use reduces cutaneous vitamin D synthesis [^1173FY29].

- **Dietary intake**: Low intake of vitamin D-rich foods or supplements [^1173FY29].

- **Age**: Older adults have reduced skin synthesis capacity [^113qUrfH].

- **Skin pigmentation**: Darker skin tones have reduced cutaneous synthesis [^notfound].

- **Obesity**: Vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue lowers bioavailability [^113qUrfH].

- **Medical conditions**: Chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malabsorption syndromes, and certain medications (e.g. glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants) [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Measurement of vitamin D status

Serum 25(OH)D is the **primary biomarker** for assessing vitamin D status [^1123HSa4]. Assay variability exists, and standardization efforts (e.g. the Vitamin D Standardization Program) aim to improve accuracy and comparability [^111hjMCj] [^1172k3oe]. The active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], is not recommended for routine assessment due to its short half-life and regulation by parathyroid hormone (PTH) [^11417Mw1] [^112zzYJM].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

There is ongoing debate regarding **optimal vitamin D levels** for extraskeletal health benefits [^113YhX86]. The Endocrine Society's 2024 guidelines no longer endorse specific 25(OH)D targets due to insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [^11535HZz]. Additionally, routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is not recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) due to insufficient evidence of benefit [^111UJRQk] [^116GMwd2].

---

## Clinical management of low vitamin D

Management typically involves **vitamin D supplementation**, with dosing tailored to the severity of deficiency, patient characteristics, and underlying conditions [^1156xH9f]. Common regimens include daily dosing (e.g. 800–2,000 IU) or weekly/bolus dosing for rapid correction, followed by maintenance therapy [^114Lxtxc]. Monitoring of serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels is recommended to ensure safe and effective treatment [^111jHwZu].

---

Low vitamin D is defined as **serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)** [^115TEChd], with **< 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L)** indicating severe deficiency [^115GCzBc]. These thresholds are based on bone health outcomes, and there is no consensus on optimal levels for extraskeletal benefits [^116wAS7B].

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^1172k3oe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

Vitamin D screening with a 25(OH)D test — background trends in healthy adults — Recent trends show a rise in population testing, with 25(OH)D testing frequency increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk in 2005 to 16.1 per 1000 person-years at risk by 2015. Advocacy for routine screening is contingent upon demonstrating that screenings can effectively identify individuals with low 25(OH)D who might not be detected through traditional risk factor assessments and that vitamin D supplementation after identifying a low 25(OH)D level leads to improvements in clinical outcomes; moreover, screening generally healthy adults would involve testing large numbers of people with important health system implications.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Vitamin D and child health part 1 (skeletal aspects) [^1174bRGV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable clinical and academic interest in vitamin D as a consequence of a number of developments over the past decade. This was initially related to a recognised resurgence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children in the UK and other countries. The potential importance of maternal vitamin D status on bone mass in early childhood and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peak bone mass has been the subject of much research. An additional development has been the recognition that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and what level should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review consists of two parts, the first focuses on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D, while the second will review some of the potential extraskeletal aspects, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to prescribe vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000–2,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily in most patients, to keep the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

Table 1
Significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency

Vitamin D status is defined by measuring the level of 25(OH)D in the blood owing to its longer half-life in plasma, where it forms a circulating reservoir of vitamin D. A serum concentration of > 30 ng/mL (> 75 nmol/L) is considered as sufficient, 20–30 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L) as insufficient, 10–20 ng/mL (25–50 nmol/L) as deficient, and < 10 ng/mL (< 25 nmol/l) as severely deficient. The US Institute of Medicine (IoM) released guidance in 2011 in which 25(OH)D equal to 20 ng/mL was considered to be adequate for ≥ 97.5% of the population; however, this has been heavily criticized by the Endocrine Society and they recommend that 25(OH)D concentration should exceed 30 ng/mL, to maximize the effect of vitamin D on calcium, bone, and muscle metabolism. Cutoffs for vitamin D status are detailed in Table 2. Both the IoM and the Endocrine Society have arbitrated respective cutoffs for optimal vitamin D status; however, these are based on bone metabolic data and not on cardiometabolic data. Optimal levels of 25(OH)D for possible prevention of cardiometabolic outcomes remain to be elucidated.

Severe vitamin D deficiency — Currently, severe deficiency is somewhat arbitrarily defined as a 25(OH)-D level of ≤ 12.5 nmol/L (5 ng/mL). In one study, 86% of the children studied who had 25(OH)-D levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) had rickets, and 94% of the hypocalcemic children with vitamin D deficiency had levels of < 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL).

### Association of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and sepsis in the critically ill [^116w2qaL]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that deficiency in 25-hydroxyvitamin D prior to hospital admission would be associated with sepsis in the critically ill.

Design

Two-center observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical ICUs.

Setting

Two hundred nine medical and surgical intensive care beds in two teaching hospitals in Boston, MA.

Patients

Three thousand three hundred eighty-six patients, 18 years old or older, in whom 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured prior to hospitalization between 1998 and 2011.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Preadmission 25-hydroxyvitamin D was categorized as deficiency in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (≤ 15 ng/mL), insufficiency (15–30 ng/mL), and sufficiency (≥ 30 ng/mL). The primary outcome was sepsis as defined by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification and validated by the 2001 Society of Critical Care Medicine/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and Surgical Infection Society international sepsis definitions conference guidelines. Logistic regression examined the presence of sepsis 3 days prior to critical care initiation to 7 days after critical care initiation. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models. Preadmission 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is predictive for the risk of sepsis. In the full cohort, 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is a significant predictor for the risk of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification-defined sepsis following multivariable adjustment, including age, gender, race, type (surgical vs medical), and Deyo-Charlson index (adjusted odds ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.17–1.94]; p = 0.001) relative to patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D sufficiency. In a subset of cohort patients enriched for those with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification-diagnosed sepsis (n = 444), preadmission 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is a significant predictor for the risk of conference guideline-defined sepsis following multivariable adjustment, including age, gender, race, type (surgical vs medical), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (adjusted odds ratio, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.19–3.52]; p = 0.009) relative to patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D sufficiency. Furthermore, in cohort patients with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification-defined sepsis (n = 568), the multivariable adjusted risk of 90-day mortality was 1.6-fold higher in those with preadmission 25-hydroxyvitamin D values in the insufficient and deficient range, compared with those with preadmission vitamin D sufficiency (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.11–2.39]; p = 0.01).

Conclusion

25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency prior to hospital admission is a significant predictor of sepsis in the critically ill. Additionally, patients with sepsis who are not vitamin D sufficient have an increased risk of mortality following critical care initiation.

Ranges for normal and abnormal blood vitamin D concentrations — The page states that 25(OH)-D is the major circulating form of vitamin D and the best available indicator of total body vitamin D status; it notes the half-life of 25(OH)-D is 2 to 3 weeks, whereas 1,25(OH)2-D has a half-life of only 4 hours, and emphasizes that the latter is not a good indicator of vitamin D stores.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^114LER3L]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D status and its predictors

The present data are consistent with the assumption that deficient vitamin D levels are an important health issue that may affect not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. The high prevalence of deficient 25OHD blood levels in the population is believed to be primarily due to inadequate vitamin D synthesis in the skin, together with inadequate dietary intake. However, circulating 25OHD levels also depend on body weight and genetic factors, and a significant portion of the variance in circulating 25OHD remains unexplained at present. Therefore, Deng et al. are to be commended for investigating potential interactions between Mg and vitamin D status. Especially with regard to vitamin D, there is still ongoing debate regarding the optimal oral intake and the adequate circulating 25OHD level. The IOM recommends a daily vitamin D intake of 600 international units and considers circulating 25OHD levels of 20 to 50 ng/ml as adequate, and 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml as potentially harmful. However, according to the Endocrine Society, the circulating 25OHD level should be within the range of 30 to 100 ng/ml. To raise the 25OHD level consistently above 30 ng/ml, they recommend a daily vitamin D intake of 1,500 to 2,000 international units.

### Vitamin D and health in the 21st century: bone and beyond. executive summary [^11437sGW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is unique, in terms of its metabolism and physiologic features and the human reliance on both endogenous production (activation through exposure to ultraviolet light) and exogenous sources (diet, primarily fortified foods) to meet biological requirements. Recent evidence has indicated a reemergence of vitamin D-deficient rickets and an alarming prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (ie, low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) in particular segments of the US population. Furthermore, evidence has emerged implicating vitamin D status in a range of adverse health conditions, including cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a conference organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements was held to explore current knowledge and to develop a research agenda to address the range of issues associated with vitamin D and health during the life cycle. These proceedings contain presentations about 1) existing data on vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, 2) the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of vitamin D, 3) the strength of evidence supporting reconsideration of current policies regarding vitamin D intake, 4) gaps in understanding of the factors affecting and current options for improving vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, and 5) research needs to address gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D assessment, biological features, and requirements. This executive summary provides an overview of the conference and its conclusions.

### Effect of monthly high-dose vitamin D on bone density in community-dwelling older adults substudy of a randomized controlled trial [^112VneHC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia, yet trials of vitamin D supplementation in the community have not on average demonstrated benefit to bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture risk in adults.

Objective

To determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation influences BMD in the general population and in those with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

Methods

Two-year substudy of a trial in older community-resident adults. A total of 452 participants were randomized to receive monthly doses of vitamin D3 100 000 IU, or placebo. The primary end-point was change in lumbar spine BMD. Exploratory analyses to identify thresholds of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D for vitamin D effects on BMD were prespecified.

Results

Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant treatment effect in the lumbar spine (between-groups difference 0.0071 g cm -2, 95%CI: -0.0012, 0.0154) or total body but BMD loss at both hip sites was significantly attenuated by ~1/2% over 2 years. There was a significant interaction between baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and treatment effect (P = 0.04). With baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 30 nmol L -1 (n = 46), there were between-groups BMD changes at the spine and femoral sites of ~2%, significant in the spine and femoral neck, but there was no effect on total body BMD. When baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D was > 30 nmol L -1, differences were ~1/2% and significant only at the total hip.

Conclusions

This substudy finds no clinically important benefit to BMD from untargeted vitamin D supplementation of older, community-dwelling adults. Exploratory analyses suggest meaningful benefit in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 30 nmol L -1. This represents a significant step towards a trial-based definition of vitamin D deficiency for bone health in older adults.

### Vitamin D deficiency is not good for you [^1121TDLd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The choice of measuring vitamin D levels using the gold standard method of liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) is a second asset of the present work. Although levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are high enough to allow detection by immunoassay techniques, avoiding the use of antibodies results in much more reliable measurements with LC/MS-MS. Furthermore, novel data indicate that modified forms of 25(OH)D may be circulating that are falsely overdetected or not detected by the antibodies and may have physiological implications. Still, at present only a few laboratories around the world are able to measure 25(OH)D by LC/MS-MS, and most laboratories therefore continue to use kits. Their continued widespread use might lead to an overestimation of both the frequency and magnitude of vitamin D deficiency.

This brings us to the other crucial question of where to put the cutoff that defines vitamin D deficiency, even with LC/MS-MS. We do not know, and we do not have a consensus. In addition, there is ongoing debate concerning the dosage of nutritional and vitamin D supplements required to achieve vitamin D sufficiency. The turmoil around a statement released by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is just an illustration of the problem. For bone health, defining the level of vitamin D deficiency is relatively easy as the rise in parathyroid hormone levels can be used as a marker for vitamin D levels that are too low. When 25(OH)D levels drop below 10–20 ng/mL (25–50 nmol/L), parathyroid hormone levels rise, indicating the switching on of the feedback cascade, suggesting that this is the level below which 25(OH)D levels are really deficient. Here, the authors avoid the cutoff discussion and its clinical relevance by using the lower 10th percentile to define deficiency. As a consequence, this study's conclusion is based on data from very severely vitamin D–deficient individuals. Literature on the effects of vitamin D at levels above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) becomes very difficult to interpret because the only available data are from association or preclinical studies in animal models.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116m7yn8]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Implementation considerations for vitamin D include commonly used laboratory thresholds and monitoring guidance: For most experts, vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D level between 20â€" 29 ng/mL, deficiency is considered as 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency serum 25(OH)D equal or greater than 30 ng/mL; it is suggested based on low quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 3â€"5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be based on baseline values and therapeutic interventions, with no consensus on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed; current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1â€"5D and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population; the tolerable upper intake levels (UL) proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for the general population is 4,000 IU/day; and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered especially for patients who are on calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or on vitamin D active analogs.

### Global consensus recommendations on prevention and management of nutritional rickets [^116wNRwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.

Evidence

A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.

Process

Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.

Results

This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.

Conclusion

Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and association with metabolic syndrome in a Qatari population [^112rru11]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with many adverse health outcomes. Vitamin D is acquired in three ways; from sun exposure, diet and supplements; however, the greatest proportion is obtained from sun exposure. For example, exposure to 0.5 minimal erythemal dose is equivalent to supplementing ~3000 IU of vitamin D 3. One of the main physiological functions of vitamin D is to maintain calcium and phosphorous levels in the body to sustain various metabolic functions, including bone metabolism. The most abundant circulating biomarker of vitamin D status is 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which also has a longer half-life (25 days) compared to the active metabolite; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (7 h). However, the threshold used to define vitamin D deficiency often varies according to the population and outcome of interest. The most common definition for optimal 25(OH)D levels is the concentration at which it supresses the parathyroid hormone to its minimum, however, using this definition results in a wide range of minimal optimal values from 12 ng mL −1 to 40 ng mL −1.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

### Systematic review of first-trimester vitamin D normative levels and outcomes of pregnancy [^111zPGZv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We undertook a systematic review to assess normative levels of vitamin D in early pregnancy and association with subsequent pregnancy outcomes.

Study Design

Medline and Embase databases and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria were pregnant populations, blood sample taken during the first trimester, and serum hydroxyvitamin D levels assessed.

Results

Eighteen studies reported vitamin D levels in first trimester (n = 11–3730), and 5 examined pregnancy outcomes. Mean vitamin D concentrations differed when stratified by ethnicity: white (mean [SD]: 29.4 [11.7] to 73.1 [27.1] nmol/L) and nonwhite (15.2 [12.1] to 43 [12] nmol/L). Most studies used general population cut points to define deficiency and found a large proportion of women deficient. Two articles examined risk of preeclampsia and reported differing findings, whereas 2 of 3 found low levels associated with increased risk of small-for-gestational age births.

Conclusion

There is no clear definition of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy and insufficient evidence to suggest low vitamin D levels in early pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Q65i2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113UqxEs]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Vitamin D-update for the pediatric rheumatologists [^113be9yM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Optimal D hormone levels

The best method to determine a person's vitamin D status is to measure the circulating level of 25(OH)D. Serum levels of 1α,25(OH)2D are often normal or even elevated in both children and adults who are vitamin D deficient due to its very short half-life and tight physiological control by PTH which can increase renal production of calcitriol (by stimulating 1α-hydroxylase activity). The vitamin D hormonal form is synthetized and accumulated to a large degree in the tissues but there it cannot be measured.

For a long time there has been no consensus on the optimal concentrations of serum 25(OH)D. Most authors have used the cut-off values of 10–15 ng/mL to define vitamin D deficiency. In 2010 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that vitamin D deficiency should be defined as a 25(OH)D level of < 20 ng/mL for children and adults. Based on a study in postmenopausal women in whom a rise of 25(OH)D level from ~20 ng/mL to ~32 ng/mL increased their efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption by 65%, the Endocrine Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee of the Endocrine Society proposed a new definition of vitamin D insufficiency and sufficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is now defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL, vitamin D insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL, and vitamin D sufficiency as > 30 ng/mL for both children and adults. It is suggested that maintenance of a 25(OH)D level between 40 and 60 ng/mL is ideal and up to 100 ng/mL is safe. These recommendations are summarized in Table 1. In adults it was shown that supplementation of 1000 IU of cholecalciferol per day increases 25(OH)D level by 7–10 ng/ml and it is believed that 100 IU can increase 25(OH)D level by as much as 2–3 ng/ml when serum 25(OH)D is below 15 ng/ml.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: an endocrine society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published, and a newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized 4 clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation. The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low. Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (ie, at least 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (ie, greater than 20ng/mL [50nmol/L] but lower than 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this Guideline Communication.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113DFK9U]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Regardless, in populations with a low prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, screening of the general population is not cost-effective, and the decision to assess an individual needs to be made using a risk stratification approach for having vitamin D deficiency. Prioritized screening for high-risk groups could be useful, given the potentially adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal and overall health, particularly when the serum 25(OH)D levels are less than 30 nmol/L (< 12 ng/mL). Boosted regression tree models have also been developed from RCT data to predict the serum 25(OH)D concentration. Several predictor variables of a deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D concentration less than 50 nmol/L have been identified from training and validation data sets in the D-Health trial. The 2 strongest predictors were ambient UV radiation and total intake of vitamin D. Other important predictors of mild vitamin D deficiency were time spent outdoors, alcohol consumption, BMI, quality of life measures, and physical activity. Thus, a lack of ambient UVB radiation and lack of vitamin D fortification of food or use of vitamin D supplements will probably result in a poor vitamin D status, particularly in individuals in whom other risk factors are also present.

In conclusion, screening for optimal vitamin D status in the general population should be avoided as it is not informative and has a considerable economic burden. Nevertheless, several characteristics and pathological conditions in the general population could place individuals at risk for severe deficits. These populations, which should be recognized, are considered in the next section.

### Micronutrient requirements for stem cell transplantation patients > 100 days after transplant and during graft versus host disease: a systematic review [^114wkRc2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The impact of micronutrient supplementation on clinical outcomes is unclear with GRADE certainty of evidence for vitamin D or calcium and BMD rated as very low. While the monitoring of vitamin D levels and calcium intake after transplantation should be considered to detect deficiency or inadequate intake, the most appropriate timeframe for retesting is unclear. In situations such as bone mineral density concerns, limited sun exposure, malabsorption or long-term steroid medication use, more frequent testing may be indicated. The definition of vitamin D deficiency is not consistent and thus consensus for the definition will assist with drawing more reliable and valid conclusions. Further high-quality studies evaluating the prevalence of deficiency for other micronutrients and supplementation outcomes in patients > 100 days post-SCT and during GVHD are required to examine the impact on post-transplant outcomes.

### Implications of a new definition of vitamin D deficiency in a multiracial us adolescent population: the national health and nutrition examination survey III [^113np5BJ]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

In children, vitamin D deficiency can interfere with bone mineralization, leading to rickets. In adults, it is linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Accurate estimates of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency are complicated by the lack of consensus as to optimal vitamin D status. Currently, individuals with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of < 11 ng/mL are classified as vitamin D deficient. Experts collectively have proposed that minimum levels be at least 20 ng/mL. Our objectives were to (1) determine the national prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adolescents by using both the current and recommended cutoffs and (2) examine the implications of the new recommendation after adjustment for various factors.

Methods

Data were obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, a cross-sectional survey administered to a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 2 months and older. Analyses were restricted to 2955 participants aged 12 to 19 with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Relationships between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and sociodemographic variables were evaluated by using logistic regression.

Results

Changing the definition of vitamin D deficiency from < 11 to < 20 ng/mL increased the prevalence from 2% to 14%. After adjustment for all covariates, non-Hispanic black adolescents had 20 times the risk of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL compared with non-Hispanic white adolescents. The risk of deficiency was more than double for females compared with males. An inverse relationship between weight and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was found. Overweight adolescents had increased risk of deficiency compared with normal-weight adolescents.

Conclusions

There was a disproportionate burden of vitamin D deficiency in the non-Hispanic black adolescent population. Routine supplementation and monitoring of serum levels should be considered. Females and overweight adolescents are at increased risk. The consequences of chronic vitamin D deficiency in adolescents should be prospectively investigated.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D – implications for clinicians [^113imBRF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify risk. We present our perspective, and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by ∼10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes that cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data becomes available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit health-care providers and patients alike.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### Toward clarity in clinical vitamin D status assessment: 25 (OH) D assay standardization [^111hjMCj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Widespread variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) assays continues to compromise efforts to develop clinical and public health guidelines regarding vitamin D status. The Vitamin D Standardization Program helps alleviate this problem. Reference measurement procedures and standard reference materials have been developed to allow current, prospective, and retrospective standardization of 25(OH)D results. Despite advances in 25(OH)D measurement, substantial variability in clinical laboratory 25(OH)D measurement persists. Existing guidelines have not used standardized data and, as a result, it seems unlikely that consensus regarding definitions of vitamin D deficiency, inadequacy, sufficiency, and excess will soon be reached. Until evidence-based consensus is reached, a reasonable clinical approach is advocated.

### Vitamin D and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^1138uGfi]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Defining vitamin D status

Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D concentration less than 30 nmol/L, a 25(OH)D concentration between 30 and 50 nmol/L is considered insufficient, greater than 50 nmol/L is considered sufficient and a 25(OH)D status greater than 125 nmol/L is considered at risk of adverse effects. These values are based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) review of published research focused on determining the optimal vitamin D concentration for maximal calcium absorption, prevention of rickets, reduction of fracture risk and prevention of osteomalacia in healthy populations. In the most recent review of vitamin D requirements, the IOM concluded that there was inadequate information to make intake recommendations in relation to other biologic roles of vitamin D. The current recommended dietary allowances (RAD) of vitamin D are 400 IU from 0 to 12 months of age and 600 IU per day from 1 to 18 years of age.

The Endocrine Society has published clinical practice guidelines for patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency. The Society recommends that at-risk populations, including "obese children and adults and children and adults on anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids, antifungals such as ketoconazole, and medications for acquired immune deficiency syndrome be given at least two to three times more vitamin D for their age group to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement". The optimal 25(OH)D concentration suggested by the Endocrine Society is 75 nmol/L. To meet this concentration it is recommended that 400–1000 IU be given between 0 to 12 months of age, 600–1000 IU per day from 1 to 8 years of age, and 1500–2000 IU for children between ages 9–18 years. These recommendations, however, are not specific for children with chronic arthritis.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^111rZo4X]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D excess and intoxication — definitions and thresholds are outlined with specific serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)-D] levels. Individuals with 25(OH)-D levels of ≥ 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) are described as having vitamin D excess and as being at risk for intoxication, while some laboratories set an upper limit of normal at 200 nmol/L (80 ng/mL). Observational contexts note that sunbathers and lifeguards can have 25(OH)-D levels of > 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) without evidence of intoxication, and supplementation leading to 25(OH)-D levels of 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) is not associated with harmful effects. Conversely, hypercalcemia is definitely associated with 25(OH)-D levels of > 325 nmol/L (150 ng/mL).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

Mortality

If low vitamin D status has such broad-ranging effects on so many (extraskeletal) tissues as described above, it would certainly increase the risk of a variety of diseases and thus ultimately increase mortality risks. No preclinical data exist on the relationship between longevity and vitamin D status. Many observational studies, as described above, associate a poor vitamin D status with nearly all major human diseases, and therefore it would not be surprising that a poor vitamin D status would be associated with increased mortality risk. Indeed, most observational studies found higher mortality rates in persons with the lowest vitamin D quartiles or quintiles in European and US populations, with the highest mortality rates found in subjects with serum 25OHD < 50 to 60 nmol/L. These very large studies also raised concerns about a U-shaped mortality curve, which suggests a slightly increased mortality rate in participants with the higher serum 25OHD levels. However, subsequent recalibration of serum 25OHD determinations decreased the number of NHANES participants with high serum 25OHD [> 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL)], so that the apparent increased mortality in the two high serum 25OHD groups disappeared. A meta-analysis of eight prospective studies on > 2600 participants (50 to 79 years of age) demonstrated a consistently higher overall mortality rate in participants with the lowest serum 25OHD concentrations (usually well below 50 nmol/L). This observation included subjects living in different areas of the world (United States, Europe, and Japan). Surprisingly, the Leiden longevity study found that the offspring of nonagenarians (age > 90 years) with at least one other nonagenarian in the family had lower (not higher as expected) serum 25OHD levels.

Conclusions and recommendations from panel discussions

What is optimal vitamin D status and the best method to determine it?

Serum 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status but there is no international consensus on its optimal value, with recommendations varying from 25 nmol L −1 to > 100 nmol L −1. 23 Figure 2 summarizes the definitions of vitamin D status by various international bodies. 23 The most widely held consensus for the boundary between insufficiency and sufficiency is 50 nmol L −1. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), 15 a serum concentration of 50 nmol L −1 25(OH)D meets or exceeds the requirement of 97.5% of the U.S. population, but it is not possible to specify desired individual status. 23 The determination of vitamin D status is discussed in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^112yFj8n]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Adult sufficiency threshold — Although a lower limit of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) for 25(OH)-D levels is still considered indicative of vitamin D sufficiency in children, data in adults suggest a somewhat higher cutoff based on impaired calcium absorption and lower bone density at 25(OH)-D levels of < 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL); on this basis, a lower limit of 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL) is increasingly becoming accepted as the lower limit of normal for 25(OH)-D levels in adults.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111fyovA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112cezVV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

### Assessment of vitamin D status and association with inflammation: biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^117TFa9i]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is an important public health problem that can contribute to the loss of bone density leading to osteoporosis and fractures as well as rickets in children. Although population data on vitamin D deficiency prevalence is limited, the available evidence suggests widespread global vitamin D deficiency, particularly in countries where calcium intake is low and vitamin D fortification is not mandatory. Accurate assessment of vitamin D is critical to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, identify at-risk subgroups, and guide public health actions to mitigate the burden of deficiency. Studies worldwide commonly assess vitamin D status using the circulating, intermediate form, 25(OH)D, because of its long half-life, relatively stability, and high plasma concentration. In contrast, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D), has unstable serum concentrations owing to its dependence on calcium concentrations and thus is not considered a good indication of vitamin D status. Disagreement exists about the thresholds to define risk of deficiency; the Institute of Medicine defines deficiency as 25(OH)D below 30 nmol/L, whereas the Endocrine Society and European Food Safety Authority recommend a threshold of 50 nmol/L. Debates also exist surrounding laboratory approaches to quantify 25(OH)D concentrations (e.g. radioimmunoassay, chemiluminescent assay or liquid chromatography), making it challenging to choose the cutoff to define deficiency.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1159T71R]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin D levels and population prevalence — The document states that "no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency". It reports that "an estimated 97.5% of the population will have their vitamin D needs met at a serum level of 20 ng/mL (49.9 nmol/L) and risk for deficiency, relative to bone health, begins to occur at levels less than 12 to 20 ng/mL (29.9–49.9 nmol/L)". Additionally, a report based on 2014 survey data found that 5% of persons 1 year or older had very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels (< 12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.

### Consensus and controversial aspects of vitamin D and COVID-19 [^112L9yHM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review and discuss controversial topics in the field of vitamin D, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19.

Methods

The International Conferences "Controversies in Vitamin D" are a series of workshops that started in 2017 featuring international experts and leaders in vitamin D research and clinical practice. The fifth annual conference was held in Stresa, Italy, September 15 to 18, 2021.

Evidence

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

### Correction of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients-VITdAL @ ICU study protocol of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial [^1169fDRZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is a key regulator in calcium and phosphorus metabolism and likely confers physiologically relevant pleiotropic functions that include cardioprotective and immunomodulatory effects as well as improvement of antimicrobial action. Profound vitamin D deficiency in humans causes rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults together with vitamin D myopathy, whereas low vitamin D levels may be associated with an increased prevalence of a multitude of other diseases including an increase in mortality.

Moreover, a systematic review concluded that intervention with cholecalciferol significantly reduced mortality in predominantly elderly, institutionalized women. To date, only few large interventional randomized trials have investigated the effect of vitamin D on clinical outcomes. The rationale for pleiotropic effects of this substance is based on the fact that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is almost ubiquitously expressed, and the vast majority of cells respond to 1,25(OH)2D exposure. Hundreds of genes with vitamin D receptor response elements directly or indirectly influence cell cycling, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

Vitamin D in ICU patients

Endogenous synthesis in the presence of UV-B radiation is the main source of vitamin D. Therefore, immobilized and elderly individuals are prone to develop vitamin D deficiency. Low vitamin D levels are highly prevalent in critically ill adults and children. Unfortunately, no uniform definition of vitamin D deficiency exists and tissue levels of the major active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D are currently not measurable. Today most guidelines agree, however, that a "low" vitamin D status is present when serum 25(OH)D levels are below 20 ng/ml. Special concerns in the ICU setting relate to the issue as to whether the definition of vitamin D deficiency should be the same as in the general population or whether special metabolites of vitamin D should be considered in this definition as well. Insufficient vitamin D levels could affect this population in various ways. Over the last years, several groups have reported on an inverse association between vitamin D levels in critically ill patients and severity of disease including length of ICU stay and mortality. Moreover, vitamin D levels decline further during ICU stay which is explained by insufficient replacement of vitamin D via enteral or parenteral nutrition in the absence of UV-B exposure. To date, only few and small intervention studies (n = 22–33 patients) that were not designed to demonstrate effects on clinical outcomes have been published.

Screening and testing vitamin D status — conclusions

Screening the general population for vitamin D deficiency is very expensive and does not result in practical clinical benefits. 25(OH)D measurements have primarily been indicated in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, but the increased awareness of potential pleiotropic effects has widened the interest in screening, although without any definitive evidence.

The most important risk factors in the general population, as identified by recent studies, include low ambient UV radiation, low vitamin D intake, and gene polymorphisms. Their inclusion as primary risk factors in risk stratification approaches to assess vitamin D status will help effectively target 25(OH)D assessment in those most in need and at risk. Finally, further studies — including those with health economic measures — are warranted to best identify all the situations in which the assessment of vitamin D status is actually needed — or not.

Methods: Assays, Thresholds, and Standardization

Accuracy and precision of vitamin D measurements are crucial to properly use the values obtained in biological fluids. The laboratory methods should be detailed in clinical trials, scientific papers, and even in the reports released to physicians and patients. The measurements could be obtained by either antibody-based methods (chemiluminescent or immunoenzymatic) or by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS or LC-MS/MS), with the latter giving more consistent and accurate results; regardless, the reference material should also be indicated in the report. The laboratory should define the reference values considering the method used for analyzing the molecule(s). The unit of measure (molar or mass) should be clearly indicated. The mol/L unit should be preferred as the SI standard unit; alternatively, both mol/L and ng/mL should be reported. Moreover, the critical difference (or least significance change), or reference change values, that is, the value (percentage) testifying to a real modification of the molecule(s) concentration between 2 consecutive measurements, assayed with the same method, in the same patient, and, on the contrary, that the modification is not only dependent from analytical and biological variability (natural oscillation of values in individuals), should be known and properly considered.

### Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the risk of frailty syndrome: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112ss4mD]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A previous meta-analysis of seven prospective cohorts reported an inverse association between vitamin D deficiency and frailty. However, only data in the highest compared with the lowest categories of 25OHD were used rather than the use of all categories. This dose response meta-analysis allowed us to evaluate risk across the entire spectrum of observed 25OHD levels. We observed an inverse linear association between 25OHD levels and the risk of frailty among the elderly population, suggesting that any incremental increase in serum 25OHD level was associated with a decreased risk of frailty. However, because serum 25OHD concentrations in the current data for the frailty study range from 12.5 to 95 nmol/L, we have not been able to investigate the dose-response relationship between higher levels of 25OHD, i.e. > 95 nmol/L and risk of frailty. It is too early to determine whether there is a specific cutoff level of serum 25OHD that increases or reduces the risk of developing frailty syndrome because a limited number of studies used serum 25OHD levels as a categorical variable and provided RR data for each category and because of the variation in the definition of frailty. Thus, the results of this analysis should be interpreted cautiously. We cannot rule out the possibility that the serum 25OHD level has a threshold rather than dose-response effect on the risk of frailty.

### Functional indices of vitamin D status and ramifications of vitamin D deficiency [^114tNev4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] concentrations are currently recognized as the functional status indicator for vitamin D. Evidence is reviewed that shows that serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations of < 80 nmol/L are associated with reduced calcium absorption, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk. For typical older individuals, supplemental oral intakes of approximately 1300 IU/d are required to reach the lower end of the optimal range. Evidence of substantial problems in routine clinical measurement of serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations among patients is cited. There is great need for standardization and improved reproducibility and sensitivity of measurements of serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117GQRA]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is reported worldwideand has been associated with non-communicable and infectious diseases. Africa has a high burden of infectious diseases, and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing. A 2014 report by WHO estimates that the burden of non-communicable diseases will overtake that of communicable diseases in Africa by 2030, a trend that has been attributed to lifestyle changes related to rapid urbanisation. Individuals of African ancestry living in temperate regions have a poorer vitamin D status than do other ethnicities, which has been associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers observed among African–American people. The presence of vitamin D receptors in most tissues and cells and the regulation of more than 200 human genes by vitamin D suggest that vitamin D could have diverse roles in maintaining health.

Measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is widely accepted as a proxy for vitamin D status. However, no consensus has been reached on the definition of low vitamin D status. Rickets and osteomalacia are associated with severe vitamin D deficiency, characterised by very low concentrations of 25(OH)D, whereas extraskeletal diseases have been associated with more modest vitamin D insufficiency. Rickets and osteomalacia caused by vitamin D deficiency are considered unlikely at concentrations higher than 25 nmol/L or 30 nmol/L, and the US National Academy of Medicine (formerly called the Institute of Medicine) recommends 25(OH)D concentrations of higher than 50 nmol/L for optimum bone health. The US Endocrine Society recommends a concentration of higher than 75 nmol/L to reduce the risk of various non-communicable and infectious diseases.

### Is vitamin D the fountain of youth? [^1121WqZ8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of vitamin D deficiency for both classic and "nonclassic" effects and raise the caution that association does not prove causation.

Methods

The pertinent literature regarding vitamin D and its effects on bone, muscle function, immune function, glucose tolerance, cancer risk, and development of cardiovascular disease and other conditions is reviewed. In addition, the limitations of observational studies are discussed.

Results

Vitamin D inadequacy is common worldwide and classically causes osteomalacia and rickets. More recently, the contribution of low vitamin D status to increased falls and fracture risk has become appreciated. Additionally, nonclassic effects of vitamin D inadequacy are being recognized, and low vitamin D status is being potentially associated with a multitude of conditions (including Alzheimer disease, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, and hypertension) and higher overall mortality. It is important to recognize that associations in observational studies can be due to chance, bias, or confounders or may be indicative of causality.

Conclusion

Because vitamin D deficiency has been established to have adverse musculoskeletal consequences, optimization of vitamin D status, for both the individual patient and the overall population, is indicated.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25–40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

Failure of conventional vitamin D supplementation in correcting deficiency has called for studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose regime in critically ill patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation that corrects a deficient state effectively and safely allows for intervention studies to be undertaken to determine the impact of vitamin D on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

Testing populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency — clinical approach

Measurement of 25(OH)D has been recommended in patients at risk for deficiency (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Thus, 25(OH)D is widely measured in many of these high-risk groups, for example, in older adults with decreased endogenous vitamin D production and prone to develop osteoporosis, in patients with parathyroid disorders and liver disease, and in patients with obesity. Patients with class III obesity (BMI > 40) present with low levels of 25(OH)D for various reasons, including nutritional factors, psychological reasons leading to less sun exposure, decreased hepatic expression of CYP2R1, and sequestration of the vitamin in the excess adipose tissue. Class III obesity may be addressed by bariatric surgery, which, by itself, may lead to malabsorption and, thereby, a further decrease of 25(OH)D levels, potentially followed by a secondary hyperparathyroidism. Other at-risk groups include those who are housebound, those working long hours indoors, dark-skinned individuals, patients with a chronic disease, those taking medications increasing vitamin D catabolism, etc (see Table 1). Paradoxically, listing situations where it may be reasonable to measure 25(OH)D accounts for most people. This would again result in overtesting with high costs for the health care system. Rather than testing in situations where it would be reasonable to, it would be better to test only in situations that actually warrant it. It comes down to the providers' judgment in first recognizing these high-risk individuals and then deciding to confirm with a measurement of 25(OH)D. There is, in fact, little evidence for the scientific utility and cost-effectiveness of testing for 25(OH)D deficiency, even in some of these selected groups. For example, some guidelines have recommended against screening pregnant women for vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for maternal and fetal outcomes. However, a case can be made for optimizing vitamin D status in all pregnant or breastfeeding women and their offspring, given the reemerging public health concern of rickets in high-risk children and potential benefits on future peak bone mass. Evidence of a relationship between low 25(OH)D and adverse maternal outcomes together with evidence that these adverse outcomes (eg, risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight, and the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage) are reduced after vitamin D supplementation have also been shown. Poor vitamin D status has also been associated with increased risk of low birth weight, increased risk of preterm birth, and offspring's adverse anthropometric and neurodevelopmental outcomes, while supplementation or sufficient vitamin D status was found to be protective against the risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age, and associated with improved offspring vitamin D sufficiency status, reduced fetal or neonatal mortality, and improved fetal and future linear growth.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Vitamin D deficiency in Europe: pandemic? [^115XiB6L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been described as being pandemic, but serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] distribution data for the European Union are of very variable quality. The NIH-led international Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) has developed protocols for standardizing existing 25(OH)D values from national health/nutrition surveys.

Objective

This study applied VDSP protocols to serum 25(OH)D data from representative childhood/teenage and adult/older adult European populations, representing a sizable geographical footprint, to better quantify the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe.

Design

The VDSP protocols were applied in 14 population studies [reanalysis of subsets of serum 25(OH)D in 11 studies and complete analysis of all samples from 3 studies that had not previously measured it] by using certified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on biobanked sera. These data were combined with standardized serum 25(OH)D data from 4 previously standardized studies (for a total n = 55,844). Prevalence estimates of vitamin D deficiency [using various serum 25(OH)D thresholds] were generated on the basis of standardized 25(OH)D data.

Results

An overall pooled estimate, irrespective of age group, ethnic mix, and latitude of study populations, showed that 13.0% of the 55,844 European individuals had serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 30 nmol/L on average in the year, with 17.7% and 8.3% in those sampled during the extended winter (October-March) and summer (April-November) periods, respectively. According to an alternate suggested definition of vitamin D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L), the prevalence was 40.4%. Dark-skinned ethnic subgroups had much higher (3- to 71-fold) prevalence of serum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L than did white populations.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is evident throughout the European population at prevalence rates that are concerning and that require action from a public health perspective. What direction these strategies take will depend on European policy but should aim to ensure vitamin D intakes that are protective against vitamin D deficiency in the majority of the European population.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116GMwd2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — evidence and harms for adult screening explains that total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status, yet levels are difficult to measure accurately and results vary by testing method and between laboratories using the same testing methods. There is no direct evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency, and adequate evidence shows that treatment of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency has no benefit on mortality, risk for fractures in persons selected solely on the basis of low vitamin D levels or incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, while evidence on other outcomes remains inadequate. Regarding harms, there is no direct evidence on the harms of screening, and adequate evidence indicates that the harms of treatment of vitamin D deficiency are small to none. Overall, the evidence on the benefits of screening is lacking; therefore, the balance of benefits and harms in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

### A review of the health consequences of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic [^114c9q6T]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis and myopathy are among the better known consequences of a low to very low vitamin D status. Over the past several years various predominantly epidemiological and prospective cohort studies have found associations between low vitamin D levels and various extraskeletal conditions. These findings may particularly become important over the next years since large proportions of the population have low vitamin D levels. Increasing incidence rates of obesity, adverse life-style factors and active avoidance of sunlight seem to decrease average population mean vitamin D levels further. This article gives a brief overview of known and also less well-established potential detrimental effects of a low vitamin D status.

### Rickets: part I [^116Xu1YU]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rickets is characterized by impaired mineralization and ossification of the growth plates of growing children caused by a variety of disorders, the most frequent of which is nutritional deficiency of vitamin D. Despite ample knowledge of its etiology and the availability of cost-effective methods of preventing it, vitamin D deficiency rickets remains a significant problem in developing and developed countries. This two-part review covers the history, etiology, pathophysiology and clinical and radiographical findings of vitamin D deficiency rickets. Other less frequent causes of rickets and some of the disorders entering into the differential diagnoses of rickets are also considered. Controversial issues surrounding vitamin D deficiency include determination of what constitutes vitamin D sufficiency and the potential relationship between low levels of vitamin D metabolites in many individuals and unexplained fractures in infants.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111jHwZu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 5: Micronutrients — vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines threshold definitions, testing, supplementation, and safety. Some, but not all, guidelines have defined insufficiency of vitamin D by serum 25(OH)D level between 20 and 29 ng/mL, deficiency as 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency as serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL. Both the KDOQI and KDIGO reports recommend checking and supplementing low serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD and dialysis patients. In the most recent update of the KDIGO guideline on MBD, it is suggested based on low-quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 1–5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be individualized according to baseline values and interventions; however, there was no clear suggestion on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed. Current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1–5D and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population, and it has been recommended for 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D repletion for the general population, although KDOQI acknowledges that patients with CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan. Because in CKD there is no clear evidence about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians should use the form commercially available in the context of their clinical practice. The tolerable upper intake level proposed by the IOM for the general population is 4,000 IU/d, there is no recommendation of a safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supplementation to prevent toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in CKD, and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered, especially for patients who are using calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D active analogues.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1173FY29]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk for low vitamin D in adults notes that although evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening, several factors are associated with lower vitamin D levels, including low dietary vitamin D intake, little or no UV B exposure (eg, winter season, high latitude, or sun avoidance), older age, and obesity, which is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels. People who are obese have a 1.3- to 2-fold increased risk of being vitamin D-deficient depending on the threshold used to define deficiency, and depending on the serum threshold used, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 2 to 10 times higher in non-Hispanic Black persons than in non-Hispanic White persons. These prevalence estimates are based on total 25(OH)D levels, controversy remains about whether this is the best measure of vitamin D status among different racial and ethnic groups, and a significant proportion of the variability in 25(OH)D levels among individuals is not explained by the risk factors noted.

### Official recommendations for vitamin D through the life stages in developed countries [^113yNH2n]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Inadequate vitamin D nutritional status is prevalent worldwide and has been associated with autoimmune disorders, heart disease, deadly cancers, insulin resistance, inflammation, neurological disorders, adverse outcomes in pregnancy, and increased risk for mortality. Expert recommendations for vitamin D intake differ between governmental agencies and practice guidelines from medical societies due to differences in the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. In addition, separate health promotion bodies also provide targeted recommendations for the prevention of specific disorders such as reducing risk for developing some cancers and autoimmune diseases. We review and provide perspectives regarding various recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM, United States) and Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN; United Kingdom), the World Health Organization, the Endocrine Society and other expert groups by life stage as a guide intended for clinician use.

### Association of vitamin D status and other clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^111TQZH1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

Vitamin D Supplementation

Dosing Regimens

The term " dose " in relation to vitamin D is typically used to signify the measured quantity of vitamin D (usually cholecalciferol, but other formulations such as ergocalciferol, eldecalcitol, calcifediol, etc are also available) in a pill. It is expressed as µg or IU (where 10 µg is 400 IU). The dose of cholecalciferol is considered an important measure as it correlates with the change in blood 25(OH)D level, which is commonly used to define vitamin D status and correlates with important clinical outcomes. Doses can be considered as "loading" or "maintenance". The most common use of a loading dose is to rapidly improve a low blood 25(OH)D; however, the clinical wisdom of this approach is questionable, especially given studies that demonstrate adverse effects with very high doses given infrequently, as discussed next. Intermittent administration of large doses is also used to optimize adherence. Daily doses are generally preferred when vitamin D replacement is considered necessary. The effect of a given dose on changing blood 25(OH)D varies considerably from person to person due to many factors, such as body weight, absorption, diet, degree of adiposity, CYP2R1 activity, DBP. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D by the National Academy of Medicine is set at 400 to 800 IU per day, and the tolerable upper intake level at 4000 IU per day; however, the "optimal" dose of vitamin D varies by the desired outcome, and other authors suggest that the upper limit of safety may be lower than 4000 IU per day. For example, 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day may be adequate to avoid clinical vitamin D deficiency and maintain calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals. Doses of vitamin D higher than the recommended upper limit may be associated with toxicity; nonetheless, daily doses up to 10 000 IU have been used without safety concerns. Careful and judicious use of vitamin D will permit the realization of potential benefits and achieving optimal outcomes.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.
Recent National guidance has been published on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK.

Additionally, early-onset and late-onset PE have unique clinical features, biomarkers and prognoses that may guide clinical dose recommendations. Studies reported varying degrees of risk for clinical subtypes of PE among women with low vitamin D levels. In order to guide the clinical recommendations, investigators must use a standard set of definitions for the disease and clinical subtypes in future research. In the current literature, the definition of PE was not consistent across studies, limiting our ability to draw generalizations. For example, clinical cutoffs for proteinuria varied slightly among studies. Replication of findings using a uniform set of definitions for PE and clinical subtypes can inform the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of PE.

Robinson et al. suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be a factor in the disproportionate incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in African American women since this group had the lowest vitamin D levels among the populations they studied. While some studies have been able to capture an adequate representation of African American women, there is a need for further research on populations with very low vitamin D levels to understand this observation and identify factors that predispose high-risk groups to PE and its more threatening clinical subtypes.

Despite the clear association of serum deficiency with PE, a better understanding of the variable impact of supplementation is needed to identify potential of genetic and environmental interactions, as well as pre-conception data to identify the critical time window for therapeutic potential of vitamin D, if any.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a 2019 evidence analysis center evidence-based practice guideline [^111Ns9SM]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shows variable effects across studies, and "severe" vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D levels under 10 ng per ml. Across included trials, supplementation resulted in a decrease in acute exacerbations (AE) in a sub-group with "severe deficiency", while other trials resulted in reduced AEs, no impact in lung function (LF) outcomes, or improvement in LF outcomes and a reduction in AEs. Conclusion statements supporting the recommendations are Fair. Synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D status definitions, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117E4Y9W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy — very low vitamin D status (25(OH)D < 10–12 ng/mL [< 25–30 nmol/L]) is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypocalcemic seizures, cardiomyopathy, and neonatal rickets, and many studies have described associations between 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, (< 50 nmol/L) and increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Whether nutritional requirements for vitamin D change during pregnancy is not known, and evidence for the role of vitamin D in improving perinatal outcomes is conflicting; accordingly, preconception or pregnancy-specific recommendations for vitamin D are not available, with no consensus on the dosage of vitamin D or 25(OH)D level required, and reported prevalence rates for low and very low vitamin D status (25(OH)D < 20 and < 12 ng/mL [< 50 and < 30 nmol/L], respectively) are high among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy. The guideline highlights two clinical questions: Question 8, "Should empiric vitamin D supplementation vs no empiric vitamin D supplementation be used during pregnancy?" and Question 9, "Should vitamin D supplementation vs no vitamin D supplementation be used during pregnancy only when 25(OH)D levels are below a threshold?"

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

Ratings of quality of evidence

We graded the quality of the available evidence in a four-part hierarchy according to the GRADE scheme (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE assesses the quality of evidence using four grades: high, moderate, low, and very low. Observational studies always start with a rating of low quality of evidence because of the risk of residual confounding but can be upgraded for large treatment effects, dose effect gradients, or if apparent confounding would reduce the observed effect. Criteria for downgrading the quality of evidence are risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We dually evaluated the overall quality of evidence for each outcome viewed as "critical" for decision-making by the scientific expert panel. We reconciled all disagreements in grades through consensus discussion.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^115dbSJP]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol) and D(3). An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration. Although controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be approximately 30 to 32 ng/mL or above. Using this definition, it has been estimated that approximately three-quarters of all adults in the United States have low levels. Low vitamin D status classically has skeletal consequences such as osteomalacia/rickets. More recently, associations between low vitamin D status and increased risk for various nonskeletal morbidities have been recognized; whether all of these associations are causally related to low vitamin D status remains to be determined. To achieve optimal vitamin D status, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU or more of vitamin D are required. The risk of toxicity with "high" amounts of vitamin D intake is low. Substantial between-individual variability exists in response to the same administered vitamin D dose. When to monitor 25(OH)D levels has received little attention. Supplementation with vitamin D(3) may be preferable to vitamin D(2).
