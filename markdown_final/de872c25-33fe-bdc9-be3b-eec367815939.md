## Question

What is the ASTRAL study?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ASTRAL study is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "ASTRAL" is intended, because multiple trials share that acronym. Then, I should verify the core design and population of the renal ASTRAL trial. Next, I will review the primary and secondary outcomes and the main results. After that, I should examine subgroup and long-term analyses, including any signals in high-risk subgroups. Finally, I will consider criticisms, limitations, and how the findings fit into current practice and guidelines, making sure I distinguish ASTRAL from similarly named studies in other fields.

> Let me first confirm the acronym ambiguity, because I need to ensure we are discussing the correct trial. "ASTRAL" has been used for at least four distinct studies: the renal Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions trial, the hepatitis C ASTRAL-1/2/3/4 program with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, the stroke Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne cohort, and the AML ASTRAL-2 guadecitabine trial; given the renal physiology framing in the question, the renal ASTRAL trial is the most likely target, but I should explicitly state this to avoid confusion [^8c82788f] [^29feb795] [^c859d4e5] [^4260054e].

> Now, I will define the renal ASTRAL trial precisely. ASTRAL was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 806 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and clinician uncertainty about the benefit of revascularization, randomizing them 1:1 to percutaneous revascularization plus optimal medical therapy versus medical therapy alone; the primary outcome was the rate of decline in renal function measured by the reciprocal of serum creatinine, with secondary outcomes including renal events, major cardiovascular events, and mortality, and the initial results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 [^8c82788f] [^37579381].

> Wait, let me verify the key baseline characteristics and intervention details so I don't gloss over important context. The mean age was about 70–71 years, mean eGFR around 40 mL/min/1.73 m², and mean RAS severity about 76%, with 83% of those assigned to revascularization actually undergoing attempted stenting; importantly, patients with clear indications for revascularization (e.g., flash pulmonary edema) were excluded, which shaped the risk profile of the cohort [^e34b9939] [^37579381].

> I should confirm the primary outcome result and its interpretation. There was no significant difference in the rate of decline in renal function between revascularization and medical therapy, with a mean difference in the slope of reciprocal creatinine of 0.06 × 10⁻³ L/μmol/year (95% CI 0 to 0.13), indicating no renal benefit from stenting in this population; secondary outcomes likewise showed no significant differences in renal events, major cardiovascular events, or death, establishing a neutral result for revascularization in unselected ARVD patients [^8c82788f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability without checking subgroup and long-term data. The long-term follow-up to a median 56.4 months confirmed no overall benefit of revascularization on renal function, cardiovascular events, or survival, and even in a post hoc "severe RAS" subgroup (bilateral > 70% or > 70% in a solitary kidney), differences in a composite renal–cardiovascular outcome and mortality were not statistically significant, though hazard ratios around 0.70–0.74 suggested a possible signal that warrants cautious interpretation given the post hoc nature and wide confidence intervals [^37579381] [^a6a0d983] [^fb6cdbda].

> I need to ensure I address criticisms and limitations transparently. Critics have argued that ASTRAL enrolled many patients with lower-grade stenoses and preserved renal function, potentially diluting any benefit, and that the "uncertainty principle" for inclusion introduced selection bias; indeed, about 41% had RAS < 70%, and patients with clear indications for revascularization were excluded, so the trial effectively tested revascularization in a lower-risk, uncertain-benefit population, which limits external validity to higher-risk phenotypes [^9f29098a] [^55b0c270] [^6e8c8586].

> Next, I should review how these findings integrate with contemporary practice and guidelines. The ASTRAL results, together with the similarly neutral CORAL trial, shifted practice toward reserving revascularization for specific high-risk scenarios such as recurrent flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension despite optimal therapy, rapidly declining renal function in the setting of hemodynamically significant stenosis, or bilateral critical stenosis in a solitary kidney; routine stenting for incidental ARVD is not supported, and medical therapy with risk-factor modification remains first-line for most patients [^1455b459] [^9f29098a].

> But wait, what if the user meant a different ASTRAL entirely? I should double-check that I've addressed the ambiguity. If the intent was hepatitis C, the ASTRAL-1/2/3/4 trials established sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as a highly effective, pangenotypic regimen with excellent SVR12 rates and favorable tolerability; if stroke, the ASTRAL registry is a large Lausanne cohort used for prognostic modeling; if AML, ASTRAL-2 tested guadecitabine versus treatment choice and did not meet its survival endpoint; I will keep the renal ASTRAL as the primary focus here but acknowledge these alternatives explicitly to avoid misinterpretation [^29feb795] [^0c025e82] [^c859d4e5] [^4260054e].

> In summary, the renal ASTRAL trial showed that in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and clinician uncertainty about revascularization, adding renal artery stenting to optimal medical therapy did not improve renal function, cardiovascular outcomes, or survival over medical therapy alone; long-term follow-up reinforced these neutral findings, and while a signal in severe RAS is intriguing, it remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing, supporting a selective, risk-stratified approach to revascularization rather than routine use [^8c82788f] [^37579381] [^a6a0d983].

The ASTRAL trial (Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study of 806 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, comparing renal artery revascularization plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone [^8c82788f]. It found **no significant benefit** of revascularization over medical therapy for renal function, blood pressure control, cardiovascular events, or mortality, with a median follow-up of 34 months [^8c82788f]. Long-term follow-up (median 56.4 months) confirmed no late advantage of revascularization, including in subgroups with severe renal artery stenosis or rapid renal decline [^37579381] [^fb6cdbda]. The trial's conclusions shaped guidelines to favor medical therapy as first-line management for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, reserving revascularization for select refractory cases [^notfound].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.
- **Population**: 806 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease; clinicians were uncertain about the benefit of revascularization.
- **Intervention**: Renal artery angioplasty/stenting plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone (antihypertensives, statins, antiplatelets).
- **Primary outcome**: Rate of decline in renal function (reciprocal of serum creatinine) [^8c82788f].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Blood pressure control, renal events, cardiovascular events, mortality [^8c82788f].
- **Follow-up**: Median 34 months; long-term follow-up to 56.4 months [^37579381].

---

## Key findings

- **Renal function**: No significant difference in renal function decline between groups (mean difference 0.06 × 10⁻³ L/μmol/year; 95% CI, 0 to 0.13) [^8c82788f].
- **Blood pressure**: No significant difference in blood pressure control or antihypertensive use [^8c82788f].
- **Cardiovascular events**: No significant difference in major cardiovascular events (HR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.19) [^8c82788f].
- **Mortality**: No significant difference in mortality (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69–1.18) [^8c82788f].
- **Long-term outcomes**: No late benefit of revascularization on renal, cardiovascular, or mortality outcomes [^37579381] [^22c3f97c].

---

## Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses examined severe renal artery stenosis (> 70% bilateral or solitary kidney) and rapid renal decline; **neither subgroup showed significant benefit** from revascularization, though hazard ratios suggested possible trends that did not reach statistical significance [^37579381] [^fb6cdbda].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

The ASTRAL trial's neutral results led to a **shift toward medical therapy** as first-line management for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Revascularization is now reserved for select refractory cases — such as resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema — rather than routine use [^notfound].

---

## Criticisms and limitations

- **Patient selection**: Many patients had moderate stenosis and preserved renal function, potentially masking benefit in severe disease [^9f29098a].
- **Technical factors**: Variable stent placement and lack of routine pressure gradient assessment may have limited revascularization efficacy [^notfound].
- **Generalizability**: Exclusion of patients with clear indications for revascularization limits applicability to high-risk phenotypes [^6e8c8586].

---

## Comparison with other trials

CORAL, a larger RCT, similarly found **no benefit** of revascularization over medical therapy for renal or cardiovascular outcomes, reinforcing ASTRAL's conclusions [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ASTRAL trial demonstrated that routine renal artery revascularization does not improve renal function, blood pressure control, cardiovascular outcomes, or survival compared with medical therapy alone. This has established medical therapy as the standard of care for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, with revascularization reserved for select refractory cases.

ASTRAL enrolled 806 participants between 2000 and 2007, and the initial report included data after the last enrolled patient had received a 12-month follow-up in 2008. However, the trial design allowed for follow-up to be continued until the end of 2013 in patients who were surviving at the time of the first database lock (November 2008). This study reports the long-term outcomes of ASTRAL patients as specified in the original design of ASTRAL, including most prespecified subgroup analyses and additional analyses, including application of the CORAL composite primary outcome and key subgroups of very severe RAS and low-level proteinuria.

The study ASTRAL was published by ASTRAL Investigators and colleagues in 2009 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Renal artery stenosis and Hypertension. In the ASTRAL study, the trial question was: what is the role of percutaneous revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease? In the ASTRAL study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ASTRAL study, the population was: 806 patients (299 female, 507 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease. The key exclusion criteria were requirement of surgical revascularization or high likelihood of requiring revascularization within 6 months, nonatheromatous CVD, or undergone previous revascularization for renal artery stenosis. In the ASTRAL study, the interventions were: n = 403 revascularization (with angioplasty either alone or with stenting plus medical therapy with statins, antiplatelet agents, and optimal blood-pressure control) n = 403 medical therapy (statins, antiplatelet agents, and optimal blood-pressure control). In the ASTRAL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of decline in serum creatinine (-0.071 ×10⁻³ L/mcmol/year vs. -0.131 ×10⁻³ L/mcmol/year; MD 0.06, 95% CI 0 to 0.13). In the ASTRAL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in renal events (22% vs. 22%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.4) No significant difference in major cardiovascular events (49% vs. 51%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19) No significant difference in death (60% vs. 57%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.18). In the ASTRAL study, the conclusion was: in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, revascularization was not superior to medical therapy with respect to the rate of decline in serum creatinine.

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^66b68a65]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Participating sites collected data for each subject on the anniversary of their enrollment date on an annual basis beyond 2008, completing annual follow-up forms returned to the trial center. Key data returns were serum creatinine and clinic blood pressure (BP) closest to the annual anniversary date, need for renal revascularization (either cross-over from the medical care arm or repeat procedure in the revascularized arm), cardiovascular events (CVEs; myocardial infarction, stroke, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for angina, fluid overload or cardiac failure, coronary artery revascularization, or peripheral arterial procedure), significant renal events (acute kidney injury, initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation, nephrectomy, or death from renal failure), and death, with cause of death noted when available.

The primary ASTRAL outcome was a change in renal function over time. For the current analysis, the reciprocal of creatinine used in the ASTRAL trial was replaced by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculation using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation. eGFR calculations were made retrospectively, and ethnicity adjustment was not included. This methodological adjustment reflects changes in clinical practice during the interval since ASTRAL was conceived, as the initial trial design predated widespread use of eGFR. The secondary outcomes included time to the first major renal event, the first CVE, and death, and were unchanged from the first trial report. A further secondary outcome was introduced for this analysis to mirror the composite end point of the CORAL trial; this was defined as time to the first of any renal, cardiovascular, or mortality events with the addition of time to > 30% decline in renal function from enrollment (measured using the slope of eGFR over time). Follow-up was from trial enrollment until death, the most recent clinical review, or December 31, 2013. Subgroup analyses were completed as per the original trial design with the exception of kidney length. These included grouping by serum creatinine, eGFR, degree of RAS, and previous rapid progression of renal impairment (defined as an increase in serum creatinine > 100 umol/L or > 20% during the previous 1-year period), and post hoc analysis of severe RAS (> 70% RAS either bilaterally or affecting a solitary functioning kidney) was also reported. An additional analysis according to the presence or absence of significant albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, stratified above or below 30 mg/mmol), estimated from overall measurements of proteinuria, was included in this study in recognition of an albuminuria subgroup analysis in the CORAL trial. As proteinuria in the ASTRAL patients was measured by urinary protein creatinine ratio or 24-hour total proteinuria, with urinary albumin:creatinine ratio derived from this, it was not possible to reliably use the CORAL urinary albumin:creatinine ratio cut-off, and the higher level of 30 mg/mmol was selected. The definitions and thresholds used in defining renal function subgroups were updated to eGFR-based CKD stages (using CKD Epidemiology Collaboration).

Study oversight

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Institutional review board/ethics committee approval was obtained before the start of the trial in each participating center, and all patients provided written informed consent before being randomly assigned. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) was established before the start of the trial, composed of 2 clinical and 1 statistical expert who did not participate in any of the ASTRAL guadecitabine trials. The committee met at regular intervals to review unblinded efficacy and safety data in closed sessions, followed by an open session with sponsor representatives (without any unblinded data) to provide recommendation on study conduct. In September 2018, with data from 278 randomly assigned patients and 107 deaths reported from the planned 315 deaths, the DMC estimated that the HR for OS at that time was 1.32 and that the trial would be highly unlikely to reach its targeted HR of 0.692 when all patients were randomly assigned. The DMC recommended that the sponsor stop further enrollment and provide the information to all investigators and patients but continue to treat and follow patients already randomly assigned according to their individual response and benefit from treatment, and after receiving reconsent from patients. By the time this was implemented by the sponsor, 302 of the planned 404 patients were enrolled. All enrolled patients were followed for ≥ 1 year from randomization, with a data cutoff in January 2020.

### Influence and critique of the ASTRAL and CORAL trials [^9042f8f8]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Optimal management of renal artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease has been widely debated and studied. Although the accepted invasive treatment has evolved into favoring balloon angioplasty and stenting, the indications for intervention or medical therapy have not been universally agreed upon. The Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial was conducted to answer the question of whether medical therapy or angioplasty and stenting is the best treatment for hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. However, the ASTRAL trial's study design was faulty and therefore did not provide conclusive evidence to answer the question. The Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) trial was designed to answer the same question as to which treatment (medical or angioplasty and stent) is best for renal artery stenosis, and its methodologies took into consideration the weaknesses of the ASTRAL trial. Results are soon to be released.

### Guadecitabine vs TC in relapsed / refractory AML after intensive chemotherapy: a randomized phase 3 ASTRAL-2 trial [^777ec32f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design

ASTRAL-2 was a phase 3 international, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (identifier #; EudraCT 2015-005256-97). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to guadecitabine or a preselected physician TC of either intensive chemotherapy, low-intensity treatment, or best supportive care (BSC).

Guadecitabine was given as 60 mg/m² per day subcutaneously for 10 days for 1 or 2 cycles (based on disease response and hematologic recovery in the first cycle), followed by subsequent 5-day cycles. Cycles were administered every 28 days, unless delayed for hematologic recovery, and continued as long as the patient continued to benefit.

Before randomization, the investigator assigned each patient to one of the following TC options given every 28 days based on the prior treatment received, country approval, and local institutional standard practice:

- **High intensity**:

- Intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C), recommended as 1.0 to 1.5 g/m² IV every 12 hours or up to 6 g/m² per day IV for ≤ 6 days.
- **Mitoxantrone, etoposide, and Ara-C (MEC regimen)**: mitoxantrone 6 to 12 mg/m² IV (recommended 8 mg/m²), etoposide 80 to 200 mg/m² IV (recommended 100 mg/m²), and Ara-C 1000 mg/m² IV, each daily for 5 days (days 1–5).
- Fludarabine, Ara-C, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, with or without idarubicin (FLAG/FLAG-Ida), with fludarabine 25 to 30 mg/m² per day IV on days 1 to 5, ARA-C 12 g/m² per day IV for up to 5 days (recommended to be given 4 hours after fludarabine), and subcutaneous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor daily from day 6 up to white cell count recovery, with or without idarubicin 8 mg/m² per day IV on days 3 to 5.
- **Low intensity**:

- Low-dose Ara-C 20 mg subcutaneous (SC) or IV twice a day on days 1 to 10;
- Decitabine 20 mg/m² per day IV on days 1 to 5; or
- Azacitidine 75 mg/m² per day IV or SC on days 1 to 7.
- BSC according to local institutional standards.

### The management of renal artery stenosis: an alternative interpretation of ASTRAL and CORAL [^9f29098a]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the literature on intervention for renal artery stenosis (RAS), with special emphasis on the last two and largest randomized trials, the ASTRAL and CORAL trials.

Design

A review of renal physiology, pathology, and pathophysiology of RAS and a critical analysis of the randomized trials.

Materials

Published literature for renal physiology and RAS were assessed.

Methods

Renal physiology, renal intervention, and the limitations and challenges of both ASTRAL and CORAL are analysed.

Results

The last two reported, and largest randomized trials of percutaneous renal artery intervention for RAS were the ASTRAL and the CORAL trials; both generated much debate and much controversy, however both trials had methodological shortcomings, and assumed a simplistic approach to renal physiology. Both trials were hampered by slow recruitment, and there were protocol changes to accommodate, and CORAL was not powered for subgroup analysis. The primary outcome measure for ASTRAL was the reciprocal of serum creatinine levels and CORAL a complex composite endpoint of cardiovascular or renal events. In ASTRAL, 25% of patients had normal renal function and 40% almost normal renal function; and in CORAL, 50% of the cohort had either no renal failure, or were Stage I or Stage II CKD, (i.e. eGFR of > 60 mls/min/1.73 m²). In ASTRAL, 41% of patients had a stenosis of < 70%; and an interim analysis of 611 patients (of 947 enrolled) in CORAL revealed that 55% had < 70% renal artery stenosis.

Conclusions

Best evidence still supports intervention for patients with RAS of > 80% with a significant trans-lesional pressure gradient; difficult to control blood pressure with more than three antihypertensives, especially in younger patients; and those with truncal rather than ostial stenosis; patient with a rapid deterioration of renal function; flash pulmonary oedema; and post-transplant RAS.

### Guadecitabine vs TC in relapsed / refractory AML after intensive chemotherapy: a randomized phase 3 ASTRAL-2 trial [^2780d319]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome and other survival analyses

Median follow-up was 21.6 months. Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Figure 3 shows a forest plot of the prespecified subgroup OS analyses. There was no statistically significant difference between the guadecitabine and TC arms in the ITT population. Median OS durations were 6.4 and 5.4 months for guadecitabine and TC, respectively (HR 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), [0.67–1.14]; log-rank P = 0.33). There was no significant difference in median OS between guadecitabine (6.4 months), high-intensity treatment (6.2 months), and low-intensity treatment (5.3 months).

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^fb6cdbda]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Subgroup Analyses

No difference was observed between revascularization or medical therapy in any of the prespecified subgroups (according to serum creatinine, eGFR, degree of RAS, or previous rate of progression of renal impairment) in this long-term follow-up. However, in the intervening years since the original trial design, there have been significant changes in clinical practice and trial design. The clinically relevant subgroups are now felt to be severe RAS (bilateral > 70% or > 70% in a single functioning kidney), prior rapid declining kidney function, and the presence or absence of albuminuria. These subgroups and their outcomes are summarized across the revascularization and medical arms in Table 1. No statistical differences were found between revascularization and medical therapy in any of these subgroups.

In the post hoc analysis of the severe RAS subgroup (bilateral stenosis > 70% or stenosis > 70% in a single functioning kidney), the HR for the CORAL composite end point was 0.74 (P = 0.062) and for mortality 0.70 (P = 0.051; Table 4). No difference was seen across the stages of CKD for any of the outcomes, including the composite outcome (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
Composite outcome (renal, cardiovascular, and mortality) event-free survival across CKD stages. CKD indicates chronic kidney disease.

Per-Protocol Analysis

Stenting was attempted in 335 and successful in 317 participants in the revascularization group. Twenty-four of those randomized to the medical group subsequently underwent revascularization. Thus, the per-protocol analysis included 317 in the revascularization arm and 379 in the medical arm. Overall, there was no significant difference in renal events, CVEs, the composite (CORAL) end point, or death when analyzed on a per-protocol basis (see Table 5).

### Cardiac structure and function after revascularization versus medical therapy for renal artery stenosis: the ASTRAL heart echocardiographic sub-study [^f60f2e2c]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this ASTRAL sub-study, there was no significant difference in longitudinal change in echocardiographic parameters between revascularized and non-revascularized patients, nor between baseline and follow-up scans in the study population as a whole. These results are consistent with the neutral renal, cardiovascular and mortality end-points observed in the main ASTRAL trial and in the subsequent CORAL trial.

### Using fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide asthma therapy: design and methodological issues for ASthma TReatment ALgorithm studies [^53998a99]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Current asthma guidelines recommend treatment based on the assessment of asthma control using symptoms and lung function. Noninvasive markers are an attractive way to modify therapy since they offer improved selection of active treatment(s) based on individual response, and improved titration of treatment using markers that are better related to treatment outcomes.

Aims

To review the methodological and design features of noninvasive marker studies in asthma.

Methods

Systematic assessment of published randomized trials of asthma therapy guided by fraction of exhaled nitric oxide(FENO).

Results

FENO has appeal as a marker to adjust asthma therapy since it is readily measured, gives reproducible results, and is responsive to changes in inhaled corticosteroid doses. However, the five randomised trials of FENO guided therapy have had mixed results. This may be because there are specific design and methodological issues that need to be addressed in the conduct of ASthma TReatment ALgorithm(ASTRAL) studies. There needs to be a clear dose response relationship for the active drugs used and the outcomes measured. The algorithm decision points should be based on outcomes in the population of interest rather than the range of values in healthy people, and the algorithm used needs to provide a sufficiently different result to clinical decision making in order for there to be any discernible benefit. A new metric is required to assess the algorithm performance, and the discordance:concordance(DC) ratio can assist with this.

Conclusion

Incorporating these design features into future FENO studies should improve the study performance and aid in obtaining a better estimate of the value of FENO guided asthma therapy.

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^e34b9939]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The initial results of the ASTRAL trial, which enrolled 806 patients from 2000 to 2007, were reported in 2009, with surviving patients remaining under follow-up until December 31, 2013 (see CONSORT [Consolidating Standards of Reporting Trials] diagram in Figure 1). As of the end of 2013, median follow-up was 56.4 (interquartile range, 28.7–82.7) months compared with a median of 33.6 months in the 2009 publication. By the end of follow-up, 108 participants (13%) were lost to follow-up or had withdrawn from the study: 61 from the revascularization arm and 47 from the medical arm. There were no significant differences in the baseline covariates between the treatment arms in the lost-to-follow-up/withdrawn consent group (Table 1), and a competing risk model incorporating lost-to-follow-up as a censoring event did not show any significant difference in any of the outcomes.

ASTRAL indicates Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions. *These patients were identified as having minimal stenosis post randomization determined by "on-the-table" intraarterial angiography.

Table 2 shows the baseline data of the entire trial population and also that of key subgroups. The mean age of the participants at enrollment was 71 (SD, 7.6) years, the mean eGFR was 40 (range, 5.4–124.5) mL/min/1.73 m², the mean RAS was estimated at 76% (range, 20%–100%), and the mean BP was 150/76 (SD, 25/12.4) mm Hg. Notably, 83% (335/403) of the patients randomized to receive revascularization underwent attempted stenting; the remaining 17% (68/403) of the revascularization group were either identified as having insignificant RAS (too minimal to merit revascularization) or fully occluded at the time of the planned procedure, or the patient had withdrawn consent.

### Angioplasty and STent for renal artery lesions (ASTRAL trial): rationale, methods and results so far [^b37f6f41]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is a relatively common condition which may lead to progressive renal dysfunction, and eventually to end-stage renal failure. Revascularization has been used in an attempt to prevent progression of ARVD, despite a lack of evidence for a benefit on kidney function. Therefore, large-scale randomized trials are needed to determine reliably whether or not there is any worthwhile benefit. The Angioplasty and STent for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial comparing renal function in ARVD patients randomized to either revascularization or medical management alone was designed to provide this evidence. ASTRAL started recruiting in November 2000 and, as of the end of 2006, 731 patients have been randomized into the trial (19 patients short of its minimum target of 750 patients). A pooled analysis (not split by treatment arm) of all patients shows that serum creatinine increased in the first 6 months then remained relatively steady, whereas blood pressure has decreased from baseline. The trial is due to close to recruitment in April 2007, with the first presentation of the results of the randomized treatment comparison planned for the spring of 2008. To date ASTRAL is by far the largest randomized trial in ARVD, and will provide the most reliable and timely evidence on the role, if any, of revascularization in ARVD with which to guide the treatment of future patients.

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^37579381]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ASTRAL trial (Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions) recruited 806 patients between 2000 and 2007. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) and clinician uncertainty about the benefit of revascularization were randomized 1:1 to medical therapy with or without renal artery stenting. The initial results were presented in 2009 at a median 33.6-month follow-up, with no benefit of revascularization on renal or cardiovascular outcomes. Surviving patients remained under follow-up until the end of 2013, and the long-term results are presented in this study.

Methods

Data were analyzed to assess whether there was a later impact of revascularization on renal function, cardiovascular events, and survival, including a composite outcome of renal and cardiovascular outcomes and death (as in the CORAL trial [Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions]). Prespecified subgroup analyses included different categories of renal function, rapid deterioration in kidney function, and degree of RAS. Post hoc analyses of patients with severe RAS (bilateral 70% or > 70% in a solitary kidney), those with or without proteinuria, and a per-protocol analysis were performed.

Results

The mean age of the entry population was 70.5 years, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 40 mL/min/1.73 m², the mean RAS was 76%, and the mean blood pressure was 150/76 mmHg; 83% of the revascularization group underwent attempted stenting. The median follow-up was 56.4 months, with 108 patients lost to follow-up. By the end of follow-up, 50% of the evaluable population had died, 18% had suffered a first renal event, and 40% had suffered a first cardiovascular event. No statistical difference was observed for any outcome in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

Conclusions

The long-term follow-up of the ASTRAL trial showed no overall benefit of renal revascularization to renal and cardiovascular outcomes. It has been highlighted that a proportion of the population had lower-risk RAS, and there is likely to be merit in further study in a higher-risk population.

### Glibenclamide for brain contusions: contextualizing a promising clinical trial design that leverages an imaging-based TBI endotype [^ad8bded1]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

TBI heterogeneity is recognized as a major impediment to successful translation of therapies that could improve morbidity and mortality after injury. This heterogeneity exists on multiple levels including primary injury, secondary injury/host-response, and recovery. One widely accepted type of primary-injury related heterogeneity is pathoanatomic-the intracranial compartment that is predominantly affected, which can include any combination of subdural, subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, diffuse axonal, intraventricular and epidural hemorrhages. Intraparenchymal contusions carry the highest risk for progression. Contusion expansion is one of the most important drivers of death and disability after TBI. Over the past decade, there has been increasing evidence of the role of the sulfonylurea-receptor 1-transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (SUR1-TRPM4) channel in secondary injury after TBI, including progression of both cerebral edema and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 with glibenclamide has shown promising results in preclinical models of contusional TBI with benefits against cerebral edema, secondary hemorrhage progression of the contusion, and improved functional outcome. Early-stage human research supports the key role of this pathway in contusion expansion and suggests a benefit with glibenclamide inhibition. ASTRAL is an ongoing international multi-center double blind multidose placebo-controlled phase-II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an intravenous formulation of glibenclamide (BIIB093). ASTRAL is a unique and innovative study that addresses TBI heterogeneity by limiting enrollment to patients with the TBI pathoanatomic endotype of brain contusion and using contusion-expansion (a mechanistically linked secondary injury) as its primary outcome. Both criteria are consistent with the strong supporting preclinical and molecular data. In this narrative review, we contextualize the development and design of ASTRAL, including the need to address TBI heterogeneity, the scientific rationale underlying the focus on brain contusions and contusion-expansion, and the preclinical and clinical data supporting benefit of SUR1-TRPM4 inhibition in this specific endotype. Within this framework, we summarize the current study design of ASTRAL which is sponsored by Biogen and actively enrolling with a goal of 160 participants.

### Guadecitabine vs TC in relapsed / refractory AML after intensive chemotherapy: a randomized phase 3 ASTRAL-2 trial [^58f9bc84]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

End points and assessments

The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included 12- and 24-month survival rate; CR; CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh); CR+CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi); duration of CR+CRh; event-free survival (EFS); transfusion independence rate; HCT rate; and safety.

Peripheral blood (PB) was assessed at screening and on day 1 of each cycle for response evaluation. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate or biopsy was performed at screening and at the end of cycles 1, 3, and 6 unless PB showed persistence of ≥ 5% leukemic blasts, which excluded the possibility of a marrow response. After cycle 6, BM assessment by BM aspirate or biopsy was repeated every 3 months for the first year of the study and every 6 months thereafter until PB or BM assessment showed disease progression or relapse.

Evaluation of response was determined based on PB and BM data listings at each visit using International Working Group response criteriawith the addition of CRh (defined as < 5% of BM blasts, no evidence of disease, partial recovery of PB counts [platelets > 50 000/μL], and absolute neutrophil count > 500/μL).

Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each visit in all patients who received treatment and were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03.

### Do patients undergoing renal revascularization outside of the ASTRAL trial show any benefit? Results of a single-centre observational study [^40425969]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction/Objectives

Though recent research has concluded that revascularization of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has no benefit for most patients, negative findings of the Angioplasty and STent for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial have been criticized in professional fora. Aim of the current study was to determine whether patients undergoing renal revascularization outside of ASTRAL showed any benefit. If so, could we determine a patient group that would benefit from intervention?

Methods

Patients undergoing renal revascularization outside of the ASTRAL trial between 2003 and 2007 at our institution were reviewed. The primary comparison was the rate of decline of renal function based on individual reciprocal creatinine plots for the periods leading up to and following revascularization. Those who showed any improvement in the mean slope were compared to those with a negative or neutral response.

Results

One hundred and twenty-seven patients underwent renal revascularization outside of ASTRAL. The majority [79 (62%)] showed some improvement in the rate of change in renal function, though overall this failed to reach statistical significance. Those who responded positively tended to be declining faster prior to intervention; they were less likely to require RRT (6 versus 29%), and if they did, it was significantly later (3.6 versus 0.7 years). Mortality was, however, similar in both groups. Subgroup analysis was undertaken of patients in whom kidney function was rapidly deteriorating prior to revascularization. The rate of change in this group showed a more sizeable improvement (P = 0.05). Nonetheless, a similar proportion of both groups required RRT and there was no evidence of improvement in overall mortality.

Conclusion

In keeping with ASTRAL's findings, our use of renal revascularization has produced no demonstrable benefit overall. There was a suggestion of benefit in patients with rapidly declining renal function in terms of delaying the need for renal replacement therapy, but improvements in cardiovascular outcomes have yet to be proven.

Table 2.
Baseline Characteristics, Comorbid Features, and Outcomes of Long-Term Follow-Up by Subgroup

Renal events occurred in 18% (126), including 14% (95) who required renal replacement therapy (RRT), and 46% (318) had suffered a first CVE. In ASTRAL, the original primary outcome was change in renal function, and prespecified secondary end points were BP, time to the first renal event, time to the first major CVE, and mortality. All of these prespecified end points were analyzed, and no differences were found. No difference was observed for any outcome in the intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses, either in the whole population or the prespecified subgroups (see Table 3 and). In an intention-to-treat analysis of the severe RAS subgroup of 163 patients (RAS > 70% in both kidneys or in a single functioning kidney), revascularization was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.54–1.01; P = 0.062) for the composite renal and cardiovascular outcome (as used in CORAL) and a HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.49–1.0; P = 0.051) for death (Table 4).

Table 4.
Outcomes for Patients With Severe RAS (Bilateral Stenosis > 70% or > 70% in a Single Functioning Kidney)

The median follow-up of patients in the revascularization group was 58.6 months, and 56.2 months in the medical group. At the time of analysis, 169 patients (42%) and 181 patients (45%) had died in these respective groups (P = 0.727), whereas 61 (15.1%) and 47 (11.6%) had been lost to follow-up or withdrawn (P = 0.147).

At the end of follow-up, the mean eGFR in the revascularization group was 38.6 versus 36.5 mL/min in the medical group (P = 0.381).

### Cardiac structure and function after revascularization versus medical therapy for renal artery stenosis: the ASTRAL heart echocardiographic sub-study [^15922fcf]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The detailed method of patient selection and intervention for ASTRAL has previously been published. In summary, ASTRAL was a multicentre, non-blinded clinical trial comparing outcomes in ARVD between patients randomised to receive either medical therapy or medical therapy plus percutaneous renal artery revascularization (Clinical Trials Registration ISRCTN59586944). Ethical approval for ASTRAL was granted by the West Midlands Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, UK and the ethics committee relevant to each individual participating study centre. Ethical permission for the echocardiographic sub-study was obtained separately. Support for the main ASTRAL trial was received from the Medical Research Council UK, Kidney Research UK, and Medtronic.

Patient selection

Patients were eligible for ASTRAL if they had at least one renal artery with an atherosclerotic lesion suitable for percutaneous revascularization and their managing clinician was not convinced that revascularization was essential. Patients were excluded if revascularization was already indicated as per guidelines, if the patient had undergone previous revascularization, or if the stenosis was not atherosclerotic in origin. No patients on haemodialysis were entered into the study, and because flash pulmonary oedema is a long-standing agreed indication for revascularization in ARVD, such patients were not recruited to ASTRAL.

Patients from 7 centres participating in ASTRAL were approached to take part in this cardiac sub-study (Salford Royal Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Royal Free London, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Derriford Hospital Plymouth, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Leicester). Patients were randomised 1:1 into the ASTRAL study to either revascularization or no revascularization, and this also determined the randomised treatment allocation of patients in the sub-study. No specific exclusion criteria were applied to the echocardiographic sub-study, and every patient provided signed informed consent.

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^22c3f97c]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis similar to the CORAL composite primary end point, using a composite of time to the first renal, cardiovascular, or mortality events or time to > 30% decline in renal function (by eGFR) from enrollment, also did not differ between the 2 groups (HR in the revascularized group, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.82–1.17]; P = 0.777; Figure 2 C).

There was no difference in overall survival (HR in the revascularized group 0.92, [95% CI, 0.75–1.12]; P = 0.391) with a total of 350 deaths among those remaining in the trial, 169 of which were in the revascularized group and 181 in the medical group (Figure 2 D). 5-year survival was 65.5% (264/403) in the medical group and 66.8% (269/403) in the intervention group, dropping to 47.4% (191/403) and 50.4% (203/403), respectively, at 10 years. The annual mortality rate over the entire follow-up period was 4.7% in the medical arm and 4.6% in the revascularization arm.

### Long term outcomes after renal revascularization for atherosclerotic renovascular disease in the ASTRAL trial [^6e8c8586]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

A post hoc analysis of the CORAL population found a significant difference in event-free survival in patients with an ACR ≤ 22.5 mg/g (equivalent to ≤ 2.83 mg/mmol) who underwent revascularization compared with medically treated patients. The explanation could be that lower levels of albuminuria indicate better preserved renal parenchyma, making the kidneys more likely to respond to revascularization. In our study, we were unable to use the CORAL albuminuria threshold as albuminuria was extrapolated from proteinuria as described in the methods. However, in our analysis, there was no statistical difference between outcomes for those with an ACR above or below 30 mg/mmol.

An important limitation, and one that has been well highlighted, was that the ASTRAL population included lower-risk patients (40.8% of patients had RAS < 70%) and did not include a large number of high-risk patients, for example, those with severe hypertension or pulmonary edema. As highlighted earlier, both ASTRAL and CORAL excluded patients who may have benefited from revascularization based upon clinician choice, and these were then managed outside of the trials, questioning the real world applicability of the RCTs to the management of more severely affected RAS patients. During the course of the study, 13% of patients withdrew their consent or were lost to follow-up. Although this proportion is quite high, it is recognized that the study was conducted over 13 years (from 2000 to 2013) in atherosclerotic renovascular disease patients across 53 separate UK and 4 Australasian centers. Analyses show that patients lost to follow-up were similar in both trial arms and did not affect the study outcomes (Table 1 ;).

Genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 HCV Infected Adults (ASTRAL-1)

ASTRAL-1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with EPCLUSA compared with 12 weeks of placebo in subjects with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Subjects with genotype 1, 2, 4, or 6 HCV infection were randomized in a 5:1 ratio to treatment with EPCLUSA or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects with genotype 5 HCV infection were enrolled to the EPCLUSA group. Randomization was stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 4, 6, and indeterminate) and the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis.

Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the EPCLUSA and placebo group. Of the 740 treated subjects, the median age was 56 years (range: 18 to 82); 60% of the subjects were male; 79% were White, 9% were Black; 21% had a baseline body mass index at least 30 kg/m²; the proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection were 53%, 17%, 19%, 5%, and 7%, respectively; 69% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 74% had baseline HCV RNA levels at least 800,000 IU/mL; 19% had compensated cirrhosis; and 32% were treatment-experienced.

Here we present findings from an echocardiographic sub-study of the ASTRAL trial. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of renal artery revascularization to standard medical therapy led to improvements in the cardiac structural and functional abnormalities associated with ARVD, as found on echocardiography, compared to standard medical therapy alone. A secondary aim was to quantitatively describe the natural progression of cardiac abnormalities in an ARVD cohort, irrespective of therapy, and specifically in patients for whom revascularization is not already indicated.

### Sofosbuvir / velpatasvir improves patient-reported outcomes in HCV patients: results from ASTRAL-1 placebo-controlled trial [^ee077eb3]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The new pan-genotypic regimen [sofosbuvir (SOF) and velpatasvir (VEL)] for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been associated with high efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of this regimen.

Methods

The PRO data (CLDQ-HCV, SF-36, FACIT-F, WPAI) came from the ASTRAL-1 study, a multicenter multinational blinded placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial of a fixed dose combination of SOF 400mg and VEL 100mg for patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 compared to placebo for 12weeks.

Results

624 patients received active treatment [618 achieved sustained virologic response (SVR)], and 116 received placebo. The baseline PRO scores were similar. By treatment week 4, patients receiving SOF/VEL experienced improvements in general health (on average, +2.3points), emotional well-being (+3.4), FACIT-F (+1.3), and all domains of CLDQ-HCV (+2.1 to +7.3) (all p < 0.005). On the other hand, the only PRO that improved in patients receiving placebo was the worry domain of CLDQ-HCV: +4.6 (p = 0.002). By the end of treatment, improvement in PRO scores with SOF/VEL continued, and no improvement was noted in the placebo. Improvement in PROs were also noted 12 and 24weeks post-treatment: +3.7, on average, in patients with SVR-12 after SOF/VEL vs. -2.6, on average, in the placebo arm (p < 0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment-emergent changes in PROs were predicted by receiving SOF/VEL for some summary PRO score (p < 0.005).

Conclusions

This placebo-controlled trial shows that patients treated with SOF/VEL experience significant improvement of their PROs during treatment and after achieving SVR.

Lay Summary

In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, health-related quality of life and work productivity are often impaired due to HCV-related fatigue. Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon-based regimens, which was the standard of care for all HCV patients until recently, had substantial and potentially debilitating side effects. These regimens caused additional impairment in health-related quality of life and work productivity during treatment and shortly after treatment cessation. The newly developed interferon-free combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir has been shown to improve health-related quality of life during treatment, and lead to an improvement in a number of indicators of patient-reported outcomes after successful clearance of HCV and achieving sustained virologic response.

ASTRO quality of evidence (QoE) grades — study designs and interpretations are defined as High, Moderate, Low, and Expert Opinion. High evidence comprises 2 or more well-conducted and highly generalizable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses of such trials, and the true effect is very likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence. Moderate evidence includes 1 well-conducted and highly generalizable RCT or a meta-analysis of such trials or 2 or more RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or 2 or more strong observational studies with consistent findings, and the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence, but it is possible that it is substantially different. Low evidence includes 1 RCT with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or 1 or more RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure or generalizability or extremely small sample sizes or 2 or more observational studies with inconsistent findings, small sample sizes, or other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect with risk that future research may significantly alter the estimate of the effect size or the interpretation of the results. Expert Opinion reflects consensus of the panel based on clinical judgment and experience due to absence of evidence or limitations in evidence, and strong consensus (≥ 90%) of the panel guides the recommendation despite insufficient evidence to discern the true magnitude and direction of the net effect; A lower quality of evidence, including expert opinion, does not imply that the recommendation is conditional.

### Where now in the management of renal artery stenosis? Implications of the ASTRAL and CORAL trials [^1455b459]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The neutral findings of Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Artery Lesions trials have shown that unselected revascularization does not improve outcomes in atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD). This review highlights recent translational, clinical and epidemiological studies and suggests directions for future research.

Recent Findings

Imaging studies show that the degree of renal artery stenosis is not the most important determinant of outcome and response to therapies in ARVD. Porcine models have established a better understanding of the microvascular and inflammatory changes that occur in ARVD. Biomarkers of inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction may be informative but do not yet help assess prognosis or response to treatment. Stem cell therapies show promise in animal models but have yet to translate into clinical practice. Analysis of patient subgroups with high-risk presentations of ARVD has provided new insights into treatment response and may guide future studies.

Summary

It is time to reframe thinking and research in ARVD. We need better ways to identify patients likely to benefit from revascularization and to improve response to treatment in these individuals. Many preclinical studies show promise, but these are often small scale and difficult to replicate. Future work should focus on establishing an international disease registry as a foundation for collaborative research.

### Cardiac structure and function after revascularization versus medical therapy for renal artery stenosis: the ASTRAL heart echocardiographic sub-study [^90bf6012]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The ASTRAL trial showed no difference in clinical outcomes between medical therapy and revascularization for atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD). Here we report a sub-study using echocardiography to assess differences in cardiac structure and function at 12 months.

Methods

ASTRAL patients from 7 participating centres underwent echocardiography at baseline and 12 months after randomisation. Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular mass (LVM), left atrial diameter (LAD), aortic root diameter (AoRD), E:A, and E deceleration time (EDT) were compared between study arms. Analyses were performed using t-tests and multivariate linear regression.

Results

Ninety two patients were included (50 medical versus 42 revascularization). There was no difference between arms in any baseline echocardiographic parameter. Comparisons of longitudinal changes in echocardiographic measurements were: δLVEF medical 0.8 ± 8.7% versus revascularization − 2.8 ± 6.8% (p = 0.05), δLVM − 2.9 ± 33 versus − 1.7 ± 39 g (p = 0.9), δLAD 0.1 ± 0.4 versus 0.01 ± 0.5 cm (p = 0.3), δAoRD 0.002 ± 0.3 versus 0.06 ± 0.3 cm (p = 0.4), δE:A − 0.0005 ± 0.6 versus 0.03 ± 0.7 (p = 0.8), δEDT − 1.1 ± 55.5 versus − 9.0 ± 70.2 ms (p = 0.6). In multivariate models, there were no differences between treatment groups for any parameter at 12 months. Likewise, change in blood pressure did not differ between arms (mean δsystolic blood pressure medical 0 mmHg [range − 56 to + 54], revascularization − 3 mmHg [− 61 to + 59], p = 0.60).

Conclusions

This sub-study did not show any significant differences in cardiac structure and function accompanying renal revascularization in ASTRAL. Limitations include the small sample size, the relative insensitivity of echocardiography, and the fact that a large proportion of ASTRAL patient population had only modest renal artery stenosis as described in the main study.

### Velpatasvir and sofosbuvir (Epclusa access) [^b9400935]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Description of Clinical Trials

Table 12 presents the clinical trial design including different treatment groups that were conducted with EPCLUSA with and without ribavirin in subjects with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection. For detailed description of trial design and recommended regimen and duration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, and 14.6)].

The ribavirin dosage was weight-based (1000 mg daily administered in two divided doses for subjects less than 75 kg and 1200 mg for those greater than or equal to 75 kg) and administered in two divided doses when used in combination with sofosbuvir in the ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 trials or in combination with EPCLUSA in the ASTRAL-4 trial. Ribavirin dosage adjustments were performed according to the ribavirin prescribing information. Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 15 IU/mL. SVR12, defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment, was the primary endpoint in all the trials. Relapse is defined as HCV RNA greater than or equal to LLOQ during the post-treatment period after having achieved HCV RNA less than LLOQ at the end of treatment. On-treatment virologic failure is defined as breakthrough, rebound, or non-response.

### Cardiac structure and function after revascularization versus medical therapy for renal artery stenosis: the ASTRAL heart echocardiographic sub-study [^625c419b]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This sub-study of a randomised clinical trial included 92 patients with ARVD and did not show any difference in longitudinal change in echocardiographic parameters between patients treated with renal artery revascularization versus those given medical therapy alone. This is consistent with the cardiovascular end point findings of the main ASTRAL (hazard ratio for cardiovascular events 0.94, 95% CI 0.75–1.19, p = 0.61) and CORAL studies (hazard ratio for composite primary end-point 0.94; 95% CI 0.76–1.17; p = 0.58).

Our findings are consistent with two other randomised clinical trials. A recent parallel ASTRAL sub-study investigated the effects of revascularization on cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 18 patients treated exclusively medically and 23 patients who underwent revascularization in addition to treatment with medical therapy. Although slight improvements in cardiac structural parameters were seen in both groups at 12 months follow-up, there were no significant differences between groups (change in LVM in medical versus revascularized group: − 5.4 g versus − 6.3 g, p = 0.8). The stenting of Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RAS-CAD) study is another randomised trial that explored the effect of revascularization on LVMI in ARVD patients with mean renal artery stenosis < 70%, mean eGFR > 60.0 ml/min/1.73 m² and well-controlled blood pressure; patients in both arms were established on multi-targeted medical therapy. Revascularization was shown to have no additional impact on cardiac structure and blood pressure control beyond optimal medical therapy. However, there was again significant equivalent improvement in blood pressure control and LVMI in both revascularized (n = 43) and non-revascularized patients (n = 41).

### Preconditioning by preceding ischemic cerebrovascular events [^c859d4e5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Emerging yet contrasting evidence from animal and human studies associates ischemic preconditioning with improvement of subsequent stroke severity, although long‐term outcome remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze how preceding cerebral ischemic events influence subsequent stroke severity and outcome.

Methods and Results

Data for this retrospective cohort study were extracted from ASTRAL (Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne). This registry includes a sample of all consecutive patients with acute ischemic strokes admitted to the stroke unit and/or intensive care unit of the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland. We investigated associations between preceding ischemic events (transient ischemic attacks or ischemic strokes) and the impact on subsequent stroke severity and clinical improvement within 24 hours, measured through National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, as well as 3‐month outcome, determined through a shift in the modified Rankin Scale. Of 3530 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke (43% women, median age 73 years), 1001 (28%) had ≥ 1 preceding cerebral ischemic events (45% transient ischemic attack, 55% ischemic stroke; 31% multiple events). After adjusting for multiple prehospital, clinical, and laboratory confounders, admission stroke severity was significantly lower in patients preconditioned through a preceding ischemic event, but 24‐hour improvement was not significant and 3‐month outcome was unfavorable.

Conclusions

Preceding ischemic events were independently associated with a significant reduction in subsequent stroke severity but worsened long‐term clinical outcome. These results, if confirmed by future randomized studies, may help design neuroprotective strategies. The unfavorable effect on stroke outcome is probably a consequence of the cumulative disability burden after multiple ischemic events.

### Re: renal artery stenting is no longer indicated after ASTRAL: pros and cons [^55b0c270]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The lack of randomized, controlled trials (RCT) for interventional radiology (IR) is one of the major problems of IR, which has been discussed for many years (SIR Dotter — lecture 2008). The reasons for this are simple but difficult to overcome. IR does not control the patients, so they often do not control the trials. Second, performing a RCT is expensive and funding for device trials is very difficult, because there is still no regulatory need to produce RCT data for registration of a device. Finally, the IR market is small compared with, for example, interventional cardiology, and the industry is not willing to invest large sums, which are needed for a RCT. That is why we always see these small, underpowered, one-arm studies in IR, never reaching any level of evidence. The ASTRAL investigators were able to overcome all of these hurdles and should absolutely be congratulated for this. However, the question remains how they were able to do this. I think personal drive and commitment can be recognized, but there is another method that they used, which is now the basis of the ongoing discussion around the trial. Next to personal commitment, the most often used method to recruit patients is to "soften" the inclusion criteria, to make them more acceptable, under the umbrella of otherwise being unethical. For this the authors introduced the so-called "uncertainty principle". They state that it is widely used and even have a reference for this. It has never been used as far as I know; I only know of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which plays a role in quantum mechanics, to state the precise inequalities of certain pairs of physical properties, but this is probably something else. In their reference, a Lancet publication from 1998, the word uncertainly is mentioned three times in completely different contexts, and the uncertainty principle is not anywhere in this paper. The core of the discussion is that in the ASTRAL trial patients could be included when the doctor was uncertain whether the patient needed to be treated with a stent. The problem is that there are currently no scientific data for any doctor to be certain about this, which was just the motivation for doing the ASTRAL trial. Therefore, patient selection in the trial is based on the doctor's gut feeling, or any other personal reason. The authors further state that this so-called uncertainty principle resulted in a heterogeneous patient population. To my opinion, it only resulted in serious patient selection bias. This uncertainty could easily have been taken away if those patients who received a stent, because the doctor was certain that they needed one, were followed clinically to be certain that the right decision was made. This was, however, not done, which is a major flaw. The authors state that many are confused about the methodology and results of the ASTRAL trial. I think there is no confusion at all; the methodology and results are crystal clear. The conclusion of the ASTRAL trial should be that if you, as a wise doctor, think or feel that a patient needs to be treated with a stent, you should do so, but if you are uncertain, which seems to be rare looking at the ASTRAL inclusion data, the patient should get best medical treatment. I am sure that the ASTRAL investigators agree with this conclusion; however, nephrologists and other referring specialists read it completely different because for them it says that there is no advantage from renal stenting above best medical treatment. That these words are coming directly from the horse his mouth is not very helpful, as we can see in our everyday practise.

Genotype 2 HCV Infected Adults (ASTRAL-2)

ASTRAL-2 was a randomized, open-label trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with EPCLUSA compared with 12 weeks of treatment with SOF with ribavirin in subjects with genotype 2 HCV infection. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment groups. Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of compensated cirrhosis and prior treatment experience (treatment-naïve vs treatment-experienced).

Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the two treatment groups. Of the 266 treated subjects, the median age was 58 years (range: 23 to 81); 59% of the subjects were male; 88% were White; 7% were Black; 33% had a baseline body mass index at least 30 kg/m²; 62% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 80% had baseline HCV RNA levels at least 800,000 IU/mL; 14% had compensated cirrhosis; and 15% were treatment-experienced.

Table 2
Current key inclusion and exclusion criteria for ASTRAL

The details presented herein about the ASTRAL protocol are accurate as of March 2023 but may evolve as the trial and enrollment progresses. Four study arms have been included (Fig. 2): low dose (3 mg/day) and high dose (5 mg/day) for 96 h, and matched placebo groups. Randomization is required to begin within 6 h of injury, with drug (or placebo) infusion by 6.5 h. Like the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the dose and timing of drug infusion also appear to have been carefully considered in the context of the preexisting research. The safety low dose (~ 3 mg/day) is the same as that used in the phase-1 (and II) study of the same drug in large hemispheric infarction. Pharmacokinetic data from this trial are eagerly awaited – it will be interesting to see how the high and low dose of BIIB093 in this clinical trial compare with the recent murine study demonstrating high-dose-only benefit, since it is challenging to translate drug doses across species. Unlike the infusion timing in large-hemispheric infarction and the prior Eisenberg study in TBI, the directive in ASTRAL is to infuse drug within 6.5 h of injury, given the earlier upregulation of SUR1-TRPM4 in the penumbral microvessels after contusional TBI. The goal is to inhibit microvascular SUR1-TRPM4 before the ensuing oncotic cell death, structural failure, pericontusional edema, and hemorrhage progression.

### Cardiac structure and function after revascularization versus medical therapy for renal artery stenosis: the ASTRAL heart echocardiographic sub-study [^5b9126ab]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In contrast, in our study there was no overall difference in parameters at follow up compared to baseline. Previous small non-randomised studies had demonstrated improvement in left ventricular mass in patients with renovascular hypertension or haemodynamically significant stenosis. In two of these studies, this was shown to correlate with improvement in blood pressure control. In ASTRAL, including this sub-study, there was no difference in blood pressure control between treatment arms. This likely explains the lack of any difference in δLVM seen here.

Although a lack of longitudinal improvement was noted in this study, which differs from the results of ASTRAL cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sub-study and RAS-CAD, this is not surprising given the relative insensitivity of transthoracic echocardiography for certain measurements (e.g. LV mass) compared to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Left ventricular mass was not adjusted for height and weight due to missing data hence this may also have contributed to reduced accuracy. Regardless, the outcome measurement is change in cardiac mass over time for each individual patient. Given this, it is unlikely that there would be any additional benefit to indexing these measurements against body surface area or height.

In view of the lack of measurable longitudinal changes observed in our study, we support the current view that optimised medical therapy is as effective as revascularization for routine ARVD therapy, except in those patients for whom revascularization is already indicated. Indeed, in the current study we provided examples of patients who showed definite improvement or stabilisation in echocardiographic parameters at 1 year, and likewise some with evidence of deterioration and this is of clinical importance. This comment is made notwithstanding the possibility that the longitudinal changes seen represent regression to the mean in a population with a broad baseline measurement in echocardiographic descriptors.

Our results suggest a weak inverse correlation between baseline function and improvement at 1 year, in keeping with results from observational studies showing that revascularization only appears to be of benefit in a small subset of 'high-risk' patients. Future research efforts are likely to be directed towards the timely identification of these individuals through risk stratification techniques with the aim of improving patient selection for revascularization.

### The tolerability of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir for 12 weeks in patients treated in the ASTRAL 1, 2 and 3 studies: a pooled safety analysis [^ebf40f80]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2023). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in three Phase 3 studies in patients with and without compensated cirrhosis. Data from three registrational trials (ASTRAL-1, NCT02201940; ASTRAL-2, NCT02220998; ASTRAL-3, NCT02201953) were pooled by treatment regimen. Researchers assessed treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and laboratory abnormalities in patients randomized to SOF/VEL or placebo for 12weeks in ASTRAL-1 and SOF/VEL for 12weeks in ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3. Overall, 1035 patients were treated with SOF/VEL, and 116 patients received placebo. Rates of any TEAE were generally similar between patients receiving SOF/VEL (79.4%) and those receiving placebo (76.7%). The majority of TEAEs were mild to moderate, with 23 (2.2%) treatment-emergent serious AEs in patients treated with SOF/VEL. Of these treatment-emergent serious AEs, none led to premature study discontinuation, nor were they considered related to treatment. Presence of compensated cirrhosis, greater age and mild renal impairment did not impact incidence or severity of TEAEs with SOF/VEL treatment. The most common TEAEs (incidence ≥ 10%) were headache, fatigue, nausea and nasopharyngitis in patients receiving SOF/VEL; similar rates were observed in placebo-treated patients. Three deaths (< 1%) were reported in patients treated with SOF/VEL, all posttreatment and none assessed as related to study treatment. Similar to that of placebo, SOF/VEL treatment of HCV infection had a safety/tolerability profile that was not affected by baseline factors, such as the presence of compensated cirrhosis, mild renal impairment or advanced age.

### Effect of renal artery revascularization upon cardiac structure and function in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: cardiac magnetic resonance sub-study of the ASTRAL trial [^ad81e7e0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac abnormalities are frequent in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD). The Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL) trial studied the effect of percutaneous renal revascularization combined with medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone in 806 patients with ARVD.

Methods

This was a pre-specified sub-study of ASTRAL (clinical trials registration, current controlled trials number: ISRCTN59586944), designed to consider the effect of percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and stenting on change in cardiac structure and function, measured using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Fifty-one patients were recruited from six selected ASTRAL centres. Forty-four completed the study (medical therapy n = 21; revascularization n = 23). Full analysis of CMR was possible in 40 patients (18 medical therapy and 22 revascularization). CMR measurements of left and right ventricular end systolic (LV and RVESV) and diastolic volume (LV and RVEDV), ejection fraction (LVEF) and mass (LVM) were made shortly after recruitment and before revascularization in the interventional group, and again after 12 months. Reporting was performed by CMR analysts blinded to randomization arm.

Results

Groups were well matched for mean age (70 versus 72 years), blood pressure (148/71 versus 143/74 mmHg), degree of renal artery stenosis (75 versus 75%) and comorbid conditions. In both randomized groups, improvements in cardiac structural parameters were seen at 12 months, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Median left ventricular changes between baseline and 12 months (medical versus revascularization) were LVEDV -1.9 versus -5.8 mL, P = 0.4; LVESV -2.1 versus 0.3 mL, P = 0.7; LVM -5.4 versus -6.3 g, P = 0.8; and LVEF -1.5 versus -0.8%, P = 0.7. Multivariate regression also found that randomized treatment assignment was not associated with degree of change in any of the CMR measurements.

Conclusions

In this sub-study of the ASTRAL trial, renal revascularization did not offer additional benefit to cardiac structure or function in unselected patients with ARVD.

### Effect of endovascular contact aspiration vs stent retriever on revascularization in patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion: the ASTER randomized clinical trial [^2071e6aa]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefits of endovascular revascularization using the contact aspiration technique vs the stent retriever technique in patients with acute ischemic stroke remain uncertain because of lack of evidence from randomized trials.

Objective

To compare efficacy and adverse events using the contact aspiration technique vs the standard stent retriever technique as a first-line endovascular treatment for successful revascularization among patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Contact Aspiration vs Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization (ASTER) study was a randomized, open-label, blinded end-point clinical trial conducted in 8 comprehensive stroke centers in France (October 2015-October 2016). Patients who presented with acute ischemic stroke and a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation within 6 hours of symptom onset were included.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to first-line contact aspiration (n = 192) or first-line stent retriever (n = 189) immediately prior to mechanical thrombectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with successful revascularization defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or 3 at the end of all endovascular procedures. Secondary outcomes included degree of disability assessed by overall distribution of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days, change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24 hours, all-cause mortality at 90 days, and procedure-related serious adverse events.

Results

Among 381 patients randomized (mean age, 69.9 years; 174 women [45.7%]), 363 (95.3%) completed the trial. Median time from symptom onset to arterial puncture was 227 minutes (interquartile range, 180–280 minutes). For the primary outcome, the proportion of patients with successful revascularization was 85.4% (n = 164) in the contact aspiration group vs 83.1% (n = 157) in the stent retriever group (odds ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.68–2.10]; P = 0.53; difference, 2.4% [95% CI, -5.4% to 9.7%]). For the clinical efficacy outcomes (change in NIHSS score at 24 hours, mRS score at 90 days) and adverse events, there were no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, first-line thrombectomy with contact aspiration compared with stent retriever did not result in an increased successful revascularization rate at the end of the procedure.

### External validation of the ASTRAL and DRAGON scores for prediction of functional outcome in stroke [^672f215c]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

ASTRAL (Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne) and DRAGON (includes dense middle cerebral artery sign, prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, age, glucose, onset to treatment, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score) are 2 recently developed scores for predicting functional outcome after acute stroke in unselected acute ischemic stroke patients and in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, respectively. We aimed to perform external validation of these scores to assess their predictive performance in the large multicentre Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register.

Methods

We calculated the ASTRAL and DRAGON scores in 36 131 and 33 716 patients, respectively, registered in Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register between 2003 and 2013. The proportion of patients with 3-month modified Rankin Scale scores of 3 to 6 was observed for each score point and compared with the predicted proportion according to the risk scores. Calibration was assessed using calibration plots, and predictive performance was assessed using area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. Multivariate logistic regression coefficients for the variables in the 2 scores were compared with the original derivation cohorts.

Results

The ASTRAL showed an area under the curve of 0.790 (95% confidence interval, 0.786–0.795) and the DRAGON an area under the curve of 0.774 (95% confidence interval, 0.769–0.779). All ASTRAL parameters except range of visual fields and all DRAGON parameters were significantly associated with functional outcome in multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

The ASTRAL and DRAGON scores show an acceptable predictive performance. ASTRAL does not require imaging-data and therefore may have an advantage for the use in prehospital patient assessment. Prospective studies of both scores evaluating the impact of their use on patient outcomes after intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy are needed.

### Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir combination improves patient-reported outcomes for patients with HCV infection, without or with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis [^28b0dcf8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is used to treat patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of different genotypes. We compared the effects of this treatment regimen, with and without ribavirin, on outcomes reported by patients (patient-reported outcomes [PROs]) with HCV infection, with or without cirrhosis.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of data collected from phase 3 clinical trials (ASTRAL-1, -2, -3, and -4) of 1701 patients infected with HCV of different genotypes treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks (n = 87), sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks (n = 401), and ribavirin-free sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 or 24 weeks (n = 1213). In all trials, participants completed 4 PRO questionnaires (while blinded to their HCV RNA levels): the Short Form-36, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-HCV Version, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem, at multiple time points. We compared baseline PROs and changes in PROs following treatment in patients without cirrhosis (n = 1112), with compensated cirrhosis (n = 338), and with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 251).

Results

Baseline PRO scores were as much as 33.5% lower in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in patients without cirrhosis (P < .05). Following treatment with ribavirin-containing regimens, changes in PRO scores were similar among patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis (all P > .01). Treatment with these regimens increased some PRO scores by as much as 11.8% from baseline (P < .05) and reduced others, by as much as 7.1% (P < .05). Despite this, by 12 weeks after cessation of treatment with ribavirin-containing regimens, all PRO decrements resolved; PRO scores increased by as much as 14.2%, and as much as 17.1% at 24 weeks after treatment, regardless of cirrhosis status (all P > .01 between cirrhosis groups). In contrast, treatment with ribavirin-free sofosbuvir and velpatasvir increased PRO scores for patients with compensated cirrhosis, and even more so in patients with decompensated cirrhosis starting at treatment Week 4; no statistically significant decrement was observed at any time point (all 1-sided P values > .05). In multivariate analysis, compensated cirrhosis was associated with a 2.3% to 5.0% greater increase in PRO scores following treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (P < .05); decompensated cirrhosis was associated with a 5.5%-9.1% greater increase (P < .002). Clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT02201940, NCT02220998, NCT02201953, NCT02201901.

Conclusions

In an analysis of data from 4 phase 3 clinical trials, we found that patients with HCV infection (especially those with decompensated cirrhosis) have significant increases in their PRO scores during treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and after achieving a sustained virologic response.

### Expanding the landscape of aging via orbitrap astral mass spectrometry and tandem mass tag integration [^ef78e9ac]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We then leverage these two studies to validate complex age-by-sex differences as demonstrated for proteins such as CSAD (Fig. 3e) and AKR1C13 (Fig. 3f) in the kidney. CSAD exhibited a consistently increasing trend in females but a decreasing trend in males across the age groups. In contrast, AKR1C13 showed a steady increase in males, while females displayed a non-monotonic up-down pattern, which only becomes evident with the broader age range. The inclusion of three distinct age groups in our study provided the resolution to capture non-linear age dynamics that would be impossible to detect with only two age groups. The observation of consistent interaction effects across independent studies strongly supports the biological validity of these findings.

We next compared age coefficients to another study, Takasugi et al. which also employed a TMT design with a Lumos mass spectrometer and C57BL/6 J mice, like Keele et al. Only males were studied, with four animals per four age groups: 6, 15, 24, and 30 months-old, thus including truly geriatric animals (30 months-old) compared to previous studies. Eight tissues were profiled, including brain, as a whole tissue, and kidney, both as whole tissue and low-solubility enriched fractions. Based on our re-analysis of the brain and kidney data from Takasugi et al. we detected far more age differences (1064 in brain, 3225 in kidney, and 1364 in insoluble kidney) than Keele et al. representing similar numbers to the present study (less in the brain tissues and slightly more in kidney) and providing support for our inference that observing more age groups is integral to detecting age changes. As with Keele et al. the Astral mass spectrometer allowed us to detect more lower abundance proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6d–f). Overall, we saw even stronger correspondence between age differences with Takasugi et al.(Fig. 3g, h). These comparisons demonstrate the quality of the data from these studies and their utility as resources for defining proteins that exhibit age-related changes across study and C57BL/6 sub-strains.

### External validation of the ASTRAL score to predict 3-and 12-month functional outcome in the China national stroke registry [^fc854830]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The ASTRAL score was recently introduced as a prognostic tool for acute ischemic stroke. It predicts 3-month outcome reliably in both the derivation and the validation European cohorts. We aimed to validate the ASTRAL score in a Chinese stroke population and moreover to explore its prognostic value to predict 12-month outcome.

Methods

We applied the ASTRAL score to acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to 132 study sites of the China National Stroke Registry. Unfavorable outcome was assessed as a modified Rankin Scale score > 2 at 3 and 12 months. Areas under the curve were calculated to quantify the prognostic value. Calibration was assessed by comparing predicted and observed probability of unfavorable outcome using Pearson correlation coefficient.

Results

Among 3755 patients, 1473 (39.7%) had 3-month unfavorable outcome. Areas under the curve for 3 and 12 months were 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. There was high correlation between observed and expected probability of unfavorable 3- and 12-month outcome (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.964 and 0.963, respectively).

Conclusions

ASTRAL score is a reliable tool to predict unfavorable outcome at 3 and 12 months after acute ischemic stroke in the Chinese population. It is a useful tool that can be readily applied in clinical practice to risk-stratify acute stroke patients.

### Acute ischaemic stroke in active cancer versus non-cancer patients: stroke characteristics, mechanisms and clinical outcomes [^63e5f5c4]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The preferred antithrombotic therapy at discharge after AIS in AC patients is still unclear. In a subgroup analysis of the NAVIGATE ESUS randomized trial comparing aspirin to rivaroxaban in patients with ESUS, 543 (7.5%) had cancer (although only 9% of cancers were diagnosed in the previous year so presumably many of these cancers were inactive). Although the risk of recurrence between treatment groups was not different, cancer patients had higher rates of recurrent stroke, and aspirin may have performed better at secondary prevention and with less risk of major bleeding. In addition, intracranial thrombi retrieved with EVT from cancer patients with ESUS are platelet‐rich, further supporting a potential benefit of antiplatelets in this population. Collectively, these findings reinforce the notion that current secondary prevention strategies in AIS patients with cancer provide suboptimal protection for recurrence, and that alternative antithrombotic strategies should be tested in targeted clinical trials. Given that cancer‐related hypercoagulability may play a key role in AIS pathogenesis, particularly in patients with extensive disease, more aggressive antithrombotic therapies come first to mind to prevent recurrence. On the other hand, targeting the underlying cancer with specific and intensive cancer therapies could hold more promise to halt further thromboembolic events.

Our study has some limitations. First, this is a quality assurance project in a single institution and the results may not apply to other settings or patient groups, in particular to non‐Caucasian younger populations. Secondly, our AIS cohort spanned a long period (> 18 years) during which stroke and oncological care have evolved, potentially introducing temporal confounders regarding the association between cancer and stroke. Thirdly, our definition of rare cancer‐related causes of stroke included presumed hypercoagulability, based on D‐dimer levels or the presence of monomers that were only measured in a subset of patients, potentially leading to an underestimation of this stroke mechanism. Further, D‐dimer and other fibrin split products are not specific to hypercoagulability and can be increased by other factors, including age, recent surgery or trauma, atrial fibrillation, concurrent venous thromboembolism. Fourthly, there was no comparison between AC and IC patients, a distinct subset of patients who may exhibit varying risks, pathophysiology and outcomes. Lastly, the precise cause of death was not recorded in ASTRAL, and therefore it is not known whether patients with cancer died of cancer‐related causes.

### Guadecitabine vs TC in relapsed / refractory AML after intensive chemotherapy: a randomized phase 3 ASTRAL-2 trial [^296b9241]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although not approved for relapsed/refractory AML, the hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine are routinely used in clinical practice to treat such patients. Data from HMAs in relapsed/refractory AML mostly come from small series with variable responses and survival. However, a large international retrospective analysis of 655 patients in 12 centers treated with HMAs showed a CR rate of 11%, CR+CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate of 16%, and median OS of 6.7 months. Decitabine requires incorporation into DNA, making its synthesis phase cycle-dependent. It is, therefore, limited by its shorter half-life and exposure time due to rapid degradation by cytidine deaminase. Guadecitabine is a novel HMA that is a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase. Gradual release of decitabine from the dinucleotide after subcutaneous injection results in more sustained levels of decitabine, prolonging its exposure window. This should allow more incorporation into the DNA of leukemia cells during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle and is the proposed basis for its potential increased efficacy compared with intravenous decitabine. In addition, the small volume (∼1 mL) of subcutaneous injection offers a more convenient administration route than the decitabine 1-hour intravenous infusion. Two schedules of guadecitabine with either 5- or 10-day treatment cycles were investigated in a phase 2 study of 103 patients, with a CR rate of 19% and a CR+CRi rate of 30% with the 10-day regimen. Median OS was 7.1 months for the 10-day schedule. After a median follow-up of 29 months, median OS was not reached for patients who achieved CR or CRi, regardless of subsequent HCT.

We report here the results of a randomized phase 3 clinical trial (ASTRAL-2) comparing guadecitabine with standard-of-care physician treatment choice (TC) in the treatment of refractory or relapsed AML.

### Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in patients with septic shock [^9330eebf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study ADRENAL was published by Venkatesh B and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock and Mechanical ventilation. In the ADRENAL study, the trial question was: what is the role of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation? In the ADRENAL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ADRENAL study, the population was: 3713 patients (1454 female, 2259 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation. The key exclusion criteria were systemic corticosteroids for an indication other than septic shock, etomidate treatment during current hospital admission, severely ill from preexisting disease and likely die within 90 days of randomization, or treatment limitations in place. In the ADRENAL study, the interventions were: n = 1853 hydrocortisone (continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg per day for 7 days) n = 1860 placebo (identical, masked 200 mL continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days). In the ADRENAL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 90 days (27.9% vs. 28.8%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.1). In the ADRENAL study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median time to resolution of shock (3 days vs. 4 days; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.81) Significant decrease in median time to discharge from ICU (10 days vs. 12 days; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94) Significant decrease in blood transfusion (37% vs. 41.7%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94). In the ADRENAL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in new-onset bacteremia or fungemia. significant differences in overall adverse events (1.1% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.009). In the ADRENAL study, the conclusion was: in patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation, hydrocortisone was not superior to placebo with respect to death at 90 days.

### Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for HCV genotype 2 and 3 infection [^0c025e82]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

In phase 2 trials, treatment with the combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3.

Methods

We conducted two randomized, phase 3, open-label studies involving patients who had received previous treatment for HCV genotype 2 or 3 and those who had not received such treatment, including patients with compensated cirrhosis. In one trial, patients with HCV genotype 2 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, in a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet (134 patients), or sofosbuvir plus weight-based ribavirin (132 patients) for 12 weeks. In a second trial, patients with HCV genotype 3 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks (277 patients) or sofosbuvir-ribavirin for 24 weeks (275 patients). The primary end point for the two trials was a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy.

Results

Among patients with HCV genotype 2, the rate of sustained virologic response in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir group was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96 to 100), which was superior to the rate of 94% (95% CI, 88 to 97) in the sofosbuvir-ribavirin group (P = 0.02). Among patients with HCV genotype 3, the rate of sustained virologic response in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir group was 95% (95% CI, 92 to 98), which was superior to the rate of 80% (95% CI, 75 to 85) in the sofosbuvir-ribavirin group (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events in the two studies were fatigue, headache, nausea, and insomnia.

Conclusions

Among patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 with or without previous treatment, including those with compensated cirrhosis, 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir resulted in rates of sustained virologic response that were superior to those with standard treatment with sofosbuvir-ribavirin.

### Ribavirin-free regimen with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is associated with high efficacy and improvement of patient-reported outcomes in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 chronic hepatitis C: results from astral-2 and-3 clinical trials [^d8098618]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, the approved treatment regimens for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes (GTs) 2 and 3 contain sofosbuvir (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks. The impact of RBV-free pan-genotypic regimen with SOF and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with genotype 2 and 3 has not been described.

Methods

PROs data were collected from participants of ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 studies before, during, and after treatment using 4 PRO instruments (Short Form-36, Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-HCV, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and Work Productivity and Activity Index: Specific Health Problem), and compared between the SOF/VEL and SOF + RBV groups.

Results

A total of 818 HCV patients were included: 78% treatment naive, 25% cirrhosis. The rates of nearly all adverse events were lower in the RBV-free SOF/VEL group (all P < .03). The SOF/VEL group also experienced improvement of their PROs by treatment week 4 (+1.8% on average across all PROs), which continued throughout treatment (+4.1%) and post-treatment (+5.5%). In contrast, those in the SOF + RBV group had a modest decline in their PROs starting at treatment week 4 (up to -3.7%), which lasted until the end of treatment (up to -6.4%). In multiple regression analysis, the association of a treatment regimen with end-of-treatment PROs was significant for nearly all PROs; the average beta was +5.0% for the use of SOF/VEL (reference: SOF + RBV).

Conclusions

Patients receiving ribavirin-free SOF/VEL reported significantly better PRO scores during treatment compared with those receiving the RBV-containing regimen. Furthermore, the interferon- and ribavirin-free SOF/VEL regimen resulted in a rapid improvement of PROs in HCV GTs 2 and 3 patients during treatment and after achieving sustained virologic response.

### Severe stroke: patient profile and predictors of favorable outcome [^0422d41d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Severe stroke carries high rates of mortality and morbidity. The aims of this study were to determine the characteristics of patients who initially presented with severe ischemic stroke, and to identify acute and subacute predictors of favorable clinical outcome in these patients.

Methods

An observational cohort study, Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL), was analyzed, and all patients presenting with severe stroke - defined as a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of ≥ 20 on admission - were compared with all other patients. In a multivariate analysis, associations with demographic, clinical, pathophysiologic, metabolic and neuroimaging factors were determined. Furthermore, we analyzed predictors of favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score of ≤ 3 at 3 months) in the subgroup of severe stroke patients.

Results

Of 1915 consecutive patients, 243 (12.7%) presented with severe stroke. This was significantly associated with cardio-embolic stroke mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–2.54), unknown stroke onset (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.14–4.83), more neuroimaging signs of early ischemia (mostly computed tomography; OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.79–3.92), arterial occlusions on acute imaging (OR 27.01, 95% CI 11.5–62.9), fewer chronic radiologic infarcts (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26–0.72), lower hemoglobin concentration (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.99), and higher white cell count (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.11). In the 68 (28%) patients with favorable outcomes despite presenting with severe stroke, this was predicted by lower age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.97), preceding cerebrovascular events (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.01–8.97), hypolipemic pretreatment (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.34–10.90), lower acute temperature (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.78), lower subacute glucose concentration (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.97), and spontaneous or treatment-induced recanalization (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.96–10.41).

Conclusions

Severe stroke presentation is predicted by multiple clinical, radiologic and metabolic variables, several of which are modifiable. Predictors in the 28% of patients with favorable outcome despite presenting with severe stroke include hypolipemic pretreatment, lower acute temperature, lower glucose levels at 24 h, and arterial recanalization.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^bb9099fd]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

"Readers should not have to infer what was probably done; they should be told explicitly". Douglas G Altman

Well designed and properly executed randomised trials provide the most reliable evidence on the benefits of healthcare interventions. Biased results from poorly designed and poorly reported trials are wastefuland can mislead decision making in healthcare at all levels, from treatment decisions for the individual patient to formulation of national public health policies.

Critical appraisal of the quality of randomised trials is possible only if their design, conduct, analysis, and results are completely and accurately reported. However, there is overwhelming evidence that the quality of reporting of randomised trials is not optimal. Without transparent reporting of methods and results, readers cannot evaluate the reliability and validity of trial findings or extract information for systematic reviews. Trials with inadequate methods are also associated with bias, especially exaggerated treatment effects. Having a transparent trial protocol is also important because it prespecifies the design and methods used in the trial, such as the primary outcome, thereby reducing the likelihood of undeclared post hoc changes to the trial.

### Expanding the landscape of aging via orbitrap astral mass spectrometry and tandem mass tag integration [^4ce4c0ef]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Progressive deterioration in fundamental biological processes results in aging-related decline, leading to increased risk of disease and mortality. Loss of physiological integrity is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases –. Transcriptional correlates with aging-related decline have been well-studied, through both bulkand single-cellRNA-seq experiments. Though there have been some studies of aging in murine models –, age-related changes at the protein level are less understood, and display poor correspondence with transcript-level aging changes across a range of murine tissues –. A recent discovery-based proteomic study in 10 tissues from C57BL/6J mice revealed age differences between adult (8 months) and late midlife ages (18 months). Surprisingly, brain tissues had relatively fewer age and sex differences than other tissues. However, this study provided a limited map of age differences with only two age groups and approximately only 5000 proteins quantified in each tissue. We hypothesized that the lack of detected age differences in brain tissues was due in part to insufficient proteome coverage and insufficient variability in surveyed age groups.

The dynamic range of the proteome is vast, with the cellular proteome spanning seven orders of magnitude. Fractionation reduces sample complexity and thereby enables greater peptide and protein coverage in proteomic analysis. However, the identification and quantitation of many low-abundance peptides still suffer from the limited sensitivity of mass spectrometers. In the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, the Asymmetric Track Lossless (Astral) analyzer enables up to 200 Hz acquisition of high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) MS/MS spectra. The parallel acquisition using the Orbitrap and Astral analyzers permits full scans with a high dynamic range and resolution and fast and sensitive HRAM MS/MS scans, expanding proteome coverage and ensuring quantitative accuracy –. Recent advances in tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic technology have enabled multiplexed sample preparation and data acquisition, allowing complex experimental designs with no loss in quantitative integrity. The high sensitivity of the Astral analyzer also enables the separation of TMTpro reporter ions and the utilization of TMTpro 18-plex for sample multiplexing. Moreover, limited previous studies have shown the use of TMT on the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer.

### Biomarkers to improve functional outcome prediction after ischemic stroke: results from the SICFAIL, STRAWINSKI, and PREDICT studies [^b0089c5b]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

SICFAIL study

Between January 2014 and February 2017, 696 with patients with AIS were recruited. Blood samples were available from 544 of 696 patients (78%). Baseline characteristics did not differ between patients with and without available samples, while they differed only regarding glomerular filtration rate between patients who did and did not take part of the follow-up. Calculation of the ASTRAL score was feasible for 520 patients (median 18 points, quartiles 16–21). Of those, 1-year follow-up was available from 412 (81%). Median age of included patients was 70 years (quartiles 59–78), median NIHSS score on admission was 3 points (quartiles 1–5) and 261 (63%) were men (Table 1).

Table 1.
Characterization of the SICFAIL study population.

STRAWINSKI/PREDICT studies

Four-hundred and eighty-six AIS patients were recruited between January 2010 and December 2012 in the PREDICT study. Between February 2011 and April 2014, 227 patients with moderate to severe stroke were recruited in the STRAWINSKI study. Twenty-nine patients were recruited in both studies. Of a total 683 patients (from both studies), blood samples were available in 573 patients, and measurements for the three biomarkers MR-proANP, procalcitonin, and copeptin were available from 545. Three-month functional outcome was available in 450 patients of them. We restricted the external validation to these patients. The median age was 73 years (quartiles 66–81), median NIHSS score on admission was 8 (quartiles 3–14) points and 242 (54%) were men (Table 2).

### Resistance analysis in patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection treated with sofosbuvir / velpatasvir in the phase III studies [^abe8b86a]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was highly efficacious in patients infected with genotype (GT)1–6 hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the ASTRAL studies. This analysis evaluated the impact of baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on treatment outcome and emergence of RASs in patients infected with HCV GT1-6 who were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

Methods

Non-structural protein 5A and 5B (NS5A and NS5B) deep sequencing was performed at baseline and at the time of relapse for all patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks (n = 1,778) in the ASTRAL-1-3, ASTRAL-5 and POLARIS-2-3 studies.

Results

Patients with 37 known and 19 novel HCV subtypes were included in these analyses. Overall, 28% (range 9% to 61% depending on genotype) had detectable NS5A class RASs at baseline, using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off. There was no significant effect of baseline NS5A class RASs on sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12) with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir; the SVR12 rate in the presence of NS5A class RASs was 100% and 97%, in patients with GT1a and GT1b infection, respectively, and 100% in patients with GT2 and GT4-6 infections. In GT3 infection, the SVR rate was 93% and 98% in patients with and without baseline NS5A class RASs, respectively. The overall virologic failure rate was low (20/1,778 = 1.1%) in patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Single NS5A class resistance was observed at virologic failure in 17 of the 20 patients.

Conclusions

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir taken for 12 weeks once daily resulted in high SVR rates in patients infected with GT1-6 HCV, irrespective of baseline NS5A RASs. NS5A inhibitor resistance, but not sofosbuvir resistance, was detected in the few patients with virologic failure. These data highlight the high barrier to resistance of this regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV across all genotypes in the vast majority of patients.

Lay Summary

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir taken once daily for 12 weeks resulted in high sustained virologic response rates in patients infected with HCV, irrespective of the presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants prior to treatment. Single class NS5A inhibitor resistance, but not sofosbuvir resistance, was detected in the few patients with virologic failure. These data highlight the high barrier to resistance of this regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV across all genotypes in the vast majority of patients.

### Blood pressure change and outcome in acute ischemic stroke: the impact of baseline values, previous hypertensive disease and previous antihypertensive treatment [^6cc70c82]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Management of blood pressure (BP) in acute ischemic stroke is controversial. The present study aims to explore the association between baseline BP levels and BP change and outcome in the overall stroke population and in specific subgroups with regard to the presence of arterial hypertensive disease and prior antihypertensive treatment.

Methods

All patients registered in the Acute STroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) between 2003 and 2009 were analyzed. Unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin score more than 2. A local polynomial surface algorithm was used to assess the effect of BP values on outcome in the overall population and in predefined subgroups.

Results

Up to a certain point, as initial BP was increasing, optimal outcome was seen with a progressively more substantial BP decrease over the next 24-48h. Patients without hypertensive disease and an initially low BP seemed to benefit from an increase of BP. In patients with hypertensive disease, initial BP and its subsequent changes seemed to have less influence on clinical outcome. Patients who were previously treated with antihypertensives did not tolerate initially low BPs well.

Conclusion

Optimal outcome in acute ischemic stroke may be determined not only by initial BP levels but also by the direction and magnitude of associated BP change over the first 24-48h.

### Deferred treatment with a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 2, 4 and 6 infection [^4aff53c7]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this single-arm, open-label, phase 3, deferred treatment study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir among patients randomized to the placebo group in the ASTRAL-1 study. Patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400/100 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was any adverse events (AEs) leading to the permanent discontinuation of study drug. Overall, 108/111 (97%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92%-99%) achieved SVR12, and only one patient had virological failure. SVR12 was achieved by 61/63 (97%, 95%CI, 89%-100%) genotype 1 patients, 20/20 (100%; 95%CI, 83%-100%) with genotype 2, 19/19 (100%; 95%CI, 82%-100%) with genotype 4 and 8/9 (89%; 95% CI, 52%-100%) with genotype 6. All (19/19; 95%CI, 82–100) patients with cirrhosis and all (31/31, 95%CI, 89–100) with prior treatment experience achieved SVR12. The safety profile during treatment was similar to that observed in patients receiving placebo treatment. The most common AEs were headache, fatigue and nausea. One patient (1%) discontinued treatment due to an AE of gallbladder carcinoma, which was not considered related to treatment. Of five reported serious AEs, none were considered related to study drug. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated among untreated and previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02346721).

### Simplified stroke imaging selection modality for endovascular thrombectomy in the extended time window: systematic review and meta-analysis [^4463a61e]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The mortality without CTP selection paradigms in the overall analysis was higher than with CTP. However, the mortality in subgroup analysis was roughly the same between these two imaging selection modalities. In the DAWN/DEFUSE 3-like subgroup, included studies were limited to patients with premorbid mRS scores of 0–2, occlusions of the internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral arteries (M1/M2 segments), and median (IQR) ASPECTS of 8. Considering the safety of the treatment, the ideal candidates for successful EVT selected by NCCT ± CTA imaging would be those who meet the DAWN/DEFUSE 3-like criteria. The results of the meta-analyses correspond with the findings from some previous studies. Consequently, the results of this analysis cannot be extrapolated to other populations.

There are some limitations to this meta-analysis. First, all studies included in this meta-analysis are retrospective observational research so there may be selection bias confounding the results. Specifically, given the lack of data on the number of patients excluded from EVT treatment and their outcomes, we could only compare the overall results of patients who ultimately underwent EVT treatment. Furthermore, the explicit criteria used to select eligible patients with AIS-LVO according to the imaging selection modality were unavailable in all the included studies. While the final results were similar, this does not mean that the same patients were selected in or out and all classification methods may be inaccurate. Finally, differentiation of imaging interpretation and post-processing software across the different sites and centers may lead to bias. Only well-conducted prospective randomized controlled trials can accurately evaluate the necessity of CTP for patient selection in EVT. We interpreted the results carefully. Although bias was unavoidable in the analysis, we can conjecture that some patients in the NCCT ± CTA imaging group would not have achieved good outcomes if they were not offered EVT. More candidates could be identified using NCCT ± CTA imaging for EVT from patients with AIS in the 6–24 hour time window. Similar deductions were found in several studies. The ASTRAL cohort showed that twice as many patients were identified for EVT by applying a more liberal clinical/imaging mismatch criteria than strict trial (DAWN and/or DEFUSE 3) criteria. Another study showed that 18% of trial ineligible patients with AIS-LVO receiving off-label EVT achieved outcomes comparable to DAWN and DEFUSE 3-eligible patients.

### ASTRAL score predicts 5-year dependence and mortality in acute ischemic stroke [^640c4f95]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The ASTRAL score was externally validated showing remarkable consistency on 3-month outcome prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to evaluate ASTRAL score's prognostic accuracy to predict 5-year outcome.

Methods

All consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke registered in the Athens Stroke Registry between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010, were included. Patients were excluded if admitted > 24 hours after symptom onset or if any ASTRAL score component was missing. End points were 5-year unfavorable functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale 3 to 6, and 5-year mortality. For each outcome, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated; also, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to investigate whether the ASTRAL score was an independent predictor of outcome. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate the probability of 5-year survival for each ASTRAL score quartile.

Results

The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the score to predict 5-year unfavorable functional outcome was 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5-year unfavorable functional outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.10). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the ASTRAL score's discriminatory power to predict 5-year mortality was 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.83). In multivariate analysis, the ASTRAL score was independently associated with 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.09, 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.10). During the 5-year follow-up, the probability of survival was significantly lower with increasing ASTRAL score quartiles (log-rank test < 0.001).

Conclusions

The ASTRAL score reliably predicts 5-year functional outcome and mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

### Sofosbuvir based regimens in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in African-American patients: a community-based retrospective cohort study [^367cf834]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

SOF/VEL is a pan-genotypic regimen. SVR rates are high in HCV GT-1 and treatment remains efficacious in previously treated and compensated cirrhotic patients. Asselah et al. in a retrospective analysis of ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2, and ASTRAL-3 trials reported SVR rates of 98% in HCV GT-1 patients with 12 weeks of treatment and response rate in cirrhotic patients was 96%. However, the number of AA patients in all the clinical trials involving SOF/VEL regimen is insufficient. Our current study included 78 AA patients that represent a significant cohort compared with all the current trials. All patients in our study were treated with SOF/VEL for 12 weeks and the response rate was 98%. The response did not vary based on previous treatment and cirrhosis status.

Thirty-eight patients were treated with SIM/SOF in our study. We observed a treatment response of 92%, with no differences with either previous treatment status or liver cirrhosis. All the cirrhotic patients in this treatment group were treated for 24 weeks with the addition of RBV. Black females achieved higher SVR12 rates in our study. Similar findings were also reflected in a real-world. The SONET study where overall response rate was 92% and AA females had higher SVR rates (97%) compared with AA males (90%).

SOF-based DAAs included in our study were generally well tolerated and AEs are consistent with other DAA-based studies in the literature–. Common adverse effects were fatigue, headache, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. In addition, anemia was noted in patients who were taking DAA concurrently with RBV. None of the patients discontinued therapy because of any AE in any group.

Our study is unique in the assessment of real-world effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of SOF-based regimens in a large cohort of HCV GT-1 patients. Another strength of the study is the representation of a significant number of AA patients treated with SOF/VEL, which is in contrast to existing literature where treatment outcomes in AA patients are rarely reported because of disproportionate representation. Key limitations of our study include using a retrospective design, insufficient documentation of AEs, and lack of viral resistance testing in all the study patients.

### Treatment of oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO / ESTRO clinical practice guideline [^919cb9a3]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASTRO/ESTRO oligometastatic NSCLC — overall quality of evidence (QoE) grades specify study types and evidence interpretation: High QoE reflects "2 or more well-conducted and highly generalizable RCTs or meta-analyses of such trials", and "The true effect is very likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence". Moderate QoE includes "1 well-conducted and highly generalizable RCT or a meta-analysis of such trials OR 2 or more RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 2 or more strong observational studies with consistent findings", with interpretation that "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence, but it is possible that it is substantially different". Low QoE includes "1 RCT with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 1 or more RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure or generalizability or extremely small sample sizes OR 2 or more observational studies with inconsistent findings, small sample sizes, or other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data", interpreted as "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. There is a risk that future research may significantly alter the estimate of the effect size or the interpretation of the results". Expert Opinion reflects "Consensus of the panel based on clinical judgment and experience, due to absence of evidence or limitations in evidence", with "Strong consensus (≥ 90%) of the panel" guiding recommendations; additionally, "A lower quality of evidence, including expert opinion, does not imply that the recommendation is conditional".

### Sofosbuvir / velpatasvir: the first pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral combination for hepatitis C [^529ec696]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Data Sources

A literature search through PubMed was conducted (June 2008 to August 2016) using the terms GS-5816, velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir. References from retrieved articles and the prescribing information were reviewed for any additional material.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Phase I, II, and III studies of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for HCV were identified.

Data Synthesis

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is indicated for adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 through 6. It is given without ribavirin in patients with or without compensated cirrhosis and with ribavirin in patients who have decompensated cirrhosis. The ASTRAL-1 study demonstrated that sofosbuvir 400 mg plus velpatasvir 100 mg for 12 weeks was effective at achieving high sustained virological response (SVR 12) rates in patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. The ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 studies demonstrated that the same regimen was effective at achieving high SVR 12 rates in patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3. The ASTRAL-4 study demonstrated that the same regimen plus ribavirin was effective at achieving high SVR 12 rate in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% of patients) associated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir were headache and fatigue.

Conclusions

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is safe and effective to treat HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in patients with or without compensated cirrhosis. The addition of ribavirin is recommended in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Fast and deep phosphoproteome analysis with the orbitrap astral mass spectrometer [^bb361fd2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Next, we plotted the distribution, by tissue, of phosphorylation sites and whether they were detected in both studies (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Despite the age and strain differences between mice, and the dynamic nature of phosphorylation, we see good overlap in detection of sites (median 55.3%). Tissue-specificity was also plotted (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 5B) and compared to Huttlin et al. In both studies, a large portion of phosphorylation sites appear to have single tissue specificity; however, our results indicate that a sizeable number of sites are detected across all twelve tissues. This result contrasts with the Huttlin work and likely stems from the increased sensitivity and reproducibility afforded by the new analyzer and DIA method. With this result, we expect that many sites may indeed be present across all tissues and that further improvements in sensitivity and reproducibility are likely needed to detect them. This hypothesis is further evinced by the results shown in Fig. 4D, E, where we examined the detected peak intensities for each site as a function of how many tissues in which it was observed. From these data, both studies show concordance between number of tissues detected and overall signal strength (i.e. abundance).

Furthermore, we compared our comprehensive phosphoprotein atlas of the mouse with the most recent multi-tissue study conducted by Giansanti and co-workers. Similar to our sample preparation, the phosphopeptides from multiple tissues were offline fractionated and further concatenated into 4 samples. These samples were measured using a 90-min gradient DDA on the Q Exactive Orbitrap HF MS system. Despite a 6-fold shorter measurement time, the Orbitrap Astral detected 2–3 times more phosphosites per tissue, with improved agreement with our dataset compared to Huttlin et al. (median 64.2% versus 55.3%; Supplementary Fig. 6A). Interestingly, Giansanti's study shows a similar trend towards a higher number of sites that are present across all tissues (Supplementary Fig. 6B). The portion of pY in this study is 1.1% (Supplementary Fig. 6C), which additionally highlights the capability of combining Astral sensitivity with DIA acquisition to enable the detection of 4.6% pY in our data.

### Efficacy and safety of glecaprevir / pibrentasvir in patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1: the EXPEDITION-2 study [^9ef712bf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Twelve weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment is the only pangenotypic HCV regimen recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association of the Liver treatment guidelines for HCV treatment-naive coinfected patients with compensated cirrhosis. In the C-EDGE study, 12-week elbasvir plus grazoprevir yielded an SVR12 rate of 96% in 218 coinfected patients, including 100% SVR12 in 35 patients with cirrhosis. In the US study ASTRAL-5, conducted in 106 patients coinfected with HCV/HIV-1, including 19 patients with cirrhosis, 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir yielded an SVR12 rate of 95%, with 2 relapses. Here, there were no relapses in 16 coinfected patients with cirrhosis following 12-week treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; 1 HCV treatment-naive patient with genotype 3 infection and cirrhosis experienced breakthrough.

### Alirocumab and cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndrome [^a299226a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study ODYSSEY OUTCOMES was published by Gregory G Schwartz and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Unstable angina. In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the trial question was: what is the role of alirocumab in patients following acute coronary syndrome who are receiving high-intensity statin therapy? In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the population was: 18924 patients (4762 female, 14162 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute coronary syndrome 1–12 months earlier who have qualifying lipid levels and are receiving high-intensity statin therapy. The key exclusion criteria were age < 40 years; LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; ApoB < 80 mg/dL; non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL; acute coronary syndrome event occurring > 52 weeks prior to randomization. In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the interventions were: n = 9462 alirocumab (subcutaneous dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks) n = 9462 placebo (matching placebo every 2 weeks). In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from coronary artery disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization (9.5% vs. 11.1%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal ischemic stroke (10.3% vs. 11.9%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93) Significant decrease in coronary artery disease event (12.7% vs. 14.3%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95) Significant decrease in cardiovascular event (13.7% vs. 15.6%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94). In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in local injection site reaction (3.8% vs. 2.1%). In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute coronary syndrome 1–12 months earlier who have qualifying lipid levels and are receiving high-intensity statin therapy, alirocumab was superior to placebo with respect to death from coronary artery disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^397e991a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The study ASPIRE was published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the ASPIRE study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked VTE and have a high risk of recurrence after anticoagulants are discontinued? In the ASPIRE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASPIRE study, the population was: 822 patients (375 female, 447 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked VTE. The key exclusion criteria were first unprovoked episode of VTE > 2 years before enrollment; indication or contraindication for the use of aspirin, other antiplatelet therapy, or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug; indication for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy; or other medical problems that would interfere with participation in the trial or limit life expectancy. In the ASPIRE study, the interventions were: n = 411 aspirin (100 mg PO once daily, for up to 4 years) n = 411 placebo (matching placebo PO once daily, for up to 4 years). In the ASPIRE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE (4.8% / y vs. 6.5% / y; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). In the ASPIRE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events (5.2% / y vs. 8% / y; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92) Significant decrease in the incidence of VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding, or death (6% / y vs. 9% / y; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.91). In the ASPIRE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding or serious adverse events. In the ASPIRE study, the conclusion was: in patients who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked VTE, aspirin was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of recurrent VTE.

### Effect of lung recruitment and titrated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) vs low PEEP on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^a60ba889]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study ART was published by Writing Group for the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART) Investigators and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the ART study, the trial question was: what is the effect of lung recruitment maneuver and titrated PEEP in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS? In the ART study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ART study, the population was: 1010 patients (379 female, 631 male). The inclusion criteria were patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with moderate-to-severe ARDS of < 72 hours of duration. The key exclusion criteria were use of increasing doses of vasoconstrictor drugs or mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg; contraindications to hypercapnia; pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or pneumatocele. In the ART study, the interventions were: n = 501 lung recruitment and titrated PEEP (a strategy with a lung recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration according to the best respiratory system compliance) n = 509 low PEEP (a strategy of low PEEP). In the ART study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in death at day 28 (55.3% vs. 49.3%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42). In the ART study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in death at 6 months (65.3% vs. 59.9%; HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.38) Significant decrease in the number of ventilator-free days (5.3 days vs. 6.4 days; AD -1.1 days, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.1) Significant increase in risk of pneumothorax requiring drainage (3.2% vs. 1.2%; AD 2%, 95% CI 0 to 4). In the ART study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death in the ICU and hospital, refractory hypoxemia, severe acidosis, and cardiorespiratory arrest. significant difference in barotrauma (5.6% vs. 1.6%) and vasopressor use or hypotension (34.8% vs. 28.3%). In the ART study, the conclusion was: in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation with moderate-to-severe ARDS of < 72 hours of duration, lung recruitment and titrated PEEP were inferior to low PEEP with respect to death at day 28.

### Principles of good clinical trial design [^bb6a294d]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are a fundamental component of medical research and serve as the main route to obtain evidence of the safety and efficacy of treatment before its approval. A trial's ability to provide the intended evidence hinges on appropriate design, background knowledge, trial rationale to sample size, and interim monitoring rules. In this article, we present some general design principles for investigators and their research teams to consider when planning to conduct a trial.

### Velpatasvir and sofosbuvir (sofosbuvir and velpatasvir) [^9120f003]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks resulted in numerically higher SVR12 rates than treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks or 24 weeks. Because sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks is the recommended dosage regimen, the results of the 12- and 24-week sofosbuvir and velpatasvir treatment groups are not presented.

Table 18 presents the SVR12 for subjects treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks in the ASTRAL-4 trial by HCV genotype. No subjects with genotype 5 or 6 HCV were treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with ribavirin for 12 weeks.

All subjects with genotype 2 (N = 4) and genotype 4 (N = 2) HCV infection treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and ribavirin achieved SVR12.

14.5	Clinical Trial in Adult Liver Transplant Recipients without Cirrhosis and with Compensated Cirrhosis

Trial 2104 was an open-label clinical trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets (400 mg/100 mg) in 79 HCV-infected treatment-naïve and previously treated adult subjects who had undergone liver transplantation. The proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV infection were 47%, 4%, 44%, and 5%, respectively. The median age was 62 years (range: 45 to 81); 81% were male; 82% were White; 3% were Black; and 15% were Asian; 28% had a baseline body mass index at least 30 kg/m². At baseline, 18% had compensated cirrhosis, and 60% were treatment experienced (subjects with prior exposure to any HCV NS5A inhibitor were excluded). Immunosuppressants allowed for coadministration were tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. The overall SVR12 rate was 96% (76/79). Of the subjects completing 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, 2 subjects experienced virologic relapse.

### Service delivery in acute ischemic stroke patients: does sex matter? [^aa7c2f63]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Women with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are older and have greater preexisting handicap than men. Given that these factors do not fully explain their poorer long‐term outcomes, we sought to investigate potential sex differences in the delivery of acute stroke care in a large cohort of consecutive AIS patients.

Methods

We analyzed all patients from ASTRAL (Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne) from March 2003 to December 2019. Multivariable analyses were performed on acute time metrics, revascularization therapies, ancillary examinations for stroke workup, subacute symptomatic carotid artery revascularization, frequency of change in goals of care (palliative care), and length of hospital stay.

Results

Of the 5347 analyzed patients, 45% were biologically female and the median age was 74.6 years. After multiple adjustments, female sex was significantly associated with higher onset‐to‐door (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.14) and door‐to‐endovascular‐puncture intervals (aHR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.05–1.25). Women underwent numerically fewer diagnostic examinations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.85–1.04) and fewer subacute carotid revascularizations (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.33–1.18), and had longer hospital stays (aHR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.99–1.07), but these differences were not statistically significant. We found no differences in the rates of acute revascularization treatments, or in the frequency of change of goals of treatments.

Conclusions

This retrospective analysis of a large, consecutive AIS cohort suggests that female sex is associated with unfavorable pre‐ and in‐hospital time metrics, such as a longer onset‐to‐door and door‐to‐endovascular‐puncture intervals. Such indicators of less effective stroke care delivery may contribute to the poorer long‐term functional outcomes in female patients and require further attention.

### Service delivery in acute ischemic stroke patients: does sex matter? [^6bba0c61]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Women with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are older and have greater preexisting handicap than men. Given that these factors do not fully explain their poorer long-term outcomes, we sought to investigate potential sex differences in the delivery of acute stroke care in a large cohort of consecutive AIS patients.

Methods

We analyzed all patients from ASTRAL (Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne) from March 2003 to December 2019. Multivariable analyses were performed on acute time metrics, revascularization therapies, ancillary examinations for stroke workup, subacute symptomatic carotid artery revascularization, frequency of change in goals of care (palliative care), and length of hospital stay.

Results

Of the 5347 analyzed patients, 45% were biologically female and the median age was 74.6years. After multiple adjustments, female sex was significantly associated with higher onset-to-door (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.14) and door-to-endovascular-puncture intervals (aHR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.05–1.25). Women underwent numerically fewer diagnostic examinations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.85–1.04) and fewer subacute carotid revascularizations (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.33–1.18), and had longer hospital stays (aHR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.99–1.07), but these differences were not statistically significant. We found no differences in the rates of acute revascularization treatments, or in the frequency of change of goals of treatments.

Conclusions

This retrospective analysis of a large, consecutive AIS cohort suggests that female sex is associated with unfavorable pre- and in-hospital time metrics, such as a longer onset-to-door and door-to-endovascular-puncture intervals. Such indicators of less effective stroke care delivery may contribute to the poorer long-term functional outcomes in female patients and require further attention.

### Serious asthma events with fluticasone plus salmeterol versus fluticasone alone [^a33150ec]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study AUSTRI was published by Stempel DA and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Severe asthma phenotypes and Asthma. In the AUSTRI study, the trial question was: is salmeterol plus fluticasone noninferior to fluticasone alone in patients with persistent asthma and a history of severe asthma exacerbations? In the AUSTRI study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AUSTRI study, the population was: 11679 patients (7749 female, 3930 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with persistent asthma who had a history of a severe asthma exacerbation in the year before randomization, but not during the previous month. The key exclusion criteria were history of life-threatening, cigarette smoking for > 10 pack-years or unstable asthma. In the AUSTRI study, the interventions were: n = 5834 fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler therapy (at a dose of 100 mcg and 50 mcg, 250 mcg and 50 mcg, or 500 mcg and 50 mcg of fluticasone and salmeterol, respectively, administered BID) n = 5845 fluticasone-only inhaler therapy (at a dose of 100 mcg, 250 mcg, or 500 mcg, administered BID). In the AUSTRI study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in serious asthma-related events (36 vs. 38; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66). In the AUSTRI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in severe asthma exacerbation, at least one (8% vs. 10%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.89). In the AUSTRI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in asthma-related hospitalizations (34 vs. 33) and there were no reported asthma-related death in either group. In the AUSTRI study, the conclusion was: in patients with persistent asthma who had a history of a severe asthma exacerbation in the year before randomization, but not during the previous month, fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler therapy was noninferior to fluticasone-only inhaler therapy with respect to serious asthma-related events.

### Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis for deep-vein thrombosis [^7b6b15ee]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study ATTRACT was published by Vedantham S and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the ATTRACT study, the trial question was: what is the role of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis in reducing the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy? In the ATTRACT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ATTRACT study, the population was: 691 patients (265 female, 426 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy. The key exclusion criteria were < 16 or > 75 years of age, pregnant, symptoms for > 14 days, high risk bleeding, active cancer, established post-thrombotic syndrome, or ipsilateral DVT in the previous 2 years. In the ATTRACT study, the interventions were: n = 336 pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus delivery of rtPA and thrombus aspiration or maceration, with or without stenting plus anticoagulation) n = 355 medical therapy (anticoagulation alone). In the ATTRACT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months (47% vs. 48%; RR 0.96, 96% CI 0.82 to 1.11). In the ATTRACT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome (18% vs. 24%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98). In the ATTRACT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and major bleeding over 24 months. significant differences in major bleeding during the first 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.049; RR 6.18, 95% CI 0.78–49.2) and recurrent VTE within 24 months (12% vs. 8%, p = 0.09). In the ATTRACT study, the conclusion was: in patients with proximal DVT despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy, pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis were not superior to medical therapy with respect to the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months.

### Phase II trials in drug development and adaptive trial design [^0b8cff74]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

ADs must be approached cautiously. Seamless progression of an AD study from phase II proof-of-concept and dose-finding stages into phase III studies of efficacy and safety in large populations implies that an efficacious outcome was seen in phase II. This "unblinding" can bias both investigators and caregivers going forward. Also, because the patient population is adjusting throughout the trial, patients enrolled earlier in the trial are likely to show a different magnitude of outcomes than those enrolled later, and this effect must be carefully accounted for in a more complex statistical analysis.

Adaptation in ADs is a design feature and not a cure for poor trial design and inadequate planning. The PhRMA Working Group on Adaptive Design in Clinical Drug Development identified statistical, logistical, and procedural issues that can arise in ADs and made recommendations for meeting these challenges. For ADs to take full advantage of the efficiencies they supposedly offer, they recommended that: 1) study endpoints in ADs should have short follow-up time relative to the overall duration of the trial; 2) data accrual should occur in real time or rapidly, making electronic data collection a priority; and 3) use of databases must incorporate case-by-case decisions regarding how well the data must be "cleaned" (a potentially time-consuming enterprise) versus making adaptation decisions based on all available data. They and other authors also emphasize that data monitoring committees that carry out interim analyses must be constituted in such a way as to minimize bias, including commercial bias. This can be challenging, because such committees usually need representation from the commercial sponsor itself, to provide input on practical aspects of trial design and commercialization. They strongly recommend that such data monitoring committees be "firewalled" from project personnel, that sponsor representatives on the committee be isolated from all trial activities, and that sponsor access to interim data be minimized.

ADs are slowly achieving increasing regulatory acceptance. Both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA have published papers and guidance documents addressing the limitations of ADs in the regulatory context. Regulatory guidances all agree that strict control of the type I error rate is a regulatory prerequisite for acceptance of a clinical trial. In a review of > 5 years of EMA and FDA advice letters regarding proposed AD phase II or phase II/III studies, 20% of the 59 studies were not accepted, and the most frequently cited concerns raised by the agencies were, not unexpectedly, insufficient justifications for the adaptation, inadequate type I error rate control, and study bias.

### Trial of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke with large infarct [^71453e08]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study ANGEL-ASPECT was published by Xiaochuan Huo and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the trial question was: what is the role of endovascular therapy in patients with AIS with large infarction? In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the population was: 455 patients (176 female, 279 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18–80 years with ischemic stroke within the previous 24 hours. The key exclusion criteria were midline shift or clinical signs of herniation; mass effect; high risk of hemorrhage; acute bilateral strokes; or multiple intracranial occlusions. In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the interventions were: n = 230 endovascular therapy (mechanical thrombectomy, aspiration thrombectomy, intra-arterial thrombolysis, angioplasty or stenting plus medical management) n = 225 medical management (standard guideline-directed medical therapy alone). In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in mRS score at day 90 (4 points vs. 4 points; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.9). In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (30% vs. 11.6%; RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.06) Significant increase in mRS score of 0–3 at day 90 (47% vs. 33.3%; RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.91) Significant increase in target artery recanalization at 36 hours (85.8% vs. 36.4%; RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.08). In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic ICH within 48 hours, death within 90 days, decompressive hemicraniectomy during hospitalization. significant difference in any ICH within 48 hours (49.1% vs. 17.3%). In the ANGEL-ASPECT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 18–80 years with ischemic stroke within the previous 24 hours, endovascular therapy was superior to medical management with respect to mRS score at day 90.

### Machine learning-based model for prediction of outcomes in acute stroke [^94720b62]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients may be useful in treatment decisions. Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P < 0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P = 0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P = 0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions- Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.

### Radiation therapy for endometrial cancer: an American Society for Radiation Oncology clinical practice guideline [^873f9836]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASTRO recommendation grading classification system — the strength categories and quality of evidence (QoE) levels are defined with linked evidence interpretations. Strong is used when "Benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden, or risks and burden clearly outweigh benefits" and when "All or almost all informed people would make the recommended choice". Conditional applies when "Benefits are finely balanced with risks and burden, or appreciable uncertainty exists about the magnitude of benefits and risks", when "Most informed people would choose the recommended course of action, but a substantial number would not", and when "A shared decision-making approach regarding patient values and preferences is particularly important". QoE levels are: High ("2 or more well-conducted and highly generalizable RCTs or meta-analyses of such trials") with interpretation that "The true effect is very likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence"; Moderate (criteria include "1 well-conducted and highly generalizable RCT or a meta-analysis of such trials OR 2 or more RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 2 or more strong observational studies with consistent findings") with interpretation that "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect based on the body of evidence, but it is possible that it is substantially different"; Low (criteria include "1 RCT with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability OR 1 or more RCTs with serious deficiencies of procedure or generalizability or extremely small sample sizes OR 2 or more observational studies with inconsistent findings, small sample sizes, or other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data") with interpretation that "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. There is a risk that future research may significantly alter the estimate of the effect size or the interpretation of the results"; and Expert opinion ("Consensus of the panel based on clinical judgment and experience, due to absence of evidence or limitations in evidence") with guidance that "Strong consensus (≥ 90%) of the panel guides the recommendation despite insufficient evidence to discern the true magnitude and direction of the net effect".

### Velpatasvir and sofosbuvir (sofosbuvir and velpatasvir) [^2d315553]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

Analyses were conducted to explore the association between relapse rates and pre-existing baseline NS5A resistance-associated polymorphisms (RAPs) (any change from reference at NS5A amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93) identified by population or deep sequencing analysis at a sensitivity threshold of 15% or higher for subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2, and ASTRAL-3 and subjects with decompensated cirrhosis in ASTRAL-4.

Studies in Subjects without Cirrhosis and Subjects with Compensated Cirrhosis

Among the subjects who received treatment with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets (400 mg/100 mg) for 12 weeks, 18% (37/209), 32% (38/117), 64% (149/232), 20% (56/274), 63% (73/115), 9% (3/34), and 83% (35/42) of subjects with genotype 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 HCV, respectively, had baseline virus with NS5A RAPs.

Genotype 1: Among the 75 genotype 1 subjects who had baseline NS5A RAPs, one subject (1%) with Q30R, L31M, and H58P polymorphisms at baseline and compensated cirrhosis relapsed.

Genotype 3: Among the 56 genotype 3 subjects in ASTRAL-3 who had baseline NS5A RAPs, 4 subjects (7%) relapsed (3 with baseline Y93H and 1 with baseline A30K). Overall, 20% (3/15) of genotype 3 subjects with the Y93H polymorphism at baseline relapsed.

In a pooled analysis of clinical trials in subjects with HCV genotype 3 infection, the prevalence of the baseline NS5A Y93H polymorphism was 6% (104/1842). Among HCV genotype 3 infected subjects with the Y93H polymorphism who were treated with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets (400 mg/100 mg) for 12 weeks, 7% (2/28) of subjects without cirrhosis relapsed, and 40% (6/15) of subjects with compensated cirrhosis experienced virologic failure (5 relapse, 1 on-treatment).

### SPIRIT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^b10ac022]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

The ethical and scientific justification for a trial depends on the uncertainty of the benefit or harm of the intervention to be tested. This uncertainty depends in turn on what is known on the topic before the trial commences. The background section of a protocol should summarise the relevance of the research question, justify the need for the trial in the context of available evidence, and present any available preliminary data on the potential effects of the interventions (benefits and harms), thus reporting a rationale for the trial.

This information is particularly important to the trial participants as it provides motivation for contributing to the trial. It is also relevant to funders, research ethics committees or institutional review boards, and other groups who evaluate the scientific and ethical basis for trial approval. The background should also present a plausible explanation of how the intervention might work. Understanding the rationale or theory underpinning an intervention helps readers to understand which aspects or components are likely to be essential to its efficacy or harm, and which are likely to be incidental.

Reviews of two samples of 108 and 292 trial protocols from 2016 found that 44% and 26%, respectively, justified the research question.

The World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki states that biomedical research involving people should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, as it is unethical to expose humans unnecessarily to the risks of research. To place the trial in the context of available evidence, it is strongly recommended that an up-to-date, systematic review of relevant trials be summarised and cited in the protocol, or, in the absence of a published review, that the protocol authors systematically identify and summarise previous trials. This evidence can also help researchers to optimise the usefulness of the new trial by informing design aspects such as outcome definition and sample size.

Several funders request this background information in grant applications. Failure to review the cumulative evidence can lead to unnecessary and wasteful duplication of researchor to trial participants being deprived of effective interventions or exposed to harmful interventions. Previous reviews of trial protocols have found that many do not cite the systematic reviews or trials that exist on the same topic.

Summary of key elements to address

Importance of the research question
Why a new trial is needed in the context of available evidence: explanation of how the intervention might work; pretrial evidence of the benefits and harms of the interventions; and reference to systematic review(s) of relevant trials; if none is available, a summary of relevant trials based on a systematic search.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^72df62d3]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Item 1b: Abstract

Standard CONSORT item — Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance see CONSORT for abstracts).

CONSORT cluster extension — Abstract see table (not shown).

Extension for SW-CRTs — Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions (see table 4).

Table 4
Items to report in the journal abstract of a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT)

For the same rationale as provided in the other CONSORT statements, clear reporting of the trial's objectives, design, methods, main results, and conclusions in the abstract is crucial. The primary reason for this is that many readers will base their assessment of the trial from the information available in the abstract. A review assessing the quality of reporting of abstracts from fully published SW-CRT revealed incomplete reporting of important details. A set of items to be reported as a minimum in an abstract of a SW-CRT is included in table 4. Of some note, the items recommended to be reported in the abstract results section do not include the summary measures of the outcome under intervention and control conditions, so as to avoid misattributing the unadjusted difference to the treatment effect. A worked example of an abstract according to this template is provided (see supplementary materials, table S1).

### Indications for the performance of intracranial endovascular neurointerventional procedures: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^99cdb6da]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

ISAT II — trial design for aneurysm management describes a pragmatic multicenter randomized trial in non-ISAT patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) allocated to coiling or clipping. The primary end point is the incidence of poor clinical outcome (defined as an mRS score > 2) at 1 year, and the secondary end point is the presence of a major recurrence at 1 year. The goal recruitment is 1896 patients (862 in each arm plus 10% losses), hypothesizing 23% and 30% poor clinical outcome rates for coiling and clipping, respectively; the trial should involve at least 50 international centers and will take ≈12 years to complete.

### Endovascular treatment for stroke due to occlusion of medium or distal vessels [^df9aaf7b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study DISTAL was published by Marios Psychogios and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the DISTAL study, the trial question was: what is the role of endovascular treatment in patients with AIS due to medium or distal vessel occlusion? In the DISTAL study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DISTAL study, the population was: 543 patients (239 female, 304 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AIS due to medium or distal vessel occlusion. The key exclusion criteria were acute ICH; bedridden or nursing home resident; in-hospital stroke; known sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents, nickel, titanium metals or their alloys; pregnancy or lactation; evidence of cerebral vasculitis; evidence of vessel recanalization prior to randomization. In the DISTAL study, the interventions were: n = 271 endovascular therapy (endovascular treatment device and technique choice made by the treating physician plus best medical treatment) n = 272 usual care (best medical treatment including intravenous thrombolysis or antiplatelet therapy if indicated under current international guidelines and according to routine clinical practice). In the DISTAL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median mRS score at day 90 (2 points vs. 2 points; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.22). In the DISTAL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in excellent functional outcome at day 90 (34.7% vs. 37.5%; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25) No significant difference in improvement in severity of neurologic deficit at 24 hours (0.4 points vs. 0.3 points; MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.14) No significant difference in cognitive function (23 points vs. 23 points; MD 0.13, 95% CI -1.22 to 1.48). In the DISTAL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death at day 90, symptomatic ICH within 24 hours. In the DISTAL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AIS due to medium or distal vessel occlusion, endovascular therapy was not superior to usual care with respect to median mRS score at day 90.
