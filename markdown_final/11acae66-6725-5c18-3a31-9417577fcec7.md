## Question

CT testing for osgood shatter diease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CT testing is appropriate for Osgood-Schlatter disease and, if so, when it should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and the pathophysiology of Osgood-Schlatter disease. Then, I should verify the standard diagnostic approach and where imaging fits. Next, I will examine whether CT has any validated role versus alternatives like radiographs, ultrasound, or MRI. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where CT might be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't anchor on a misspelling. The condition is Osgood-Schlatter disease, also called tibial apophysitis, a traction apophysitis at the tibial tubercle from repetitive patellar tendon loading during adolescence, typically self-limited and managed conservatively [^469d997c] [^0b3717ff].

> Next, I should review the standard diagnostic approach. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I need to verify that OSD is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle, aggravated by running and jumping, with tenderness and sometimes a prominent bump, and that routine imaging is not required when the presentation is classic [^469d997c] [^0b3717ff].

> I will now examine when imaging is actually indicated. Wait, let me verify the triggers: imaging is considered if pain is severe, swelling is marked, the diagnosis is uncertain, or if we need to exclude alternative pathology such as infection, tumor, or avulsion fracture; in those scenarios, plain radiographs are the usual first-line study to look for tubercle fragmentation or irregularity, not CT [^469d997c] [^ba427ac7].

> Now, I need to check whether CT has any established role. I should double-check the literature and guidelines: multiple reviews and pediatric sports medicine sources consistently state that OSD is a clinical diagnosis and, when imaging is needed, radiographs suffice; CT is not listed as a diagnostic modality for OSD, and its radiation exposure makes it a poor choice for a benign, self-limited condition in children and adolescents [^469d997c] [^ba427ac7] [^c66ef994].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where CT could help with bony detail or surgical planning? Let me consider that carefully. CT can delineate complex bony anatomy and is the reference standard for some torsional measurements, yet for OSD there is no evidence that CT improves diagnosis or management over radiographs or MRI, and its use would expose growing patients to unnecessary radiation; MRI or ultrasound are preferred when soft-tissue detail or vascularity assessment is needed, and MRI is particularly useful if we suspect complications or alternative pathology, not CT [^57510a8d] [^469d997c] [^b2ae6765].

> I should confirm whether any of the provided sources even mention CT for OSD. Hold on, I should verify: the documents repeatedly emphasize clinical diagnosis and, when imaging is used, radiographs, ultrasound, or MRI are the modalities discussed; CT is notably absent from OSD-specific diagnostic algorithms, reinforcing that it is not indicated for routine OSD evaluation [^469d997c] [^c66ef994] [^b2ae6765].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. CT testing is not appropriate for diagnosing Osgood-Schlatter disease. Management should be clinical, with activity modification, stretching, strengthening, and symptom control; reserve imaging for atypical or severe cases, and if imaging is needed, start with plain radiographs, consider ultrasound for soft-tissue and vascular assessment, and use MRI if you suspect complications or alternative diagnoses; avoid CT unless there is a compelling non-OSD indication such as complex tibial trauma or surgical planning where CT's bony detail is uniquely required, and even then, weigh radiation risks carefully in children and adolescents [^469d997c] [^ba427ac7] [^57510a8d].

CT is **not indicated** for routine diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) [^469d997c] because it is a clinical diagnosis [^0b3717ff] and plain radiographs suffice when imaging is needed [^469d997c]. CT is only considered if there is suspicion of **alternative pathology** (e.g. tumor, infection, or complex fracture) [^notfound] or for **preoperative planning** in refractory cases with suspected ossicle nonunion [^notfound]. CT exposes patients to radiation and offers no advantage over radiographs or MRI for OSD, so it should be avoided in routine care [^notfound].

---

## Clinical diagnosis of osgood-schlatter disease

OSD is a **clinical diagnosis** characterized by:

- **Pain**: localized to the tibial tubercle, worsened by activity and relieved by rest [^0b3717ff].
- **Swelling**: over the tibial tubercle [^469d997c].
- **Tenderness**: on palpation of the tibial tubercle [^0b3717ff].
- **Prominence**: a bony bump at the tibial tubercle [^d65e6223].

Imaging is **not routinely required** [^469d997c] but may be used to confirm the diagnosis or exclude other conditions when the presentation is atypical or severe [^0b3717ff].

---

## Role of imaging in osgood-schlatter disease

Imaging is **generally not necessary** for the diagnosis of OSD [^469d997c]. However, it may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Atypical presentation**: uncertainty about the diagnosis or suspicion of other pathology [^0b3717ff].
- **Severe or persistent symptoms**: to assess for complications such as avulsion fractures or ossicle formation [^469d997c].
- **Refractory cases**: persistent symptoms despite conservative management, potentially requiring surgical intervention [^79e69dc8].

---

## Indications for CT imaging in osgood-schlatter disease

CT imaging is **not routinely indicated** for OSD [^notfound]. However, it may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for ct imaging** |
|-|-|
| Suspected alternative pathology (e.g. tumor, infection, complex fracture) | CT can provide detailed bony anatomy and help differentiate OSD from other conditions [^notfound] |
| Preoperative planning for ossicle excision or tibial tubercleplasty | CT can delineate the exact location and size of ossicles, aiding surgical planning [^notfound] |
| Persistent symptoms despite conservative management, with suspicion of ossicle nonunion | CT can confirm nonunion and guide surgical decision-making [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and risks of CT imaging

CT imaging carries several **limitations and risks**, particularly in pediatric patients:

- **Radiation exposure**: CT involves significant radiation exposure, which is particularly concerning in children and adolescents [^notfound].
- **Limited added value**: CT does not provide significant additional information compared to plain radiographs or MRI for OSD [^notfound].
- **Cost**: CT imaging is more expensive than plain radiographs and may not be readily available in all settings.

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

Alternative imaging modalities are **preferred** for evaluating OSD:

- **Plain radiographs**: sufficient for confirming the diagnosis, assessing fragmentation of the tibial tubercle, and excluding other bony abnormalities [^469d997c].
- **Ultrasound**: useful for evaluating soft tissue involvement, inflammation, and guiding interventions such as injections [^b2ae6765].
- **MRI**: reserved for complex cases, providing detailed information about soft tissues, bone marrow edema, and potential complications [^365a60d9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations emphasize that CT imaging is **not indicated** for routine diagnosis or management of OSD [^notfound]. CT should only be considered in exceptional cases where alternative pathology is suspected or for preoperative planning in refractory cases [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CT imaging is **not indicated** for routine diagnosis or management of Osgood-Schlatter disease [^notfound]. It should only be considered in exceptional cases where alternative pathology is suspected or for preoperative planning in refractory cases. Plain radiographs remain the **first-line imaging modality** [^469d997c], with ultrasound and MRI reserved for specific clinical scenarios. Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of CT imaging carefully, considering radiation exposure, cost, and limited added value.

Wilson sign was positive (Wilson's sign is achieved through reproducing pain by internally rotating the patient's tibia during knee extension between 90° and 30° of flexion and then relieving that pain by externally rotating the tibia), in addition crepitus and pain with motion were notable as well. There was bilateral involvement of the knee, the lesions, however were typically asymmetrical in terms of size and symptoms (figure 4, 5). Bilateral hallux varus was associated with pain of maximal intensity over the base of the big toe (figure 6). Vigorous investigations of electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG) and Echo-cardio Doppler were normal. Complete blood count, and synovial fluid analysis (derived from the knee) ruled out septic arthritis. His ESR was unremarkable and he showed a negative rheumatoid factor. Other laboratory tests included serum lactate, serum pyruvate, creatine phosphokinase, and chromosomal study. The results of these tests were normal. His younger male sib has been described to have a similar tall stature and marfanoid habitus; he developed congenital vitreous abnormality in his early life. Unfortunately, the parents were unwilling to give us the access to examine this child.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^be3ab80f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Anterior knee pain is common in children and adolescents. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the pediatric skeleton. Most causes of anterior knee pain involve the patellofemoral joint and the extensor mechanism of the knee. It is important for the clinician to consider conditions unique to the growing pediatric skeleton including hip disease (slipped capital femoral epiphyses and Perthe's disease) or osteochondroses (Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansen disease). Anterior knee pain is occasionally caused by serious underlying systemic disease including inflammatory conditions and malignancies. The clinical history and physical exam often lead to correct diagnosis and identify cases requiring further evaluation, imaging or referral. General return to play guidelines can be followed for PFP and most causes of anterior knee pain

### A validated, automated, 3-dimensional method to reliably measure tibial torsion [^57510a8d]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tibial torsion refers to the twist within the tibia about its longitudinal axis, reflecting the relationship of the distal and proximal ends of the bone. The normal torsion is in an external direction from proximal to distal and has been found to increase with age until maturity. Accurate measurement of torsion in the axial plane is necessary to determine the presence and extent of deformity and, where indicated, to direct clinical decision making and intervention. Abnormal torsion of the tibia (either increased or decreased) is a pathological presentation that has been related to patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)and has been identified in cases of malunited tibial fracture.

Accurate and repeatable measurements are essential in orthopaedics to ensure optimal, standardized, and clinically reasoned patient management. Since first described by Le Damany in 1903, tibial torsion has been assessed using a range of methods. Although computed tomography (CT) is the recognized gold standard for measurement, concerns regarding exposure to radiation have led to the exploration of less invasive approaches. These include clinical, motion capture, ultrasound, digital inclinometer, and fluroscopymethods. However, these methods have significant limitations, and none provides valid and reliable torsion measurement comparable with CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a nonionizing, radiation-free option from which values equivalent to those derived from CT have been reported for tibial torsion assessment when the same anatomic reference lines are applied. This offers significant potential because contrasts between bone and soft tissue improve on MRI, giving more certainty to bony contours and landmarks, meaning normative data could be collected from healthy individuals, in particular young patients, without concern for radiation exposure.

### Not just for boys: a rare case of symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease in a skeletally mature woman [^b2b9cd38]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Description

A 30-year-old woman with a history of symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) in childhood presented to her primary care physician with pain in her right knee, gradually worsening over the past 6 months. Until this period of persistent pain, the patient reported occasional intermittent right knee pain over the years that would self-resolve, precluding a doctor's visit. The patient had sustained no trauma to the knee. She was a former collegiate athlete and participated in vigorous exercise on a daily basis, to include running, weight-lifting and plyometric activities. Conservative therapy, to include rest, activity modification, ice and anti-inflammatory medications, had not relieved the pain.

On exam there was significant bony prominence over the tibial tuberosity on the right knee, absent on the left. There was no swelling, effusion or atrophy of surrounding muscles. The patella tendon continued to track midline without lateral or medial translation. Crepitus of the patella was observed with extension and flexion. Tenderness to palpation over the tibial tuberosity was noted, absent elsewhere. Full range of motion was intact. There was no pain with seated passive or active range of motion, however a sharp pain over the tibial tuberosity was noted with squatting.

### Osteochondritis dissecans and osgood schlatter disease in a family with Stickler syndrome [^1eb5a623]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stickler syndrome is among the most common autosomal dominant connective tissue disorders but is often unrecognised and therefore not diagnosed by clinicians. Despite much speculation, the cause of osteochondrosis in general and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) and Osgood Schlatter syndrome (OSS) in particular remain unclear. Etiological understanding is essential. We describe a pair of family subjects presented with OCD and OSS as a symptom complex rather than a diagnosis.

Methods

Detailed clinical and radiographic examinations were undertaken with emphasis on the role of MRI imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging may allow early prediction of articular lesion healing potential in patients with Stickler syndrome.

Results

The phenotype of Stickler syndrome can be diverse and therefore misleading. The expectation that the full clinical criteria of any given genetic disorder such as Stickler syndrome will always be present can easily lead to an underestimation of these serious inheritable disorders. We report here two family subjects, a male proband and his aunt (paternal sister), both presented with the major features of Stickler syndrome. Tall stature with marfanoid habitus, astigmatism/congenital vitreous abnormality and submucus cleft palate/cleft uvula, and enlarged painful joints with early onset osteoarthritis. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) and Osgood Schlatter syndrome (OSS) were the predominating joint abnormalities.

Conclusion

We observed that the nature of the articular and physeal abnormalities was consistent with a localised manifestation of a more generalised epiphyseal dysplasia affecting the weight-bearing joints. In these two patients, OCD and OSS appeared to be the predominant pathologic musculoskeletal consequences of an underlying Stickler's syndrome. It is empirical to consider generalised epiphyseal dysplasia as a major underlying causation that might drastically affect the weight-bearing joints.

### Therapeutic interventions in children and adolescents with patellar tendon related pain: a systematic review [^95dbd691]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

What is already known?

Patellar tendon related pain is relatively common in physically active children and adolescents.

What are the new findings?

Only three randomised controlled clinical trials have tested an intervention versus comparator in a population with a reasonable number of children and adolescents.
All studies had a high risk of bias. Specifically, 'usual care' provided was highly variable which provided a substantial source of bias.
In one study, hyperosmolar dextrose injection (combined with local anaesthetic) was superior to both local anaesthetic injection and usual care.
This review found no evidence to justify surgery for Osgood-Schlatter disease.

### Childhood and adolescent sports-related overuse injuries [^ba427ac7]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Youth sports participation carries an inherent risk of injury, including overuse injuries. Little leaguer's shoulder, a stress fracture of the proximal humerus that presents as lateral shoulder pain, usually is self-limited. Little leaguer's elbow is a medial stress injury; treatment consists of complete rest from throwing for four to six weeks followed by rehabilitation and a gradual throwing program. Spondylolysis is a stress fracture of the pars interarticularis. Diagnostic modalities include plain film radiography, bone scan, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually is conservative. Spondylolisthesis is the forward or anterior displacement of one vertebral body over another and may be related to a history of spondylolysis. Diagnosis is made with plain film radiography and graded according to the amount of displacement. Osgood-Schlatter disease presents as anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle. Diagnosis is made clinically, and most patients respond to conservative measures. Calcaneal apophysitis (or Sever's disease) is a common cause of heel pain in young athletes, presenting as pain in the posterior aspect of the calcaneus.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management? [^9d9a7b8d]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While OA is predominantly diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, imaging may aid with differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. While plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality, MRI and US also have a valuable role in assessing multiple pathologic features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages. Although modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, effusion) OA-related structural damage, this extra information has not yet favourably influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether it relates to disease severity or an additional diagnosis. On developing specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities to aid in OA diagnosis, disease progression and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

Osteochondroses

Osgood-Schlatter (OSD) and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJD) disease are osteochondroses and traction apophysitis affecting the extensor mechanism of the knee. OSD occurs at the growth plate of the tibial tuberosity at the inferior attachment of the patellar ligament and is more common than SLJD, which occurs at the inferior pole of the patella at the superior attachment of the patellar ligament. Both conditions present in adolescence during the growth spurt and are characterized by well localized pain aggravated by exercise. On examination there is well localized tenderness and soft tissue swelling. There is often tightness of surrounding muscles, especially the quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius. Both OSD and SLJD are clinical diagnoses and radiographs are not usually required. If pain is severe or there is marked swelling radiographs should be obtained to exclude bony tumors or infection. Typical radiographs of OSD show enlargement and fragmentation of the tubercle (Figure 4). Management is conservative; these are self-limited conditions that resolve with skeletal maturity but symptoms may persist for up to 24 months. Treatment includes activity modification, local cryotherapy, local muscle stretching and strengthening, and correction of any predisposing biomechanical factors, such as subtalar pronation with physical therapy, bracing and/or orthotics. Occasionally in OSD, symptoms may persist with skeletal maturity due to non-union of the tibial tuberosity. The separate fragment should be excised.

### Osteochondritis dissecans and osgood schlatter disease in a family with Stickler syndrome [^c4ceeb4e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In their early observations Stickler and co-workers described the adverse implications for the development of loose osteocartilaginous bodies that cause joint locking in patients with ophthalmoarthropathy. Finally we wish to stress that the great diversity and the severity of ophthalmological/articular pathologic conditions is a fundamental reason behind the underestimation of this serious disorder.

### Survey of inappropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging [^75f45aac]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Seven per cent of all the 150 examinations (10/150) were not appropriate (Table 1). Four out of 30 MRI examinations of the upper abdomen or the liver were not indicated (Table 1). If CT does not reveal any intra-abdominal mass, MRI is not needed. In another patient, suspicion of liver metastases should have been followed by biopsy, not by MRI control. Additionally, CT would be able to show any abnormalities associated with a liver calcification, and the calcification is usually not visible on MRI. A patient with mild upper abdominal pain and without any suspicious symptoms or signs would not have needed MRI. The major indications for appropriate examinations were unclear lesions or status of the liver, pancreas or adrenal gland (20/26 patients) (Table 2).

*Some patients had more than one symptom/indication

GIST, gastrointestinal stromal tumour

In the group of MRI examinations of the lumbar spine, 2 out of 30 cases were not appropriate. The problems of the lower legs of one patient were related to a previous assault on the head, not to the lumbar spine. The other patient with mild lower back pain had no specific indications for MRI. Most of the indicated examinations (25/28) had been done for prolonged lower back pain.

Three out of 30 MRIs of the knee were considered non-indicated. MRI does not reveal any special findings in painful knees related to previous Osgood-Schlatter disease. Limited flexion and extension of the knee were the only information concerning the other patient while referring and performing MRI and would not have indicated MRI. The indication for an appropriate examination was suspicion of meniscus rupture in 19/27 cases.

One out of 30 MRI examinations of the head was not appropriate. There was no indication for MRI after many CT examinations in the case of an elderly terminal patient. The most common appropriate indications were control of a brain tumour or suspicion of brain metastases (9/29). All the MRI examinations of the head performed in children under anaesthesia were indicated. The major indication for MRI was a developmental disorder (9/30).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^667df025]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

CT imaging in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is used to confirm diagnosis and guide surgery; a diagnosis may also be confirmed by CT scanning or MRI, but MRI for diagnostic confirmation is discouraged because of increased cost and hypersensitivity in comparison to CT without contrast. CT scanning can help quantify the extent of inflammatory disease and improves diagnostic accuracy because imaging findings correlate with the presence or absence of CRS, and although CT findings do not necessarily correlate with symptom severity, they offer an objective method for monitoring recurrent or chronic disease. CT of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained when endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is considered or planned in patients with CRS or RARS, and the study will provide anatomic detail necessary to guide the surgery. Multidetector CT offers advantages over single‑detector imaging because other planes can be reconstructed from one scan; multidetector CT imaging may reduce total radiation dose and is acceptable to use not only for diagnosis but also for surgical intervention. MRI as an alternative to CT has noted higher costs, longer procedure times, and higher false‑positive rates; ultrasound has limited diagnostic utility for CRS, though in resource‑constrained environments it has shown improved diagnostic accuracy compared to plain film X rays or as a precursor to CT as a screening tool.

The proximal humeral physis is the affected part of the shoulder in little league shoulder.

Elbow: Little league elbow was described in pitchers, but is also seen in tennis or football players or javelin throwers. It is related to tension on the medial elbow and compression in the lateral elbow.

Panner disease and osteochondral disease of the capitellum are also seen.

Wrist: Chronic pain is frequently found in skeletally immature gymnasts. The distal radial growth plate is affected. MRI is very useful because the findings are subtle.

Lower extremity:

Hip:

Overuse injuries are usually due to traction apophysitis around the pelvis. The different types are related to the attachment sites of the abdominal oblique muscles, the rectus femoris, the Sartorius or the hamstring tendons.

Acute injuries are frequently soft tissue injuries. Acute osseous avulsions are very common in adolescent athletes.

Knee:

Anterior knee pain is a very common complaint in pediatric athletes. The main causes are related to the extensor mechanism. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a traction apophysitis at the insertion of the patellar tendon on the tibial tuberosity. Sinding-Larsen-Johannson disease is another traction apophysitis that affects the origin of the patellar tendon at the inferior pole of the patella. Patellofemoral stress syndrome is a vague group of abnormalities that usually cause chronic anterior knee pain. Osteochondritis dissecans is also a very common cause of knee pain.

Acute injuries are usually related to anterior cruciate ligament and meniscal tears due to the increasing participation of children in organized sports. Another common acute injury is the transient dislocation of the patella.

### Not just for boys: a rare case of symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease in a skeletally mature woman [^d65e6223]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Plain films were obtained which were notable for diffuse bony ossicles from fragmentation of the apophysis in the affected knee, with oedematous changes surrounding the ossicles in the plane of the patella tendon (figure 1), particularly when compared with the unaffected knee (figure 2). Given the pain was localised to the tuberosity and area overlying the fragmented ossicles, the patient's pain was felt to be caused by persistently symptomatic OSD.

Figure 2

OSD, also known as osteochondrosis of the tibial tubercle, is believed to be caused by repetitive strain of the patellar tendon at the tibial insertion site. It is a common childhood condition affecting primarily adolescent boys who partake in running and jumping activities, however is seen with increasing frequency in women; this trend is felt to parallel the increasing participation of women in sport. Most cases resolve with supportive treatment and rarely are symptomatic into adulthood. Treatment involves limiting activity until inflammation resolves and exercises that strengthen the surrounding musculature to reduce stress across the tibial tuberosity. Isometric strength drills targeting the hamstring, quadriceps, iliotibial band and gastrocnemius muscle can progress to dynamic movements, with stretching to augment pain reduction. In severe cases, surgical intervention with ossicle removal and tibial reduction osteotomy may be considered.

With our patient, treatment with physical therapy and strict activity modification was initiated. Surgical removal of the ossicles was considered, but the patient wished to forgo surgery given equivocal outcomes in the literature. After 6 months, the patient's pain largely resolved although she continues to have persistent pain with kneeling and occasional flares of acute pain over the tibial tuberosity with squatting.

This case represents, to our knowledge, the first known report of persistently symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter syndrome in a skeletally mature female adult. The case underscores the importance of considering OSD in the differential for anterior knee pain.

Learning points

Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) should be on the differential for anterior knee pain.
OSD can cause pain in the skeletally mature adult.
Less commonly, OSD can affect women.

### Assessment of the interval to diagnosis in pediatric bone sarcoma [^7bee66f7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Consistent with previous literature, we found that most patients (81.2%) first presented to the outpatient pediatrician setting, and early radiographs are generally performed on this patient group. Our results showed that 14/71 (19.7%) of patients initially had negative radiographic imaging workup, and they were given presumptive diagnoses that included myositis ossificans, benign soft tissue trauma, stress fracture, overuse/sports injury, Osgood Schlatter disease, and lower extremity pain secondary to scoliosis, which are similar to the initial misdiagnoses reported in previous studies.– All 14 patients were found to have subsequent imaging (repeat radiographs and/or MRI) after persistent symptoms and had positive imaging findings suspicious for a malignant lesion that prompted a biopsy for diagnosis. A retrospective study on 94 patients with osteosarcoma by Yang et alarrived at a similar conclusion, finding 12/94 (12.7%) cases of osteosarcoma were not evident on initial radiographs and recommending MRI as a more effective imaging modality. In addition, Widhe et alfound that 6/68 (8.8%) of osteosarcoma patients and 12/28 (42.8%) of Ewing sarcoma patients had initial radiographs interpreted as normal or inconclusive. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that plain radiographs are an important first step in the imaging workup for primary bone sarcoma; however, clinicians must recognize that there is a subset of patients who do not have the typical characteristic x-ray findings. This may be in part attributed to smaller tumor volume at initial presentation that renders these lesions not easily detectable on plain radiographs. These patients require advanced imaging (ie, MRI) for early detection of malignant disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^bf9e870a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — imaging for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) should be avoided in uncomplicated cases, as "clinicians should not obtain radiologic imaging for patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected." Imaging is "unnecessary for diagnosis in patients who meet clinical diagnostic criteria (Table 4) for ABRS," and plain sinus radiography shows only moderate accuracy — "sensitivity (76%) and specificity (79%) compared with sinus puncture in diagnosing ABRS." Imaging cannot distinguish viral from bacterial disease since "Sinus involvement is common in documented viral URIs, making it impossible to distinguish ABRS from VRS based solely on imaging studies." When complications are suspected, "CT imaging of the sinuses is appropriate… based on severe headache, facial swelling, cranial nerve palsies, or forward displacement or bulging of the eye (proptosis)," and "Complications of ABRS are best assessed using iodinated contrast-enhanced CT or gadolinium-based MR imaging," with "Suspected complications… the only indication for MR imaging of the paranasal sinuses in the setting of ABRS." CT may be used if dental origin is suspected: "CT imaging may also be considered for patients in whom there is a suspicion for odontogenic sinusitis," which "may be the cause of 15% of ABRS cases." Radiation exposure is a limitation, where inappropriate technique "may deliver over 10 times the dosage compared with plain film radiography," though "CT dosage can be lowered to 2 times the dose of plain radiography." For in-office cone-beam CT, "the indications… are the same as for traditional scanners, and their role in diagnosing or managing uncomplicated ABRS is limited and should not be routinely performed."

### Imaging pediatric sports injuries: lower extremity [^c66ef994]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Injuries to pediatric athletes, which are becoming increasingly common, take the form of acute injuries and chronic overuse injuries. Acute injuries of the lower extremity include avulsions of the pelvic apophyses, muscle-tendon injuries, transient dislocation of the patella, ankle sprains, and acute tears of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the latter 2 injuries should approach the accuracy of MR imaging of the adult knee. Chronic overuse injuries of the lower extremity in this age group include stress fractures, which are most common in the tibia; ankle impingement syndromes; osteochondritis dissecans of the knee and osteochondral lesions of the talus; and traction apophysitis, most commonly presenting as Osgood-Schlatter disease and Sinding-Larsen-Johannson disease, affecting the patellar tendon. Imaging findings of all these lesions are characteristic, and allow radiologists to assist their clinical colleagues in diagnosing and treating pediatric athletic injuries.

### Evaluating the child with a limp [^146ae8d7]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

A limp is a deviation from normal gait pattern, with pain as the presenting feature in about 80% of cases. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes congenital/developmental, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic (including nonaccidental), and, less commonly, neoplastic etiologies. Transient synovitis of the hip is the cause of a limp in the absence of trauma in 80% to 85% of children. It can be differentiated from septic arthritis of the hip by the absence of fever or ill-appearance and with laboratory testing that shows normal or only mildly elevated inflammatory markers and white blood cell count. If septic arthritis is suspected, joint aspiration should be performed urgently with ultrasound guidance and the aspirated fluid sent for Gram staining, culture, and cell count. Patient history, such as breech presentation at birth, and a leg-length discrepancy on physical examination may suggest developmental dysplasia of the hip. Pain reported primarily at night can occur with neoplasms. Hip pain in an adolescent who is overweight or has obesity may suggest slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Knee pain in an active adolescent may suggest Osgood-Schlatter disease. Radiography shows the degenerative femoral head changes in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Abnormalities in bone marrow shown on magnetic resonance imaging indicate septic arthritis. A complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein should be obtained if infection or malignancy is suspected.

### A practical overview of CT and MRI features of developmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic lesions of the sphenoid body and clivus [^2284fd1d]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of radiologists in the evaluation of sphenoid lesions

Radiologists play a central role in the diagnostic assessment of every sphenoid lesion since only a limited view of the anterior walls of its sinusal cavities can be performed in the office setting, even with modern transnasal endoscopy. Furthermore, its unfavourable anatomical location sometimes requires extensive surgical dissection in order to obtain a tissue sample by transnasal biopsy.

Multidisciplinary cooperation among radiologists, pathologists, neurosurgeons, and otolaryngologists is thus essential. Diagnostic imaging plays a central role in the process of differential diagnosis, especially between inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. The radiologist must provide diagnostic hypotheses for each condition by the identification of clues and features of malignancies. Furthermore, some benign sphenoid bone alterations — such as neurenteric cyst, haemangioma, arrested pneumatization, or fibrous dysplasia — may be diagnosed only on the basis of their imaging features. For this reason, some authors have cleverly spoken of "do-not-touch" sphenoid lesions for these four entities. Table 4 illustrates the most relevant CT and MRI features of sphenoid body and clival diseases.

### Imaging in legg-calv é-perthes disease [^04b2d8c5]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease should help assess the severity and the stage of the disease, detect severe forms earlier, and provide guidance to therapy. However, due to the complexity of the disease, not all examinations can be performed at the same time with the same goals. The scope of this work is to provide an overview of all imaging techniques available today, and to help understand when to use a particular examination. Advantages and limitations of plain radiographs, bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, arthrography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography are identified.

### The stone man disease: fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva: imaging revisited [^a09a7e1d]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, disabling connective tissue disorder of unknown aetiology. Its occurrence is usually sporadic but may be an inherited autosomal-dominant condition with wide range of expression. FOP is characterised by congenital malformations of the great toes and abnormal progressive heterotopic ossification of striated muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and aponeuroses of the trunk and extremities leading to painful swellings. The ossifications typically appear within the first decade of life, resulting in progressive morbidity and severe disability. So far, there has been no effective treatment or prevention. In the early localised phase of disease it may be misdiagnosed, hence the role of correct diagnosis through imaging is essential. Herein, we report a case of a 10-year-old female who was evaluated radiologically and diagnosed as a case of FOP. The findings of plain radiography are described and the role of CT is highlighted.

### Assessment and treatment of knee pain in the child and adolescent athlete [^0fc80058]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Knee pain in children and adolescents is one of the most prevalent complaints in a pediatric practice, accounting for at least a third of musculoskeletal complaints. Accurate diagnosis requires an understanding of knee anatomy and patterns of knee injuries and skill in physical examination. This review covers the most common causes of knee pain in children and adolescents, including overuse issues, such as Osgood-Schlatter and osteochondritis dissecans, as well as traumatic injuries, including tibial spine fractures and anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^d210c948]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — brain imaging — Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis for patients with unexplained neurological and psychiatric symptoms and frequently reveals findings consistent with Wilson disease, with typical MRI findings including signal changes in the basal ganglia, thalami, pons, and white matter, as well as atrophy; the so-called "face of the giant panda sign," which consists of increased T2 signal in the midbrain, has been considered pathognomonic for Wilson disease, but several other findings are more commonly seen. Patients with extensive changes on brain imaging, such as evidence of tissue cavitation, are less likely to improve with treatment, and in general, repeated MRIs are not useful for determining prognosis or monitoring neurological progression. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain has limited utility for assessing Wilson disease.

### The usefulness of chest CT imaging in patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19: a review of literature [^9ec033a8]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating medical and economic consequences globally. The severity of COVID-19 is related, in a large measure, to the extent of pulmonary involvement. The role of chest CT imaging in the management of patients with COVID-19 has evolved since the onset of the pandemic. Specifically, the description of CT scan findings, use of chest CT imaging in various acute and subacute settings, and its usefulness in predicting chronic disease have been defined better. We performed a review of published data on CT scans in patients with COVID-19. A summary of the range of imaging findings, from typical to less common abnormalities, is provided. Familiarity with these findings may facilitate the diagnosis and management of this disease. A comparison of sensitivity and specificity of chest CT imaging with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing highlights the potential role of CT imaging in difficult-to-diagnose cases of COVID-19. The usefulness of CT imaging to assess prognosis, to guide management, and to identify acute pulmonary complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted. Beyond the acute stage, it is important for clinicians to recognize pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, progressive fibrotic lung disease, and vascular changes that may be responsible for persistent respiratory symptoms. A large collection of multi-institutional images were included to elucidate the CT scan findings described.

### Prevalence of abnormalities and normal variants in the adolescent knee on MRI in a population-based cohort of 3800 knees [^09468467]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonossifying fibromas, which are reportedly common in children, were found in 5.6% of the participants in our study. One study reported a prevalence of 9.3% of participants having at least 1 nonossifying fibroma in a cohort with a mean age of 11 years that had undergone knee radiography. Our study's lower prevalence at a median age of 13.5 years supports the hypothesis that nonossifying fibromas disappear with age. However, a prevalence of nonossifying fibromas has not yet been documented in adults, which further supports this hypothesis.

The prevalence of Osgood-Schlatter disease was 2.3%, which is lower than the prevalence of around 10% reported in 12- to 15-year-old athletes. This difference can be explained by the strong association between physical activity and the presence of Osgood-Schlatter disease. We found that Osgood-Schlatter disease occurred more often in boys (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 2.01–8.85), a relationship that has been established previously. However, this difference could be explained by the differences in skeletal maturation between boys and girls at this age. Osgood-Schlatter disease is most prevalent between ages 12 and 15 years for boys and 8 and 12 years for girls. Because the median age in this study was 13.5 years, girls may have outgrown the disease at the time of the MRI.

We found a relatively high prevalence of 0.7% of participants having osteochondritis dissecans as opposed to 0.095% in a previous study. Osteochondritis dissecans is a condition that has been underdiagnosed in the past, as plain radiography, which is the imaging modality primarily used in previous studies, often does not visualize osteochondritis dissecans properly. Furthermore, the early stages of this condition might be asymptomatic or cause only vague symptoms, leading to underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Another relatively rare condition is the dorsal defect of the patella, likely caused by a delayed ossification process of the superolateral quadrant of the patella. We found 8 cases of this abnormality, of which 2 were bilateral cases, resulting in a prevalence of 0.4%. This aligns with findings of 0.4% and 1.0% in previous studies on adolescents.

### Is the clinician's eye a valid and reproducible tool for diagnosing patella alta on a lateral knee radiography? [^1acf68ef]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Patella alta (PA) or high-riding patella refers to a condition where the position of the patella is high in relation to the femur, femoral trochlea, or tibia, determined on a lateral radiography (radiograph). It may be present in the acute setting after patellar tendon ruptures, as a normal condition in asymptomatic patients or result in anterior knee pain after recurrent patellar dislocations, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and chondromalacia patellae.

More than 10 radiographic ratios have been described to estimate patellar height on a lateral knee radiograph. Direct measures are those ratios that estimate patellar height in relation to the femur, whereas indirect measures assess patellar height in relation to the tibia. The indirect more frequently used ratios are the Insall-Salvati (IS), modified Insall-Salvati (mIS), and Caton-Deschamps (C-D), but the literature is not clear to determine which method is considered the benchmark for diagnosis of PA. A wide range of definitions, measurements and cutoff values, anatomic variants, and nonstandardized radiographic protocols makes it difficult to define which ratio is more precise. This in addition to the fact that most of these measurements are time consuming. Knee surgeons and radiologists frequently use their clinician's eye (CE) as a subjective visual appreciation to rule out PA before objectively measuring the patellar height. This method has not been reported nor compared with other conventional radiographic ratios (CRRs), and therefore, its validity and reproducibility are unknown in the literature.

### What imaging-detected pathologies are associated with shoulder symptoms and their persistence? A systematic literature review [^9ec365c6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Systematic literature search and selection

Following exclusion of duplicates, 4,383 articles were included, of which 119 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were screened. In total, 56 articles were included (41 cross‐sectional, 11 cohort, 4 case–control). Imaging modalities included 25 ultrasound 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 24 MRI 15, 16, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 12 radiographs 27, 30, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 3 bone scintigraphy 65, 71, 72, 2 PET 73, 74, and no computed tomography. Of these studies, 10 assessed associations with 2 imaging modalities (16, 27, 30, 41, 44, 49, 53, 55, 62, 65). Most studies included both sexes; 8 studies did not state the sex ratio involved 35, 38, 41, 59, 62, 65, 71, 74, and 1 included males only 34. The nomenclature for defining imaging pathologies varied between studies, and there was no standardized way of defining pathology (see Supplementary Table 3, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at). There was heterogeneity between study populations.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part II. differential diagnosis [^2ed31357]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain. Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### Doppler ultrasound and tibial tuberosity maturation status predicts pain in adolescent male athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease: a case series with comparison group and clinical interpretation [^dc655172]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In adolescents, the patellar ligament has been shown to attach not only on the developing tibial tubercle but also to broaden out to its attachment beyond the adjacent perichondrium of the physis and the periosteum of the adjacent metaphysic. This anatomical attachment may result in the ATT being submitted to either traction, but mainly compressive forces. Compression can be either a chronic micro repetitive load or a unique traumatic event such as a fall on the knee — a common history described by symptomatic subjects.

This hypothesis may also help explain the success of complete rest (knee joint immobilisation) in the treatment of OSD. The decrease of compression load may reduce the VEGF production and could prevent the neo-vessel invasion of the tendon. We suggest that clinically this may infer stage 2 cases require complete rest whereas stages 3 and 4 can be managed with training load modification only.

This series has shown that Doppler ultrasound scan and clinical examination could be helpful for the practitioner in the management and diagnosis of OSD.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^bbff135e]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Use of imaging in COVID-19 — scope and modality considerations — states that the guidance "focuses exclusively on the use of the chest radiography and CT of the thorax." It notes that "Chest radiography is insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection," yet "In hospitalized patients, chest radiography can be useful for assessing disease progression and alternative diagnoses (eg, lobar pneumonia suggestive of bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion)," with portability that "may favor chest radiography… particularly in environments lacking PPE." Conversely, "CT is more sensitive for early parenchymal lung disease, disease progression, and alternative diagnoses."

### Prevalence of abnormalities and normal variants in the adolescent knee on MRI in a population-based cohort of 3800 knees [^0a2494cd]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abnormalities and normal variants of the knee are common in adolescents. We found that bone marrow edema is common in adolescents, especially in boys and those with a lower BMI, and that osteochondritis dissecans is more prevalent than previously thought. We also found that Osgood-Schlatter disease and osteochondritis dissecans are more common in boys and discoid menisci are more often found in adolescents with a non-Western ethnicity and a higher BMI-SD. Some of the abnormalities that are found can have consequences for a child's future, whereas others can be considered incidental findings. More research is needed to correlate the abnormalities found to pain and other symptoms to determine their clinical relevance.

### Patellofemoral pain [^0b3717ff]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain — differential diagnosis and screening: Clinicians should refer to the hip pain and mobility deficits — hip OA CPG to determine the presence of hip OA when hip OA has been reported to present with a primary complaint of knee pain, and should use information from the patient's age, history, provocative activities, and physical examination test results to screen for the presence of other possible causes of AKP including patellar tendinopathy, patellar subluxation or dislocation (instability), tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion), and patellar apophysitis (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease). Persons with iliotibial band syndrome often present with tenderness and localized swelling over the lateral femoral epicondyle that is provoked by palpation of the lateral femoral epicondyle. Pain from patellar tendinopathy is typically localized to the inferior pole of the patella or near the tibial tubercle, may be differentiated from PFP by pain located over the patellar tendon, tenderness to palpation of the patellar tendon, and symptom response, and is aggravated by activities that require higher rates of knee extensor loading, such as jumping or high-speed sprinting. Clinicians should refer to the consensus statement written by the international patellofemoral osteoarthritis consortium for clinical symptoms and signs to screen for the presence of PFOA. Anterior knee pain in children may be due to apophysitis of the tibial tubercle or the inferior pole of the patella, and clinicians should use the patient's age and the presence of tenderness to palpation over these sites to determine the presence of these conditions.

### Osteochondritis dissecans and osgood schlatter disease in a family with Stickler syndrome [^29ec2ea1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Hoornaert et al observed (OCD) in three families who manifested features of R519C COL2A1 genotype. They considered these mutations are of diagnostic relevance in which some of these mutations seem to cause unusual phenotypes such as Stickler syndrome. Liberfarb et al evaluated a cohort of clinically diagnosed Stickler syndrome for which the causative mutation has been identified. They concluded that the molecular determination of a mutation could predict the occurrence of Stickler syndrome, but it was difficult to predict the severity of the phenotype on the basis of genotype.

Osgood Schlatter syndrome (OSS), or tibial osteochondrosis, is the most common traction apophysitis and overuse injury in the knee of adolescent athletes. The condition is caused by multiple submaximal avulsion fractures of the patellar tendon attachment to the tibial tubercle, when the tibial tubercle is in the apophyseal stage and the secondary ossification center has appeared. The aetiology of (OSS) also remains controversial.

### Doppler ultrasound and tibial tuberosity maturation status predicts pain in adolescent male athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease: a case series with comparison group and clinical interpretation [^0f199cb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study has demonstrated significantly lower levels of pain in subjects with later (stages 3 and 4) maturation of their ATT. The magnitude of the VAS difference demonstrated here is considered to be clinically meaningful as it exceeds a 33% change. We suggest that documentation of the maturation status is clinically useful in determining the levels of pain likely encountered in symptomatic OSD.

In this series no subject reported symptoms of OSD at stage 1. It is unknown as to whether symptoms can arise with this maturation stage; however, we speculate that stage 2 could be the critical stage of development where the likelihood of symptomatic OSD is heightened. We suggest that the described modification of Ducher et al 'sstaging system is warranted as this cohort has shown no painful subjects in stage 1, and a majority in stage 2. In Ducher et al 'sclassification system, all of these subjects would have been classified as stage 1.

Radiographic examination of Patient 1 (figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Orthopaedic treatment was primarily planned upon non-surgical intervention. These measures were initially successful, but later on pain recurs. It is highly likely that we might proceed with a mosaic arthroplasty, as a treatment of choice.

Patient 2

Patient 2 is a 49-year-old-woman the aunt of patient 1, manifested a marfanoid habitus, with a height of 178 cm (above 97 th. percentile). Craniofacially she exhibited prominent eyes (proptosis), epicanthal folds, small nose, flat nasal bridge, long philtrum, cleft uvula, and micrognathia. No history of hearing loss, but early childhood astigmatism was the main ophthalmological problem. Musculoskeletal examination showed relative generalised articular stiffness with features of multiple joint pain. Thoracic spine kyphosis in connection with Scheuermann's adolescent kyphosis (osteochondritis of the upper and lower cartilaginous vertebral end plates) associated with marked stiffness.

She developed pain in her knees at the age of 12 years. Pain worsened after sporting activities, which involved jumping and or running. Osgood-Schlatter syndrome was recognised. The patient was advised to restrict her activities. Oral anti-inflammatory medication, knee padding, and physical therapy associated with special exercises to improve the flexibility of the surrounding muscles were recommended. Symptoms, however, continued unabated into adulthood. At the age of 16 years prominent tibial tuberosity were apparent in the lateral view of the knees (fig 7). Tibial sequestrectomy associated with insertion of bone pegs was performed successfully at the age of 20 years. Weight-bearing joint pain over the hips, knees and ankle is still a dilemma for this patient. Nevertheless, weakness of the quadriceps muscles persisted after the operation.

This article describes the use of acupuncture in the management of knee pain in Osgood-Schlatter disease. Manual and electroacupuncture were used. The patient responded well to acupuncture and found it effective in relieving his knee pain.

### Increased posterior tibial slope in patients with Osgood-Schlatter disease: a new association [^64013581]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) is a traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle caused by repetitive strain and chronic avulsion from the patellar tendon. No widely accepted anatomic risk factors have been associated with OSD.

Purpose

To determine if OSD is associated with increased posterior tibial slope (PTS).

Study Design

Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Forty knees with OSD and 32 control knees examined by the senior author between 2008 and 2019 were included. Patients 10 to 15 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of OSD and available lateral radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were eligible. Age- and sex-matched patients with a history of knee pain but no evidence of OSD on clinical examination and without significant pathology on lateral radiograph and MRI were included in the control group. PTS was defined as the angle between a reference line perpendicular to the proximal anatomic axis and a line drawn tangent to the uppermost anterior and posterior edges of the medial tibial plateau. Measurements were carried out in duplicate on true lateral radiographs by 2 blinded investigators. Interrater reliability of PTS measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The independent samples t test was used to compare PTS between the OSD and control knees.

Results

The mean age was 12.6 ± 1.6 years and 51% (37/72) of the knees were from male youth. There were no differences in age, sex, and laterality of knees between the OSD and control groups. The mean PTS was significantly higher in the OSD group (12.23° ± 3.58°) compared with the control group (8.82° ± 2.76°; P < .001). The ICC was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.890–0.957), indicating almost perfect interrater reliability.

Conclusion

This study identifies an association between OSD and increased PTS. The clinical implications of this finding have not yet been elucidated. It may be speculated that in patients with OSD, stress from the extensor mechanism through the patellar tendon loads the anterior portion of the tibia disproportionately to the posterior segment, thereby resulting in asymmetric growth and an increased PTS.

### Prevalence of abnormalities and normal variants in the adolescent knee on MRI in a population-based cohort of 3800 knees [^35cdf46c]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Associations Between Abnormalities and Normal Variants and Participant Characteristics

Associations between abnormalities and normal variants and participant characteristics are presented in Table 3. The participants with bone marrow edema were more often boys (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69–3.52). Signs of Osgood-Schlatter disease and osteochondritis dissecans were also more often seen in boys (OR, 4.21 [95% CI, 2.01–8.85] and OR, 13.18 [95% CI, 1.71–101.58], respectively). Those with bone marrow edema were also more likely to have a lower BMI-SD (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.98). Discoid menisci were associated with a non-Western ethnicity (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.07–3.96), being overweight or obese (OR, 6.44; 95% CI, 3.32–12.50), greater weight (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03–1.07), lower height (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.98), and higher BMI-SD (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.76–3.11).

### Radiologic investigation of rheumatic diseases [^3cc5ff8b]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Extensive evidence now supports the increasing role of all the cross-sectional imaging modalities, but especially MRI and sonography, in investigating rheumatic disease. CT plays a more limited role because of its need for radiation and its relatively poorer soft tissue contrast. MRI provides exquisite detail of all joint and periarticular soft tissues, which can be used to provide earlier and more accurate diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory arthritides. The application of these techniques should enable better-targeted therapy and evaluation of potential complications.

### Increased patellar volume / width and decreased femoral trochlear width are associated with adolescent patellofemoral pain [^52bc2b8a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain is one of the most common forms of knee arthralgia in adolescent females. Unlike in adults, in whom the etiology of patellofemoral pain is considered to be multifactorial (eg, altered bone shape and musculoskeletal dynamics), the etiology of adolescent patellofemoral pain has been historically attributed to overuse. Although it is highly plausible that adolescent patellofemoral pain results from excessive maltracking, as suggested by recent research, an increase in patellar, relative to femoral, size could also contribute to patellofemoral pain through altered cartilage stresses/strains, resulting in overloading of the subchondral bone. Because the role of bone morphology in the genesis of patellofemoral pain in adolescent females remains largely unknown, research is needed in this area to improve our understanding of patellofemoral pain and advance diagnosis/treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are patellar volume and width increased, and femoral trochlear width decreased, in female adolescents with patellofemoral pain compared with asymptomatic females? (2) Are measures of patellofemoral size correlated with patellofemoral tracking?

Methods

Twenty adolescent females with patellofemoral pain (age, 13.7 ± 1.3 years) and 20 asymptomatic female control participants (age, 13.6 ± 1.3 years) were enrolled in this case-control institutional review board-approved study. This study focused on a strict definition of patellofemoral pain, peripatellar pain in the absence of other structural pathologic conditions (eg, tendinitis, ligament injury, Osgood-Schlatter disease) or a history of dislocations/trauma. Control participants with no history of patellofemoral pain or other lower extremity pathology were matched for age (within 6 months) and body mass index (within 5 kg/m). Participants self-referred and were recruited through clinicaltrails.gov, printed advertisements, and word of mouth. Three-dimensional (3-D), static, T1-weighted, gradient recalled echo MR images were acquired, from which 3-D patellofemoral models were created. Patellar volume and width, patellar-to-femoral volume and width ratios, and femoral trochlear width were compared across cohorts. In addition, 3-D patellofemoral tracking was quantified from dynamic MR images captured during cyclical flexion-extension volitional movements of the lower extremity. The size measures and ratios were correlated to patellofemoral tracking.

Results

Compared with control participants, the cohort with patellofemoral pain had greater patellar volume (13,792 ± 2256 versus 11,930 ± 1902 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1336 mm; p = 0.004; d = 0.89) and width (38.4 ± 3.0 versus 36.5 ± 2.7 mm; 95% CI, 1.8 mm; p = 0.021; d = 0.67). The femoral trochlear width was smaller (32.0 ± 1.8 versus 32.9 ± 1.8 mm; p = 0.043, d = 0.54). The patellar-to-femoral volume ratio and the patellar-to-trochlear width ratio were greater in adolescents with patellofemoral pain (0.15 ± 0.02 versus 0.13 ± 0.01, p = 0.006, d = 0.83 and 1.20 ± 0.09 versus 1.11 ± 0.09, p = 0.001, d = 1.02). No correlations were found between patellar size and patellofemoral tracking (r < 0.375, p > 0.103).

Conclusions

In adolescent females with patellofemoral pain, the increased patellar volume/width and patellar-to-trochlear width ratio, along with the decreased femoral trochlear width, may initiate a pathway to pain through improper engagement of the patella within the femoral trochlea. Specifically, the mean differences between cohorts in patellar and femoral trochlear width (1.9 mm and 0.9 mm) are 58% and 37% of the mean patellar and femoral cartilage thickness in females, respectively, as reported in the literature. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of pain.

### Development and evaluation of a new semi-quantitative and morphometric scoring system for magnetic resonance imaging in adolescents with osgood schlatter disease (the OSIS score) [^365a60d9]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osgood Schlatter Disease (OSD) is a common injury in adolescents. A recent systematic review identified multiple tissue characteristics evaluated in imaging studies, but the studies used different imaging modalities, used varying MRI protocols and were of poor study quality, which led to conflicting findings and hamper the clinical utility of MRI scans. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the reliability of a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system for use in adolescents with OSD.

Materials and Methods

Based on a systematic review, we used an expert-led process to develop a scoring list to describe soft tissues, cartilage, bone, and morphometric characteristics in adolescents with OSD. 1.5 T MRI was performed on the most symptomatic knee in adolescents with OSD. A trained radiologist and a research trainee each assessed 10 cases twice to assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the scoring list.

Results

The final 18 item scoring list included an assessment of the patellar tendon, infrapatellar bursa, cartilage, and the tibial epiphysis, metaphysis, and tibial tuberosity, which were scored by signal intensity, degree, and signal homogeneity. Patellar height, patella morphology, patellar tendon attachment, and tendon thickness and width were quantified. Ten adolescents with OSD (13.2 ± 1.1, 30% female) were included for reliability. Most features showed good to very good (κ and ICC > 0.6) reliability. The exceptions were intra-rater reliability for superficial bursa homogeneity (κ = 0.51) and inter-rater reliability for signal degree in the patellar tendon (κ = 0.55), tibial epiphysis (κ = 0.53) and tibial tuberosity (κ = 0.52) and patella morphology ratio (ICC: -0.16, p = 0.67. Reliability for patella height and patellar tendon width had the highest reliability (intra-rater ICC (0.75–0.98); inter-rater ICC (0.48–0.93)).

Conclusion

This semi-quantitative scoring system for MRI allows the comprehensive and reliable assessment of features relevant for evaluating affected tissues in adolescent patients with OSD.

### Van neck-odelberg disease: a common but poorly known and often misdiagnosed condition [^44eddfcd]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

van Neck-Odelberg disease, a condition involving the ischiopubic synchondrosis in children, is a commonly encountered but poorly known ailment, which is now considered a normal variant. Symptoms can include pain, discomfort, and fever, leading to van Neck-Odelberg disease often being discovered in the context of patients presenting with non-specific clinical manifestations. In this essay, we describe what is currently known about van Neck-Odelberg disease and illustrate the condition using images acquired from multiple patients, with some using multiple imaging techniques from the same patients. Awareness of van Neck-Odelberg disease is essential for radiologists who are involved in the treatment of children, as well as for paediatricians, to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary invasive procedures for what is a benign and self-resolving condition.

### Imaging of osteochondritis dissecans [^dc928097]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a localized process that affects the subchondral bone and can progress to the overlying articular cartilage. The cause of this lesion remains elusive. With the vague clinical symptoms and signs of OCD, imaging plays a vital role in making the diagnosis and helping with the prognosis of OCD lesions. This article reviews current imaging modalities for the assessment of OCD including conventional radiography, nuclear medicine, computed tomography (CT), CT arthrography, magnetic resonance (MR) and MR arthrography. The role of imaging in evaluating healing of the OCD and articular congruity after surgical and nonsurgical management is discussed.

OBJECTIVE. Sesamoids and accessory ossicles are frequently encountered normal osseous structures in the foot that may be an uncommon cause of pain. Familiarity with their imaging findings allows the radiologist to provide reassurance in normal cases and increase confidence when making the relatively uncommon diagnosis of a pathologic sesamoid or symptomatic ossicle. CONCLUSION. Image-guided injections targeted to the symptomatic ossicle can confirm the suspected diagnosis and predict therapeutic outcomes before surgical intervention.

### Doppler ultrasound and tibial tuberosity maturation status predicts pain in adolescent male athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease: a case series with comparison group and clinical interpretation [^b2ae6765]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osgood-Schlatter's disease (OSD) was first described in the early 1900sand is now classified as an apophysitis of the anterior aspect of the tibial tuberosity (ATT). It is a common condition in an active youth populationand is said to be responsible for a significant number of days lost from training and competition.OSD occurs during the early adolescent period which is a critical phase of any long-term athlete development plan, and therefore such a condition which incurs significant time loss from training and competition can adversely affect the ultimate performance level.

The pathogenesis of this growth-related condition is still debated. The diagnosis is essentially clinical but radiology is often used for confirmation. Based on x-ray, ultrasoundand MRIinvestigations, different aetiologies have been developed. The initial hypothesis described the repetitive traction of the patellar tendon on the distal insertion as the main area of secondary ossification centre fragmentation and transitory necrosis. This fragmentation has been questioned as a definitive sign of OSD and has subsequently been seen as a normal development of the ATT. Fragmentation of the ATT is found in symptomatic as well as asymptomatic knees and therefore cannot be used to discriminate between the normal and abnormal pathology. Subsequent to these studies, Ducher et al developed a maturation staging of the ATT using ultrasonography. Three developmental stages are described, principally in asymptomatic subjects. In Ducher's classification, stage 1 is delineated as a cartilage attachment, initially without, and subsequently with ossicles. Stage 2 demonstrates insertional cartilage, and stage 3 is a mature attachment. Relatively recently, it has been suggested that the presence of neo-vessels in and/or around a symptomatic tendon, as demonstrated by a Doppler-positive ultrasound, could be a hallmark feature of a pathological tendon. It is unknown if such changes are present in the presumed pathological tendon insertion seen in OSD, nor the relation of Doppler-positive changes to pain on clinical examination.

It is proposed that examining both symptomatic and asymptomatic knees of OSD sufferers to ascertain the maturation status, as described by Ducher et al and the presence of neo-vessels as indicated by Doppler ultrasound could shed light on the pathogenesis and provide clinical insight into the management of this troubling and common condition.

### The role of MRI in diagnosing and managing tracheal diverticulum [^0ec0df7b]. Academic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Multidetector CT is the best imaging method to diagnose tracheal diverticulum (TD) till now. MRI characteristics of this disease is not reported before. The study report 5 cases of TD, intend to discuss the role of MRI in diagnosing and managing tracheal diverticulum (TD).

Materials and Methods

Five cases of TD (include 4 cases of uninfected TD and 1 case of infected TD) with complete CT and MR imaging data were collected and analyzed to compare MR and CT imaging features(location/size/wall/channel) of the disease. The role of MRI in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of infected TD was also discussed.

Results

All cases were located in the right posterolateral region of the trachea at the level between the T1 and T3 vertebrae. MRI was better in showing the wall of TD, and inferior to showing the channel (between TD and the tracheal) than CT. The diameter measured in MR images was longer than measured in CT image. MRI had equal capacity with CT in accurately display the location of the disease. MRI sensitively showed the absorption of infected TD.

Conclusion

MRI is helpful in diagnosing TD, especially infected TD. The sign that local thickening and signal increasing of tracheal wall observed on MR images means that a paratracheal abscess may originate from TD. MRI plays an important role in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of infected TD.

### Rehabilitation of avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity following Osgood-Schlatter disease [^a5c995bc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

A sixteen-year-old boy suffered from sharp pain in the knee during a jump while playing basketball. He had a positive history of Osgood Schlatter disease. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity Type III according to the classification of Watson-Jones. Rehabilitation after avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity is an important consideration for this relatively uncommon adolescent injury. In such avulsion fractures, landing on the ground with the knee fully extended after a jump is the most likely cause. This case report reviews the rehabilitation program, and selected functional outcome measures after rehabilitation are reported. The patient returned to sporting activity after 12 months.

### ESR essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of thoracic imaging [^d6f76804]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs) represent a subgroup of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), which can progress over time and carry a poor prognosis. Imaging has increased diagnostic discrimination in the evaluation of FLDs. International guidelines have stated the role of radiologists in the diagnosis and management of FLDs, in the context of the interdisciplinary discussion. Chest computed tomography (CT) with high-resolution technique is recommended to correctly recognise signs, patterns, and distribution of individual FLDs. Radiologists may be the first to recognise the presence of previously unknown interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) in various settings. A systematic approach to CT images may lead to a non-invasive diagnosis of FLDs. Careful comparison of serial CT exams is crucial in determining either disease progression or supervening complications. This 'Essentials' aims to provide radiologists a concise and practical approach to FLDs, focusing on CT technical requirements, pattern recognition, and assessment of disease progression and complications. Hot topics such as ILAs and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) are also discussed.

Key Points

Chest CT with high-resolution technique is the recommended imaging modality to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis.
CT pattern recognition is central for an accurate diagnosis of fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs) by interdisciplinary discussion.
Radiologists are to evaluate disease behaviour by accurately comparing serial CT scans.

### Diseases involving the lung peribronchovascular region: a CT imaging pathologic classification [^304d66cd]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Chest CT imaging holds a major role in the diagnosis of lung diseases, many of which affect the peribronchovascular region. Identification and categorization of peribronchovascular abnormalities on CT imaging can assist in formulating a differential diagnosis and directing further diagnostic evaluation.

Review Findings

The peribronchovascular region of the lung encompasses the pulmonary arteries, airways, and lung interstitium. Understanding disease processes associated with structures of the peribronchovascular region and their appearances on CT imaging aids in prompt diagnosis. This article reviews current knowledge in anatomic and pathologic features of the lung interstitium composed of intercommunicating prelymphatic spaces, lymphatics, collagen bundles, lymph nodes, and bronchial arteries; diffuse lung diseases that present in a peribronchovascular distribution; and an approach to classifying diseases according to patterns of imaging presentations. Lung peribronchovascular diseases can appear on CT imaging as diffuse thickening, fibrosis, masses or masslike consolidation, ground-glass or air space consolidation, and cysts, acknowledging that some diseases may have multiple presentations.

Summary

A category approach to peribronchovascular diseases on CT imaging can be integrated with clinical features as part of a multidisciplinary approach for disease diagnosis.

### Long-term functional and sonographic outcomes in Osgood-Schlatter disease [^0ee6a3de]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the sonographic characteristics, functional aspects and life quality of a group of adolescent patients 2 years after having been diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter disease and compare them with an age-matched healthy control group.

Methods

The study was conducted on eighteen Osgood-Schlatter patients with unilateral involvement and 14 age-matched healthy controls. The Flaviis classification and patellar tendon characteristics were observed using a GE Logiq 9 scanner. Broad and vertical jump tests were used for jumping performance. The coordination, proprioception, strength and endurance functions were assessed with the Functional Squat System. For the quality of life, the SF-36 questionnaire was used. The Wilcoxon test for the patients' initial and second-year assessment and Mann-Whitney U test for the comparison between the patient and control groups were used.

Results

By the end of second year, 38.9% of the patients had totally recovered. The patellar tendon lengthened, distal diameter and distal area of the tendon had lessened, and no significant difference was observed between patient and control groups (n.s). Improvements were detected for the bilateral broad jump test scores, the quality of life and coordination of the patients after 2 years (p < 0.05). The average power of endurance and the total work of strength were significantly higher in control group (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

According to the sonography results 2 years after diagnosis, nearly half of the patients had totally recovered. Coordination was the only parameter that improved over the 2-year period. The patient group strength and endurance function remained lower than the control group.

### Doppler ultrasound and tibial tuberosity maturation status predicts pain in adolescent male athletes with Osgood-Schlatter's disease: a case series with comparison group and clinical interpretation [^9589cfab]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methodology

Cohort

A prospective analysis was carried out from April 2010 until May 2011 on a consecutive series of 20 symptomatic adolescent male students who were all attending a Middle Eastern Sports Academy. The group consisted of 17 soccer players, two squash players and one middle distance athlete (mean age 13.8 years (SD 1.37), range 12.2–16.3). Both knees were assessed for all athletes and comparison was made between the two limbs. In total, 15 athletes complained of unilateral symptoms and seven bilateral symptoms (two recurrences). Of the original group of 20 athletes, five had at least one reassessment due to a recurrence of symptoms after initial discharge from care. A comparison group of 68 asymptomatic knees in 35 athletic adolescent men attending the same Academy were scanned (12.4 years (2.65), 9.5–17.1) and independently rated and clinically assessed in the same manner as the clinical group.

The inclusion criterion to be part of the OSD group was the inability to continue their physical activities due to anterior knee pain. History of onset could be either progressive or acute following a direct trauma on the ATT. Pain had to be localised at the ATT site that increased by palpation, and resisted isometric knee extension. Criteria of exclusion were knee effusion, patella instability, femoro-patellar syndrome and Sinding Larsen disease.

Consent for investigation was given by the parents or guardians, and the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.

Clinical investigation

All athletes were clinically assessed using the same subjective and objective criteria. Subjective criteria included a history of any anterior knee pain inferior to the patella. Subjects were asked regarding daily and sporting activity which provoked this particular pain, as well as their estimate of the level of this pain on a 0–100 point visual analogue pain scale (VAS) with 0 signifying no pain and discomfort and 100 extreme pain and discomfort.

During the standardised physical examination, palpation of the tibial tuberosity was carried out and discomfort levels measured using a VAS. A resisted contraction of the extensor mechanism was carried out in a prone position with the knee at 90° of flexion with the subject reporting the VAS. A single leg squat with arms folded across the chest was carried out as a functional test with the VAS recorded. All physical examination was conducted by the same experienced medical practitioner.

This new molecular entity has recommended indications for use with magnetic resonance imaging to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system and the body. The recommended patient population is children 2 years of age and older and adults, and the recommended dose is 0. 05 mmol/kg body weight administered as an intravenous bolus. These trials were considered mutually supportive for visualization claims in both anatomic regions. The Applicant also conducted a pharmacokinetic study in patients aged 2 years to 17 years that served as a basis for extrapolation of effectiveness to this population of pediatric patients.

Lesion visualization indications are shared among all previously approved macrocyclic GBCAs and are generally considered to have inherent clinical utility. In the large majority of routine clinical MRI studies, T2 changes caused by GBCAs are difficult to detect and only T1 relaxivity, is relevant. Contrast is generally seen as increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images. While relaxivity measurements vary with experimental conditions, it is generally expected that at the same concentration, a GBCA with higher relaxivity will appear brighter on T1-weighted images. Although no specific data quality issues were suspected, because GDX-44-010 and GDX-44-011 provided the primary effectiveness and safety results for this NME application, an Office of Scientific Investigations audit of these studies was requested.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^bb366f65]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Bursitis

There are multiple bursas around the knee. Bursa are synovial lined structures that provide a low-friction interface between tissues to provide smooth motion. Bursitis, inflammation of the bursa, can be secondary to repetitive microtrauma from overuse, direct trauma, autoimmune disease including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or infection. Prepatellar bursitis is the most common bursitis of the knee, presenting with anterior knee pain and swelling. Infrapatellar bursitis may also cause anterior knee pain mimicking patellar tendinopathy but can be diagnosed by careful palpation for localized tenderness. In both conditions it is important to differentiate fluid in the bursa from intraarticular effusion. Treatment includes local cryotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID's) and avoidance of further direct trauma to the bursa. If there are any signs of septic bursitis the bursa should be aspirated and appropriate antibiotics prescribed.

Inflammatory disorders

Oligoarticular JIA often presents with monoarticular knee arthritis. Children may present with anterior knee pain but the typical history of morning stiffness, gradual resolution of pain with activity and clinical exam findings usually allow the practitioner to make the correct diagnosis. A complete joint and systemic examination to exclude other joint involvement is important as is screening for asymptomatic uveitis associated with JIA.

The JIA subtype, Enthesitis Related Arthritis, is unique in that it is more common in school-age boys, is frequently associated with the genetic marker HLA-B27 and inflammation of the entheses may be a prominent finding. Enthesitis (inflammation at the attachment of tendons, ligaments and fascia to bone with characteristic pain on palpation) around the knee may be confused with Osgood's Schlatter or Sinding-Larsen Johannsen disease. Enthesitis is usually associated with arthritis and symptoms are more prominent in the morning, which helps to differentiate it from the osteochondroses and traction apophysitis group.

Treatment of arthritis includes physiotherapy for improving range of motion and strength, NSAID's and potentially local intra-articular corticosteroid injection or disease modifying anti-rheumatic therapy. All children and adolescents suspected of having JIA or other chronic inflammatory arthritis should be referred to a pediatric rheumatologist.

Imaging in the crystal arthropathies has undergone great advances in the past decade, with newer techniques having additional benefits for assisting diagnosis, predicting prognosis, and monitoring the treatment of these conditions. Three-dimensional digitized modalities such as computed tomography, dual-energy computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer a multislice view of any anatomic region. Both ultrasonography and MRI reveal features of inflammation and joint damage in all crystal arthropathies, and can be used to monitor the inflammatory response to therapy.

Imaging studies in chILD syndrome — role of CXR and CT: "CXRs are usually the first imaging study performed in chILD syndrome," and "They rarely provide a specific chILD diagnosis, but they are frequently abnormal, and may identify diseases that mimic chILD syndrome." "CT defines the presence, extent, and pattern of lung disease," which "may aid diagnosis, identify a site for biopsy, and help monitor the disease." "Radiation dosing tailored to neonates and infants permits dramatic reductions in radiation exposure," and "HRCT further reduces" exposure.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^982e4dbc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Our 2020 edition of this review showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive and moderately specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this update, we include new relevant studies, and have removed studies with case-control designs, and those not intended to be diagnostic test accuracy studies.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19.

Search Methods

We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 30 September 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19 and that reported estimates of test accuracy or provided data from which we could compute estimates.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently and in duplicate screened articles, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list. We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and we summarised pooled estimates in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented the uncertainty of accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 19,775 participants suspected of having COVID-19, of whom 10,155 (51%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Forty-seven studies evaluated one imaging modality each, and four studies evaluated two imaging modalities each. All studies used RT-PCR as the reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, with 47 studies using only RT-PCR and four studies using a combination of RT-PCR and other criteria (such as clinical signs, imaging tests, positive contacts, and follow-up phone calls) as the reference standard. Studies were conducted in Europe (33), Asia (13), North America (3) and South America (2); including only adults (26), all ages (21), children only (1), adults over 70 years (1), and unclear (2); in inpatients (2), outpatients (32), and setting unclear (17). Risk of bias was high or unclear in thirty-two (63%) studies with respect to participant selection, 40 (78%) studies with respect to reference standard, 30 (59%) studies with respect to index test, and 24 (47%) studies with respect to participant flow. For chest CT (41 studies, 16,133 participants, 8110 (50%) cases), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 25.4% to 97.4%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 87.9% (95% CI 84.6 to 90.6) and the pooled specificity was 80.0% (95% CI 74.9 to 84.3). There was no statistical evidence indicating that reference standard conduct and definition for index test positivity were sources of heterogeneity for CT studies. Nine chest CT studies (2807 participants, 1139 (41%) cases) used the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) scoring system, which has five thresholds to define index test positivity. At a CO-RADS threshold of 5 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 41.5% to 77.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 67.0% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.2); the specificity ranged from 83.5% to 96.2%; and the pooled specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.6 to 94.0). At a CO-RADS threshold of 4 (7 studies), the sensitivity ranged from 56.3% to 92.9% and the pooled sensitivity was 83.5% (95% CI 74.4 to 89.7); the specificity ranged from 77.2% to 90.4% and the pooled specificity was 83.6% (95% CI 80.5 to 86.4). For chest X-ray (9 studies, 3694 participants, 2111 (57%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 51.9% to 94.4% and specificity ranged from 40.4% to 88.9%. The pooled sensitivity of chest X-ray was 80.6% (95% CI 69.1 to 88.6) and the pooled specificity was 71.5% (95% CI 59.8 to 80.8). For ultrasound of the lungs (5 studies, 446 participants, 211 (47%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 68.2% to 96.8% and specificity ranged from 21.3% to 78.9%. The pooled sensitivity of ultrasound was 86.4% (95% CI 72.7 to 93.9) and the pooled specificity was 54.6% (95% CI 35.3 to 72.6). Based on an indirect comparison using all included studies, chest CT had a higher specificity than ultrasound. For indirect comparisons of chest CT and chest X-ray, or chest X-ray and ultrasound, the data did not show differences in specificity or sensitivity.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Ultrasound is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, chest CT and ultrasound may have more utility for excluding COVID-19 than for differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest in the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices.

### Chest CT signs in pulmonary disease: a pictorial review [^4d5c0eb7]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

CT scanning of the chest is one of the most important imaging modalities available to a pulmonologist. The advent of high-resolution CT scanning of the chest has led to its increasing use. Although chest radiographs are still useful as an initial test, their utility is limited in the diagnosis of lung diseases that depend on higher resolution images such as interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary vascular diseases. Several metaphoric chest CT scan signs have been described linking abnormal imaging patterns to lung diseases. Some of these are specific to a disease, whereas others help narrow the differential diagnosis. Recognizing these imaging patterns and CT scan signs are thus vitally important. In the present article, we describe a comprehensive list of the commonly encountered metaphoric chest CT scan signs and their clinical relevance.

### Imaging in osteoarthritis [^05662b39]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

With technologic advances and the availability of sophisticated computer software and analytical strategies, imaging plays an increasingly important role in understanding the disease process of osteoarthritis (OA). Radiography has limitations in that it can visualize only limited features of OA, such as osteophytes and joint space narrowing, but remains the most commonly used modality for establishing an imaging-based diagnosis of OA. This article describes the roles and limitations of different imaging modalities and discusses the optimum imaging protocol, imaging diagnostic criteria of OA, differential diagnoses, and what the referring physician needs to know.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^3d1f8c62]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Use of imaging in COVID-19 — chest radiography and CT of the thorax — is guided by clinical actionability balanced against risks and resource constraints. "The value of an imaging test relates to the generation of results that are clinically actionable either for establishing a diagnosis or for guiding management, triage, or therapy," yet this value "is diminished by costs that include the risk of radiation exposure to the patient, risk of COVID-19 transmission to uninfected health care workers and other patients, consumption of PPE, and need for cleaning and downtime of radiology rooms in resource-constrained environments." The statement "focuses exclusively on the use of chest radiography and CT of the thorax," noting that "Although US has been suggested as a potential triage and diagnostic tool for COVID-19… there is limited experience at this time… as well as infection control issues." Chest radiography "is insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection," but in hospitalized patients "can be useful for assessing disease progression and alternative diagnoses (eg, lobar pneumonia suggestive of bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion)," and portability "may favor chest radiography… effectively eliminating the risk of COVID-19 transmission… particularly in environments lacking PPE." In contrast, "CT is more sensitive for early parenchymal lung disease, disease progression, and alternative diagnoses including acute heart failure from COVID-19 myocardial injury and, when performed with intravenous contrast material, pulmonary thromboembolism."

### A comprehensive review of imaging findings in COVID-19-status in early 2021 [^89606f49]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

A number of professional societies have published recommendations on the role of imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including the European Society of Radiology together with the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESR/ESTI), the Fleischner Society, and the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI). Recommendations concur that the indication for CT imaging should be a matter of the severity of respiratory symptoms of the patients, with consideration of the local prevalence of the disease and the status of health care facilities. CT imaging is not indicated in patients with mild symptoms, but an initial chest radiograph seems appropriate to diagnose the presence and extent of pulmonary opacifications in patients with moderate to severe symptoms. CT should be reserved for high-risk patients or those suspected of having complications or worsening of respiratory status, and for patients in need of expedited case management despite a present lack of definitive RT-PCR results. Typical CT findings for COVID-19 can be hard to distinguish from those with other viral infections (e.g. influenza) or non-infectious diseases (e.g. organizing pneumonia). The accuracy of image interpretation is therefore highly dependent on the local disease prevalence at the time of investigation. Combining CT findings with laboratory findings such as white blood cell count and lymphocytopenia reportedly increases diagnostic accuracy.

In general, one critical aspect in the management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is to need to ensure the safety of non-infectious patients and personnel, not only in radiology departments but also throughout the hospital. Therefore, specific measures are required in order to minimize virus dissemination and contamination of imaging equipment. The American College of Radiology recently emphasized helpful measures.

### Development and validation of the sorting non-trauMatIc adoLescent knEe pain (SMILE) tool-a development and initial validation study [^37c963ef]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Annually, 7% of adolescents visit their general practitioner with musculoskeletal problems. Musculoskeletal problems are one of the most common causes of consultation in this population. Knee pain is common among adolescents and often due to non-traumatic causes. Non-traumatic knee pain is most often the result of repetitive and excessive stress to musculoskeletal structures from sports participation and physical activity. 'The most common types of non-traumatic knee pain during adolescence are Osgood-Schlatter disease and patellofemoral pain '. Despite being less common, Sinding-Larsen Johansson/patellar tendinopathy, Iliotibial band syndrome, and plica syndrome are important differential diagnoses for adolescents with non-traumatic knee pain. In addition to the non-traumatic knee complaints, knee pain can be related to growth also known as benign nocturnal pains of childhood (growing pain), referred pain from the hip or lumbar spine, osteosarcomas, and systemic causes which all are important differential diagnoses.

Non-traumatic knee complaints can be long-lasting, with an impact on health-related quality of life and physical activity. In light of this, the management strategy initiated by the health care practitioner becomes critical to improve long term prognosis. Furthermore, treatment may need to be managed differently related to the specific diagnosis which can be a challenge for medical doctors, due to non-specific symptoms and clinical tests being of limited diagnostic value. Further, qualitative research shows the importance to adolescents of "getting a name" for their knee pain which underlines the need to support the health care practitioner in diagnosing the specific type of knee pain. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a support tool for diagnosing the most common types of non-traumatic adolescent knee pain.

Sensitivity and specificity of MRI-based assessments of the patellar tendon

Indeed, an additional univariate logistic regression analysis revealed a direct association of the predictor variable 'abnormalities of the distal insertion of the patellar tendon' and the clinical indication 'distal patellar tendon complaint' (eg, Osgood-Schlatter disease) as the dependent variable (χ 2 = 29.924, p < 0.001, R 2 Nagelkerke = 0.400, n = 108 and B = 3.878, SE B = 0.850, e B = 48.333, p < 0.001). However, the sensitivity of an MRI-based detection of a 'distal patellar tendon complaint' (ie, a clinically diagnosed Osgood-Schlatter disease) by the MRI finding 'abnormalities of the distal insertion of the patellar tendon' was 0.526, while the specificity revealed to be 0.978 (n = 108; positive: 19; negative: 89 → true positive: 10; false negative: 9; true negative: 87; false positive: 2). For athletes with the clinical indication 'proximal patellar complaint', even no MRI-detected abnormalities were observed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^8eb6f68b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Noncontrast CT (NCCT) is the imaging study of choice for initial evaluation of patients with acute onset of flank pain and suspicion of stone disease without known prior stone disease. NCCT can reliably characterize the location and size of an offending ureteral calculus, identify complications, and diagnose alternative etiologies of abdominal pain. Although less sensitive in the detection of stones, ultrasound may have a role in evaluating for signs of obstruction. Radiography potentially has a role, although has been shown to be less sensitive than NCCT. For patients with known disease and recurrent symptoms of urolithiasis, NCCT remains the test of choice for evaluation. In pregnancy, given radiation concerns, ultrasound is recommended as the initial modality of choice with potential role for noncontrast MRI. In scenarios where stone disease suspected and initial NCCT is inconclusive, contrast-enhanced imaging, either with MRI or CT/CT urogram may be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^6c11ac41]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) imaging — thin-section chest CT to characterize disease is suggested: For patients with chILD syndrome, we suggest thin-section CT scanning of the chest to optimally characterize the nature and distribution of the lung disease (weak recommendation). This recommendation is based on observations that CT scanning is superior to CXR at identifying diffuse lung disease (DLD) and superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in resolution, detecting characteristics of chILD diseases, and correlating with histological findings. Supporting observations include studies finding CT scanning more likely than CXR to accurately identify DLD in children and studies demonstrating CT superiority to MRI in resolution and in identifying ground glass opacity, normal peripheral bronchial, and air trapping in patients with cystic fibrosis. The committee judged that potential benefits such as potentially achieving a definitive diagnosis without lung biopsy, guiding further diagnostic evaluation, and avoiding unnecessary or potentially harmful empiric treatment outweigh downsides including radiation exposure, cost, and burden.

### Healthcare resource use associated with tumor-induced osteomalacia: a literature review [^1990e474]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Investigations, Diagnosis, and Localization

The most commonly reported symptom at presentation was pain (n = 478; 77.0%), followed by weakness (n = 245; 39.5%), a history of fracture(s) (n = 194; 31.2%), and impaired physical function (n = 187; 30.1%) (Table 3). In patients under the age of 18 years (n = 34), lower limb deformities were reported in 10 patients (29.4%), and rickets was reported in 9 patients (26.5%).

Table 3.
Symptoms at presentation, time to TIO diagnosis, and other attributed conditions

The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis (defined as biochemical diagnosis of TIO, and not necessarily tumor localization) was 4.6 years (n = 422; SD: 4.7) (Table 3). Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was highest in India (5.6 years, SD: 6.6), lowest in the Other Asia/Pacific region (including Japan, Australia, and New Zealand; 4.0 years, SD: 3.6) and similar across the American region (4.5 years, SD: 4.7), Europe/Middle East/Africa (4.5 years, SD: 4.4), and China (4.3 years, SD: 3.5).

Other conditions attributed as causes were reported for 69/621 patients (11.1%). In those patients, the most frequent conditions were osteoporosis (n = 14/69; 20.3%), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 8/69; 11.6%), and arthritis/osteoarthritis (n = 7/69; 10.1%) (Table 3). In the 34 patients under the age of 18, there were 5 (14.7%) who had other conditions attributed as a cause of their symptoms, with the following diagnoses made for 1 patient each: transient synovitis, bronchitis, growing pains/bilateral patellofemoral syndrome and bilateral pes planus, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. None of those diagnoses were reported in patients over the age of 18.

### The diagnostic utility of computed tomography for preoperative localization in surgery for hyperparathyroidism [^4ce8ccd6]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Successful unilateral or minimal-access parathyroid exploration and reoperative surgery of the parathyroid glands requires accurate preoperative localization of parathyroid disease. Although ultrasound and nuclear imaging techniques have an established role in this regard, the use of computed tomography (CT) for parathyroid exploration is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to better define the diagnostic utility of CT in preoperative localization of the abnormal gland in surgery for hyperparathyroidism.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

All parathyroid explorations performed at Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR) between 2000 and 2002 were reviewed. The study group was limited to patients with hyperparathyroidism in whom localization failed preoperatively using ultrasound and/or sestamibi scanning and subsequent investigation using CT imaging was performed. Operative, pathological, and imaging reports were then analyzed to assess the accuracy of CT imaging for localizing parathyroid disease.

Results

Twenty-two patients with hyperparathyroidism were investigated preoperatively using CT imaging. Parathyroid exploration was successful in all but one patient, leaving 21 patients in all in the cohort. The majority of cases (67%) were reoperative, and all patients had previously undergone inconclusive ultrasound and/or sestamibi scanning. Computed tomography correctly localized parathyroid disease in 18 (86%) of the 21 patients who underwent successful extirpation of parathyroid disease and was able to identify abnormal glands with equal utility in the neck and the chest.

Conclusion

When ultrasound or sestamibi are unsuccessful, CT imaging can provide valuable preoperative localizing information before surgery for hyperparathyroidism, particularly in patients with recurrent or persistent disease.

### Arthroscopic excision of an ununited ossicle due to Osgood-Schlatter disease [^79e69dc8]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical excision of the ossicles has been suggested for unresolved sequelae of Osgood-Schlatter disease in adults resistant to conservative measures. A 24-year-old, male semiprofessional soccer player had anterior knee pain during sports activity and climbing stairs that had been treated conservatively for 2 years. On physical examination, there was a permanent tibial tubercle with pain. On radiographic examination, an ununited ossicle was seen beneath the patellar tendon. Arthroscopy was performed through the standard low anterolateral and anteromedial portals close to the patellar tendon. Soft tissue at the retropatellar surface and the inflamed infrapatellar fat pad beneath the patellar tendon were debrided with a motorized shaver. Localization of the ununited ossicle was performed by use of an image intensifier. The ossicle was separated from the surrounding soft tissue with a motorized shaver and removed by use of a grasper. After excision of the ossicle, the inflamed surface of the retropatellar tendon was also debrided. The contouring of the irregular surface of the tibial tubercle was performed by use of a motorized bur. After 6 weeks, the patient returned to sports activities without any restrictions. This study showed that all of the described procedures might be done arthroscopically and sports activity may be allowed earlier.

### Advancements in imaging in ChILD [^1a98d2a3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Interstitial and diffuse lung diseases in children constitute a range of congenital and acquired disorders. These disorders present with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease accompanied by diffuse radiographic changes. In many cases, radiographic findings are nonspecific, while in other disorders, chest computed tomography (CT) is diagnostic in the appropriate context. Regardless, chest imaging remains central in the evaluation of the patient with suspected childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Several newly described chILD entities, spanning both genetic and acquired etiologies, have imaging that aid in their diagnoses. Advances in CT scanning technology and CT analysis techniques continue to improve scan quality as well as expand use of chest CT as a research tool. Finally, ongoing research is expanding use of imaging modalities without ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging is being applied to investigate pulmonary structure and function, and ultrasound of the lung and pleura is a novel technique with an emerging role in chILD disorders. This review describes the current state of imaging in chILD including recently described diagnoses, advances in conventional imaging techniques and applications, and evolving new imaging modalities that expand the clinical and research roles for imaging in these disorders.

### Clinical and therapeutic diversity in adult chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) of the sternocostoclavicular region: a meta-analysis [^2e5bfde2]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

First, this review shows that CNO/SCCH as a CNO subtype is insufficiently defined in the present medical literature and cases are found under a variety of names and classifications. Chinese, Italian and French studies consequently refer to SAPHO syndrome, Japanese studies use PAO, and Dutch and Scandinavian studies generally use CNO/SCCH. Clinical, biochemical, histopathological and imaging characteristics as well as treatment modalities and effects were diverse, and differentially reported and interpreted, as also reflected in the statistical pooling of data. This diversity is a key observation as it seriously hampers insight in the disease of CNO/SCCH. We found a mean diagnostic delay of 5.3 years, regardless of whether CNO/SCCH was diagnosed as a manifestation of SAPHO or PAO or as a separate entity. The delay may therefore not fully be caused by the absence of diagnostic criteria, as these are available for SAPHO syndrome. In any case, this substantial delay is problematic, for it has been associated with irreversible tissue damage and impaired quality of life (QoL). Following from our data, the major drawback for fast diagnosis is CNO/SCCH's unspecific presentation. Symptom-wise, pain of the anterior chest wall and shoulder were ascribed to a wide range of alternative diagnosis, many of which are self-limiting and would not require referral, especially not at the relatively young age of presentation. Co-occurrence with pustulosis, a highly particular manifestation found in 53% should theoretically steer towards CNO/SCCH, but it is known that osteoarticular and skin manifestations generally do not flare simultaneously. Another delaying factor is that step-one imaging techniques such as plain X-rays often do not show clear changes; one study found normal X-rays in 36/54 patients. Hence, CT scans or nuclear imaging are often needed to detect key abnormalities. The most consistent finding was the strongly increased isotope uptake on nuclear imaging, reported for over 99%. The essential role of nuclear imaging in the diagnostic process is herewith confirmed. MRI, which is preferred in paediatric CNO/CRMO to prevent radiation exposure, was performed less frequently in this adult population and bone marrow oedema as an early sign of inflammation was only reported in one study. The combined CT and nuclear imaging prove the diagnostic tools of choice; they are easily performed simultaneously, they detect early signs of inflammation and soft tissue involvement, and also assess bone turnover. Laboratory investigation was also unspecific for CNO/SCCH. Biochemical inflammation (ESR or CRP rise) was only found in approximately half of the patients. Interestingly, one study found that CNO/SCCH patients with PPP and CNO/SCCH patients with other axial localizations demonstrate (significantly) higher levels of ESR and CRP, suggesting that biochemical inflammation may be limited to those with more extensive disease. Alternatively, as CRP elevation was also more prevalent in studies using high-sensitive (hs) CRP, the detection of low-grade inflammation might require more sensitive markers than generic CRP and ESR. Indeed, in RA, hs-CRP has shown to be a better predictor of disease activity compared with ESR. The utility of sensitive markers to diagnose and monitor CNO/SCCH should therefore be addressed in future research. Also relevant in this context is that infection (like tonsillitis or sinusitis) was found in 156/363 patients of four studies total, tempting speculation whether molecular mimicry might trigger CNO/SCCH, as proposed for other rheumatic diseases too and supported by the positive clinical effects of tonsillectomy in SAPHO patients.

### Long-term outcome after surgical treatment of unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease in young men: surgical technique [^4b45ee2d]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical treatment of Osgood-Schlatter disease is occasionally warranted, but its long-term prognosis remains poorly investigated. We studied the rate of occurrence of surgical treatment of unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease as well as the clinical course, radiographic characteristics, and long-term outcomes after that treatment in a large population of military recruits.

Methods

During a thirteen-year period, 178 consecutive recruits underwent surgery for unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease, and 107 of them (117 knees) who met the inclusion criteria participated in a follow-up examination. We obtained data from the original medical records and radiographs as well as follow-up information from physical and radiographic examinations, interviews, and questionnaires to determine functional outcomes.

Results

The rate of occurrence of surgically treated unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease was forty-two per 100,000 military recruits. The median age at the onset of symptoms was fifteen years. After a median duration of follow-up of ten years after the surgery, ninety-three patients (87%) reported no restrictions in everyday activities or at work and eighty (75%) had returned to their preoperative level of sports activity. The median modified Kujala score was 95 points, and the median visual analog score for pain was 7 mm. Forty-one patients (38%) reported a complete absence of pain when kneeling. Six patients had experienced minor postoperative complications, and two had undergone a reoperation for the treatment of the Osgood-Schlatter disease. After resection, the mean tibial tuberosity thickness decreased by 47%. The mean Insall-Salvati index was 1.0 preoperatively and 1.09 postoperatively (p = 0.003), and the corresponding mean Blackburne-Peel indexes were 0.85 and 0.95 (p = 0.003). With the numbers studied, the symptom duration, surgical methods, and radiographic indexes were not found to have an effect on the outcome of surgery.

Conclusions

In the great majority of young adults, the functional outcome of surgical treatment of unresolved Osgood-Schlatter disease is excellent or good, the residual pain intensity is low, and postoperative complications or subsequent reoperations are rare.
