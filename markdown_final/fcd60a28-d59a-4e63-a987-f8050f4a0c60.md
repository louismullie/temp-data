## Question

patient can be on colchicine prophylaxis dose AND at the same time take an additional low-dose colchicine dose if they get acute gout flare while titrating allopurinol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient who is already taking colchicine prophylaxis during allopurinol initiation can safely and effectively add a low-dose colchicine acute flare regimen when a gout flare occurs, and how to dose and monitor in that scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the rationale and guideline basis for colchicine prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled acute colchicine regimen and whether it can be layered on top of prophylaxis. Next, I will check renal and hepatic dose adjustments and drug–drug interactions that could alter safety. After that, I should review evidence on efficacy and safety of low-dose versus high-dose colchicine for flares. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and counseling points, and confirm whether allopurinol should be continued during the flare [^11417bTt].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why prophylaxis is recommended. When starting or uptitrating allopurinol, serum urate falls and mobilizes monosodium urate crystals, which transiently increases flare risk; guidelines strongly recommend concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, with low-dose colchicine as a first-line option, to mitigate this risk and preserve adherence to urate-lowering therapy [^114XNW5a] [^111RqG5r] [^116Tdtmx] [^117QyWfG].

> I need to check the FDA-labeled acute colchicine regimen and whether it can be used during ongoing prophylaxis. The approved acute dose is 1.2 mg at flare onset followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, for a total of 1.8 mg, and the label explicitly states that COLCRYS may be administered for treatment of a gout flare during prophylaxis at these doses, with a 12-hour hiatus before resuming the prophylactic dose, which directly answers the question affirmatively [^113UUqju] [^114gFZYv].

> Wait, let me verify the exact sequencing so I don't misstate it. The label instructs to give 1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg one hour later, and then wait 12 hours before restarting the regular prophylactic dose; this avoids stacking exposures and helps minimize gastrointestinal toxicity, which is the most common adverse effect with colchicine [^113UUqju] [^1139y5n8].

> Hold on, I should confirm the evidence base supporting low-dose acute therapy rather than older high-dose regimens. High-dose colchicine improves pain but markedly increases gastrointestinal adverse events, whereas low-dose regimens achieve comparable efficacy with fewer adverse effects; the ACR guideline likewise recommends low-dose colchicine when colchicine is chosen for a flare, aligning with the FDA-labeled 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg regimen rather than legacy hourly dosing [^1132ms2q] [^115ALujz] [^112kpWS7].

> Next, I should review renal and hepatic adjustments because accumulation increases toxicity risk. For prophylaxis in severe renal impairment, reduce to 0.3 mg/day and monitor closely; for dialysis, 0.3 mg twice weekly is advised. For acute flares in severe renal impairment, the total treatment dose should be limited and not repeated within two weeks; in dialysis, a single 0.6 mg dose is recommended with at least a two-week interval before retreatment. In hepatic impairment, dose reduction is prudent in severe disease, and caution is warranted with interacting drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-gp, such as macrolides and certain calcium channel blockers, which can raise colchicine levels and toxicity risk [^117DydLi] [^117RzNTL] [^114WSd67] [^112D3qBA].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that are especially relevant during prophylaxis. Strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors like clarithromycin and cyclosporine are contraindicated with colchicine due to toxicity risk; moderate inhibitors such as diltiazem or verapamil warrant dose reduction and close monitoring. Interestingly, recent observational data suggest statins may not markedly increase adverse events with colchicine, though vigilance remains reasonable, and HIV treatment guidance provides specific colchicine dose reductions when coadministered with boosted integrase inhibitors, underscoring the need to reconcile the medication list before layering acute dosing on top of prophylaxis [^114WSd67] [^113sJj8N] [^114bx2pu].

> Let me consider the practical steps so I don't miss anything important. If a flare occurs while on prophylaxis, pause the prophylactic schedule, administer 1.2 mg colchicine immediately, then 0.6 mg one hour later, and wait 12 hours before resuming the regular prophylactic dose; throughout, continue allopurinol because stopping ULT during a flare can worsen crystal dynamics and delay control, and both FDA labeling and ACR guidance advise maintaining ULT with concurrent anti-inflammatory management during flares [^113UUqju] [^116EJ8Fu].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe CKD or is on dialysis — does the same acute layering apply? I need to ensure I adjust for kidney function. In severe CKD or dialysis, the acute treatment should be limited to a single 0.6 mg dose and not repeated within two weeks; layering a full 1.8 mg acute course on top of prophylaxis would risk toxicity, so in those cases I would favor an alternative anti-inflammatory such as an NSAID if not contraindicated or an intra-articular or short oral glucocorticoid course, while keeping the prophylactic colchicine at the reduced maintenance dose if used at all [^117DydLi] [^114mnjSE].

> I should confirm monitoring and counseling points. Watch for gastrointestinal intolerance, myalgias, or weakness suggesting neuromyotoxicity, especially with renal impairment or interacting drugs; if muscle symptoms occur, check creatine kinase and reassess colchicine and coadministered agents. Educate patients that flares may still occur early in ULT but typically shorten and become less frequent with sustained urate lowering, reinforcing adherence to both allopurinol and prophylaxis until urate is at target and flares abate for several months [^111RCkTS] [^116EJ8Fu].

> In summary, yes — during colchicine prophylaxis for allopurinol initiation, a patient who experiences a gout flare can receive the FDA-approved low-dose acute colchicine regimen of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, with a 12-hour pause before resuming the prophylactic schedule, while continuing allopurinol; this approach balances efficacy and safety, with dose adjustments dictated by renal and hepatic function and drug interactions, and alternative anti-inflammatories considered when colchicine exposure should be minimized [^113UUqju] [^114gFZYv] [^11417bTt].

---

Patients can take a **low-dose colchicine flare regimen** (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later) while on colchicine prophylaxis (0.6 mg once or twice daily) during allopurinol titration, but **hold the prophylactic dose for 12 hours** after the loading doses to avoid toxicity [^113UUqju]. This approach is supported by FDA labeling and ACR guidelines, which allow acute colchicine use during prophylaxis and recommend low-dose regimens to minimize adverse effects [^112kpWS7] [^113UUqju]. Monitor for GI upset, myopathy, and drug interactions, and adjust dosing in renal or hepatic impairment [^117DydLi] [^117RzNTL].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA labeling**: Colchicine may be administered for acute flares during prophylaxis at 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, with a 12-hour hiatus before resuming prophylaxis [^113UUqju].

- **ACR guidelines**: Use low-dose colchicine for flares and continue prophylaxis during ULT initiation; low-dose regimens have similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects than high-dose [^112kpWS7] [^111zAZ1i].

- **Clinical trials**: Low-dose colchicine is effective for acute flares with fewer GI adverse events than high-dose [^1132ms2q].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

| **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Prophylaxis | 0.6 mg once or twice daily | Ongoing |
| Acute flare | 1.2 mg loading dose | At flare onset |
| Acute flare | 0.6 mg one hour later | One hour after loading |
| Prophylaxis | Resume 0.6 mg once or twice daily | 12 hours after acute dose |

---

## Safety considerations

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are common; monitor closely [^1139y5n8].

- **Myopathy and neuropathy**: Risk increases with renal impairment or interacting drugs; monitor for muscle weakness or neuropathy [^112D3qBA].

- **Drug interactions**: Strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine) increase toxicity risk; avoid or adjust dose [^114WSd67].

- **Renal and hepatic impairment**: Reduce dose and monitor closely in impairment [^117DydLi] [^117RzNTL].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Efficacy: Low-dose colchicine is effective for acute flares, with fewer adverse effects than high-dose [^1132ms2q]. Adherence: Continuing prophylaxis during ULT initiation reduces flares and improves adherence [^117NnEN2].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient education**: Explain that flares may occur during ULT initiation and that acute colchicine can be used without stopping prophylaxis [^113UUqju].

- **Monitoring**: Check renal and hepatic function regularly and monitor for adverse effects during combined use [^114rED5G].

- **Alternative therapies**: If colchicine is contraindicated or not tolerated, use NSAIDs or corticosteroids for flares [^112kpWS7].

---

Patients can use a low-dose colchicine flare regimen during prophylaxis in allopurinol titration, but **hold prophylaxis for 12 hours** after the loading doses to reduce toxicity risk [^113UUqju]. This strategy is guideline-supported and effective, with monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions [^111RqG5r].

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^114EkSKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite lack of proven benefit. We investigated if colchicine administration during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

Methods

Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg po bid or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration < 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

Results

Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer recurrent gout flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares, and reduces the likelihood of recurrent flares. Treating patients with colchicine during initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114XNW5a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Effect of prophylaxis on gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy: analysis of data from three phase III trials [^115AC7N4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as febuxostat or allopurinol, is recommended for the long-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout to reduce the incidence of acute flares. Because of the paradoxical relationship between early use of ULT and the increased incidence of gout flares, prophylaxis with either low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs has been recommended, although there have been concerns about the long-term prophylactic use of these agents.

Objectives

The present analysis examined flare rates during the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat based on mean postbaseline serum urate (sUA) concentrations and duration of prophylaxis. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Methods

This investigator-initiated, post hoc reanalysis of data on gout flares from the 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trials evaluated the proportion of patients requiring treatment for gout flares at 4-week intervals based on mean postbaseline sUA concentrations < 6.0 and ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. The 3 trials enrolled males or females aged 18–85 years who had a diagnosis of gout and a baseline sUA concentration ≥ 8.0 mg/dL. Patients received ULT (febuxostat or allopurinol) or placebo for 6 months or 1 year and flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg/d or naproxen 250 mg BID for 8 weeks or 6 months. The prophylactic regimen was chosen at the discretion of the investigator, based on renal function and known intolerance to either drug. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min were not to receive naproxen. AEs were summarized based on prophylaxis with colchicine or naproxen.

Results

The 3 trials enrolled a total of 4101 patients with gout. The majority were white (80.1%), male (94.5%), and obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) (62.8%). The mean duration of gout ranged from 10.9–11.9 years, and the mean baseline sUA concentration ranged from 9.6–9.9 mg/dL. Flare rates increased sharply (up to 40%) at the end of 8 weeks of prophylaxis and then declined gradually, whereas flare rates were consistently low (range, 3%-5%) at the end of 6 months of prophylaxis. Mean postbaseline sUA concentrations were correlated with flare rates; by the end of each study, patients with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration < 6.0 mg/dL had fewer flares than did those with a mean postbaseline sUA concentration ≥ 6.0 mg/dL. There were differences in rates of AEs between prophylaxis groups, but the rates did not increase with increased duration of prophylaxis.

Conclusion

This analysis of gout flare data from the 3 Phase III trials of febuxostat found that flare prophylaxis for up to 6 months during the initiation of ULT appeared to provide greater benefit than flare prophylaxis for 8 weeks, with no increase in AEs.

### Cost-effectiveness of low dose colchicine prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach for gout: evidence from a non-inferiority randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^112e6DBP]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of low-dose colchicine prophylaxis for preventing gout flares when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach.

Methods

Participants with gout, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology recommendations for starting urate-lowering therapy and with serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L (6mg/dL), were randomly allocated (1:1) to either colchicine (0.5 mg daily) or placebo for six months with a further six-month follow-up. All participants received allopurinol, with monthly increase in dose to achieve target urate < 0.36 mmol/L. The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness at 6-month and 1-year follow-up from the health system perspective, measured by incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) at a willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to gross domestic product per capita.

Results

Two hundred participants were randomized to either colchicine (n = 100) or placebo (n = 100). Mean costs were higher in the colchicine group over both 6 months and 1 year (adjusted mean difference $1848 [95%CI -321 to 4017] and $2282 [95%CI -173 to 4737], respectively). Quality-adjusted life years were slightly higher in the colchicine group over 6 months (adjusted mean difference 0.008 [95%CI -0.020 to 0.035]), but lower over 1 year (-0.015, [95%CI -0.039 to 0.010]). Treatment with colchicine was not found to be cost-effective at either 6-months or 12-months (INMB -$1373 (95%CI -4287 to 1542) and -$3191 (95%CI -6274 to -107), probability of cost-effectiveness 17.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Similar results were obtained from a societal perspective.

Conclusion

Six months of low-dose colchicine prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" approach is unlikely to be cost-effective over 12 months.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^112CisuA]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized for gout flares while receiving allopurinol (n = 59), dose reductions (or discontinuations) of allopurinol during admissions were associated with higher rates of flares in the 3 months following discharge than admissions during which allopurinol doses were unchanged or increased (53% vs 22%; P = 0.03). The primary reason provided for the allopurinol dose reductions/discontinuations was acute kidney injury, which was present in a higher proportion of this group than that of the comparator group (60% vs 36%). Patients in the dose-reduced/discontinued cohort were less likely to have received flare prophylaxis at discharge than the dose-unchanged/increased cohort (60% vs 27%; P -value not specified), which may have contributed to the observed differences in post-discharge flares.

Whether to initiate ULT during a gout flare has been evaluated in three studies that included participants recruited from EDs and inpatient settings. In an RCT, 31 participants were recruited from EDs and rheumatology clinics within 72 h of initial therapy for a gout flare and randomized to receive allopurinol 100 mg daily (up-titrated to 200 mg daily after 14 days) or placebo. Treatment for the flare was determined by the treating physician, with corticosteroids utilized in over 80% of participants. Both study arms received prophylactic low-dose colchicine. The primary end point of time to resolution of the flares was not significantly different between the allopurinol and the placebo arms (15.4 days vs 13.4 days, respectively; P = 0.50). It is of note, however, that post-hoc power calculations suggested 116 subjects per arm were required in order to have demonstrated a significant difference in this end point. Pain and physician global assessment scores declined rapidly in both study arms. As might be expected, SU levels were significantly lower in the allopurinol arm than the placebo arm at study completion (6.4 mg/dl vs 8.3 mg/dl; P = 0.012).

Gout — antiinflammatory prophylaxis when starting ULT — initiating concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy (e.g., colchicine, NSAIDs, prednisone/prednisolone) over no antiinflammatory prophylaxis is strongly recommended; the choice of specific antiinflammatory prophylaxis should be based upon patient factors; and continuing prophylaxis for 3–6 months rather than < 3 months is strongly recommended, with ongoing evaluation and continued prophylaxis as needed if the patient continues to experience flares.

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. We aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if 1) no concurrent urate-lowering therapy was prescribed, 2) uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months, or 3) uric acid goals were met for > 1 year and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Results

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without urate-lowering therapy increase in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for > 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. Allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

We found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by failure to prescribe concurrent urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultation was associated with improved colchicine prescribing.

### Allopurinol [^11417bTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Gout: an update [^117YHQA5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^111kgTxe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

Methods

A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily or matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg 3 times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg 2 times per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

Results

On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in 2 subjects taking allopurinol and 3 subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

Conclusions

Allopurinol initiation during an acute gout attack caused no significant difference in daily pain, recurrent flares, or inflammatory markers.

### Casebook consults: improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^112j9Uc5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made on the basis of the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome. Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL. Measurements of SUA should be obtained after resolution of an acute attack, then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT. Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure close adherence with recommended therapies. Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for control of the disease. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis and choosing a therapeutic regimen for gout while effectively communicating with and educating patients about their disease.

### Predicting gout flares in people starting allopurinol using the start-low Go-slow dose escalation strategy [^117MbXfE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study objective was to determine predictors of gout flare when commencing allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of a 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months was undertaken. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of gout flares in the first and last six months of the trial.

Results

Multivariable analysis revealed a significant association between risk of a gout flare in the first six months and flare in the month before starting allopurinol (odds ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–5.17) and allopurinol 100 mg starting dose (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41–7.27). The predictors of any gout flares in the last six months of the trial, after stopping colchicine or placebo, were having received colchicine (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.48–5.86), at least one flare in the month before stopping study drug (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.21–13.15), and serum urate ≥ 0.36 mmol/L at month 6 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.14–7.12).

Conclusion

Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting allopurinol using the "start-low go-slow" dose escalation strategy may be best targeted at those who have had a gout flare in the month before starting allopurinol and are commencing allopurinol 100 mg daily. For those with ongoing gout flares during the first six months of starting allopurinol who have not yet achieved serum urate target, a longer period of prophylaxis may be required.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^114KJ8hZ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found that people were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who were older, had more comorbidities and were prescribed certain potentially interacting medications. Reassuringly, the rate of serious adverse events was low, providing reassurance for people with gout and for clinicians. We also found no evidence that the prescription of statins significantly increased the risk of adverse events except atorvastatin being associated with MI.

Future research is needed to determine which patients are at greatest risk of adverse events from prophylaxis and whether the cardiovascular benefits of colchicine reported in randomized controlled trials of people at high risk of cardiovascular events because of a prior history of coronary heart disease also apply to people with gout. Our findings will provide much-needed information about the safety of flare prophylaxis that can inform treatment decisions when initiating allopurinol, directly benefitting people with gout and their clinicians.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Comparative efficacy of low-dose versus regular-dose colchicine to prevent flares in gout patients initiated on urate-lowering therapies [^11266isE]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the prophylactic effect of regular-dose (RD, 1.2mg/day) vs low-dose (LD, 0.6mg/day) colchicine on gout flare when initiating urate-lowering therapy.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we included gout patients who were initiated on either allopurinol or febuxostat, in combination with colchicine therapy and followed them up for 3months. We analysed the rates of gout flare and adverse events according to the dose of colchicine. We performed the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and weighted logistic regression analysis to assess the treatment effect. Analysis of gout flares and adverse events was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis.

Results

Of the total of 419 patients with gout, 177 patients (42.2%) received LD colchicine, whereas 242 patients (57.8%) received RD colchicine. Lower BMI and estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher incidence of cardiovascular disease were seen in the LD group than in the RD group. In IPTW-adjusted analysis, events of gout flare were not significantly different between the LD and RD groups [ITT: 14.3% vs 11.3%; odds ratio (OR):1.309, 95% CI: 0.668, 2.566, P = 0.432; PP: 15.3% vs 10.0%; OR:1.623, 95% CI: 0.765, 3.443, P = 0.207]. However, LD colchicine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than RD colchicine [ITT: 8.2% vs 17.9%; OR:0.410, 95% CI: 0.217, 0.777; P < 0.05; PP: 8.4% vs 17.2%; OR:0.442, 95% CI: 0.223, 0.878; P < 0.05].

Conclusion

Our data suggest that LD colchicine can adequately prevent gout flare with fewer adverse events compared with RD colchicine.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^115BYxw7]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the United States. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

### Comparison of gout flares with the initiation of Treat-to-target allopurinol and febuxostat: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized multicenter trial [^112MQTe5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in gout can precipitate arthritis flares. There have been limited comparisons of flare risk during the initiation and escalation of allopurinol and febuxostat, administered as a treat-to-target strategy with optimal anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of a 72-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat. For this analysis, the occurrence of flares was examined during weeks 0 to 24 when ULT was initiated and titrated to a serum urate (sUA) goal of less than 6 mg/dl (< 5 mg/dl if tophi). Flares were assessed at regular intervals through structured participant interviews. Predictors of flare, including treatment assignment, were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Study participants (n = 940) were predominantly male (98.4%) and had a mean age of 62.1 years with approximately equal proportions receiving allopurinol or febuxostat. Mean baseline sUA was 8.5 mg/dl and all participants received anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (90% colchicine). In a multivariable model, there were no significant associations of ULT treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17; febuxostat vs allopurinol), ULT-dose escalation (HR 1.18 vs no escalation), prophylaxis type, or individual comorbidity with flare and no evidence of ULT-dose escalation interaction. Factors independently associated with flare risk during ULT initiation/escalation included younger age, higher baseline sUA, and absence of tophi.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that gout flare risk during the initiation and titration of allopurinol is similar to febuxostat when these agents are administered according to a treat-to-target strategy using gradual ULT-dose titration and best practice gout flare prophylaxis.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^112kpWS7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^1142NHAX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

Post hoc analyses of the 12‐month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start‐low go‐slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). The methods and results of the full trial have been reported. Briefly, this was a one‐year double‐blind placebo‐controlled noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine at 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve a target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L. Starting doses of allopurinol were 50 mg daily in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The allopurinol doses were increased monthly by 50 mg daily in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and by 100 mg daily in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until the serum urate level was < 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen in person every three months by study coordinators, with intervening monthly telephone assessments. Gout flares, defined as self‐reported gout flares requiring treatment, were recorded at each monthly assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were collected monthly and coded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). Participants were asked about the occurrence of any adverse events as well as colchicine‐specific adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and myalgia). Blood samples were obtained monthly for serum urate and creatinine; every three months for complete bloodcount, alanine transaminase, alkaline phophatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase; and at baseline, month three, and month six for CK. Nonfasting plasma samples were collected for trough colchicine plasma concentrations (just before the next colchicine dose) and the assumed peak (30–60 minutes post dose) colchicine concentrations at month three.

### Treatment guidelines in gout [^111CG6MT]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^116BbkLZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with chronic gout is derived from the published literature. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with gout initiating treatment with urate-lowering therapy. In both trials, treatment with colchicine decreased the frequency of gout flares.

The efficacy of a low-dosage regimen of oral colchicine (COLCRYS total dose 1.8 mg over one hour) for treatment of gout flares was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, one week, dose-comparison study. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout were randomly assigned to three groups: high-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg hourly × 6 hours [4.8 mg total]); low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg in one hour [1.8 mg total] followed by five placebo doses hourly); or placebo (two capsules, then one capsule hourly × six hours). Patients took the first dose within 12 hours of the onset of the flare and recorded pain intensity (11-point Likert scale) and adverse events over 72 hours. The efficacy of colchicine was measured based on response to treatment in the target joint, using patient self-assessment of pain at 24 hours following the time of first dose as recorded in the diary. A responder was one who achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain score at the 24-hour postdose assessment relative to the pretreatment score and did not use rescue medication prior to the actual time of 24-hour postdose assessment.

Our results suggest that colchicine could be used with caution to treat crystal-induced arthritis flare in patients with severe CKD (G4–5), with dose reduction and close monitoring. Longer term data exploring the efficacy and safety of colchicine use as a prophylactic treatment would be interesting. Clinical trials in this population could be of interest, to evaluate the use of colchicine in prophylaxis for long-term gout flares and thus avoid the recurrence of flare when urate-lowering therapies are initiated.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^11222XNd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the relationship between colchicine plasma concentrations and clinical and demographic factors and to determine the relationship between colchicine concentrations and colchicine efficacy and colchicine-specific adverse events.

Methods

Post hoc analyses were undertaken using data from a 12-month randomized controlled trial involving 200 people with gout that compared low-dose colchicine to placebo for the first six months while starting allopurinol, with a further six-month follow-up. Steady-state colchicine plasma concentrations were measured 30 to 80 minutes post dose (assumed peak) and just before the dose (trough) at month three, and creatine kinase (CK) levels were measured at months zero, three, and six. Self-reported gout flares, adverse events, and serious adverse events were collected monthly.

Results

Peak and trough colchicine concentrations were available for 79 participants in the colchicine arm. Multivariable analysis showed that those taking a statin and non-Māori and non-Pacific ethnicity were independently associated with higher trough concentrations, and age older than 60 years was independently associated with higher peak concentrations. Trough and peak colchicine concentrations were significantly higher in those who had any adverse event between months four and six. However, there was no association between colchicine concentrations and colchicine-specific adverse events (gastrointestinal and muscle) or with CK changes in the colchicine-treated patients.

Conclusion

Trough or peak colchicine concentrations are not associated with gout flare prophylaxis efficacy. There is no consistent relationship between colchicine concentrations and colchicine-specific adverse events. Although colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use, this does not result in muscle-related adverse events. These findings indicate that colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^117PsGAs]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy and hospitalizations for gout: results from a nationwide cohort study in england [^1129PVft]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our finding that ULT associates with an increased risk of flares requiring hospitalization in the first 6 months after initiation is in keeping with the results of studies in community settings. In a UK primary care-based RCT of people with gout (n = 517), treat-to-target ULT increased the frequency of gout flares within the first year when compared with usual care, but reduced flares at 2 years. In the NOR-Gout study of treat-to-target ULT, flares were more frequent during the first year after initiation (particularly at 3–6 months after initiation), but reduced greatly in the second year.

Changes in SU levels when initiating ULT may precipitate flares through dissolution and remodelling of intra-articular urate crystal deposits. Guidelines recommend considering prescription of prophylaxis against flares when initiating and titrating ULT, with low-dose colchicine (500 micrograms once or twice daily for ≥ 3 months) recommended as first-line prophylaxis. In our cohort, only 10% of people initiating ULT were prescribed the equivalent of colchicine 500 micrograms once daily for ≥ 3 months. In age and sex-adjusted models, we observed an association between increased hospitalizations and the prescription of colchicine prophylaxis; however, this association was not statistically significant following multivariable adjustment. Our finding contrasts RCTs that have reported fewer flares when initiating ULT with colchicine prophylaxis. The differences may represent confounding by indication in our cohort; for example, prescription of colchicine to people with more severe gout at greater risk of hospitalization. We explored the use of propensity models to account for differences in colchicine-receiving vs non-receiving groups; however, differences between these groups precluded this. Other potential contributing factors could include repeated acute prescriptions for colchicine for flares being misclassified as prophylaxis, and low adherence to prophylaxis during ULT titration.

### Allopurinol [^116EJ8Fu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Administration

Advise patients to take allopurinol tablets after meals to minimize gastric irritation. If a single dose of allopurinol tablets is occasionally forgotten, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time.

Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity

Inform patients that allopurinol tablets may increase the risk of serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions. Instruct patients to discontinue allopurinol tablets and to seek medical attention immediately, at the first sign of a skin rash, blisters, fever, painful urination, blood in the urine, irritation of the eyes, swelling of the lips or mouth, or other signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Gout Flares During Treatment With Allopurinol Tablets

Inform patients that gout flares may occur during initiation of treatment with allopurinol tablets, even when their serum uric acid is normal. Concurrent use of additional medications such as colchicine or other anti-inflammatory agents can prevent gout flares. Advise patients to continue treatment with both, allopurinol tablets and the prophylactic therapy as prescribed, even if gout flares occur. Reassure them that it may take months to achieve control of the flares but the flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^116WTQcK]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This Consensus Statement highlights where knowledge regarding the management of gout in people with CKD remains incomplete, and proposes a research agenda to address the most important areas of uncertainty, which includes a better understanding of the natural history of gout in people with CKD. A greater knowledge of the safety of treatments used for the management of gout flares, as well as the requirement for flare prophylaxis in this population, is also needed. Additional investigation is required to determine the safe dosing of allopurinol in people with CKD, as well the prediction and management of AHS. Further research is also required to help determine whether febuxostat is associated with increased cardiovascular risk or is in fact risk-neutral, and whether febuxostat is safer to use than allopurinol in people with gout and CKD. The safety and efficacy of uricosuric medications at different levels of renal function is another area where further research would be of benefit. Evidence regarding the use of pegloticase in people with gout and CKD is limited. From the standpoint of treating or preventing gout flares, the knowledge gaps are also substantial and revolve around the safe use and dosing of colchicine, the safety and efficacy of IL-1 inhibitors and the absolute indication for prophylactic therapy in all patients in whom ULT is being initiated.

In order to resolve these issues, it is important that researchers include patients with all stages of CKD in clinical trials of gout management wherever possible, and undertake pre-specified analyses of safety and efficacy according to renal function, using standardized outcome measures.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

Recent Findings

For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using low dose. Intra-articular, oral or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favour with most guidelines favouring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6mg/dl, and less than 5mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

Summary

Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease management [^114rED5G]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colchicine-an anti-inflammatory alkaloid-has assumed an important role in the management of cardiovascular inflammation ≈3500 years after its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt. Primarily used in high doses for the treatment of acute gout flares during the 20th century, research in the early 21st century demonstrated that low-dose colchicine effectively treats acute gout attacks, lowers the risk of recurrent pericarditis, and can add to secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events. As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted anti-inflammatory cardiovascular therapy, colchicine currently has a unique role in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The safe use of colchicine requires careful monitoring for drug-drug interactions, changes in kidney and liver function, and counseling regarding gastrointestinal upset. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine relevant to atherosclerosis, the potential role of colchicine in primary prevention, in other cardiometabolic conditions, colchicine's safety in cardiovascular patients, and opportunities for individualizing colchicine therapy using clinical and molecular diagnostics.

### Febuxostat [^11222BMs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2 Gout Flares

After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation

The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ.

Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison to allopurinol in a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing ULT strategies and flare prophylaxis.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### Cost-effectiveness of colchicine prophylaxis for gout flares when commencing allopurinol [^112QBRm8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy is recommended by international rheumatology society guidelines. Whether this is a cost-effective intervention is currently unknown. Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis using both a US cost input model and an Australian cost input model.

Methods

This cost-effectiveness analysis was completed from the point of view of the third-party payer. We used a 2-arm decision tree with 1 arm commencing allopurinol with no colchicine prophylaxis and the other with colchicine prophylaxis. Model inputs were drawn from published literature where available. We completed a univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to confirm the robust nature of the modeling. The time frame for the model was 6 months.

Results

The colchicine prophylaxis arm resulted in a cost of $1,276 and 0.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while in the placebo arm the cost was $516 and 0.47 QALYs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,004 per QALY gained. In Australia, where cost of colchicine was much lower, the colchicine arm dominated the placebo ($208 [Australian] in the colchicine arm versus $415 [Australian] in the placebo). Univariate and probability sensitivity analysis demonstrated that results were robust to changes in input parameters. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of colchicine prophylaxis being the most cost-effective option was 93% in the US and 100% in the Australian setting.

Conclusion

Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares while commencing allopurinol in gout is very cost-effective.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^114mnjSE]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Drugs used for flare prophylaxis

Although the medications used for flare prophylaxis are the same as those used to treat flares, they are generally used at lower doses and for longer periods of time (months rather than days or weeks). A post hoc analysis of three phase III RCTs in people starting febuxostat who also received prophylaxis with colchicine included participants with an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 but again the results were not stratified by renal function. Long-term use of colchicine in the general population has been associated with bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, but whether these effects are increased in those with gout and CKD is unknown. Whereas short-term courses of glucocorticoids can be considered to have an acceptable risk–benefit profile, long-term use of glucocorticoids for flare prophylaxis can be associated with an increased risk of glucocorticoid-related adverse events, particularly infections, as seen in other rheumatic diseases. This risk could be particularly concerning in a population that is already at high risk of severe infections, such as those with CKD. Whether the gout flare rate when starting ULT is the same in those with CKD as in those without, and whether prophylaxis is always required, are unknown, although a recent study of incremental use of febuxostat suggested that prophylaxis might not be required when a dose-escalation approach is used.

For prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance [Clcr] 50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg/day and any increase in dose should be done with close monitoring. For the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients undergoing dialysis, the starting doses should be 0.3 mg given twice a week with close monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment of Gout Flares

For treatment of gout flares in patients with mild (Clcr50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted for the treatment of gout flares, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For patients with gout flares requiring repeated courses, consideration should be given to alternate therapy. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose for the treatment of gout flares should be reduced to a single dose of 0.6 mg (one tablet). For these patients, the treatment course should not be repeated more than once every two weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment of gout flares with COLCRYS is not recommended in patients with renal impairment who are receiving COLCRYS for prophylaxis.

5.1	Cardiovascular Death

In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with ULORIC had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the ULORIC group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). ULORIC was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of the increased risk of CV death, ULORIC should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of ULORIC when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on ULORIC. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

5.2	Gout Flares

After initiation of ULORIC, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.

In order to prevent gout flares when ULORIC is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^117HCoX1]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

### Allopurinol [^116nSsoa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gout Flares

Gout flares have been reported during initiation of treatment with allopurinol tablets, even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained due to the mobilization of urates from tissue deposits. Even with adequate therapy with allopurinol tablets, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the flares. The flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

In order to prevent gout flares when treatment with allopurinol tablets is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with colchicine or an anti-inflammatory agent is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise patients to continue allopurinol tablets and prophylactic treatment even if gout flares occur, as it may take months to achieve control of gout flares.

5.3 Nephrotoxicity

Treatment with allopurinol tablets may result in acute kidney injury due to formation of xanthine calculi or due to precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease or history of kidney stones, may be at increased risk for worsening of kidney function or acute kidney injury due to xanthine calculi while receiving treatment with allopurinol tablets.

In patients receiving allopurinol tablets for the management of gout or the management of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi, monitor kidney function frequently during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day of neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine to avoid the possibility of formation of xanthine calculi and help prevent renal precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents.

In patients receiving allopurinol tablets for the management of tumor lysis syndrome, monitor kidney function at least daily during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day in adults and at least 2 liters/m2/day (or at least 100 mL/m2/hour) in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout [^11588AtF]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi.

### Gout [^117ThUik]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout typically presents as an acute, self-limiting inflammatory monoarthritis that affects the joints of the lower limb. Elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the major risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and development of gout. Although traditionally considered a disorder of purine metabolism, altered urate transport, both in the gut and the kidneys, has a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia. Anti-inflammatory agents, such corticosteroids, NSAIDs and colchicine, are widely used for the treatment of gout flare; recognition of the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and bioactive IL-1β release in initiation of the gout flare has led to the development of anti-IL-1β biological therapy for gout flares. Sustained reduction in serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy is vital in the long-term management of gout, which aims to dissolve MSU crystals, suppress gout flares and resolve tophi. Allopurinol is the first-line urate-lowering therapy and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation. Low-dose anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. Models of care, such as nurse-led strategies that focus on patient engagement and education, substantially improve clinical outcomes and now represent best practice for gout management.

### Gout: state of the art after a decade of developments [^117SUop2]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.

### Allopurinol for chronic gout [^1172BLY4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is considered one of the most effective urate-lowering drugs and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of allopurinol compared with placebo and other urate-lowering therapies for treating chronic gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE on 14 January 2014. We also handsearched the 2011 to 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) abstracts, trial registers and regulatory agency drug safety databases.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that compared allopurinol with a placebo or an active therapy in adults with chronic gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted and analysed data using standard methods for Cochrane reviews. The major outcomes of interest were frequency of acute gout attacks, serum urate normalisation, pain, function, tophus regression, study participant withdrawal due to adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4531 participants) that compared allopurinol (various doses) with placebo (two trials); febuxostat (four trials); benzbromarone (two trials); colchicine (one trial); probenecid (one trial); continuous versus intermittent allopurinol (one trial) and different doses of allopurinol (one trial). Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. We deemed allopurinol versus placebo the main comparison, and allopurinol versus febuxostat and versus benzbromarone as the most clinically relevant active comparisons and restricted reporting to these comparisons here. Moderate-quality evidence from one trial (57 participants) indicated allopurinol 300 mg daily probably does not reduce the rate of gout attacks (2/26 with allopurinol versus 3/25 with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 3.52) but increases the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate over 30 days (25/26 with allopurinol versus 0/25 with placebo, RR 49.11, 95% CI 3.15 to 765.58; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 1). In two studies (453 participants), there was no significant increase in withdrawals due to AE (6% with allopurinol versus 4% with placebo, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.08) or SAE (2% with allopurinol versus 1% with placebo, RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.48 to 7.80). One trial reported no difference in pain reduction or tophus regression, but did not report outcome data or measures of variance sufficiently and we could not calculate the differences between groups. Neither trial reported function. Low-quality evidence from three trials (1136 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily over eight to 24 weeks (21% with allopurinol versus 23% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.1); however more participants may achieve target serum urate level (four trials; 2618 participants) with febuxostat 80 mg daily versus allopurinol 300 mg daily (38% with allopurinol versus 70% with febuxostat, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.65, NNTB with febuxostat 4). Two trials reported no difference in tophus regression between allopurinol and febuxostat over a 28- to 52-week period; but as the trialists did not provide variance, we could not calculate the mean difference between groups. The trials did not report pain reduction or function. Moderate-quality evidence from pooled data from three trials (2555 participants) comparing allopurinol up to 300 mg daily versus febuxostat 80 mg daily indicated no difference in the number of withdrawals due to AE (7% with allopurinol versus 8% with febuxostat, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26) or SAE (4% with allopurinol versus 4% with febuxostat, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.82) over a 24- to 52-week period. Low-quality evidence from one trial (65 participants) indicated there may be no difference in the incidence of acute gout attacks with allopurinol up to 600 mg daily compared with benzbromarone up to 200 mg daily over a four-month period (0/30 with allopurinol versus 1/25 with benzbromarone, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.58). Based on the pooled results of two trials (102 participants), there was moderate-quality evidence of no probable difference in the proportion of participants achieving a target serum urate level with allopurinol versus benzbromarone (58% with allopurinol versus 74% with benzbromarone, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicated there may be no difference in the number of participants who withdrew due to AE with allopurinol versus benzbromarone over a four- to nine-month period (6% with allopurinol versus 7% with benzbromarone, pooled RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.58). There were no SAEs. They did not report tophi regression, pain and function. All other comparisons were supported by small, single studies only, limiting conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found low- to moderate-quality evidence indicating similar effects on withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs and incidence of acute gout attacks when allopurinol (100 to 600 mg daily) was compared with placebo, benzbromarone (100 to 200 mg daily) or febuxostat (80 mg daily). There was moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in the proportion of participants achieving target serum urate when allopurinol was compared with benzbromarone. However, allopurinol seemed more successful than placebo and may be less successful than febuxostat (80 mg daily) in achieving a target serum urate level (6 mg/dL or less; 0.36 mmol/L or less) based on moderate- to low-quality evidence. Single studies reported no difference in pain reduction when allopurinol (300 mg daily) was compared with placebo over 10 days, and no difference in tophus regression when allopurinol (200 to 300 mg daily) was compared with febuxostat (80 mg daily). None of the trials reported on function, health-related quality of life or participant global assessment of treatment success, where further research would be useful.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^1139y5n8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis of Gout Flares

The most commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials of colchicine for the prophylaxis of gout was diarrhea.

Treatment of Gout Flares

The most common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial with COLCRYS for treatment of gout flares were diarrhea (23%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (3%).

FMF

Gastrointestinal tract adverse effects are the most frequent side effects in patients initiating COLCRYS, usually presenting within 24 hours, and occurring in up to 20% of patients given therapeutic doses. Typical symptoms include cramping, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. These events should be viewed as dose-limiting if severe, as they can herald the onset of more significant toxicity.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience in Gout

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a gout flare, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients using the recommended dose (1.8 mg over one hour) of COLCRYS compared to 77% of patients taking a nonrecommended high dose (4.8 mg over six hours) of colchicine and 20% of patients taking placebo. Diarrhea was the most commonly reported drug-related gastrointestinal adverse event. As shown in Table 3, diarrhea is associated with COLCRYS treatment. Diarrhea was more likely to occur in patients taking the high-dose regimen than the low-dose regimen. Severe diarrhea occurred in 19% and vomiting occurred in 17% of patients taking the nonrecommended high-dose colchicine regimen but did not occur in the recommended low-dose COLCRYS regimen.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^114HRgjZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116F5Bu9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that the study population was 93% male. Although this reflects a typical gout trial population, women often experience higher disease severity, have more negative illness perceptions, and experience higher impact on daily activities. Although the number of women in our study were too small to enable analysis by gender, we would expect the observed effects to be even more pronounced in women.

These data contribute to our understanding of the impact and burden of gout flares in people with gout, highlighting their concern about this core clinical manifestation of the disease. In the long term, excellent serum urate control is important. However, it is also essential that health care professionals support people with gout to prevent and manage flares as a core part of gout management.

Strengths of this study include the standardized study protocols, prospective gout flare event ascertainment, and use of outcomes of relevance to patients. Limitations include some loss to follow‐up, albeit minimal; the use of subjective assessments; and the short study design, which did not allow for assessment beyond one year. It is well recognized that gout flares can paradoxically increase after starting ULT. Given this peak in flares after starting ULT, it is not surprising that LDA and PASS are hard to achieve in the first six months of starting ULT even with anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis with colchicine. Over time, there is a gradual reduction in gout flares such that, by the second year of ULT, if target serum urate is achieved, flares may cease altogether or occur less frequently. Thus, it is likely that longer trials beyond 12 months are required to see the full effect of ULT on achievement of the disease activity states. Finally, we did not asked participants in the study whether they considered that their flare frequency aligned with the ascribed disease state.

The majority of people (57%) were able to achieve PASS or LDA in the second six months after commencing ULT. As the flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient. These findings highlight the importance of flare prevention in the management of gout.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^114bx2pu]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Colchicine is commonly used to prevent flares when starting urate-lowering therapy for gout. Patients with gout are frequently concurrently prescribed other medications (such as statins) that may interact with colchicine, increasing the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study was to describe potential prognostic factors for adverse events in patients prescribed colchicine when initiating allopurinol.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in linked UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics datasets. Adults initiating allopurinol for gout with colchicine (1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016) were included. Potential prognostic factors were defined, and the likelihood of adverse events, including diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, myocardial infarction, neuropathy, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression, were estimated.

Results

From 1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016, 13 945 people with gout initiated allopurinol with colchicine prophylaxis [mean age 63.9 (. 14.7) years, 78.2% male]. One-quarter (26%, 95% CI 25%, 27%) were prescribed one or more potentially interacting medicines, most commonly statins (21%, 95% CI 20%, 22%). Statins were not associated with increased adverse events, although other drugs were associated with some adverse outcomes. Diarrhoea and myocardial infarction were associated with more comorbidities and more severe chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion

People were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who had more comorbidities and certain potentially interacting medications. Our findings will provide much-needed information about prognostic factors for colchicine-related adverse events that can inform treatment decisions about prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^117RzNTL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The clearance of colchicine may be significantly reduced and plasma half-life prolonged in patients with chronic hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prophylaxis of Gout Flares

For prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. Dose reduction should be considered for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Treatment of Gout Flares

For treatment of gout flares in patients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment, adjustment of the recommended COLCRYS dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of COLCRYS. However, for the treatment of gout flares in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted, the treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For these patients, requiring repeated courses for the treatment of gout flares, consideration should be given to alternate therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

FMF

In patients with severe hepatic disease, dose reduction should be considered with careful monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### A randomized, double-blind, active-and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^112CwegN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Two hundred thirty‐nine gout patients who had had at least 3 flare episodes during the previous year were randomized and treated in this study. The primary efficacy outcome measure was met, as demonstrated by the finding that arhalofenate at a daily dose of 800 mg reduced the incidence of flare compared to allopurinol at a daily dose of 300 mg, in both a statistically and clinically significant manner (a 46% incidence reduction). Also, more patients in the 800 mg arhalofenate group experienced no flares during treatment than did patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group, and patients in the 800 mg arhalofenate group tended to have fewer flares than did patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group.

In this study, the known antiflare activity of colchicine 19 was confirmed, further validating the electronic diary technology and the definition of flare that was used. The flare incidence was also both clinically and statistically decreased in the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group compared with the 300 mg allopurinol group. There was also no significant difference in flare incidence between the 800 mg arhalofenate group and the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group, although the study was not powered to test this comparison. Thus, the clinical utility of 800 mg arhalofenate to prevent gout attacks will have to be judged in the context of the respective risk:benefit ratio of each flare treatment. While colchicine is an effective antiflare therapy 19, it does not reduce serum UA, it can be poorly tolerated with diarrhea or abdominal cramps, and it can potentially induce rare yet severe reactions such as myelosuppression and neuromuscular toxicity 10. In addition, colchicine has multiple potential interactions with commonly prescribed drugs, and the dose needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment 10.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^113UUqju]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The long-term use of colchicine is established for FMF and the prophylaxis of gout flares, but the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment for gout flares has not been evaluated. The dosing regimens for COLCRYS are different for each indication and must be individualized.

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS depends on the patient's age, renal function, hepatic function and use of coadministered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6)].

COLCRYS tablets are administered orally without regard to meals.

COLCRYS is not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes.

2.1 Gout Flares

Prophylaxis of Gout Flares

The recommended dosage of COLCRYS for prophylaxis of gout flares for adults and adolescents older than 16 years of age is 0.6 mg once or twice daily. The maximum recommended dose for prophylaxis of gout flares is 1.2 mg/day.

An increase in gout flares may occur after initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy, including pegloticase, febuxostat and allopurinol, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. COLCRYS is recommended upon initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with uric acid-lowering therapy. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for at least the first six months of uric acid-lowering therapy.

Treatment of Gout Flares

The recommended dose of COLCRYS for treatment of a gout flare is 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Higher doses have not been found to be more effective. The maximum recommended dose for treatment of gout flares is 1.8 mg over a 1-hour period. COLCRYS may be administered for treatment of a gout flare during prophylaxis at doses not to exceed 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Wait 12 hours and then resume the prophylactic dose.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111RCkTS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Low‐dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice daily) is one of the first‐line recommended therapies for prevention of gout flares when commencing urate‐lowering therapy. Although colchicine may be effective, it has a number of potential adverse events, of which the most common are gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea. In people with gout, gastrointestinal adverse events are dose dependent, with more gastrointestinal adverse events observed in those who received a higher dose (4.8 mg over four hours) versus a low dose (1.8 mg over one hour) in a study of gout flares, albeit with no difference in circulating maximum concentration (C max) between the two colchicine doses in healthy volunteers. Other less common adverse events include bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, which may occur with more prolonged use.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use; this does not result in muscle‐related adverse events.
Regular monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate.
Colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

Impaired kidney function, which is common in people with gout, is reported to be a predictor of colchicine adverse events. Because of the risk, it has been suggested that a complete blood count and a creatine kinase (CK) measurement should be performed every six months in patients who are receiving long‐term prophylactic colchicine, defined as 0.5 mg daily for six or more months. The prolonged period suggested for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis and the risk of adverse events have led to a general reluctance to use prophylaxis by many clinicians and people with gout. A study of a nurse‐led educational intervention for people with gout with recurrent flares reported that only 4% of participants opted for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis when urate‐lowering therapy was increased. Thus, the ability to accurately predict who may obtain the most clinical benefit with the least adverse events based on clinical factors would be of clinical use.

### Febuxostat compared with allopurinol in patients with hyperuricemia and gout [^114PDeb2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Febuxostat, a novel nonpurine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is a potential alternative to allopurinol for patients with hyperuricemia and gout.

Methods

We randomly assigned 762 patients with gout and with serum urate concentrations of at least 8.0 mg per deciliter (480 micromol per liter) to receive either febuxostat (80 mg or 120 mg) or allopurinol (300 mg) once daily for 52 weeks; 760 received the study drug. Prophylaxis against gout flares with naproxen or colchicine was provided during weeks 1 through 8. The primary end point was a serum urate concentration of less than 6.0 mg per deciliter (360 micromol per liter) at the last three monthly measurements. The secondary end points included reduction in the incidence of gout flares and in tophus area.

Results

The primary end point was reached in 53 percent of patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat, 62 percent of those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, and 21 percent of those receiving allopurinol (P < 0.001 for the comparison of each febuxostat group with the allopurinol group). Although the incidence of gout flares diminished with continued treatment, the overall incidence during weeks 9 through 52 was similar in all groups: 64 percent of patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat, 70 percent of those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, and 64 percent of those receiving allopurinol (P = 0.99 for 80 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol; P = 0.23 for 120 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol). The median reduction in tophus area was 83 percent in patients receiving 80 mg of febuxostat and 66 percent in those receiving 120 mg of febuxostat, as compared with 50 percent in those receiving allopurinol (P = 0.08 for 80 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol; P = 0.16 for 120 mg of febuxostat vs. allopurinol). More patients in the high-dose febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (P = 0.003) or the low-dose febuxostat group discontinued the study. Four of the 507 patients in the two febuxostat groups (0.8 percent) and none of the 253 patients in the allopurinol group died; all deaths were from causes that the investigators (while still blinded to treatment) judged to be unrelated to the study drugs (P = 0.31 for the comparison between the combined febuxostat groups and the allopurinol group).

Conclusions

Febuxostat, at a daily dose of 80 mg or 120 mg, was more effective than allopurinol at the commonly used fixed daily dose of 300 mg in lowering serum urate. Similar reductions in gout flares and tophus area occurred in all treatment groups.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^1158f87p]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### Comparative risk of gout flares when initiating or escalating various urate-lowering therapy: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^117NnEN2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We systematically examined comparative gout flare risk after initiation or escalation of different urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), comparative flare risk with and without concomitant flare prophylaxis, adverse event rates associated with flare prophylaxis, and optimal duration of flare prophylaxis.

Methods

We searched the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and clinical trial registries from inception to November 2021 for trials investigating adults with gout initiating or escalating ULT. We performed random effects network meta-analyses and calculated risk ratios (RRs) between treatments. Bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.

Results

We identified 3,775 records, of which 29 publications (27 trials) were included. When compared to placebo plus prophylaxis, the RR of flares ranged from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.33) for febuxostat 40 mg plus prophylaxis to RR 2.65 [95% CI 1.58–4.45] for febuxostat 80 mg plus lesinurad 400 mg plus prophylaxis. Compared to ULT alone, the RR of flares was lower for ULT plus rilonacept 160 mg (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.25–0.50]), ULT plus rilonacept 80 mg (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.31–0.60]) and ULT plus colchicine (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.35–0.72]). There was limited evidence for other flare prophylaxis and on prophylaxis harms and optimal duration. Primarily because of missing outcome data and bias in the selection of reported results, 71.4% and 63.4% of studies were assessed as high risk of bias for flares and adverse events, respectively.

Conclusion

The RR of flares when introducing ULT varies depending on ULT drug and dosing strategies. There were limited data on ULT escalation. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine and rilonacept reduces flare incidence. More research is required on the harms and optimal duration of prophylaxis.

### Medications for gout and its comorbidities: mutual benefits? [^116sV6wp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent literature with relevance to the management of multimorbid patients with gout, i.e., gout medication repurposed for comorbidities and vice versa.

Recent Findings

Adding to the previous success of interleukin-1 inhibition, two trials on low-dose colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrated potential benefits in patients with or without gout. In Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial, a composite CVD endpoint was reduced by 23% among patients who had experienced a recent myocardial infarction. In Low-Dose Colchicine 2, the composite CVD endpoint was reduced 31% among those with stable coronary artery disease. Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for renal protection in patients without gout produced null results. Allopurinol did not benefit the glomerular filtration rate in two trials (Controlled trial of slowing of Kidney Disease progression From the Inhibition of Xanthine oxidase and Preventing Early Renal Function Loss) among patients with chronic kidney disease (with or without hyperuricemia, but not gout). SGLT-2 inhibitors, a medication recommended for patients with diabetes and CVD, diabetic kidney disease, or heart failure, demonstrated a protective effect against gout flares in a secondary trial analysis and a large observational study.

Summary

The role of colchicine may expand beyond gout flare prevention to patients with existing CVD. The renal benefit of ULT among patients with gout remains unclear. SGLT-2 inhibitors may benefit diabetic patients who have gout as a comorbidity.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^112LXB5U]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, December 2019) GOLD and Aurum datasets, which have > 3 and 13 million patients, respectively, currently registered and research acceptable. CPRD contains electronic, coded information collected during the course of routine primary healthcare, is representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity, and has been used extensively for primary care research. We used the primary care data linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care dataset, which has coverage from April 1997 to the present. The study was approved by CPRD's in-house Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) (protocol number: 19_233).

Study design and participants

Retrospective cohort studies were assembled in GOLD and Aurum separately. Each consisted of people aged 18 years and over with a clinical code for gout between 1 April 1997 and 30 November 2016 (to allow HES linkage at the time of data access) who received a prescription for colchicine and on the same date received a prescription for allopurinol and did not receive a prescription for NSAID or glucocorticoids in the preceding month. The positive predictive value of a diagnosis of gout in CPRD has been shown to be 90%. The definition of ULT was restricted to allopurinol since this is by far the most commonly prescribed ULT in UK primary care, accounting for 99% of first ULT prescriptions.

The index date (i.e. start of time at risk) was the date of the concomitant first time prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine following the diagnostic code for gout. Everyone was followed up for 6 months or until the end of colchicine treatment, whichever was sooner. The end of treatment was defined as 56 days after the last colchicine prescription.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to allopurinol, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate allopurinol as first-line urate-lowering therapy in patients with normal kidney function, starting at a low dose (100 mg/day) and increasing by 100 mg increments every 2–4 weeks if required, to reach the uricemia target.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111w67Uq]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis, there was no significant association between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and occurrence of gout flares. There was also no consistent relationship between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and colchicine‐specific adverse events. However, both trough peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those with any adverse event in months four to six. Although trough and peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those taking a statin, there was no association with an increase in CK levels or muscle‐related adverse events.

From a clinical perspective TDM is likely to be more useful when colchicine is being used in the long term for prophylaxis while starting urate‐lowering therapy rather than in the short term for gout flares. However, we have shown that there is no reliable association between trough or peak colchicine concentrations and either efficacy, defined as gout flares, or colchicine‐specific adverse events. The lack of a relationship with efficacy is not necessarily unexpected because the majority of colchicine accumulates in neutrophils, and its therapeutic effects are mediated through its ability to bind within cells to tubulin monomers, thus preventing the formation of microtubule heterodimers, which are involved in cell division, signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, and migration. It is possible that the higher dose of colchicine for prophylaxis of 0.5 mg twice daily may be more effective at preventing gout flares when starting allopurinol. Interestingly, both trough and peak colchicine concentrations were higher in those with any adverse event in months four to six. However, these results may be confounded by older age and worse renal function as markers of more comorbidities and higher risk of adverse events generally. In this prophylaxis study, colchicine was used at a lower dose and for a much longer duration (0.5 mg daily for six months) compared to the dose and duration for gout flare (1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg after one hour). This likely, at least in part, explains the lower peak concentrations observed in our study as compared to a previous study of the higher dose in healthy volunteers, as the longer duration of therapy could allow more penetration of colchicine into cells and tissues.

### Association between the initial dose urate-lowering drugs and gout flares in adult males with gout [^111b4cau]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Frequent gout attacks in the initial introduction of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) are significant causes of poor drug adherence and ULT discontinuation. Initial low-dose urate-lowering drugs may be effective in reducing gout flares, however robust evidence is sparse. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the association of initial dose urate-lowering drugs with gout flares in adult males with gout during the initial introduction of ULT.

Methods

This cohort study obtained data on consecutive gout patients from a single-centre gout cohort study from August 2017 to October 2020. A standard questionnaire was applied to collect demographic and clinical information, and biochemical parameters were tested on the same day. The primary endpoint was to estimate the association of initial dose febuxostat with gout flares, using Cox hazard models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).

Results

A total of 582 gout patients were included in this study. During the 6-week follow-up, 71 (12.2%) patients suffered gout flares. In the main analysis using Cox hazard models with IPTW, compared with colchicine prophylaxis, initial low-dose febuxostat alone had no statistical significance with the increased risk of gout flares [hazard ratio (HR) 1.26; 95% CI 0.58, 2.72], while initial high-dose febuxostat was associated with an increased risk of gout flares (HR 3.08; 95% CI 1.34, 7.07).

Conclusions

This observational study demonstrated that initial low-dose febuxostat was equally effective in preventing gout flares as colchicine prophylaxis, while initial high-dose febuxostat alone was associated with an increased risk of gout flares.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^1115jBQQ]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Data sources

All data used in these analyses were routinely captured during clinical care. In-hospital data were extracted from electronic patient records. Post-discharge data were extracted from local care records, containing primary and secondary care data for patients with linked NHS identifiers who had not opted out of this service. All data were manually validated by a rheumatologist, and pseudonymized for the purposes of analysis. Outcomes were selected a priori with stakeholder input.

Baseline characteristics

Baseline data were collected as follows: age; sex; admission type (ED attendance-only vs hospital admission); day/time of presentation (defined as out-of-hours if occurring between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. or on a Saturday/Sunday); pre-existing gout diagnosis; pre-existing prescription for ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone or probenecid); and baseline blood tests, if performed during the presentation (serum urate, CRP, white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and serum creatinine).

Outcomes during hospitalization

Data were captured to ascertain whether the following outcomes occurred during the hospitalization episode: rheumatology input sought; serum urate level performed; joint aspiration performed; flare treatment(s) prescribed (NSAID, colchicine and/or oral, intramuscular, intravenous or intra-articular corticosteroids); disease education provided to patients; ULT initiated (if patient not already receiving ULT) or up-titrated (if patient already receiving ULT at a sub-optimal dose); prophylaxis prescribed (low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids); gout-specific recommendations and/or follow-up on discharge.

Outcomes after hospitalization

For patients with available follow-up data, we ascertained whether the following outcomes occurred within 6 months of discharge: ULT initiation and/or up-titration; prescription of prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation/titration; number of serum urate levels performed; attainment of serum urate targets ≤ 360 μmol/l and/or ≤ 300 μmol/l; follow-up in the gout telephone clinic and/or rheumatology outpatient clinic; re-attendance at ED and/or re-admission with a subsequent gout flare (occurring > 7 days after discharge from the initial presentation).
