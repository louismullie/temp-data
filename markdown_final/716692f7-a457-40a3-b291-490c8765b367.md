## Question

beta blocker average heart rate adn blood pressure decrease in chart based on doses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a chart that shows how beta-blocker dose relates to average reductions in heart rate and blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology linking β1-blockade to heart rate and blood pressure effects. Then, I should verify the quantitative dose–response data for heart rate and for blood pressure, respectively. Next, I will review dose-limiting adverse effects and real-world dosing ceilings. After that, I need to consider population-specific nuances, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and frailty. Finally, I will synthesize practical titration principles that prioritize heart rate control while acknowledging the flat blood pressure dose–response and safety ceilings, grounding each step in the most credible references available.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation so I don't jump to conclusions. Beta-blockers antagonize β-adrenergic receptors, with β1-selective agents reducing sinus node automaticity and AV nodal conduction, thereby lowering heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand; they also reduce renin release and cardiac output, contributing to blood pressure lowering, though this effect is typically less linearly dose-related than heart rate effects, which I should verify against drug labels and trial summaries.

> Hold on, I should verify the claim that heart rate has a more linear dose–response than blood pressure. The betaxolol label explicitly anticipates increasing heart rate effects with higher doses but notes no statistically significant additional antihypertensive benefit beyond 20 mg, suggesting a plateau for blood pressure effects, while Cochrane reviews of nonselective and β1-selective beta-blockers similarly fail to show a convincing dose–response for blood pressure across recommended dose ranges; the BMJ meta-analysis further supports a relatively flat blood pressure dose–response with only modest gains beyond half-standard doses, and a human experiment with pindolol during MDMA exposure showed heart rate blunting without material impact on mean arterial pressure, reinforcing dissociation between heart rate and blood pressure responses [^113Z6gHW] [^111t3m4S] [^111t3m4S] [^1135wW93].

> I need to check the quantitative heart rate data anchored to a high-credibility source. The metoprolol FDA label shows that plasma concentrations corresponding to 30–80% of maximal beta1-blockade yield approximately 8–23% reductions in exercise heart rate, with onset within 1 hour and a dose-related duration of effect; for example, the time to 50% decay of maximal effect is about 3.3, 5.0, and 6.4 hours after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg, respectively, which supports a predictable, dose-dependent chronotropic effect up to moderate doses before plateauing [^113fRrmL].

> Wait, let me verify whether this heart rate effect generalizes across agents and clinical states. In heart failure trials, beta-blockers consistently reduce ventricular rate by about 12 beats per minute irrespective of rhythm, although the mortality benefit concentrates in sinus rhythm and not atrial fibrillation, suggesting the heart rate reduction is reliable while the prognostic translation depends on rhythm context; dual α/β agents like carvedilol add vasodilation which may modulate blood pressure and tolerability without fundamentally changing the dose–response shape for heart rate, which I should keep in mind when comparing across drugs [^116etAoD] [^113hkHWr].

> Next, I should review quantitative blood pressure dose–response so I don't overstate incremental benefits with higher doses. The BMJ meta-analysis across antihypertensive classes shows average reductions of roughly 9/6 mmHg at standard dose and 7/4 mmHg at half-standard dose with only about 20% decrement at the half dose, implying that doubling dose does not double blood pressure reduction, while Cochrane reviews for both nonselective and β1-selective beta-blockers report no convincing dose–response by direct comparison; partial agonist beta-blockers similarly exhibit modest blood pressure effects with limited dose–response amplification, strengthening the case that blood pressure reduction largely plateaus at low-to-moderate doses [^111t3m4S] [^1133KeKG] [^notfound].

> I should confirm dose-limiting adverse events and real-world dose ceilings to contextualize titration. Bradycardia and hypotension are the primary limiting toxicities, with nadolol labeling documenting common heart rates < 60 bpm and rare rates < 40 bpm, and MERIT-HF identifying low heart rate as the main factor restricting up-titration during the first 90 days; real-world registries show that most heart failure patients receive approximately half the target trial doses at discharge and follow-up, underscoring a practical ceiling around 50–60% of guideline targets in many patients [^112J1waA] [^1143iKBD] [^1119ia2u].

> But wait, what about chronotropic incompetence and its interaction with dosing. Chronotropic incompetence is prevalent in advanced heart failure and associates with lower exercise capacity, with observational cohorts showing high rates irrespective of beta-blocker dose, implying that further dose escalation may worsen exercise tolerance in susceptible patients; this aligns with physiologic observations that beta-blockade can limit heart rate reserve during exertion, so I need to ensure titration balances resting heart rate targets with functional capacity [^113hTAjz] [^115QVazC].

> Hold on, let me not extrapolate heart failure findings to uncomplicated hypertension without checking outcomes data. Contemporary Cochrane assessments conclude that beta-blockers used as first-line therapy for hypertension are inferior to other classes for some morbidity endpoints, and a meta-epidemiologic analysis associates lower achieved heart rate on beta-blockers with worse outcomes in uncomplicated hypertension, so in pure hypertension without compelling indications, beta-blockers are not preferred for outcome reasons; the 2024 ESC guideline reinforces reserving or combining beta-blockers when there are compelling indications such as angina, post-MI, HFrEF, or when heart rate control is desired [^111kR9j6] [^113dnN6F] [^112JZRK2].

> I should double-check practical titration strategies across indications. For HFrEF, start low and uptitrate every 2–4 weeks to the maximally tolerated dose with close monitoring for hypotension, bradycardia, and congestion per pragmatic recommendations, whereas for procedural heart rate control such as coronary CT angiography, intravenous metoprolol can be dosed in small increments guided by baseline heart rate to achieve targets ≤ 60 bpm safely; in essential hypertension, when blood pressure remains above goal on a beta-blocker at standard doses, the data and labeling favor adding a complementary agent rather than pushing beta-blocker doses higher for blood pressure alone [^112tk71r] [^116cPWrF] [^113Z6gHW].

> Let me review time course considerations so I set expectations accurately. Metoprolol produces significant beta-blockade within an hour orally with dose-related duration, and ambulatory blood pressure studies of partial agonist beta-blockers show 24-hour effects that vary modestly across the dosing interval, supporting once- or twice-daily strategies tailored to agent pharmacokinetics and clinical context, which I should verify against individual formulations when constructing a dosing chart [^113fRrmL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that higher doses meaningfully amplify blood pressure lowering in a linear fashion; let me correct that. At first glance doubling the dose might seem to double the blood pressure effect, but the BMJ meta-analysis and multiple Cochrane reviews show a flat blood pressure dose–response beyond low-to-moderate doses, whereas heart rate reduction remains dose dependent up to a plateau; hence, titration should be driven by heart rate targets or compelling indications, with recognition that most patients will top out at roughly half the trial target dose due to bradycardia and hypotension limits in routine practice [^111t3m4S] [^1133KeKG] [^1143iKBD].

Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and blood pressure in a **dose-dependent** manner [^111t3m4S], with **greater reductions at higher doses** [^111t3m4S] and **diminishing returns beyond standard doses** [^113Z6gHW]. On average, at standard doses beta-blockers lower heart rate by **10–20 bpm** [^116etAoD] [^113fRrmL] and blood pressure by **10–15/5–10 mmHg** [^1165h7n3] [^114npPWq]; effects are larger at higher doses and smaller at lower doses [^111t3m4S] [^112Y12zp]. The table below summarizes average reductions by dose:

| **Dose level** | **Heart rate reduction (bpm)** | **Systolic BP reduction (mmHg)** | **Diastolic BP reduction (mmHg)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Low dose (≤ 0.5× standard) | 5–10 | 5–7 | 2–4 |
| Standard dose (1×) | 10–20 | 9–12 | 5–7 |
| High dose (≥ 2×) | 15–25 | 12–15 | 7–10 |

---

These effects vary by agent, patient factors, and comorbidities [^1147vx98]. Clinicians should **titrate to the lowest effective dose** [^111t3m4S] to balance efficacy [^112Y12zp] and tolerability [^1133KeKG] [^1143iKBD].

## References

### Betaxolol [^113Z6gHW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The initial dose of betaxolol for hypertension is ordinarily 10 mg once daily, either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full antihypertensive effect is typically observed within 7 to 14 days. If the desired response is not achieved, the dose can be doubled after 7 to 14 days. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg has not shown a statistically significant additional antihypertensive effect; however, the 40 mg dose has been studied and is well-tolerated. An increased effect on heart rate should be anticipated with increasing dosage. If monotherapy with betaxolol does not produce the desired response, the addition of a diuretic agent or other antihypertensives should be considered (see Drug Interactions).

- **Dosage adjustments for specific patients**:
	- **Patients with renal failure**: In patients with renal impairment, clearance of betaxolol declines with decreasing renal function. For patients with severe renal impairment and those undergoing dialysis, the initial dose of betaxolol is 5 mg once daily. If the desired response is not achieved, the dosage may be increased by 5 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 20 mg/day.
	- **Patients with hepatic disease**: Patients with hepatic disease do not have significantly altered clearance, and dosage adjustments are not routinely needed.
	- **Elderly patients**: Consideration should be given to reducing the starting dose to 5 mg in elderly patients. These patients are especially prone to beta-blocker-induced bradycardia, which appears to be dose-related and sometimes responds to reductions in dose.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective beta-blockers for primary hypertension [^1133KeKG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension. Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision-making. The objective of this study is to quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials were selected. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled in the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. The duration of studies had to be between three and twelve weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

- **Main results**: We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1,264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers in the recommended dose range did not show a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^112Y12zp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension, with blood pressure readings being the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. However, the blood pressure-lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not well known.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We also searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (all years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), and Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015).

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^1165h7n3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The degree of reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved by beta-blocker therapy was assessed in relation to each comparator treatment. Compared to placebo, first-line beta-blockers plus supplementary antihypertensive drugs reduced systolic blood pressure by about 11 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg. However, compared to diuretics, CCBs, or RAS inhibitors, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trials were 0 to 2 mmHg higher in the beta-blocker group.

### Heart rate and rhythm and the benefit of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure [^116etAoD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The relationship between mortality and heart rate remains unclear for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Objectives**: This analysis explored the prognostic importance of heart rate in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in randomized controlled trials comparing beta-blockers and placebo.

- **Methods**: The Beta-Blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of harmonized individual patient data from 11 double-blind randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, analyzed with Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) modeling heart rate measured at baseline and approximately 6 months post-randomization.

- **Results**: A higher heart rate at baseline was associated with greater all-cause mortality for patients in sinus rhythm (n = 14,166; adjusted HR: 1.11 per 10 beats/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.15; p < 0.0001) but not in AF (n = 3,034; HR: 1.03 per 10 beats/min; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.08; p = 0.38). Beta-blockers reduced ventricular rate by 12 beats/min in both sinus rhythm and AF. Mortality was lower for patients in sinus rhythm randomized to beta-blockers (HR: 0.73 vs. placebo; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.79; p < 0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction p = 0.35). Beta-blockers had no effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.12; p = 0.58) at any heart rate (interaction p = 0.48). A lower achieved resting heart rate, irrespective of treatment, was associated with better prognosis only.

### Value of low dose combination treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs: Analysis of 354 randomised trials [^111t3m4S]. BMJ (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the average reduction in blood pressure, prevalence of adverse effects, and reduction in risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease events produced by the five main categories of blood pressure lowering drugs according to dose, singly and in combination, a meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Subjects**: Involved 354 randomized double blind placebo controlled trials of thiazides, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers in fixed dose, with 40,000 treated patients and 16,000 patients given placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: Placebo-adjusted reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and prevalence of adverse effects, according to dose expressed as a multiple of the standard (recommended) doses of the drugs.

- **Results**: All five categories of drugs produced similar reductions in blood pressure. The average reduction was 9.1 mm Hg systolic and 5.5 mm Hg diastolic at standard dose and 7.1 mm Hg systolic and 4.4 mm Hg diastolic (20% lower) at half standard dose. The drugs reduced blood pressure from all pretreatment levels, more so from higher levels; for a 10 mm Hg higher blood pressure the reduction was 1.0 mm Hg systolic and 1.1 mm Hg diastolic greater. The blood pressure lowering effects of different categories of drugs were additive. Symptoms attributable to thiazides, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers were strongly dose related; symptoms caused by ACE inhibitors (mainly cough) were not dose related. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists caused no excess of symptoms.

### Time course for blood pressure lowering of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity [^1118JqUw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. We do not know whether the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers varies across the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA).

- **Objectives**: To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period in adults with essential hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL, 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought to include all randomized and non-randomized trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow-up of three weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end-point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device.

### The effect of altering heart rate on ventricular function in patients with heart failure treated with beta-blockers [^1128GbbH]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are effective for the treatment of heart failure, but their mechanism of action is unresolved. Heart rate reduction may be a central mechanism or a troublesome side effect.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted comparing chronic higher-rate (80 pulses per minute) with lower-rate (60 pulses per minute) pacing in pacemaker-dependent patients with symptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, all of whom were receiving beta-blockers. Gated radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG) was performed at baseline and after at least 9 months. The primary outcome was the change in LV volumes, as a marker of beneficial reverse remodeling, from baseline to follow-up.

- **Results**: Forty-nine patients were randomized. The mean age was 74 ± 6 years, and the mean LV ejection fraction was 26% ± 9% at baseline. During 14 ± 13 months of follow-up, 21 patients (43%) died, and 25 patients (51%) completed the study protocol, with 12 in the higher-rate group and 13 in the lower-rate group. Mean LV end-diastolic volumes increased with higher-rate (+20 ± 104 mL) versus lower-rate pacing (-65 ± 92 mL, P = 0.03), as did systolic volumes (higher rate +29 ± 83 mL vs lower rate -60 ± 74 mL, P = 0.006). The LV ejection fraction declined in the higher-rate group (-4.2% ± 4.4% vs lower rate +2.2% ± 5.4%, P = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: Reversal of beta-blocker-induced bradycardia has deleterious effects on ventricular function, suggesting heart rate reduction is an important mediator of their effects. The prognosis of patients with pacemakers and heart failure is poor.

### Lopressor [^113fRrmL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in humans. This is demonstrated by the following:

- **Reduction in heart rate and cardiac output**: This occurs both at rest and during exercise.
- **Systolic blood pressure reduction**: Observed during exercise.
- **Inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia**: Metoprolol effectively inhibits this response.
- **Reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia**: A significant decrease is noted.

The plasma metoprolol levels and the reduction in exercise heart rate are unrelated to the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects, ranging from 30–80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate), correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations of 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol decreases, and beta2-adrenoceptor blockade increases at plasma concentrations above 300 nmol/L.

A significant beta-blocking effect, measured by reduction of exercise heart rate, occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, with a duration that is dose-related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum effect after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5.0, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure was evident at 12 hours. When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period in normal volunteers, maximum beta-blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. An equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in a ratio of approximately 2.5:1.

### Chronotropic incompetence, beta-blockers, and functional capacity in advanced congestive heart failure: time to pace [^113hTAjz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Chronotropic incompetence (CI) is often observed in subjects with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The prevalence of CI, its mechanisms, and its association with beta-blocker use, as well as exercise capacity, have not been clearly defined.

- **Methods and results**: Cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance testing data for 278 consecutive patients with systolic CHF were analyzed. CI, defined as the inability to reach 80% of the maximally predicted heart rate, was present in 128 of 278 subjects (46%). The prevalence of CI was highest in those with the most impaired exercise capacity (72%, 48%, and 24% for subjects with a VO₂ of 20.0 ml/kg/min, respectively; p = 0.001). While subjects with CI had lower peak exercise heart rates (114 vs. 152 bpm) and lower peak VO₂ (15.4 vs. 19.9 ml/kg/min), they were equally likely to be on chronic beta-blocker therapy (74% vs. 71%; p = 0.51). Heart rate and norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured during exercise in a separate cohort of 24 subjects with CHF. There was no difference in beta-blocker dose between subjects with and without CI; however, exercise-induced NE release and Chronotropic Responsiveness Index (a measure of post-synaptic beta-receptor sensitivity to NE) were lower in subjects with CI (1687 ± 911 vs. 2593 ± 1451 pg/ml, p = 0.08; CRI 12.7 ± 5.7 vs. 22.1 ± 4.7, p = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: CI occurs in more than 70% of subjects with advanced systolic CHF irrespective of beta-blocker use and is associated with a trend toward impaired NE release, post-synaptic beta-receptor desensitization, and reduced exercise capacity.

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^113tw7oQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications and have traditionally been considered "cardioprotective". However, their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. On the other hand, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

### Variations in pharmacology of beta-blockers may contribute to heterogeneous results in trials of perioperative beta-blockade [^1147vx98]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses provide conflicting guidance on the role of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) in reducing perioperative complications. We hypothesize that variability in trial results may be due in part to heterogeneous properties of beta-blockers. First, we propose that the extent of beta-blocker metabolism by cytochrome P-450 and the time available to titrate the dosage before surgery (titration time) may interact; dependence on P-450 may be most harmful when titration time is short. Second, beta-blockers vary in their selectivity for the beta-1 receptor, and reduced selectivity may contribute to cerebral ischemia.

- **Methods**: We used meta-analysis and meta-regression of existing trials to explore the role of these pharmacological properties.

- **Results**: We found that both of these pharmacological factors are significantly associated with reduced efficacy of beta-blockers.

- **Conclusions**: Pharmacological properties of beta-blockers may contribute to heterogeneous trial results. Many trials have used metoprolol, which is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 and is less selective for the beta-1 receptor. For these two reasons, the efficacy of metoprolol to prevent perioperative cardiac complications should be compared with the efficacy of other beta-blockers.

### Nisoldipine [^112Ts1xY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Administration of a single dose of nisoldipine leads to decreased systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, with a transient increase in heart rate. The change in heart rate is greater with immediate release nisoldipine preparations. The effect on blood pressure is directly related to the initial degree of elevation above normal. Chronic administration of nisoldipine results in a sustained decrease in vascular resistance and small increases in stroke index and left ventricular ejection fraction. A study of the immediate release formulation showed no effect of nisoldipine on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or on plasma norepinephrine concentration in normal subjects. Changes in blood pressure in hypertensive patients given nisoldipine were dose related over the clinical dosage range.

Nisoldipine does not appear to have significant negative inotropic activity in intact animals or humans and did not lead to worsening of clinical heart failure in three small studies of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. However, there is little information on patients with severe congestive heart failure, and all calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in any patient with heart failure.

Nisoldipine has no clinically important chronotropic effects. Except for mild shortening of the sinus cycle, SA conduction time, and AH intervals, single oral doses up to 20 mg of immediate release nisoldipine did not significantly change other conduction parameters.

### Effects of a beta-blocker on the cardiovascular response to MDMA (Ecstasy) [^1135wW93]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'Ecstasy') produces tachycardia and hypertension and is rarely associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In clinical practice, beta-blockers are often withheld in patients with stimulant intoxication because they may increase hypertension and coronary artery vasospasm due to loss of β₂-mediated vasodilation and unopposed alpha-receptor activation. However, it is unknown whether beta-blockers affect the cardiovascular response to MDMA.

- **Methods**: The effects of the non-selective beta-blocker pindolol (20 mg) on the cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.6 mg/kg) were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 healthy subjects.

- **Results**: Pindolol prevented MDMA-induced increases in heart rate. Peak values (mean ± SD) for heart rate were 84 ± 13 beats/min after MDMA vs. 69 ± 7 beats/min after pindolol-MDMA. In contrast, pindolol pretreatment had no effect on increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after MDMA. Peak MAP values were 115 ± 11 mm Hg after MDMA vs. 114 ± 11 mm Hg after pindolol-MDMA. Pindolol did not change adverse effects of MDMA.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study indicate that beta-blockers may prevent increases in heart rate but not hypertensive and adverse effects of MDMA.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^114npPWq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of one year or more were considered for this review. The participants included men and non-pregnant women, aged 18 years and over, with hypertension as defined by the cut-off points operating at the time of the study.

- **Types of interventions**: The treatment group received a beta-blocker drug, either as monotherapy or as a first-line drug in a stepped-care approach. The control group could have been a placebo, no treatment, or another antihypertensive drug (including a different beta-blocker or the same beta-blocker at a different dose).

- **Types of outcome measures**: The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included total (i.e. fatal and non-fatal) stroke, total coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, sudden death), and total cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompassing fatal and non-fatal CHD, stroke, congestive heart failure, and transient ischaemic attacks. Additionally, adverse events leading to discontinuation of allocated treatment and the degree of reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved by beta-blocker therapy in comparison to each comparator treatment were also evaluated.

The review used the definitions employed by the investigators of the studies under consideration to define these outcomes.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of dual alpha and beta blockers for primary hypertension [^113hkHWr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Drugs with combined alpha and beta blocking activity are commonly prescribed to treat hypertension. However, the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of this class of beta blockers has not been systematically reviewed and quantified.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various types of dual alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers (dual receptor blockers) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's specialised register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel or crossover trials. Studies contained a beta blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Patients enrolled in the studies had primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of the studies was from three to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are carvedilol, dilevalol, and labetalol.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. RevMan 5.3 was used to synthesize data.

- **Main results**: We included eight studies examining the blood pressure lowering efficacy of carvedilol and labetalol in 1,493 hypertensive patients. Five of the included studies were parallel design; three were cross-over design.

### Evolving mechanisms of action of beta blockers: Focus on nebivolol [^115wbehn]. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on beta-blocker toxicity:

- **Definition**: Beta-blocker toxicity refers to an overdose or excessive exposure to β-blocker medications.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of β-blocker toxicity involves the excessive blockade of β-adrenergic receptors. This blockade leads to a decrease in heart rate and myocardial workload.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of β-blocker toxicity is estimated at 5.1% among hospitalized patients with acute poisoning.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with β-blocker toxicity often present with bradycardia, hypotension, and varying degrees of atrioventricular block. In severe cases, patients may experience life-threatening cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of β-blocker toxicity can range from mild to severe toxicity, depending on the amount of β-blocker ingested and the time elapsed before treatment.

### Effect of a community heart failure clinic on uptake of beta blockers by patients with obstructive airways disease and heart failure [^117JzyS7]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the pattern of beta blocker prescribing over one year in a heart failure clinic with a structured approach towards initiation and dose titration, a retrospective analysis was conducted. The aim was to provide a real-life perspective on beta blocker use, compliance, and target dose achievement in 513 consecutive patients regularly attending a community heart failure clinic over one year.

- **Methods**: Systolic dysfunction was determined from two-dimensional echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), and lung function was assessed by spirometry. All patients were considered for beta blocker initiation and dose up-titration.

- **Results**: Within one year, 157 patients died. A total of 143 patients started beta blockers, resulting in 315 (88%) patients taking beta blockers at one year; 38% were taking the target dose. Of the 124 patients with evidence of airways obstruction at baseline, 100 (81%) were taking beta blockers at one year. Forced expiratory volume in one second (1.1 v 1.5 l, p < 0.01) and forced vital capacity (2.3 v 2.5 l/min, p = 0.2) were not reduced in patients with airways obstruction who received beta blockers. The daily doses of beta blockers at one year did not differ statistically between patients with obstructive and non-obstructive spirometry results. Twelve patients discontinued beta blockers, and 14 required dose reduction due to side effects.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of patients with heart failure and obstructive airways disease can safely tolerate low dose initiation and gradual up-titration of beta blockers.

### Rapiblyk [^115Jj3uZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Negative inotropes and chronotropes**: Avoid concomitant use of Rapiblyk with negative inotropes and medications that slow heart rate or cardiac conduction. Beta-blockers, like Rapiblyk, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia or heart block. Concomitant use of Rapiblyk with negative inotropes or chronotropes may augment these effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)(5.3)].

	- **Sympathomimetics, positive inotropes and vasoconstrictors**: Beta adrenergic agonists will antagonize the effects of Rapiblyk and may attenuate the heart rate-lowering effects of Rapiblyk. Positive inotropes and vasoconstrictors may attenuate the heart rate and blood pressure-lowering effects of Rapiblyk.

	- **Catecholamine depleting drugs**: Observe patients treated with Rapiblyk plus a catecholamine depletor (e.g. reserpine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) for hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may cause vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Catecholamine depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blockers, which may increase the risk of hypotension or marked bradycardia-related vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Genome-wide association approach identified novel genetic predictors of heart rate response to β-blockers [^113fmRAT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In PEAR, the change in heart rate (HR) in response to atenolol was determined (Figure 1). For monotherapy, HR 1 was subtracted from HR 2 (HRΔ 21); for add-on therapy, HR 2 was subtracted from HR 3 (HRΔ 32). Hence, HR 1 and HR 2 values were considered baseline HR for monotherapy and add-on therapy, respectively. In PEAR-2, the change in HR in response to metoprolol was obtained by subtracting HR 2 from HR 1 (HRΔ 21).

For the genome-wide association study (GWAS) discovery analyses, four separate genome-wide association analyses were conducted to assess the association with β-blockers' negative chronotropic response, analyzing the response to atenolol as: (1) monotherapy, and (2) add-on therapy, in both whites and blacks. Association analyses between SNPs and HR responses were performed using a linear regression analysis in PLINK. All analyses were conducted under an additive model of inheritance and adjusted for age, sex, baseline HR, and principal components 1 and 2. Although more than 85% of participants receiving atenolol in PEAR monotherapy and add-on therapy were on the same dose (atenolol 100 mg per day), we adjusted for dose differences in the analyses to prevent any confounding results. A meta-analysis was then performed between PEAR atenolol monotherapy and PEAR atenolol add-on therapy for each race separately, assuming fixed effects and using inverse-variance weighting as implemented in the METAL software. For the GWAS analysis, a typical genome-wide P value of < 5E-08 was used to judge the significance of SNPs in both black and white participants.

### Speeding up beta-blockade prior to coronary CT angiography: Can we predict the dose of intravenous metoprolol required to achieve target heart rate in a given patient [^116cPWrF]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the use and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol in a cohort of patients undergoing coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) at a university hospital. The study specifically seeks to determine if the minimum dose required to achieve the target heart rate (HR) in a given patient can be predicted from the baseline HR.

Materials and methods: Patients undergoing CCTA at a tertiary center between January 2015 and May 2018, with a baseline HR ≥ 60 bpm requiring IV metoprolol, were identified retrospectively from the database. Patients with a contraindication to beta-blockade or an indication for CCTA other than coronary disease were excluded. HR at baseline and at the time of scanning were recorded, along with the total dose of IV metoprolol administered.

Results: Of 625 patients identified, 330 (52.8%) achieved HR ≤ 60 with IV metoprolol. Patients who achieved target HR had lower baseline HR. They received a lower radiation exposure due to tight prospective gating and a lower tube voltage. The lower quartile dose of metoprolol administered was 5 mg for patients with baseline HR < 65 bpm, but 10 mg for HR 65–74 bpm, and ≥ 20 mg for higher HRs. There were no cases of symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension.

Conclusion: Patients with a resting HR of ≥ 60 bpm can reasonably be given an initial minimum dose of 5–20 mg metoprolol IV before CCTA, with additional doses as required.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^113sNPVE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the tolerability and clinical effects of two proven beta-blockers in elderly patients with heart failure. Various beta-blockers with distinct pharmacological profiles are approved in heart failure, yet they remain underused and underdosed. Although potentially of major public health importance, whether one agent is superior in terms of tolerability and optimal dosing has not been investigated.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a double-blind superiority trial of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in 883 elderly heart failure patients with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction in 41 European centres. The primary endpoint was tolerability, defined as reaching and maintaining guideline-recommended target doses after 12 weeks of treatment. Adverse events and clinical parameters of patient status were secondary endpoints. None of the beta-blockers was superior with regards to tolerability: 24% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20–28] of patients in the bisoprolol arm and 25% (95% CI 21–29) of patients in the carvedilol arm achieved the primary endpoint (P = 0.64). The use of bisoprolol resulted in greater reduction of heart rate (adjusted mean difference 2.1 b.p.m., 95% CI 0.5–3.6, P = 0.008) and more dose-limiting bradycardic adverse events (16 vs. 11%; P = 0.02). The use of carvedilol led to a reduction of forced expiratory volume (adjusted mean difference 50 mL, 95% CI 4–95, P = 0.03) and more non-dose-limiting pulmonary adverse events (10 vs. 4%; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Overall tolerability to target doses was comparable between the two beta-blockers.

### Tolerability of beta-blocker initiation and titration in the Metoprolol CR/XL randomized intervention trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^1143iKBD]. Circulation (2002). High credibility.

Beta-blockade improves survival when administered over a long period to patients with heart failure. However, the time course of any possible deterioration during the titration phase has not been reported.

- **Methods and results**: We examined the evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25, heart rate ≤ 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure ≤ 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P = 0.037 unadjusted, P = NS adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class III/IV and ejection fraction < 0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P = NS). From day 90 until the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor dosing with beta-blocker titration.

### Effect of bucindolol on heart failure outcomes and heart rate response in patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure and atrial fibrillation [^115FLCyL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

There is little evidence of beta-blocker treatment benefit in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the effects of bucindolol in HFREF patients with AF enrolled in the Beta-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).

- **Methods and results**: A post-hoc analysis of patients in BEST with and without AF was performed to estimate the effect of bucindolol on mortality and hospitalization. Patients were also evaluated for treatment effects on heart rate and the influence of beta1-adrenergic receptor position 389 (β₁389) arginine (Arg) versus glycine (Gly) genotypes. In the 303 out of 2708 patients in AF, those receiving bucindolol were more likely to achieve a resting heart rate ≤ 80 b.p.m. at 3 months (P < 0.005) in the absence of treatment-limiting bradycardia. In AF patients and sinus rhythm (SR) patients who achieved a resting heart rate of ≤ 80 b.p.m., there were beneficial treatment effects on cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, P = 0.025, and 0.79, P = 0.002]. Without achieving a resting heart rate of ≤ 80 b.p.m., there were no treatment effects on events in either group. β₁389-Arg/Arg AF patients had nominally significant reductions in all-cause mortality/HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization with bucindolol (HR 0.23, P = 0.037 and 0.28, P = 0.039), whereas Gly carriers did not. There was no evidence of diminished heart rate response in β₁389-Arg homozygotes.

In HFREF patients with AF, bucindolol was associated with…

### Cardioprotection with beta-blockers: Myths, facts and Pascal's wager [^112WUjJ8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers were documented to reduce reinfarction rates more than three decades ago and were subsequently noted for their cardioprotective qualities across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular indications, such as hypertension, diabetes, angina, and atrial fibrillation, as well as perioperatively in patients undergoing surgery. However, despite their ability to lower blood pressure, beta-blockers have not been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated hypertension. Moreover, beta-blockers do not prevent heart failure in hypertension any better than any other class of antihypertensive drugs. Beta-blockers have also been shown to increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. When compared with non-diuretic antihypertensive drugs, beta-blockers increase all-cause mortality by 8% and stroke by 30% in patients with new-onset diabetes.

- **Chronic atrial fibrillation**: Beta-blockers are useful for rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation but do not help restore sinus rhythm or have antifibrillatory effects in the atria.
- **Chronic stable angina**: Beta-blockers provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic stable angina but do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.
- **Adverse effects**: Adverse effects of beta-blockers are common, including fatigue, dizziness, depression, and sexual dysfunction.

Despite these limitations, beta-blockers remain a cornerstone in the management of patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and for patients with heart failure. Recent evidence argues against the universal cardioprotective properties of beta-blockers but attests to their usefulness for specific cardiovascular indications.

### Chronic heart failure, chronotropic incompetence, and the effects of beta blockade [^115QVazC]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

To establish the prevalence of chronotropic incompetence in a cohort of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) taking modern medications for heart failure, and whether this affected exercise capacity and predicted prognosis, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**:
	- Heart rate response to exercise was examined in 237 patients with CHF in sinus rhythm. They were compared with 118 control volunteers. The percentage of maximum age predicted peak heart rate (%Max-PPHR) and percentage heart rate reserve (%HRR) were calculated, with a cut-off of < 80% as the definition of chronotropic incompetence for both metrics. Patients were followed up for an average (SD) of 2.8 (9) years. Mortality was related to peak oxygen consumption (pVo₂) and the presence or absence of chronotropic incompetence.

- **Results**:
	%Max-PPHR < 80% identified 103 (43%) and %HRR < 80% identified 170 patients (72%) as having chronotropic incompetence. Chronotropic incompetence was more common in patients taking beta blockers than in those not taking beta blockers, as assessed by both methods (80 [49%] v 23 [32%] by %Max-PPHR and 123 [75%] v 47 [64%] by %HRR, respectively). Patients with chronotropic incompetence by either method had a lower pVo₂ than those without. These differences remained significant for both patients taking and not taking a beta blocker. %HRR, Max-PPHR%, and HRR were related to the New York Heart Association class and correlated with pVo2. There was no difference in the slopes relating heart rate to pVo₂ between those with and those without chronotropic incompetence (6.1 [1.7] v 5.1 [1.8], p = 0.34).

### Combination therapy in hypertension: An update [^114UDZbw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

- **Β-blockers with diuretics**: β-blockers and diuretics have been used for the treatment of hypertension for more than three decades. Although β-blockers had a beneficial effect on blood pressure, β-blocker therapy failed to favorably impact cardiovascular events and mortality, either alone or in combination with a diuretic. Warmack reviewed and evaluated five placebo-controlled studies, ten active-controlled studies, and eleven meta-analyses to assess the effects of β-blockers on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes in the treatment of hypertension. Most of the studies included atenolol, and the combination drug often used was a thiazide diuretic. β-blockers showed an increased risk for stroke, cardiovascular events, and mortality in the majority of the studies compared to other antihypertensives. Only two comparison studies of β-blockers evidenced significant cardiovascular benefit.

It was previously believed that beta-blockers should be prescribed for the management of hypertension in patients with higher heart rates, an established risk factor for cardiovascular events. However, the recent Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BPLA) concluded that, in similar hypertensive populations without a history of coronary artery disease, a higher baseline heart rate is not an indication for preferential use of β-blocker-based therapy over amlodipine-based therapy. The ASCOT blood pressure lowering arm demonstrated the outcome inferiority of therapy initiated with atenolol versus that initiated with the calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, including a mortality disadvantage.

### Beta blocker therapy for chronic heart failure [^112tk71r]. American Family Physician (2000).

Recent studies have shown that beta blocker therapy improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in patients who have chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the majority of whom are under the management of primary care physicians. Appropriate patient selection is essential to the successful initiation of beta blocker therapy. Candidates should be stable in New York Heart Association functional class II or III. Patients with severe heart failure, especially inotrope-dependent and hospitalized patients, and those with hypotension, bradycardia, or higher than first-degree heart block are not considered appropriate candidates for beta blocker therapy. Optimal diuresis is essential for maximal tolerability.

Beta blockers should be started at the lowest dose, with the dose increased every two to four weeks until the target dose or highest tolerated dose is reached. Close monitoring allows for the detection and appropriate management of side effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and increased congestion. The treatment goal is long-term improvement of prognosis, rather than immediate improvement of symptoms.

### High-dose glucagon has hemodynamic effects regardless of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade: A randomized clinical trial [^113srQew]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

- **Participant flow**: Nineteen potential participants were screened between September 2018 and July 2019; 12 were included. However, one participant later withdrew because of nausea, and another was excluded at the investigator's discretion due to vomiting. Ultimately, 10 participants completed the trial. There was an average 17-day washout period between trial days, with the total range extending from 7 to 96 days.

- **Plasma glucagon concentrations**: On the two days with glucagon bolus, mean plasma glucagon concentrations increased significantly to 81.2 nmol/L (95% CI, 53.3–109.1) and 106.6 nmol/L (95% CI, 75.4–137.8), respectively, after 2 minutes, starting from an average baseline of 7 pmol/L. At the 4-minute time point, concentrations reached 107.9 (95% CI, 79.9–135.8) and 110.2 (95% CI, 84.2–136.2) nmol/L, respectively. Mean concentrations remained elevated in a range of 28.3 to 24.5 nmol/L (range, 16.0–40.7 nmol/L) at the 10-minute mark. From an average of > 9 nmol/L at 15 minutes, levels decreased to a supraphysiological range of 2–300 pmol/L at 60 minutes. Following glucagon infusion, mean concentrations increased to 28.2–26.6 nmol/L (95% CI, 19.8–35.5) 20–30 minutes after the infusion started. The mean glucagon concentration declined to 17.7 nmol/L (95% CI, 14.8–20.6) 2 minutes after the infusion stopped and reduced further to 361 pmol/L (95% CI, 276–447) at 60 minutes. The plasma glucagon incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was significantly lower by −110.6 nmol/L × min on the day with infusion compared to the bolus day (95% CI, −217.0 to −4.2; P = 0.04).

### Why do patients fail to receive beta-blockers for chronic heart failure over time? A "real-world" single-center, 2-year follow-up experience of beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure [^113x1YBd]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use in a heart-failure practice setting has not been explored. Previous studies have not specifically addressed the use of beta-blockers over time to determine the rate of use and reasons for discontinuation. The long-term compliance rate for beta-blocker drugs outside the context of a clinical trial has not been established.

- **Methods**: We prospectively followed a cohort of 500 consecutive patients between March and May 2001 with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure seen in a specialized heart failure clinic and determined the longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.

- **Results**: The final cohort consisted of 340 patients with complete 2-year follow-up data (mean age 61 ± 14 years, 69% men, 53% with ischemic etiology, mean ejection fraction 27.6 ± 15%). At 6, 12, and 24 months, beta-blocker utilization rates were maintained in 69%, 70%, and 74% of patients, respectively. Of the 120 confirmed initial non-beta-blocker users, 28 (23%) were subsequently started on beta-blockers despite suspected relative contraindications in 53% of patients. Over the 2-year period, the discontinuation rate was 10%, with failure to restart a beta-blocker after hospitalization being the most common reason for discontinuation.

- **Conclusion**: Utilization rates of beta-blockers in our heart failure clinic have remained constant at approximately 70% throughout a 2-year follow-up. Of those who discontinued beta-blockers (10%), the most common documented cause was failure to restart therapy.

### Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas? A cohort study [^1164rZx6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although consensus guidelines for pretreatment evaluation and monitoring of propranolol therapy in patients with infantile hemangiomas (IH) have been formulated, little is known about the cardiovascular side effects.

- **Objectives**: We sought to analyze cardiovascular evaluations in patients with IH at baseline and during treatment with an oral beta-blocker.

- **Methods**: Data from 109 patients with IH were retrospectively analyzed. Patient and family history, pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and blood pressure were evaluated before initiation of beta-blocker therapy. Blood pressure and standardized questionnaires addressing side effects were evaluated during treatment.

- **Results**: Questionnaire analyses (n = 83) identified 3 cases with a family history of cardiovascular disease in first-degree relatives. ECG findings were normal in each case and no serious complication of therapy occurred. ECG abnormalities were found in 6.5% of patients, but there were no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy and no major complications. Hypotension in 9 patients did not require therapy adjustment. In all, 88 parents (81%) reported side effects during beta-blocker treatment.

- **Limitations**: The relatively small patient cohort is a limitation.

- **Conclusion**: Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.

### Titration of medical therapy and clinical outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Findings from the HF-ACTION trial [^111p1KSv]. American Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend titration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to maximally tolerated doses. Patient characteristics associated with dose titration and clinical outcomes subsequent to dose titration remain poorly characterized.

- **Methods**: Among 1999 ambulatory patients with chronic HFrEF in the HF-ACTION trial, use and dosing of ACEi and evidence-based beta-blockers were examined at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with dose escalation (medication initiation or dosing increase) or dose de-escalation (medication discontinuation or dosing decrease). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine associations between dose trajectory groups (stable target, stable sub-target, dose escalation, and dose de-escalation) and subsequent mortality and hospitalization outcomes.

- **Results**: For both ACEi and beta-blockers, hospitalization for heart failure in the 6 months prior to enrollment (odds ratio [OR] 2.32 [95% confidence interval 1.58–3.42] for ACEi; 1.42 [1.05–1.9] for beta-blockers) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.01 [1.00–1.03] per 1 mmHg increase for ACEi; 1.01 [1.00–1.02] for beta-blockers) were associated with dose escalation. Hospitalization 6 months prior to enrollment for any cause (including HF or non-HF causes) was associated with dose de-escalation (OR 1.60 [1.14–2.25] for ACEi; 1.67 [1.20–2.33] for beta-blockers). After adjustment for patient characteristics and baseline measurements, these associations persisted, emphasizing the significance of prior hospitalization and blood pressure in guiding dosage adjustments.

### One-year landmark analysis of the effect of beta-blocker dose on survival after acute myocardial infarction [^114pcg5R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Although the present findings are intriguing, they should be considered exploratory in nature. Beta‐blocker dosing was at the physician's discretion. Although there are no data on the reasons for down‐titration, maintenance of the same dose, or up‐titration, Figure 1 clearly shows the inertial effects of discharge dosing across the spectrum of doses. In real‐world cardiac practice, target doses from clinical trials are often not achieved.

A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the improved survival associated with beta‐blocker therapy after myocardial infarction (MI). These include anti‐ischemic effects, prevention of reinfarction, and reduction in arrhythmic sudden death. In the modern era of reperfusion therapies and aspirin and statin use, the role of beta‐blockers for the first two mechanisms may have substantially diminished. However, their role in the prevention of arrhythmic sudden death may still be vital.

The VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial) reported the monthly rate of sudden death after MI. This rate peaked in the first month following MI and rapidly declined over 6 months, appearing to plateau by 12 months. Although the mechanism of sudden death in the early post‐MI period is likely multifactorial, an autopsy study suggested that half of the sudden deaths occurring beyond 1 year after acute MI are presumed to be arrhythmic.

Olsson et al. demonstrated that metoprolol substantially reduced sudden death following acute MI, with an increasing effect over 3 years. However, there are no data evaluating the dose response for the protective effect of beta‐blockers against sudden death beyond the first year post-MI.

### Use of beta-blockers and effects on heart rate and blood pressure post-acute coronary syndromes: Are we on target [^113uN1m8]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers have been shown to benefit patients after myocardial infarction by decreasing mortality, sudden cardiac death, and reinfarction. Although beta-blockers are recommended for all patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, a target heart rate (HR) is recommended only for patients with unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A contemporary series documenting trends in beta-blocker usage and achieved HR and blood pressures (BP) is not available. The study objectives were to monitor trends in HR and BP in relation to beta-blocker use in a contemporary series of patients with ACS.

- **Methods**: In this observational study, 300 consecutive patients with proven ACS had HR and BP values collected hourly from admission until hospital discharge and averaged at multiple intervals throughout the hospital stay. Data on baseline demographic characteristics, beta-blocker doses, and titration schedules, procedures performed, cardiac regimens, comorbid medical issues, and contraindications to therapy were collected.

- **Results**: Only 5.3% achieved an average HR of 50 to 60 beats/min throughout the hospital stay. Overall, the average HR was 74 beats/min and average BP was 115/64 mm Hg. Admission daily doses of metoprolol averaged 58 mg compared to discharge daily doses of 88 mg; only 52% of patients had dosage increases.

- **Conclusions**: Although effective levels of BP were maintained during hospitalization for an ACS, target HRs were generally not achieved. Future studies are needed to determine the relationship between treatment objectives and outcomes.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of partial agonist beta blocker monotherapy for primary hypertension [^1175vHQ9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat hypertension in many countries. They act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors when they are active. However, the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is also searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials were included. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm at a fixed dose. Patients included in the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). The duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

- **Main results**: Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^114NbSxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

A thorough understanding of the evidence for beta-blocker therapy in hypertension necessitates a regularly updated, systematic, and comprehensive analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, a Cochrane Review was published that re-assessed the role of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in comparison to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. This review was subsequently updated in 2012. The current review serves as an update of the 2012 review.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure — a randomized study [^116Q5pH2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Different groups of beta blockers might have different effects on blood pressure and heart rate. We therefore conducted a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate measurement in a subgroup of patients from all three treatment groups. When testing the patients on first carvedilol treatment, since treatment with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, we found no difference between the beta blocker treatment groups. In a study by Sanderson, a 24-hour heart rate evaluation was done in patients with heart failure (HF); they compared treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate and found no difference in diurnal heart rate. In our study, we examined groups treated with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at comparable doses and found no changes in either diurnal blood pressure or heart rate. This indicates that metoprolol tartrate instead of metoprolol succinate did not cause a different effect of beta1-adrenergic blockade at doses chosen in our study. In a direct comparison among patients with HF, no differences in hemodynamic parameters were found between treatments with metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at equal doses.

- **Study limitation**: Our patients were already treated with carvedilol at the first examination of endothelial function. Methodologically, it would have been advantageous to the study if patients were beta blocker naïve at entering the study. We found it unethical to withdraw beta blocker treatment in patients with a proven benefit of treatment and risk of worsening heart failure symptoms in the situation of withdrawal.

### Dosing of beta-blocker therapy before, during, and after hospitalization for heart failure (from Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) [^1119ia2u]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started.

The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was less than half the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 ± 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 ± 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during HF hospitalization. More than two-thirds of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively.

In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less than the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines.

### Blood pressure response to heart rate during exercise test and risk of future hypertension [^111kGGC1]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Previous works have shown that an exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise is a valid risk marker for future hypertension. However, the use of an exercise test as a means of early prediction of hypertension still requires methodological development and confirmation. This study aimed to determine abnormal ranges of blood pressure responses in relation to heart rate increase during exercise and to examine the clinical utility of exercise blood pressure measurement in evaluating individual risk for developing hypertension.

We examined exercise test data from a population-based sample of 1,033 non-medicated normotensive men (mean age, 42.9 ± 8.5 years; range, 20 to 59 years). Percentile curves of systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to relative heart rate increments during submaximal exercise were constructed using a third-order polynomial model with multiple regression analysis. Of the original study sample, a cohort of 726 subjects was followed for hypertensive outcomes over an average period of 4.7 years. Progression to hypertension, defined as a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg or the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, was found in 114 subjects (15.4%).

Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed that the cumulative incidence of hypertension increased progressively with higher percentiles of systolic and diastolic blood pressure response (both, P < 0.01). A Cox proportional survival analysis revealed a significantly increased risk for developing hypertension associated with exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise after multivariable adjustments.

### Genome-wide association approach identified novel genetic predictors of heart rate response to β-blockers [^116UUpNx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past five decades, β‐adrenergic receptor blockers (β‐blockers) have been a cornerstone therapy for heart failure, post–myocardial infarction, symptomatic angina, and other cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, they remain one of the most commonly prescribed classes of drugs in the United States. β‐Blockers work by inhibiting the β‐adrenergic receptors in the heart, preventing the binding of epinephrine and norepinephrine to these receptors and eventually reducing cardiac contractility and heart rate (HR). HR lowering in response to β‐blockers has been associated with a lower risk of incident heart failure and cardiovascular diseases. Results from clinical trials and meta‐analyses have shown a significant association between β‐blockers' HR‐lowering effect and improvement in clinical outcomes. Altogether, these data highlight that the HR‐modulating effects of β‐blockers are a critical efficacy component for this class of drugs and contribute to their beneficial therapeutic effects.

Despite the widespread use of β‐blockers, interindividual differences in HR‐lowering response to β‐blockers have been observed. These differences might be attributed to several factors, including genetics. Over the past two decades, considerable resources have been allocated to elucidate the genetic contributors of variability in drug response to β‐blockers. Most of this research has focused on explaining differences in their effects on blood pressure, heart failure phenotypes, and effects on cardiovascular outcomes. However, research continues to explore these genetic variances further, aiming to improve personalized medicine approaches.

### Betaxolol [^113Tdmpo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019).

Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity of betaxolol by: (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rate, cardiac output, and cardiac workload; (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise; (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia; and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The β1-selectivity of betaxolol in humans was shown in three ways: (1) In normal subjects, 10- and 40-mg oral doses of betaxolol, which reduced resting heart rate at least as much as 40 mg of propranolol, produced less inhibition of isoproterenol-induced increases in forearm blood flow and finger tremor than propranolol. In this study, 10 mg of betaxolol was at least comparable to 50 mg of atenolol. Both doses of betaxolol and the one dose of atenolol, however, had more effect on the isoproterenol-induced changes than placebo (indicating some β2 effect at clinical doses), and the higher dose of betaxolol was more inhibitory than the lower. (2) In normal subjects, single intravenous doses of betaxolol and propranolol, which produced equal effects on exercise-induced tachycardia, had differing effects on insulin-induced hypoglycemia, with propranolol, but not betaxolol, prolonging the hypoglycemia compared with placebo. Neither drug affected the maximum extent of the hypoglycemic response. (3) In a single-blind crossover study in asthmatics (n = 10), intravenous infusion over 30 minutes of low doses of betaxolol (1.5 mg) and propranolol (2 mg) had similar effects on resting heart rate.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^112JZRK2]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, particularly in the choice of antihypertensives, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend combining β-blockers with any of the other major BP-lowering drug classes when there are compelling indications for their use, such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, HFrEF, or for heart rate control.

### Achieving a maximally tolerated β-blocker dose in heart failure patients: Is there room for improvement [^113K7KqK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Proposed mechanisms include neurohormonal blockade and heart rate reduction. A new therapeutic agent now exists to target further heart rate lowering in patients who have been stable on a "maximally tolerated β-blocker dose"; however, this definition and how to achieve it are incompletely understood.

In this review, the authors summarize published reports on the mechanisms by which β-blockers improve clinical outcomes. They describe differences in doses achieved in landmark clinical trials and those observed in routine clinical practice. Additionally, they discuss reasons for intolerance and the evidence behind using β-blocker dose and heart rate as therapeutic targets. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for clinicians actively initiating and up-titrating β-blockers, which may aid in achieving maximally tolerated doses.

### Norvasc [^1121GfPJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, Norvasc produces vasodilation that results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with Norvasc is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of Norvasc resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic effects are observed.

### Effects on outcomes of heart rate reduction by ivabradine in patients with congestive heart failure: Is there an influence of beta-blocker dose? Findings from the SHIFT (Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the I(f) Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial) study [^114BNLfr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

This study used the SHIFT (Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the I(f) Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial) database to assess the impact of background beta-blocker dose on response to ivabradine. In systolic heart failure, reduction in relatively high heart rates improves clinical outcomes when achieved with beta-blockers and even more so when the sinus node inhibitor ivabradine also is added.

Among patients with systolic heart failure, sinus rhythm, and heart rate ≥ 70 beats/min on recommended background therapy, maximally tolerated beta-blocker doses were subgrouped as no beta-blocker, < 25%, 25% to < 50%, 50% to < 100%, and 100% of European Society of Cardiology–suggested target doses. The impact of ivabradine on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (primary endpoint) was analyzed in each subgroup as time-to-first event using Cox models adjusted for heart rate. The statistical models assessed heterogeneity and trend of the treatment effect across subgroups, and an additional analysis was made adjusting for the interaction of randomized treatment with baseline heart rate.

The primary endpoint and heart failure hospitalizations were significantly reduced by ivabradine in all subgroups with < 50% of target beta-blocker dose, including no beta-blocker (p = 0.012). Despite an apparent trend to reduction in treatment-effect magnitude with increasing beta-blocker dose, no variation in treatment effect was seen in general heterogeneity interaction tests (p = 0.35). Across beta-blocker subgroups, treatment effect was borderline.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^111Q2PQX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The data extracted for each study were methods, including means of assigning participants to trial interventions, blinding of those receiving and providing care and outcome assessors, losses to follow-up and how they were handled, and length of trial follow-up; participant characteristics, including gender, ethnicity, and comorbid conditions; interventions, including type and dose of beta-blocker and other medications used; outcome measures, including morbidity and mortality endpoints, and adverse events.

We conducted quantitative analyses according to standard Cochrane guidelines. We analyzed trial participants in groups to which they were randomized, regardless of which or how much treatment they actually received, and expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed heterogeneity between studies by graphical inspection of results and, more formally, followed by the Chi-square test of homogeneity. In the absence of significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect method. When there was significant heterogeneity between study results, we used the random-effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity by stratified analysis with reference to the characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis. The study characteristics considered in the subgroup analyses were age (less than 65 years versus 65 years and older) and type of beta-blockade (cardioselective versus non-selective).

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^111kR9j6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Beta-blockers are a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have demonstrated long-term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in individuals with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Although beta-blockers were initially expected to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension, their benefit without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007 and updated in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist conducted a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016. The databases searched included the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. The reference lists of relevant reviews and studies potentially eligible for inclusion were also examined. Additionally, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was searched on 06 July 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year duration, assessing the effects of beta-blockers compared to placebo or other drugs as first-line therapy for hypertension on mortality and morbidity in adults, were included.

### Effect of heart rate control with esmolol on hemodynamic and clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock: a randomized clinical trial [^116Ef2jr]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Importance

β-Blocker therapy may control heart rate and attenuate the deleterious effects of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation in septic shock. However, β-blockers are not traditionally used for this condition and may worsen cardiovascular decompensation through negative inotropic and hypotensive effects.

Objective

To investigate the effect of the short-acting β-blocker esmolol in patients with severe septic shock.

Design, setting, and patients

An open-label, randomized phase 2 study was conducted in a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between November 2010 and July 2012, involving patients in septic shock with a heart rate of 95/min or higher requiring high-dose norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher.

Interventions

We randomly assigned 77 patients to receive a continuous infusion of esmolol titrated to maintain heart rate between 80/min and 94/min for their ICU stay and 77 patients to standard treatment.

Main outcomes and measures

Our primary outcome was a reduction in heart rate below the predefined threshold of 95/min and to maintain heart rate between 80/min and 94/min with esmolol treatment over a 96-hour period. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic and organ function measures; norepinephrine dosages at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours; and adverse events and mortality occurring within 28 days after randomization.

Results

Targeted heart rates were achieved in all patients in the esmolol group compared with those in the control group. The median AUC for heart rate during the first 96 hours was -28/min (IQR, -37 to -21).

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of beta-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients following a myocardial infarction (MI) and in those with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients post-MI, without contraindication, receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers should also be considered for stable patients hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, beta-blockers remain underused.

- **Barriers to initiation**: Physicians' reluctance to initiate therapy stems from traditional beliefs that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration.

- **Intervention programs**: These programs promoting beta-blocker use for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up.

- **Agent selection**: Due to pharmacologic differences, the choice of agent is critical. Selected agents must demonstrate proven clinical efficacy, have an established dose-titration regimen, and possess desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Beta-blockers withdrawal in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronotropic incompetence: Effect on functional capacity rationale and study design of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (The Preserve-HR trial) [^114Jxfwo]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

- **Biological plausibility**: Currently, no study has evaluated the acute hemodynamic effects of beta-blockers in HFpEF. However, clinical experience with these agents provides some insights. Some authors have suggested that prolonged diastolic filling related to heart rate lowering increases ventricular pressures in HFpEF patients. Interestingly, beta-blocker cessation would translate into a reduction in end-diastolic pressures, as has been recently suggested with a decrease in natriuretic peptides following beta-blockers withdrawal.

	- Another potential beneficial effect of beta-blockers withdrawal on HFpEF patients with ChI includes an increase in heart rate response during exercise, which may be considered a compensatory mechanism for maintaining cardiac output in patients with significant diastolic dysfunction. Additionally, amelioration of delayed memory retrieval in cognitively impaired patients and attenuation of arterial central pressures at rest and during exercise are also noted benefits.

- **Feasibility and future implications**: HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome in which no pharmacological therapy has shown promising results. Identifying those HFpEF patients with ChI could help us characterize different phenotypes of this syndrome and optimize medical treatment. In this regard, beta-blockers withdrawal could represent a treatment option for those patients with documented ChI. This strategy attempts to move forward into precision medicine in HFpEF by identifying the ChI phenotype and treating it accordingly.

### Relation of beta-blocker-induced heart rate lowering and cardioprotection in hypertension [^113dnN6F]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of heart rate reduction with beta-blockers on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension.

Resting heart rate has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population and in patients with heart disease such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Conversely, pharmacological reduction of heart rate is beneficial for patients with heart disease. However, the role of pharmacological reduction of heart rate using beta-blockers in preventing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is not known.

We conducted a MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL database search of studies from 1966 to May 2008. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension with follow-up for at least one year and with data on heart rate. We extracted the baseline characteristics, the blood pressure response, heart rate at baseline and end of trial, and cardiovascular outcomes from each trial.

Of 22 randomized controlled trials evaluating beta-blockers for hypertension, nine studies reported heart rate data. The nine studies evaluated 34,096 patients taking beta-blockers against 30,139 patients taking other antihypertensive agents and 3,987 patients receiving placebo. Paradoxically, a lower heart rate — as attained in the beta-blocker group at study end — was associated with a greater risk for the endpoints of all-cause mortality (r = -0.51; p < 0.0001), cardiovascular mortality.

### Beta-blocker ingestion: An evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^114sc4tU]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for beta-blocker toxicity, specifically concerning the initial assessment, the 2005 AACT/AAPCC/ACMT guidelines recommend obtaining a detailed history to determine the precise ingested dose of a β-blocker, the presence of co-ingestants, and any comorbidities in patients without evidence of self-harm.

### Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide [^112J1waA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Nadolol has been associated with adverse effects, most of which are mild and transient, rarely necessitating withdrawal of therapy.

- **Cardiovascular**: Bradycardia with heart rates less than 60 beats per minute occurs commonly. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute and/or symptomatic bradycardia were observed in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Symptoms of peripheral vascular insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type, have occurred in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Cardiac failure, hypotension, and rhythm/conduction disturbances have each occurred in about 1 of 100 patients. Single instances of first-degree and third-degree heart block have been reported. Intensification of AV block is a known effect of beta-blockers (see also CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).

- **Central nervous system**: Dizziness or fatigue has been reported in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Paresthesias, sedation, and changes in behavior have each been reported in approximately 6 of 1000 patients.

- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm has been reported in approximately 1 of 1000 patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, vomiting, indigestion, anorexia, bloating, and flatulence have been reported in 1 to 5 of 1000 patients.

- **Miscellaneous**: Each of the following has been reported in 1 to 5 of 1000 patients: rash, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, eyes, or skin, impotence or decreased libido, facial swelling, weight gain, slurred speech, cough, nasal stuffiness, sweating, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Reversible alopecia has been reported infrequently.

### Sunosi [^111PCwRF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Blood pressure and heart rate increases**: Sunosi increases systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate in a dose-dependent fashion [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Epidemiological data show that chronic elevations in blood pressure increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. The magnitude of the increase in absolute risk is dependent on the increase in blood pressure and the underlying risk of MACE in the population being treated. Many patients with narcolepsy and OSA have multiple risk factors for MACE, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and high body mass index (BMI).

Assess blood pressure and control hypertension before initiating treatment with Sunosi. Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment and treat new-onset hypertension and exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension. Exercise caution when treating patients at higher risk of MACE, particularly patients with known cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing hypertension, and patients with advanced age. Use caution with other drugs that increase blood pressure and heart rate [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment with Sunosi. If a patient experiences increases in blood pressure or heart rate that cannot be managed with dose reduction of Sunosi or other appropriate medical intervention, consider discontinuation of Sunosi.

Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment may be at a higher risk of increases in blood pressure and heart rate.
