## Question

What dose of bactrim for MRSA on the skin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about choosing the correct Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX) dose for MRSA skin infections, including abscesses and cellulitis, with attention to adult versus pediatric dosing, duration, and when to add streptococcal coverage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with a drained abscess, nonpurulent cellulitis, or another SSTI phenotype. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for adult dosing from randomized trials and FDA labeling. Next, I will check pediatric dosing recommendations and the evidence base. After that, I need to review duration of therapy and whether shorter courses are acceptable. Finally, I should confirm when to add streptococcal coverage and summarize practical dosing with safety checks and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because dosing and the need for antibiotics differ by SSTI phenotype. For uncomplicated purulent infections such as drained abscesses, adjunctive antibiotics can improve cure and reduce recurrence, whereas for nonpurulent cellulitis, routine MRSA coverage is often unnecessary and adding TMP-SMX to a beta-lactam like cephalexin has not improved outcomes in RCTs, so I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing from abscess data to cellulitis without purulence [^117E864F] [^113gWrmr] [^1112uFJm] [^112z7Dvu].

> Now, I should verify the adult dose used in the pivotal trials. The NEJM 2016 trial in drained abscesses used TMP-SMX 320 mg/1600 mg (double-strength) twice daily for 7 days and showed higher cure versus placebo, and the subsequent NEJM 2017 trial comparing clindamycin, TMP-SMX, and placebo after incision and drainage used TMP-SMX 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily for 10 days with similar cure to clindamycin and both superior to placebo, so the evidence-based adult dose is 320 mg TMP/1600 mg SMX twice daily, typically for 7–10 days depending on severity and response [^117E864F] [^113gWrmr].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA-labeled SSTI dosing to ensure alignment. The FDA labeling lists 160–320 mg TMP with 800–1600 mg SMX twice daily for skin and soft tissue infections, which brackets the trial dose; practically, most clinicians use the higher end (320/1600 mg twice daily) for suspected or confirmed MRSA, reserving the lower end for milder presentations or when tolerability is a concern, so the labeled range supports the trial dose as standard for MRSA SSTI [^113Gsi3r].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric dosing because it is weight-based and easy to misstate. The IDSA pediatric guidance and contemporary summaries recommend 8–12 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component divided every 12 hours, which corresponds to roughly 4–6 mg/kg per dose of TMP, and the pediatric infectious diseases literature notes that prospective data for uncomplicated skin infections used 8–10 mg/kg/day of the TMP component, so a practical target is 8–10 mg/kg/day of TMP divided twice daily, with careful attention to renal function and tolerability [^112w921g] [^111q1gJ1].

> I need to check duration next, and I should be cautious about shortening therapy. In adults with drained abscesses, 7–10 days is standard based on RCTs, and in children, a randomized study suggested that 3 days of TMP-SMX after drainage was associated with higher failure and recurrence in MRSA compared with 10 days, so I should avoid 3-day courses in pediatric MRSA abscesses despite the appeal of shorter therapy [^117E864F] [^113gWrmr] [^115meg9L].

> But wait, what if the infection is nonpurulent cellulitis without abscess or purulent drainage. I should confirm that routine MRSA coverage is not routinely indicated. IDSA notes beta-lactam monotherapy is usually sufficient, and RCTs show no benefit to adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin for uncomplicated cellulitis, so TMP-SMX should not be added unless there are specific MRSA risk factors or failure of beta-lactam therapy, in which case targeted MRSA therapy may be reasonable [^112z7Dvu] [^1112uFJm].

> Next, I should review streptococcal coverage because TMP-SMX has unreliable activity against beta-hemolytic streptococci. If both MRSA and streptococci are suspected or confirmed, options include clindamycin monotherapy, linezolid or tedizolid monotherapy, or TMP-SMX combined with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin or cephalexin; I initially thought TMP-SMX might cover streptococci adequately, but wait, I should double-check — IDSA cautions that TMP-SMX has limited streptococcal activity, so combination therapy is prudent when dual coverage is desired [^112z7Dvu] [^114KJuVG].

> I will now examine special situations briefly to ensure I am not missing important caveats. For severe MRSA infections with bacteremia or deep involvement, TMP-SMX has not proven noninferior to vancomycin and is generally not recommended as monotherapy in those settings, so vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid should be preferred intravenously with step-down to oral agents once clinically improved, and TMP-SMX should be reserved for mild to moderate SSTI without systemic involvement or as step-down when appropriate [^116Krma2] [^112w921g].

> Let me summarize practical dosing to ensure internal consistency. For adults with uncomplicated MRSA SSTI such as a drained abscess, use TMP-SMX 320 mg/1600 mg (double-strength) orally twice daily for 7–10 days, adjusting duration to clinical response; for milder presentations or tolerability concerns, the FDA range allows 160/800 mg twice daily, though many clinicians favor the higher dose for MRSA. For children, use 8–10 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 12 hours, avoiding shorter 3-day courses after drainage in MRSA, and monitor for adverse effects including rash, GI upset, hematologic effects, and electrolyte disturbances, with renal function guiding dose in both populations [^117E864F] [^113gWrmr] [^113Gsi3r] [^111q1gJ1].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and monitoring considerations. TMP-SMX can cause serious hypersensitivity, hematologic toxicity, and hyperkalemia, particularly in older adults or those with renal impairment, so I need to ensure appropriate renal dosing, review concomitant medications that raise potassium or interact with folate metabolism, and advise stopping immediately if rash or systemic symptoms occur; these cautions are emphasized in FDA labeling and should be integrated into prescribing and counseling [^116cnh5b] [^113bHcUU].

---

The standard adult dose of Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) for MRSA skin infections is **1–2 double-strength tablets (160/800 mg per tablet) orally every 12 hours** [^113Gsi3r] for 7–14 days, with 7–10 days typical for uncomplicated infections [^111aNudS]. For pediatric patients, use **8–12 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component** divided every 12 hours [^112w921g] for 7–10 days. Adjust dosing for renal impairment [^113bHcUU] and monitor for adverse effects such as rash, gastrointestinal upset, and hematologic changes [^116cnh5b].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

### Adults

- **Standard dose**: 1–2 double-strength (DS) tablets (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole per tablet) orally every 12 hours [^113Gsi3r] (total daily dose: 320–640 mg trimethoprim/1600–3200 mg sulfamethoxazole) [^notfound].

- **Duration**: Typically 7–14 days, with 7–10 days common for uncomplicated infections [^1125JJvB].

---

### Pediatric patients

For pediatric patients, the **recommended dose** is 8–12 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component, divided every 12 hours (total daily dose: 8–12 mg/kg trimethoprim) [^112w921g]. The **duration** is 7–10 days, tailored to clinical response [^1125JJvB].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

Clinical trials support the **efficacy of TMP-SMX** for MRSA skin infections:

- **NEJM 2016 trial**: TMP-SMX 320/1600 mg twice daily for 7 days improved cure rates in drained abscesses compared to placebo [^117E864F].

- **NEJM 2015 trial**: TMP-SMX and clindamycin had similar cure rates for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu].

- **NEJM 2017 trial**: TMP-SMX or clindamycin plus drainage improved outcomes versus drainage alone in small abscesses [^113gWrmr].

---

## Factors influencing dosing adjustments

### Renal impairment

In renal impairment, **adjust the dose** based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):

| **Creatinine clearance (crcl)** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min | Standard dosing |
| CrCl 15–29 mL/min | Reduce dose by 50% |
| CrCl < 15 mL/min | Avoid use or use with extreme caution |

---

### Patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Elderly patients have a higher risk of adverse effects; monitor closely [^113bHcUU].

- **Comorbidities**: Hepatic impairment, folate deficiency, or hematologic disorders may require dose adjustments or alternative therapy [^112SyHHX].

- **Allergies**: Sulfa allergy is a contraindication; consider alternatives such as clindamycin, doxycycline, or linezolid [^112w921g].

---

## Potential side effects and monitoring

Common side effects include **rash, gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), hematologic changes (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), and hyperkalemia** [^114AG97P] [^113ffv6a] [^113bHcUU]. Monitor CBC for hematologic effects, renal function for nephrotoxicity, and potassium for hyperkalemia, and discontinue if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur [^111q1gJ1] [^113bHcUU] [^116cnh5b].

---

## Comparison with alternative antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | - Effective against MRSA and streptococci <br/> - Good tissue penetration | - Resistance varies <br/> - C. difficile risk [^111cQDs1] |
| Doxycycline | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Oral availability | - No streptococcal coverage <br/> - Not for children < 8 years [^112w921g] |
| Linezolid | - Effective against MRSA and VRE <br/> - Oral/IV | - Expensive <br/> - Hematologic toxicity [^115ugoME] |
| Vancomycin | - Gold standard for severe MRSA | - IV only <br/> - Nephrotoxicity [^114VRSGT] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

IDSA recommends TMP-SMX as a **first-line oral agent** for uncomplicated MRSA skin infections, with clindamycin or doxycycline as alternatives [^112w921g]. WSES also lists TMP-SMX among first-line oral options for MRSA SSTIs [^114KJuVG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid TMP-SMX, especially in the first trimester; use clindamycin or beta-lactams instead [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: TMP-SMX is safe and effective; monitor for hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects [^111q1gJ1].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider broader coverage or combination therapy based on severity and risk factors [^1157bqUp].

---

The standard adult dose of Bactrim for MRSA skin infections is **1–2 double-strength tablets every 12 hours** for 7–14 days, with pediatric dosing of 8–12 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component divided every 12 hours. Adjust for renal function and monitor for adverse effects [^113Gsi3r].

Background

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

Results

The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 8.6%; difference, -5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, -7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.4 to -4.1), and infections in household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, -2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.2) 7 to 14 days after the treatment period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.

Conclusions

In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00729937.).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^112Wx9eX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We used a central computer generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Subgroup analysis of antibiotic treatment for skin Abscesses [^1127Vwkj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Two large randomized trials recently demonstrated efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibiotics for drained skin abscesses. We determine whether outcome advantages observed in one trial exist across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline-recommended antibiotic indications.

Methods

We conducted a planned subgroup analysis of a double-blind, randomized trial at 5 US emergency departments, demonstrating superiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (320/1,600 mg twice daily for 7 days) compared with placebo for patients older than 12 years with a drained skin abscess. We determined between-group differences in rates of clinical (no new antibiotics) and composite cure (no new antibiotics or drainage) through 7 to 14 and 42 to 56 days after treatment among subgroups with and without abscess cavity or erythema diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm, history of MRSA, fever, diabetes, and comorbidities. We also evaluated treatment effect by lesion size and culture result.

Results

Among 1,057 mostly adult participants, median abscess cavity and erythema diameters were 2.5 cm (range 0.1 to 16.0 cm) and 6.5 cm (range 1.0 to 38.5), respectively; 44.3% grew MRSA. Overall, for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and placebo groups, clinical cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 92.9% and 85.7%; composite cure rate at 7 to 14 days was 86.5% and 74.3%, and at 42 to 56 days, it was 82.4% and 70.2%. For all outcomes, across lesion sizes and among subgroups with and without guideline antibiotic criteria, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes. Treatment effect was greatest with history of MRSA infection, fever, and positive MRSA culture.

Conclusion

Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with improved outcomes regardless of lesion size or guideline antibiotic criteria.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1113MbZX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The main treatment options for MRSA infections other than vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. Most of the new antibiotics were evaluated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials. Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials and when reported was very low (usually < 1%). Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not include only MRSA. Daptomycin was non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial including 245 patients with S aureus bacteraemia, of whom 89 had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin. The overall mortality was 11%. Similar efficacy and safety for was shown for linezolid and vancomycin in nosocomial pneumonia, and the mortality rate in these trials was 14%. Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial including 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections, but most were skin and soft tissue infections (mortality rate 5%). Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA, overall mortality in the study 19%). Compared with these trials, ours included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as evidenced by the mortality rates, more closely reflecting patients treated with MRSA infections in clinical practice.

Limitations of study

The main limitation of our trial is the small sample size of patients with bacteraemia, in whom results suggest an important advantage for vancomycin. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline for nearly all variables. However, a subtle difference existed for important prognostic variables, and more patients allocated to vancomycin were bacteraemic. Multivariable analysis of the entire study cohort showed a larger advantage of vancomycin with regard to treatment failure, reaching statistical significance. Patients with polymicrobial infections and receiving additional antibiotics were included in the study, reflecting its pragmatic nature. However, these were mostly inactive against MRSA and concomitant antibiotics covering MRSA were not allowed at randomisation. Patients excluded owing to inability to provide informed consent had higher severity of illness scores than those included, affecting the trial's external validity. Finally, the dosing of vancomycin and trough levels achieved (≥ 15 µg/mL in only 67% of patients) were lower than currently recommended, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the efficacy of vancomycin and the difference between arms.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111kKcmx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003) and EMBASE (1980-February 2003). Key search terms included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and Staphylococcus aureus.

Data Synthesis

An evaluation of case reports, case series, and clinical studies focusing on the use of TMP/SMX for treatment of severe S. aureus infections was conducted. The majority of the reports indicate that TMP/SMX may be effective for the treatment of infections due to low bacterial burdens of susceptible strains of S. aureus.

Conclusions

In select infections, TMP/SMX may be a useful alternative to vancomycin for treatment of severe S. aureus infections. Additional randomized studies should be conducted comparing this agent with vancomycin and linezolid.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^11471bHB]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an old antibiotic active against Staphylococcus aureus. Trimethoprim is the main active component and bactericidal in itself, but the combination is highly synergistic. With increasing rates of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in healthcare settings and in the community, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been suggested as a convenient treatment option.

MRSA isolates have retained susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in many locations worldwide despite several decades of exposure to the antibiotic. Coverage rates above 90% are described in contemporary reports for community associated MRSA and nosocomial isolates in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, Israel, and Turkey. Resistance is described in Australia, where 30% of nosocomial and 10% of community associated MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2012, but a significant trend for decreasing resistance from 2005 was observed, unlike other antibiotics. In sub-Saharan Africa, 19% resistance has been recently documented, owing to high rates of trimethoprim resistance. In India, more than 85% of MRSA isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole between 2009 and 2011.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections but not for MRSA bacteraemia or pneumonia. Vancomycin is the primary treatment recommendation for these infections. Alternatives to vancomycin are sought as vancomycin is inferior to β lactams in meticillin susceptible S aureus infections, and it may be less effective against MRSA at the higher end of the vancomycin susceptible range. In a small observational study, we reported similar outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia. Favourable outcomes for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin were reported in an observational study focusing on infections caused by MRSA with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL to vancomycin. In both studies, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given to significantly less ill patients.

We did a randomised controlled trial to assess whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of inpatients with severe MRSA infections, including bacteraemia.

### A randomized trial of clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated wound infection [^115oh5xm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

With the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the United States, visits for skin infections greatly increased. Staphylococci and streptococci are considered predominant causes of wound infections. Clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are commonly prescribed, but the efficacy of TMP-SMX has been questioned.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, superiority trial at 5 US emergency departments. Patients > 12 years of age with an uncomplicated wound infection received oral clindamycin 300 mg 4 times daily or TMP-SMX 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, each for 7 days. We compared the primary outcome, wound infection cure at 7–14 days, and secondary outcomes through 6–8 weeks after treatment, in the per-protocol population.

Results

Subjects had a median age of 40 years (range, 14–76 years); 40.1% of wound specimens grew MRSA, 25.7% methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and 5.0% streptococci. The wound infection was cured at 7–14 days in 187 of 203 (92.1%) clindamycin-treated and 182 of 198 (91.9%) TMP-SMX-treated subjects (difference, 0.2%; 95% confidence interval, -5.8% to 6.2%; P = not significant). The clindamycin group had a significantly lower rate of recurrence at 7–14 days (1.5% vs 6.6%; difference, -5.1%; 95% CI, -9.4% to -.8%) and through 6–8 weeks following treatment (2.0% vs 7.1%; difference, -5.1%; 95% CI, -9.7% to -.6%). Other secondary outcomes were statistically similar between groups but tended to favor clindamycin. Adverse event rates were similar.

Conclusions

In settings where MRSA is prevalent, clindamycin and TMP-SMX produce similar cure and adverse event rates among patients with an uncomplicated wound infection. Further study evaluating differential effects of antibiotics on recurrent infection may be warranted.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1148NgjB]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Few randomised controlled trials have assessed the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. A single randomised controlled trial compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against vancomycin for staphylococcal infections. The trial randomised 228 intravenous drug users with suspected staphylococcal infections and analysed 101 with proven infections (54 with meticillin susceptible S aureus and 47 with MRSA). Vancomycin was superior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among patients with meticillin susceptible S aureus infections, but no differences were observed for patients with MRSA. Specifically, bacteraemia duration (total 57 patients) was longer with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment for meticillin susceptible S aureus (7.8 v 3.5 days; P = 0.05) and similar for MRSA (5.2 v 5.6 days). The authors concluded that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a valuable alternative for the treatment of MRSA infections, unlike the conclusions of our study. However, the study included significantly younger and less ill patients, with a single death compared with the 13% mortality rate in our study. In a recent randomised controlled trial, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampin was compared with linezolid in the treatment of MRSA infections (bacteraemia in 18/150 (12%) and mortality in 14/150 (9%)), showing no differences in failure/relapse rates or mortality. Among 50 patients with chronic meticillin susceptible S aureus osteomyelitis randomised to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin versus oxacillin, long term outcomes were similar and patients allocated to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-rifampin had a significantly shorter hospital stay (median 51 v 31 days). Finally, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not significantly different from doxycycline for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in a small randomised controlled trial assessing 22 patients with MRSA.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; p = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; p = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Skin and skin-structure infections are common in ambulatory settings. However, the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We enrolled outpatients with uncomplicated skin infections who had cellulitis, abscesses larger than 5 cm in diameter (smaller for younger children), or both. Patients were enrolled at four study sites. All abscesses underwent incision and drainage. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 10 days. Patients and investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments and microbiologic test results. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

A total of 524 patients were enrolled (264 in the clindamycin group and 260 in the TMP-SMX group), including 155 children (29.6%). One hundred sixty patients (30.5%) had an abscess, 280 (53.4%) had cellulitis, and 82 (15.6%) had mixed infection, defined as at least one abscess lesion and one cellulitis lesion. S. aureus was isolated from the lesions of 217 patients (41.4%); the isolates in 167 (77.0%) of these patients were MRSA. The proportion of patients cured was similar in the two treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population (80.3% in the clindamycin group and 77.7% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -2.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to 4.9; P = 0.52) and in the populations of patients who could be evaluated (466 patients; 89.5% in the clindamycin group and 88.2% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -1.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.6 to 5.1; P = 0.77). Cure rates did not differ significantly between the two treatments in the subgroups of children, adults, and patients with abscess versus cellulitis. The proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

We found no significant difference between clindamycin and TMP-SMX, with respect to either efficacy or side-effect profile, for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections, including both cellulitis and abscesses.

Objective To show non-inferiority of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with vancomycin for the treatment of severe infections due to meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Design Parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial.

Setting Four acute care hospitals in Israel.

Participants Adults with severe infections caused by MRSA susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Patients with left sided endocarditis, meningitis, chronic haemodialysis, and prolonged neutropenia were excluded.

Interventions Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily versus vancomycin 1 g twice daily for a minimum of seven days and then by indication.

Main outcome measures The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure assessed at day 7, consisting of death, persistence of haemodynamic instability or fever, stable or worsening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and persistence of bacteraemia. The primary safety outcome was all cause mortality at day 30. Non-inferiority was defined by a difference of less than 15% for treatment failure.

Results 252 patients were included in the trial, of whom 91 (36%) had bacteraemia. No significant difference in treatment failure was seen for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (51/135, 38%) versus vancomycin (32/117, 27%) — risk ratio 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not meet the non-inferiority criterion — absolute difference 10.4% (95% confidence interval −1.2% to 21.5%). For patients with bacteraemia, the risk ratio was 1.40 (0.91 to 2.16). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly associated with treatment failure (adjusted odds ratio 2.00, 1.09 to 3.65). The 30 day mortality rate was 32/252 (13%), with no significant difference between arms. Among patients with bacteraemia, 14/41 (34%) treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 9/50 (18%) with vancomycin died (risk ratio 1.90, 0.92 to 3.93).

Conclusions High dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority to vancomycin in the treatment of severe MRSA infections. The difference was particularly marked for patients with bacteraemia.

### Randomized controlled trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin abscesses in patients at risk for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^112GbcSA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is now the leading cause of uncomplicated skin abscesses in the United States, and the role of antibiotics is controversial. We evaluate whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces the rate of treatment failures during the 7 days after incision and drainage and whether it reduces new lesion formation within 30 days.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized adults to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo after uncomplicated abscess incision and drainage. Using emergency department rechecks at 2 and 7 days and telephone follow-up, we assessed treatment failure within 7 days, and using clinical follow-up, telephone follow-up, and medical record review, we recorded the development of new lesions within 30 days.

Results

We randomized 212 patients, and 190 (90%) were available for 7-day follow-up. We observed a statistically similar incidence of treatment failure in patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (15/88; 17%) versus placebo (27/102; 26%), difference 9%, 95% confidence interval -2% to 21%; p = 0.12. On 30-day follow-up (successful in 69% of patients), we observed fewer new lesions in the antibiotic (4/46; 9%) versus placebo (14/50; 28%) groups, difference 19%, 95% confidence interval 4% to 34%, P = 0.02.

Conclusion

After the incision and drainage of uncomplicated abscesses in adults, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does not reduce treatment failure but may decrease the formation of subsequent lesions.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy reduces failure and recurrence in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin abscesses after surgical drainage [^115meg9L]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a 3-day vs 10-day course of antibiotics after surgical drainage of skin abscesses is associated with different failure and recurrence rates.

Study Design

Patients age 3 months to 17 years seeking care at a pediatric emergency department with an uncomplicated skin abscess that required surgical drainage were randomized to receive 3 or 10 days of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. Patients were evaluated 10–14 days later to assess clinical outcome. Patients were followed for 6 months to determine the cumulative rate of recurrent skin infections.

Results

Among the 249 patients who were enrolled, 87% of wound cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) (55% methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA], 32% methicillin-sensitive S aureus), 11% other organisms, and 2% no growth. Thirteen patients experienced treatment failure. Among all patients, no significant difference in failure rates between the 3- and 10-day treatment groups was found. After we stratified patients by the infecting organism, only patients with MRSA infection were more likely to experience treatment failure in the 3-day group than the 10-day group (P = 0.03, rate difference 10.1%, 95% CI 2.1%-18.2%) Recurrent infection within 1 month of surgical drainage was more likely in patients infected with MRSA who received 3 days of antibiotics. (P = 0.046, rate difference 10.3%, 95% CI 0.8%-19.9%).

Conclusion

Patients with MRSA skin abscesses are more likely to experience treatment failure and recurrent skin infection if given 3 rather than 10 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after surgical drainage.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^113o2SD7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of studies relating to colonization and/or infection with MRSA shows the potential effect of differing study designs on resistance outcomes. The 2 cohort studies (ie, the most robust studies) clearly showed reduced MRSA colonization and/or infection, both individually and when combined, whereas the cross-sectional and case-control studies showed no effect.

This literature review had several limitations. Because TMP-SMX prophylaxis has long been proven to save lives of HIV-infected patients, only observational studies, which have more potential for bias and confounding, were available for review. Most studies did not control for factors that are known to independently increase antibiotic resistance. For example, only 3 studies adjusted for HIV disease progression or previous hospitalization. Previous hospitalization has been reported as an important risk factor for colonization or infection with MRSA.

Most studies did not provide data on the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Of the studies that did, the duration of exposure is shorter than expected in clinical practice in resource-limited settings. Because of the shortage of antiretroviral therapy in such settings, HIV-infected adults are likely to be receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for much longer periods than was evaluated in these studies. However, the finding from Gill et al may be more generalizable to HIV-exposed infants, because TMP-SMX was given according to guidelines used in many resource-limited settings.

Most studies only evaluated resistance to 1 antibiotic. This makes it difficult to know whether findings can be applied across different antibiotic classes.

The other limitation of the review was the heterogeneity of study designs, class of bacteria, and drug classes investigated, which makes comparing study findings problematic and makes it inappropriate to conduct a meta-analysis for all studies.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^111dXN5T]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results

We evaluated 782 patients with clinically significant MRSA isolates, of whom 252 were included. The main reasons for exclusion were previous treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin for more than 48 hours or inability to provide informed consent, related mostly to severity of sepsis (figure). Inclusion was based on microbiologically documented inclusion criteria in 245 (97%) patients: 91 (36%) with bacteraemia and 154 (61%) with MRSA isolated from other clinical samples. Patients' mean age was 65.8 (SD 17) years, and all infections were healthcare associated (218 (87%) hospital acquired). Characteristics of patients and infections were mostly balanced between groups; the exception was bacteraemia, which was more common in the vancomycin group (table 1). Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was infrequent. Surgical interventions and catheter extraction, when indicated, were performed in similar proportions in the two study groups. Vancomycin trough concentrations were available for 97/117 (82.9%) patients in the vancomycin arm (≥ 10 µg/mL in 80 (83%) patients and ≥ 15 µg/mL in 65 (67%) patients). Isolates' minimum inhibitory concentration to vancomycin was 2 µg/mL in 12/77 (16%) of patients in the vancomycin arm and lower in the remaining patients. All isolates were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (disk zone ≤ 10 mm). The median duration of treatment with assigned antibiotics in the per protocol population was 17 (95% confidence interval 12 to 22) days with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 110) and 14 (13 to 15) days with vancomycin (n = 96). Potentially effective antibiotics against MRSA (mainly rifampin) were added throughout the treatment course for 14/135 (10%) patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole arm and 8/117 (7%) patients in the vancomycin arm (P = 0.32).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116GWo9y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Daptomycin has proven efficacy in patients with Gram-positive complicated ©SSTIs, including those caused by S. aureus resistant to methicillin. Daptomycin has been shown to achieve very good concentrations in the skin and soft tissues. In 2010, a meta-analysis compared effectiveness and toxicity of daptomycin with that of other antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Four studies were included in the analysis (three were randomized RCTs). Vancomycin and semisynthetic penicillins were used in the comparator arm. Three studies reported on patients with cSSTIs. Daptomycin tissue penetration supports its use in the treatment of cSSTIs, and it has been shown to be non-inferior to vancomycin and semisynthetic penicillins.

Ceftaroline is an oxyimino advanced-generation broad-spectrum cephalosporin which has in vitro activity against S. aureus and MRSA, both of which are associated with cSSTIs. Ceftaroline fosamil has been found to be effective in the treatment of cSSTI when compared with vancomycin plus aztreonam for the treatment of cSSTI. Ceftaroline fosamil was also well tolerated and had a safety profile concordant with other antibiotics in the cephalosporin class.

More recently, new drugs have been approved for ABSSSI and have an important activity against MRSA, especially dalbavancin and tedizolid. Tedizolid, a novel oxazolidinone with Gram-positive activity including MRSA, is promising because it can be administered daily in oral or intravenous forms, and dalbavancin, a second-generation lipoglycopeptide that covers MRSA, can be administered as infrequently as once weekly.

Antibiotics recommended for MRSA infections are listed below.

Oral options:
Minocycline100 mg q12h
Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg q12h
Doxycycline 100 mg q12h
Clindamycin 300–600 mg q8h (high resistance rate)

The outcome of patients who were treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or oral clindamycin after hospitalization at Texas Children's Hospital for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections was compared. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of patients who returned to the emergency center or clinics because of worsening or incomplete resolution of the infected site.

We found no significant difference in treatment failure at day 7 between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin (risk ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.99) (table 2. The failure rate with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 51/135 (38%) compared with 32/117 (27%) with vancomycin, and the 95% confidence interval for the difference fell outside the lower limit of the 15% predefined for non-inferiority (−1.2% to 21.5%). Of the components comprising the composite outcome, the advantage to vancomycin emerged from higher bacteraemia persistence at day 7 and lack of improvement in SOFA score at day 7 with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We observed similar results in the per protocol population of patients completing seven days' treatment (risk ratio 1.24, 0.82 to 1.89; absolute difference 9.9%, −3.1% to 22.5%) and for patients with bacteraemia (risk ratio 1.40, 0.91 to 2.16). Restricting the analysis to patients in the vancomycin group whose isolates' minimum inhibitory concentrations were below 2 µg/mL resulted in a larger risk ratio in favour of vancomycin (1.64, 0.99 to 2.68).

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114oUcbz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to type 1 studies, for type 2 studies, there was stronger evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects from infection with drug-resistant bacteria. Four studies, all considered of good quality, reported reduced infection and/or colonization with MRSA, and 1 study, also of good quality, reported no change in colonization with MRSA. The 2 lower-quality studies in this group reported increased MRSA. The meta-analysis of MRSA cohort studies revealed a 70% protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis from MRSA infection (relative risk,.29; 95% confidence interval,.12–.7)

It is plausible that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against infection with drug-resistant bacteria. TMP-SMX may directly protect against colonization and/or infection with drug-susceptible bacterial pathogens, and indirect protection may arise as a result of this as the individual is less exposed to conditions that have been found to be risk factors for infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. For example, the patient may no longer need frequent hospitalization or will be less likely to be exposed to intravenous catheters, conditions that have been shown to increase antibiotic resistance. As a result, the patient may be less likely to receive other antibiotics for treatment of infections, and such exposure to antibiotics has been shown to increase antibiotic resistance.

The finding by Gill et al that pneumococcal resistance to 1 of 5 antibiotics increased whereas there was no change in the resistance levels for the other 4 drugs might mean that it is possible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis to increase bacterial resistance to some classes of antibiotics but not to others. This may be feasible if the mechanism of development of resistance to TMP-SMX is linked to that of the other antibiotic. Multidrug resistance can be horizontally transferred between bacterial species and genus borders if the genes that code for multidrug resistance are located on transferable plasmids or transposons. It has been proposed that TMP-SMX prophylaxis may cause resistance to clindamycin or penicillin through co-selection of linked antibiotic resistance genes.

The strength of the Hamel et al study is that it was adjusted for baseline antibiotic resistance levels. Results from that study suggest that there is no effect of 6 months of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on antibiotic resistance among similarly exposed HIV-infected adults. This may also be explained by possible protection of TMP-SMX from infections, as explained above. Of note, the 2 studies that were designed to answer the question of this review reported no change in pneumococcal resistance to penicillin.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) skin infections [^116HeCRE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as the predominant cause of skin infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and clindamycin are often used as first-line treatment options, but clinical data are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of outpatients with skin and soft tissue infections managed from July 1 to December 31, 2006. Patients younger than 18 years of age were excluded, as were those who had no clinical admission or progress notes; were hospitalized within the 90 days before admission; were hospitalized with polymicrobial, surgical site, catheter-related, or diabetic foot infections; or were discharged to places other than home. Patient demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses, cultures, prescribed antibiotics, susceptibilities, surgical procedures, and health outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients were divided in 2 cohorts for further analysis: TMP-SMX and clindamycin. The primary study outcome was composite failure defined as an additional positive MRSA culture from any site 5 to 90 days after treatment initiation or an additional intervention during a subsequent outpatient or inpatient visit. Baseline characteristics and failure rates were compared using χ(2), Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

Results

A total of 149 patients were included in this study. These patients had a median age of 36 years, 55% were men, 71% were Hispanic, 42% were uninsured, and 60% received an incision and drainage procedure. Patients who did not receive incision and drainage were twice as likely to experience the composite failure endpoint (57% vs 29%; P < .001). Failure rates were 25% for patients who received incision and drainage plus antibiotics compared with 60% for patients who received incision and drainage minus antibiotics (P = 0.03). When patients who did not receive incision and drainage were excluded, there were no significant differences between the TMP-SMX (n = 54) and clindamycin (n = 20) cohorts with respect to composite failures (26% vs 25%), microbiologic failures (13% vs 15%), additional inpatient interventions (6% vs 5%), or additional outpatient interventions (20% vs 20%).

Conclusions

Our findings reinforce the belief that incision and drainage and antibiotics are critical for the management of CA-MRSA skin infections. Patients who receive TMP-SMX or clindamycin for their CA-MRSA skin infections experience similar rates of treatment failure.

For topical therapy, "Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high)". For systemic therapy, "Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high)", and "dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended", while "When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate)". Additionally, "Systemic antimicrobials should be used for infections during outbreaks of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis to help eliminate nephritogenic strains of S. pyogenes from the community (strong, moderate)".

Nursing Mothers

Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use

BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. BACTRIM Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. BACTRIM DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

However, among patients with bacteraemia, mortality was nearly twice as high with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole — 14/41 (34%) versus 9/50 (18%) with vancomycin (risk ratio 1.90, 0.92 to 3.93). Among non-bacteraemic patients, mortality rates were low (5/94 (5%) v 4/67 (6%)) and not significantly different (risk ratio 0.89, 0.25 to 3.2).

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^115ugoME]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Oxazolidinones

Linezolid is available in IV and oral formulations. Linezolid provides an option for early switch to oral therapy, and dose reduction is not necessary in patients with renal insufficiency. Linezolid has shown to be active against many resistant gram-positive organisms including MRSA, VRE, and macrolide-resistant streptococci. In a study of patients with ABSSSIs due to MRSA, compared with vancomycin, linezolid-treated patients had significantly higher clinical and microbiological success rates at the end of treatment. Linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia and anemia are typically mild, reversible, and duration dependent. There is an interaction between linezolid and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Tedizolid, a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor, can be administered once daily, either orally or IV at equivalent doses. In 2 randomized trials, treatment with tedizolid for 6 days was shown to be noninferior to linezolid for 10 days. In addition, differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs have been observed between tedizolid and linezolid, possibly due to the effects of these agents on intestinal flora. The effect of tedizolid on normal intestinal flora has been shown to be limited and reversible, and another study showed that linezolid led to marked changes in gut flora composition. Further, the less frequent dosing with tedizolid (once daily vs twice daily with linezolid) may also somewhat reduce the overall risk of developing gastrointestinal AEs.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and Clindamycin

Several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin for the treatment of uncomplicated ABSSSIs. In a study of uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses treated with drainage, adjunctive treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 7 days resulted in higher cure rates compared with placebo. In another randomized study of uncomplicated wound infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin were similarly effective with comparable cure rates and AEs. A randomized clinical trial involving adults and children found no differences between clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in efficacy or safety for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. However, the development of new infections by 1 month of follow-up was lower in the clindamycin-treated group. Neither of these 2 antibiotics has been evaluated in a head-to-head comparison with the newer MRSA-active antibiotics.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116XRX5P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and CA-MRSA is required, options include clindamycin alone or TMP-SMX or a tetracycline in association with a β-lactam (eg, amoxicillin) or linezolid alone.

For hospitalized patients with severe SSTI, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, empirical therapy for MRSA should be considered, pending culture data. Options include intravenous (IV) vancomycin, PO or IV linezolid 600 mg twice daily, daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO 3 times a day, tigecycline 100 mg IV LD, then 50 mg twice daily.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice for difficult Gram positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft tissue infections where an aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin.

Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs), It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010 an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### Treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 μ g / mL to vancomycin: old (trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole) versus new (daptomycin or linezolid) agents [^116vqEwV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that agents other than vancomycin be considered for some types of infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to vancomycin is 2 μg/mL or more. Alternative therapeutic options include daptomycin and linezolid, 2 relatively new and expensive drugs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), an old and inexpensive agent.

Objective

To compare the clinical efficacy and potential cost savings associated with use of TMP/SMX compared to linezolid and daptomycin.

A retrospective study was conducted at Detroit Medical Center. For calendar year 2009, unique adults (age > 18 years) with infections due to MRSA with an MIC to vancomycin of 2 μg/mL were included if they received 2 or more doses of TMP/SMX and/or daptomycin and/or linezolid. Data were abstracted from patient charts and pharmacy records.

Results

There were 328 patients included in the study cohort: 143 received TMP/SMX alone, 89 received daptomycin alone, 75 received linezolid alone, and 21 patients received a combination of 2 or more of these agents. In univariate analysis, patients who received TMP/SMX alone had significantly better outcomes, including in-hospital (p = 0.003) and 90-day mortality (p < 0.001) compared to patients treated with daptomycin or linezolid. Patients receiving TMP/SMX were also younger (p < 0.001), had fewer comorbid conditions (p < 0.001), had less severe acute severity of illness (p < 0.001), and received appropriate therapy more rapidly (p = 0.001). In multivariate models the association between TMP/SMX treatment and mortality was no longer significant. Antimicrobial cost savings associated with using TMP/SMX averaged $2067.40 per patient.

Conclusions

TMP/SMX monotherapy compared favorably to linezolid and daptomycin in terms of treatment efficacy and mortality. Use of TMP/SMX instead of linezolid or daptomycin could potentially significantly reduce antibiotic costs. TMP/SMX should be considered for the treatment of MRSA infection with MIC of 2 μg/mL to vancomycin.

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia — TMP-SMX dosing and toxicity: Given toxicity and absent dose-response data, evidence that TMP dosing of > 15 mg/kg/day may increase adverse events without incremental benefit leads to a suggested trimethoprim component dose range of 10–15 mg/kg, with doses between 10 and 15 mg/kg/day expected to provide bacteriostasis for the majority of susceptible isolates, and TMP-SMX considered a treatment option when used in combination with a second agent.

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions

Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Respiratory Tract

Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment.

Respiratory Failure

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock

Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions

BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue BACTRIM immediately and institute appropriate management.

### What is the evidence for Co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant (MRSA) pneumonia? [^113cLKAX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the evidence for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Data Source: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1946 to May 20, 2019. The search was performed with the keywords methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole drug combination, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. Data Extraction: Studies reporting the use of the above antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia treatment with clinical outcomes were included. Search parameters were limited to English language and human studies only. Data Synthesis: The search yielded 16 relevant articles: 6 TMP-SMX, 8 clindamycin, zero doxycycline, and 2 minocycline. For TMP-SMX, prospective randomized trials showed variable results; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess MRSA pneumonia treatment. Retrospective studies with clindamycin suggested that it could be used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-MRSA antibiotics. There was no evidence for doxycycline use, but 2 small retrospective reviews appeared to support minocycline as a treatment option. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: These antibiotics are often used in clinical practice as potential treatment options for MRSA pneumonia. This article reviews the evidence for the clinical efficacy and safety of these agents. Conclusions: There are limited data to support use of TMP-SMX, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline in MRSA pneumonia treatment. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Clinicians should base their decision to use these agents on a case-by-case basis depending on clinical status and susceptibility results.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^113gWrmr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P = 0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P = 0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P = 0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^11521KG7]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This was an open label, parallel, one to one randomised controlled trial, conducted in four acute care hospitals (Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva (192 patients); Rambam Health Care Campus (38 patients); Holy Family Hospital Nazareth (7 patients); Wolfson Medical Center (6 patients)) in Israel, between July 2007 and April 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal guardian.

Study population and procedures

We included adult inpatients with severe infections caused by MRSA, including bacteraemia, and patients with highly probable MRSA infections. We defined bacteraemia as the isolation of MRSA in more than one blood culture bottle or isolated in a single bottle and accompanied by fever above 38°C, chills, or systolic blood pressure under 90 mm Hg. We defined other microbiologically documented MRSA infections by using predefined criteria adapted from surveillance definitions of healthcare associated infections, plus isolation of MRSA from a sterile sample from the source of infection. Patients with skin and soft tissue infections could be included only if they fulfilled the sepsis inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Patients with polymicrobial infections could be included, except those involving meticillin susceptible S aureus or mandating treatment with vancomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The highly probable group included patients with ventilator associated pneumonia and prior antibiotic treatment, central catheter related infections, and surgical site infections in the presence of a foreign body, all without microbiological documentation. We excluded patients who had received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin for more than 48 hours; patients with MRSA resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin; those with highly suspected or confirmed left sided endocarditis or meningitis; patients with chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min) and chronic haemodialysis (those with severe acute renal failure, including acute haemodialysis, could be included); neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia or bone marrow transplantation; and patients with known allergy to either study drug, treatment with methotrexate, pregnancy or lactation, previous enrolment in this study, or concurrent participation in another trial.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^117DMf2M]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — Staphylococcus aureus antimicrobial selection: When S. aureus is suspected to be susceptible to both clindamycin and vancomycin, empiric use of clindamycin is preferred over vancomycin. For methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), alternatives to vancomycin should be considered for vancomycin non-susceptible strains (MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL). Parenteral daptomycin and parenteral/oral linezolid have been studied in prospective pediatric trials for complicated staphylococcal skin infections, including MRSA, and provide options based on in vitro susceptibility testing. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) shows in vitro activity against most S. aureus strains including CA-MRSA, but no controlled, comparative data exist for TMP/SMX in ABA caused by CA-MRSA. No controlled, comparative data support the choice of one of these agents over another for invasive MRSA infections in children, and no controlled data exist to base recommendations for synergistic combination therapy; however, combining agents to broaden empiric antibacterial spectrum is appropriate for severe infections, particularly when Gram-negative coverage in addition to S. aureus is needed.

Pediatric AHO — TMP/SMX, daptomycin, and linezolid evidence: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has in vitro activity against CA-MRSA and effectiveness for skin infections, but no controlled data exist for osteomyelitis, with only limited retrospective data in 11 children. For children unable to use beta-lactams, vancomycin, or clindamycin due to allergies or intolerance, parenteral daptomycin and parenteral/oral linezolid provide additional options; in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind pediatric osteomyelitis study, 73 daptomycin-treated children were compared with 73 receiving standard-of-care antibiotics (vancomycin 51%, nafcillin/oxacillin 33%, cephalexin 18%, and clindamycin 1%), with statistically similar early outcomes at the day 5 time point (78% response vs 83% response), pathogens isolated from 62 children, only 4 children with CA-MRSA in each group, and treatment-emergent adverse events in 46% vs 63% respectively. In a single-center retrospective study of children treated with linezolid, cure was described in 11 of the 13 subjects, and use of linezolid for more than 2 weeks is associated with an increased risk of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy; these adverse effects usually resolve over many weeks once linezolid is discontinued.

Table 4 — empirical antibiotic therapy according to clinical presentation and microbiological data aligns infection severity and risk factors with likely pathogens and candidate agents. For mild infection with no complicating factors targeting gram‑positive cocci (GPC), potential regimens include semisynthetic penicillinase‑resistant penicillin (cloxacillin) or 1st generation cephalosporins (cephalexin). For mild infection with β‑lactam allergy or intolerance (GPC), options include clindamycin, fluoroquinolone (levo/moxi‑floxacin), trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. For moderate or severe infection without complicating factors (GPC ± GNR), options include β‑lactam; β‑lactamase inhibitor regimens (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam), 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), or group 1 carbapenem (ertapenem). For moderate or severe infection with MRSA risk factors, the table states to "consider adding, or substituting with" glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), linezolid, daptomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. Footnotes specify practical use: antibiotics enclosed in boxes are cited as examples; "where more than one agent is listed, only one of them should be prescribed unless otherwise indicated"; "oral antibiotic agents should generally not be used for severe infections, except as a follow‑on (switch) after initial parenteral therapy"; and clinicians should "consider modifying doses or agents selected for patients with comorbidities such as azotaemia, liver dysfunction, and obesity".

### Skin and soft tissue infections in immunocompetent patients [^111HfvYS]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The increasing incidence of skin and soft tissue infections requires family physicians to be familiar with the management of these conditions. Evidence of systemic infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, is an indication for inpatient management. Urgent surgical referral is imperative for those with life-threatening or rapidly advancing infections. In patients with uncomplicated abscesses measuring less than 5 cm in diameter, surgical drainage alone is the primary therapeutic intervention. Wound irrigation using tap water has similar outcomes as irrigation using sterile water. When antimicrobials are indicated, choice of agents depends on local resistance and susceptibility patterns. In settings where suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is low, beta-lactam antibiotics are the first-line treatments for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections without focal coalescence or trauma. When empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated and the infection is uncomplicated, oral agents, such as tetracyclines, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin, are preferred. Vancomycin is the first-line agent for MRSA in hospitalized patients, and newer agents, such as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline, should be reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate vancomycin therapy. There are insufficient data to support eradicating the carrier state in patients with MRSA or their contacts with nasal mupirocin or antibacterial body washes. Standard infection-control precautions, including proper and frequent handwashing, are a mainstay of MRSA prevention.

### Profile of a novel anionic fluoroquinolone-delafloxacin [^114VRSGT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines on the treatment of ABSSSIs classify them into nonpurulent (necrotizing infections, cellulitis, and erysipelas) and purulent (furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses) and further on the basis of severity (mild, moderate, and severe). A variety of antimicrobial agents are recommended depending upon the type and severity of infection, and if caused by S. aureus, the methicillin susceptibility of the causative strain. As recently reviewed, oxacillin (or another β-lactamase resistant penicillin such as dicloxacillin or nafcillin) or cefazolin (in case of allergy to penicillin) are usually recommended for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), whereas vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline are most often specifically recommended when the infection is caused by MRSA. Older agents such as clindamycin, doxycycline/minocycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are also used to treat infections caused by MSSA or MRSA. However, all of these drugs are associated with limitations that include local high level of resistance (clindamycin or doxycycline), high cost and toxicity (linezolid), decreased susceptibility (vancomycin; often requiring higher dosing that results in renal toxicity), and heightened risk of Clostridium difficile infection (eg, clindamycin). Although these drugs still form the mainstay of current treatment strategies, recent approvals of agents including dalbavancin, tedizolid, oritavancin, and delafloxacin have provided additional options for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including those caused by MRSA.

An additional concern is the ability of S. aureus to survive in the acidic environment of the skin. Their survival is dependent on expression of an enzyme that confers resistance to polyamines, anti-inflammatory compounds capable of promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration, which are present in the acidic environment of the skin and are toxic to S. aureus. Moreover, S. aureus can adopt specific modes of life (eg, in biofilms or intracellularly after phagocytosis by permissive cells) that play a role in the development of persistent/recurrent infections, including in skin and skin-associated structures. Thus, there is a need for therapeutic agents that are not only effective against resistant pathogens but also retain or even increase their activity at the acid pH prevailing at the surface of the skin, deep in biofilms, or in phagolysosomes.

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infections [^111MyGdr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Finally, the antibiogram of CA-MRSA isolates may vary from country to country. In Taiwan, CA-MRSA isolates are also resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents; 71.4%, 91.4%, and 41.2% are resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol, respectively. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is more effective against CA-MRSA isolates than other first-line antimicrobial agents: the resistance rate is 0%–65.7%. Therefore, clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be not adequate empiric antimicrobial agents for SSTIs in Taiwan or other areas with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for children with acute osteomyelitis [^111qyVP9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has complicated the conventional management of osteomyelitis. While oral clindamycin is commonly used to treat acute CA-MRSA osteomyelitis, the emergence of inducible clindamycin resistance among CA-MRSA isolates has made alternative therapy necessary. The excellent oral bioavailability, susceptibility profile, favorable palatability, and low cost of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) make this drug an attractive option for treating osteomyelitis, yet its clinical efficacy for osteomyelitis has not been established.

Methods

Between October 1998 and September 2009, 20 children who received a TMP-SMX-containing regimen for acute osteomyelitis at All Children's Hospital were identified from hospital records, and their cases reviewed for clinical outcome and drug safety.

Results

Patients ranged in age from 9 months to 17 years. Twelve (60%) of the patients were male. Causative pathogens were found in 8 (40%) cases of which 5 were CA-MRSA and 3 were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven patients (55%) received TMP-SMX as their primary therapy. The median dose of TMP-SMX was 16.4 mg/kg/d. During TMP-SMX therapy, 8 patients (40%) experienced adverse events; all were considered mild. Duration of total therapy was 26 to 59 days, with a median of 40 days. All 20 patients were considered cured of their infection at the end of therapy.

Conclusion

Orally administered TMP-SMX appears to be a useful and well-tolerated therapy for treatment of acute osteomyelitis in children. Further prospective comparative studies will be needed to confirm this observation.

### The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired hand infections [^116zTBuP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become increasingly prevalent in hand infections. Traditionally, the empiric treatment of hand infections has involved beta-lactam antibiotics, which are ineffective against MRSA. Centers for Disease Control recommends empiric coverage of MRSA infections if the local rate of MRSA exceeds 10% to 15%. A retrospective review was performed on all patients admitted for community-acquired soft tissue infections of the hand between 2004 and 2007 at a single institution. The overall incidence of MRSA was 60%. The incidence of MRSA in healthy adults was 64%, healthy pediatric patients was 100%, immunocompromised patients was 45%, and diabetic patients was 20%. The current rates of MRSA would imply that all patients presenting with hand infections should be treated empirically for MRSA. Linezolid is the only oral antibiotic approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating MRSA, but many studies have reported that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective antibiotic for outpatient treatment of MRSA.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^116yn9zF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment decisions in MRSA bacteremia require consideration of the prevalence and resistance profile of local strains, risk factors for a complicated clinical course, presence of comorbidities, concurrent interventions, and response to prior antibiotics. Current US and European treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 3. For most cases of MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin or daptomycin is the recommended treatment. The choice of antibiotic may also depend on if the bacteremia is secondary to another infection. For example, daptomycin, although indicated for treatment of SAB, is contraindicated for SAB originating from pneumonia since pulmonary surfactants inactivate it. Vancomycin poorly penetrates lung tissue; thus, linezolid or clindamycin are recommended if the strain is susceptible. Reports of MRSA isolates resistant or nonsusceptible to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftaroline, as well as multidrug-resistant MRSA clones, are a concerning trend. These data highlight the importance of early identification of MRSA and susceptibility to identify the optimal antibiotic.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis [^1149R1ni]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as, not only an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer people with cystic fibrosis with a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including P aeruginosa) or increased adverse effects from drugs, or both.

Search Methods

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE, clinical trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN Registry), handsearching article reference lists and through contact with experts in the field. Date of the last search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 27 July 2017. Ongoing trials registries were last searched: 07 August 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials with the primary aim of eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently assessed all search results for eligibility. They used the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

The review includes two trials with a total of 106 participants with MRSA infection. In both trials the active treatment was oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin; however, one trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. In both trials the control arm was observation only. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with CF as an outcome; however, the definition used for MRSA eradication differed. The first trial (n = 45) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that, when compared to control, oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures, odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence); however, by day 168 of follow-up there was no difference in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative in either treatment arm, OR 1.17 (95% CI 0.31 to 4.42) (low-quality evidence). In the second trial, successful eradication was defined as the absence of MRSA following treatment (oral co-trimoxazole and rifampicin with intranasal mupirocin or observation) in at least three cultures over a period of six months. At the time of reporting, 40 out of 61 participants had completed follow-up, but results showed no difference between groups. Eradication was achieved in 12 out 29 participants (41%) receiving active treatment, and in 9 out of 32 participants (28%) on the observation arm, OR 1.80 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.25) (very low-quality evidence). With regards to this review's secondary outcomes, these were reported in the first trial only. The trial reports that no differences were observed between the two arms in terms of pulmonary exacerbations (from screening to day 28), nasal colonisation, lung function, weight or participant-reported outcomes. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control, rate ratio 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.72) (P = 0.0102).

Authors' Conclusions

Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, by six months, the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative did not differ between treatment arms in either trial. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care, remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design and unclear detail reported in one trial. Based on the available evidence, it is the opinion of the authors that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

### Staphylococcus aureus-associated skin and soft tissue infections in ambulatory care [^114DYujT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

With the continued emergence of CA-MRSA, the clinical management of skin and soft tissue infections has returned to the basic principles of surgical drainage and debulking, wound culture, and the use of older antimicrobial agents other than β-lactams. However, our results indicate that β-lactam drugs consisting of cephalosporins and penicillins remain the most commonly prescribed therapy for skin and soft tissue infections and that the rate of use of cephalosporins increased over the 12-year study period. A recent study found that for 57% of patients seen in emergency departments for skin and soft tissue infections associated with MRSA, the infecting isolate was resistant to the agent prescribed. Before the emergence of CA-MRSA, the most appropriate form of antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infection was β-lactams (assuming penicillins consisted of antistaphylococcal agents). Now clinicians must take into account local and regional rates of CA-MRSA and consider the use of agents such as clindamycin (a lincosamide) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the empiric treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. Periodic monitoring of antimicrobial drug use may be helpful as CA-MRSA continues to emerge.

### Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new bug, old drugs [^112c1dXv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections and evaluate older antibiotics as suitable therapeutic treatment options.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1966-May 2006) were performed using the key terms methicillin resistance, community-acquired, community associated, treatment, Staphylococcus aureus, mec, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles were critically evaluated and all relevant information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

There has been a documented shift of methicillin resistance occurring in staphylococcal infections manifested within the community. Infections caused by CA-MRSA possess unique characteristics including lack of hospital-associated risk factors, improved susceptibility patterns, distinct genotypes, faster doubling times, and additional toxins. Potential therapeutic options to treat these infections include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and new antimicrobials.

Conclusions

CA-MRSA infections can be successfully treated with older, oral antibiotic agents including TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and tetracyclines. Fluoroquinolones and linezolid should be avoided as first-line agents.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^114BT1Uk]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The evidence

To inform the recommendations, the guideline panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of adjuvant antibiotic therapy compared with no antibiotic therapy in addition to incision and drainage in patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses.

A large RCT published in March 2016 suggested that TMP-SMX treatment resulted in a higher cure rate than placebo among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess. Another RCT published in June 2017 found that, compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in addition to incision and drainage improved short term outcomes in patients who had an uncomplicated skin abscess. The Rapid Recommendations team believed these two trials, in addition to the existing body of evidence, might change practice.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the characteristics of patients and trials included in the systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. There were 14 RCTs: eight included a comparison of antibiotics versus no antibiotics, and seven included a comparison of two different antibiotics. Explicit descriptions of abscess definitions, for each trial, were summarised in the accompanying systematic review (table C of appendix 2). The largest trial specifically focused on small abscesses (all < 5 cm diameter and about half ≤ 2 cm) in patients who had no signs of systemic infection. The RCTs included participants with skin abscesses anywhere on the body.

Fig 1
Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of the effects of antibiotics on uncomplicated skin abscesses. (MRSA = meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSSA = meticillin susceptible S aureus)

Eleven trials reported study setting, of which nine were conducted in emergency departments, one in outpatient dermatology clinics, and one in an Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Services (ISIS) clinic involving patients with high rates of comorbidity, such as infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV. The RCTs included children and adults. Almost all patients underwent incision and drainage for their skin abscess. The most common pathogen was MRSA (49–88%) followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 9–18%).

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115SYZbY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — impetigo and ecthyma therapy notes that cultures of the vesicle fluid, pus, erosions, or ulcers establish the cause and, unless cultures yield streptococci alone, antimicrobial therapy should be active against both S. aureus and streptococci. Oral penicillinase–resistant penicillin or first-generation cephalosporins are usually effective as most staphylococcal isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are methicillin susceptible, with alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients or infections with MRSA including doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice, with a macrolide or clindamycin as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Topical treatment with mupirocin or retapamulin is as effective as oral antimicrobials for impetigo, and systemic therapy is preferred for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission.

### A 39-year-old man with a skin infection [^116ZHwAY]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

The case of Mr M, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community. Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

### Ceftobiprole compared with vancomycin plus aztreonam in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial (TARGET) [^115zPeYC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The safety findings of ceftobiprole in this study were consistent with its established safety profile, including that reported in previous studies in cSSTIs and pneumonia. The most common AEs were related to gastrointestinal disorders and less than 2% of patients experienced AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, suggesting that ceftobiprole is well tolerated in the majority of patients.

When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America include several antibacterial options, such as vancomycin, linezolid, clindamycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, or telavancin, with specific recommendations varying depending on the severity of infection and type of ABSSSI. Since these guidelines were issued in 2014, additional agents have become available, including tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and delafloxacin. With the exception of delafloxacin, these agents are all indicated in gram-positive infections only. Our study results, together with previous studies with ceftobiprole in this setting, suggest that ceftobiprole has the potential to be an effective broad-spectrum treatment option for ABSSSIs, with suitability for use in those with gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, or mixed gram-positive/gram-negative infections. Unlike with vancomycin, monitoring of serum trough concentrations is not required with ceftobiprole, which may help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^115xLm8c]. FDA. Low credibility.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Pediatric patients aged < 2 months**: use caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Randomized controlled noninferiority trial comparing daptomycin to vancomycin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections in an observation unit [^117CQand]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing in complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Treatment is heterogeneous and can require inpatient admission to an observation unit (OU). Vancomycin is commonly used in the OU for treatment, but increasing MRSA resistance to vancomycin suggests the need for alternatives. Daptomycin is an alternative but it is not known how it compares with vancomycin.

Objective

This study tested the hypothesis that daptomycin is noninferior to vancomycin for the treatment of cSSSI in an OU, using a relative risk (RR) of 1.3 as the noninferiority limit.

Methods

Subjects admitted to an ED-based OU with a diagnosis of cSSSI were eligible. Consenting subjects were randomized 1:1 to intravenous (i.v.) vancomycin at 15 mg/kg dosing every 12 h or i.v. daptomycin at 4 mg/kg once. Subjects were followed until they met objective criteria for discharge home or hospital admission. Discharged patients were prescribed 10–14 days of oral cephalexin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin if allergic to either of these medications. The primary endpoint was meeting objective discharge criteria with no change in antibiotic therapy or return to the ED for the same cellulitis within 30 days of OU discharge.

Results

There were 100 patients enrolled. RR for satisfying the endpoint was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.58–1.98) for daptomycin compared with vancomycin. Hospital admission rates were 36% and 32% for daptomycin and vancomycin treatment, respectively.

Conclusion

Daptomycin was not inferior to vancomycin in the treatment of cSSSI in an OU.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113vS5vE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infection — antibiotic selection recommends a first-generation cephalosporin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin for MSSA, or vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline where risk factors for MRSA are high (nasal colonization, prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, recent antibiotics) (strong, low). Agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended for infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract (strong, low).

### Antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections: the challenge of outpatient therapy [^115w8uoj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are becoming increasingly prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Certain strains are notorious for causing skin and soft tissue infections in patients with no established risk factors. In this article, we report our findings on the dynamic antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA and outpatient prescription trend for skin and soft tissue infections within our community.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 1876 patients evaluated in the emergency department of an urban community hospital from 2003 to 2012. Data regarding culture isolates and associated antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic treatment, site of specimen collection, age, race, and sex were collected and analyzed.

Results

Analysis of 1879 culture specimens yielded 2193 isolates. In some cases, a single specimen yielded polymicrobial growth. Staphylococcus aureus represented 996 isolates (45.4%); 463 were methicillin-susceptible (21.1%) and 533 (24.3%) were methicillin-resistant. Most patients were prescribed a single- or poly-drug regimen of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Antimicrobial resistance analysis indicated that MRSA became increasingly resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics over time: 10% and 6% in 2012 vs 3.5% and 3.4% in 2007 for clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively.

Conclusion

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a particularly virulent, rapidly adaptive pathogen that is becoming increasingly difficult to combat with existing antibiotics. Care must be taken to ensure appropriate treatment and follow-up of patients with known MRSA infections.

### WSES / GAIS / WSIS / SIS-E / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^111cQDs1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of CA-MRSA varies worldwide, ranging from less than 1% in some countries to more than 50% in others, with the prevalence been higher in children than in adults.

Clindamycin has been used to treat CA-MRSA, although clindamycin resistance is now very common. Like penicillin, clindamycin has activity against group A and B streptococci and S. aureus. It has virtually no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, clindamycin is bacteriostatic, and its use is at high risk for the development of Clostridioides difficile infection.

Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), doxycycline, and minocycline are effective against CA-MRSA. However, they have no activity against group A and B streptococci. Therefore, if coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin, linezolid or tedizolid alone or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam agent (amoxicillin, cephalexin) or azithromycin in the case of beta-lactam allergy.

For many years glycopeptides have been the microbiological agents of choice in complicated Gram-positive infections. Frequent use of vancomycin as the drug of choice for treatment of infections caused by MRSA has putatively led to selection of the isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin.

Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides such as in vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and in vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRA) remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics. Heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) shows MICs in the susceptible range (≤ 2 μg/mL), because of a sub-population that expresses a resistant phenotype. Infections caused by VRSA, VISA and hVISA can lead to higher rates of vancomycin treatment failure and are associated with extended hospitalization, higher risk of persistent infection, and elevated treatment costs.

### Methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: management principles and selection of antibiotic therapy [^112XFSfn]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was clinical treatment failure at seven days and was a composite of death, persistence of fever (< 38°C for two consecutive days and no increase above 38° after resolution was required to rule out persistence), persistence of hypotension (< 90 mm Hg systolic or need for vasopressor support), non-improving Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (for baseline SOFA ≥ 3, a decrease of at least 30% was required; and for baseline SOFA < 3, a stable or decreased SOFA score was required to rule out failure), or persistent bacteraemia on day 7. Blood cultures were repeated on day 2 for all patients with bacteraemia and daily thereafter for patients with persistent fever, persistent bacteraemia, or other signs of infection. We also defined a primary safety outcome of all cause mortality at 30 days.

Secondary outcomes included failure or modification of treatment, comprising treatment failure (as defined) or antibiotic treatment modification; bacteriological failure, defined as growth of MRSA on day 7 cultures; persistence of bacteraemia at 48 hours; length of hospital admission; duration of fever, summing all days with at least one measurement of temperature 38°C or above until day 30; and development of resistance defined as acquisition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin resistant S aureus or vancomycin resistant Enterococci. Adverse events included renal failure defined using RIFLE criteria, rash, leucopoenia, any diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea, and other adverse events.

Skin and soft tissue infections — empiric antibacterial strategies and antivirals emphasize that in patients with suspected or confirmed SSTI (initial infection), therapy should include broad-spectrum agents administered at the first clinical signs or symptoms of infection, antibiotic selection should follow the clinical care guidelines developed by IDSA and the NCCN, gram-negative infections have shown excellent results with broad-spectrum monotherapy (carbapenems, antipseudomonal cephalosporins, or piperacillin/tazobactam), agents with activity against MRSA (linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline) have FDA approval for SSTIs but have not been comprehensively studied in neutropenia and linezolid use has been associated with delayed ANC recovery, the combination of ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred oral regimen for low-risk patients with levofloxacin 750 mg daily sometimes suggested due to activity trade-offs, fluoroquinolone prophylaxis should preclude fluoroquinolones for empiric therapy with broad-spectrum β-lactams considered instead, and intravenous acyclovir should be added for patients without prior effective HSV/VZV prophylaxis who develop suspected or confirmed viral skin lesions.

Glanders — Therapy is guided by in vitro susceptibility with multiple agent options. Ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended based on in vitro susceptibility (strong, low).

Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. ADULTS In patients with normal renal function, intravenous vancomycin is recommended, but should not exceed 2 g per dose. In seriously ill patients with suspected MRSA infection, a loading dose of 25 to 30 mg per kg may be considered. Use of trough vancomycin concentrations is the most accurate and practical method to guide vancomycin dosing.

Serum trough concentrations should be obtained at steady state conditions, before the fourth or fifth dose. Monitoring peak vancomycin concentrations is not recommended. Vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mcg per mL are recommended in patients with serious infections, such as bacteremia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, pneumonia, or severe skin and soft-tissue infections caused by MRSA. For most patients with skin and soft-tissue infections who have normal renal function and are not obese, traditional dosages of 1 g every 12 hours are adequate, and trough monitoring is not required. Trough vancomycin monitoring is recommended for patients with serious infections or who are morbidly obese, have renal dysfunction, or have fluctuating volumes of distribution. A regimen of continuous infusion is not recommended. CHILDREN Data on vancomycin dosing in children are limited.

The recommended treatment is vancomycin in children with serious or invasive disease. The effectiveness and safety of targeting trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mcg per mL in children require additional study, but should be considered in those with serious infections, such as bacteremia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, pneumonia, or severe skin and soft-tissue infections.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^113BHvRB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations: Community-acquired MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections, such as pustules, furuncles, and small abscesses, usually respond to incision and drainage. This may be sufficient to treat small, uncomplicated purulent lesions, although clear evidence is lacking. More complicated lesions are usually treated with antimicrobial agents. Patients with fever or other systemic symptoms are also usually treated with antimicrobial agents. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. A retrospective review showed TMP/SMX to be effective for skin and soft-tissue infections.

However, because TMP/SMX may inadequately treat group A streptococci, combining it with another antimicrobial may be preferred when the specific organism is unknown. The ideal dosage of TMP/SMX for treating community-acquired MRSA is unknown, although one small study reported higher success rates when two double-strength pills were given twice daily, compared with one pill twice daily. Clindamycin is widely used in children for community-acquired MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections, and is anecdotally reported to be effective. Resistance to clindamycin varies widely, from less than 12 percent in San Francisco, Calif., to as much as 76 percent in Boston, Mass. Routine microbiologic testing may falsely report community-acquired MRSA isolates to be sensitive to clindamycin because of the inducible expression of the MLS. B gene, which methylates the binding site and renders the organism resistant.

This can be avoided by ordering tests, such as the double-disk D-test, to detect this type of inducible resistance. Linezolid has been demonstrated to be effective in MRSA infections in clinical controlled trials. It may be especially useful in serious skin and soft-tissue infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, because of its ability to inhibit toxin production. However, a reasonable alternative would be to use vancomycin with clindamycin for this purpose.
