## Question

A round extendable table has a diameter of 1 meter. When extended, a 1 m × 0.5 m rectangle fits between the two semicircular parts of the tabletop. Does the tabletop then have two points that are more than 150 cm apart?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, when a round extendable table with a 1-meter diameter is extended by inserting a 1 m × 0.5 m rectangular leaf between the two semicircular halves, there exist two points on the resulting tabletop that are more than 150 cm apart. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry of the original round table and its radius. Then, I should verify how the rectangular leaf is positioned and how it changes the overall shape. Next, I will identify the two points that are most likely to be farthest apart and calculate that distance. Finally, I will compare the result to 150 cm and confirm the answer with a quick sanity check.

> Let me first confirm the basic dimensions. The original table is a circle with a 1-meter diameter, so the radius is 0.5 meters, which is 50 cm. That means any two points on the original tabletop are at most 100 cm apart, which is less than 150 cm, so the extension is necessary to exceed that threshold [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify how the extension works. The rectangular leaf is 1 m by 0.5 m and fits between the two semicircular halves. I initially thought this might create a total length of 1.5 m by simply adding 0.5 m to the diameter, but hold on, that's not quite right because the semicircles already contribute half-circles that abut the rectangle. The correct way to visualize this is that the two semicircular halves are separated by the 0.5 m width of the rectangle, so the total length becomes the diameter of a semicircle plus the width of the rectangle, i.e., 1 m + 0.5 m = 1.5 m, which is 150 cm. Let me reconsider: yes, that's accurate because the semicircles are pushed apart by the 0.5 m leaf, extending the longest dimension to 1.5 m [^notfound].

> I will now examine which two points are farthest apart. The maximal distance will be between the outermost points on opposite semicircles, aligned along the axis that includes the 0.5 m rectangle. In other words, from the far edge of one semicircle, across the 0.5 m leaf, to the far edge of the opposite semicircle. That total span is 0.5 m (radius) + 0.5 m (leaf width) + 0.5 m (radius) = 1.5 m, which equals 150 cm [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The question is whether there are two points more than 150 cm apart. My calculation shows the maximum distance is exactly 150 cm, not more than 150 cm. So, strictly speaking, there are no two points on the extended tabletop that are more than 150 cm apart; the greatest possible separation is 150 cm [^notfound].

> Let me double-check with a quick sanity check. If I tried to claim a distance greater than 150 cm, I would need a longer total span than 1.5 m, but the geometry constrains the maximum to 1.5 m because the semicircles each contribute 0.5 m from center to edge and the rectangle adds 0.5 m between them. Therefore, the answer is no, there are not two points more than 150 cm apart; the maximum distance is exactly 150 cm [^notfound].

The extended tabletop forms an **oval shape** with a maximum length of 1.5 m (100 cm + 50 cm) and a width of 1 m. The farthest points are at the ends of the major axis, so the maximum distance is **1.5 m**, which equals 150 cm. Therefore, there are **no two points more than 150 cm apart** on the extended tabletop.

---

## Geometric analysis

### Original round table

The original table is a **circle with a 1 m diameter**, so its radius is 0.5 m. The maximum distance between any two points on the original tabletop is the diameter, which is 1 m (100 cm).

---

### Extension with rectangular leaf

When the table is extended, a **1 m × 0.5 m rectangle** is inserted between the two semicircular parts. This configuration creates a new shape that is essentially an oval (ellipse-like) with the following dimensions:

- **Length**: The length of the extended tabletop is the sum of the diameter of the original round table and the width of the rectangular leaf. Therefore, the total length is 1 m + 0.5 m = 1.5 m (150 cm).
- **Width**: The width of the extended tabletop remains the same as the diameter of the original round table, which is 1 m (100 cm).

---

### Maximum distance between two points

The maximum distance between any two points on an oval shape is the **length of its major axis**. In this case, the major axis corresponds to the length of the extended tabletop, which is 1.5 m (150 cm). Therefore, the maximum distance between any two points on the extended tabletop is exactly 150 cm.

---

## Conclusion

The extended tabletop has a **maximum distance of 150 cm** between its two farthest points. Thus, there are **no two points on the tabletop that are more than 150 cm apart**.

### Impact of knee support and shape of tabletop on rectum and prostate position [^e35c821e]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the impact of different tabletops with or without a knee support on the position of the rectum, prostate, and bulb of the penis; and to evaluate the effect of these patient-positioning devices on treatment planning.

Methods and Materials

For 10 male volunteers, five MRI scans were made in four different positions: on a flat tabletop with knee support, on a flat tabletop without knee support, on a rounded tabletop with knee support, and on a rounded tabletop without knee support. The fifth scan was in the same position as the first. With image registration, the position differences of the rectum, prostate, and bulb of the penis were measured at several points in a sagittal plane through the central axis of the prostate. A planning target volume was generated from the delineated prostates with a margin of 10 mm in three dimensions. A three-field treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 Gy to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements point was automatically generated from each planning target volume. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for all rectal walls.

Results

The shape of the tabletop did not affect the rectum and prostate position. Addition of a knee support shifted the anterior and posterior rectal walls dorsally. For the anterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 9.9 mm (standard error of the mean [SEM] 1.7 mm) at the top of the prostate. For the posterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 10.2 mm (SEM 1.5 mm) at the middle of the prostate. Therefore, the rectal filling was pushed caudally when a knee support was added. The knee support caused a rotation of the prostate around the left-right axis at the apex (i.e., a dorsal rotation) by 5.6 degrees (SEM 0.8 degrees) and shifts in the caudal and dorsal directions of 2.6 mm (SEM 0.4 cm) and 1.4 mm (SEM 0.6 mm), respectively. The position of the bulb of the penis was not influenced by the use of a knee support or rounded tabletop. The volume of the rectal wall receiving the same dose range (e.g., 40–75 Gy) was reduced by 3.5% (SEM 0.9%) when a knee support was added. No significant differences were observed between the first and fifth scan (flat tabletop with knee support) for all measured points, thereby excluding time trends.

Conclusions

The rectum and prostate were significantly shifted dorsally by the use of a knee support. The rectum shifted more than the prostate, resulting in a dose benefit compared with irradiation without knee support. The shape of the tabletop did not influence the rectum or prostate position.

### Use of carotid ultrasound to identify subclinical vascular disease and evaluate cardiovascular disease risk: a consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography carotid intima-media thickness task force. endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine [^254ea43f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement approach — B-mode is preferred and calibration is advised: B-mode imaging is preferred over M-mode imaging, as M-mode provides measurement of only a single point of thickness rather than a segmental value and perpendicular imaging is challenging. Because M-mode or point-to-point B-mode measurements are limited to multiples of the pixel size, precision is reduced unless multiple (several hundred) points are measured, and multiple measurements of several extended segment lengths permit higher precision expression of CIMT values. All reported observational studies relating CIMT values to cardiovascular events used B-mode measurements. A small parts ultrasound phantom should be used to determine whether the ultrasound system is calibrated.

Methods

Materials

We use monodisperse spherical glass beads of nominal diameter d = 0.05 cm or 0.1 cm. The grains are Potters Industries A-series technical quality glass beads. The material density is ρ glass = 2.54 ± 0.01 g cm −3, found by sinking grains into water and measuring the volume of displaced water versus the increase in mass. Filtered tap water is used for the submerged cases. Based on standard textbook values for density ρ f and viscosity η, the expected terminal velocity of the smaller (larger) beads is, in accord with visual observation.

Devices

For all experiments we use flat-bottomed cylindrical hoppers with concentric circular orifices. The bottom plate consists of a polycarbonate disc with a 2.5 cm hole and a 5.1 cm depression to accommodate interchangeable aluminum discs 0.6 cm thick, each having an orifice of different diameter D. The orifice consists of a cylindrical hole that extends 0.1 cm straight down from the top of the disc and then expands out in a 45° bevel cut. The hopper sidewalls consist of interchangeable polycarbonate tubes of desired inner diameter D h, and 30 cm height, glued to a flange that bolts to the bottom plate. This design makes it possible to vary the orifice diameter and hopper size reproducibly and independently. The top of the hopper is either open, or is sealed off and connected to a gear pump (Cole-Parmer 75210–50) to impose a desired volumetric flow rateof water into the hopper with precision.

### Extending resolution within a single imaging frame [^530b151c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The MS is locally computed by a kernel window that slides throughout the entire image, subtracts the sample mean (weighted local mean) as well as the central value of the kernel using a spatial-range neighborhood (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. S5, Supplementary Table S1). The MS is a vector that always points towards the direction of the intensity gradient and its length provides a local measure of the fluorescence density and brightness –; its magnitude depends on the value difference between the central pixel of the neighborhood and the surrounding pixels. A mathematical proof, provided in Supplementary Note 4, demonstrates that the minimum MS value, computed from a Gaussian distribution, matches with the point of maximum intensity of the initial distribution (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. S6).

The increase in resolution offered by MSSR 0 was evaluated by the Rayleigh and Sparrow limits –, which are two criteria that establish resolution bounds for two near-point sources (Fig. 1b). Processing with MSSR 0 of two point sources located at their resolution limit (2.5 σ and 2 σ for Rayleigh and Sparrow limit respectively, Fig. 1c vertical discontinuous lines) decreases the dip (height at the middle point)within their intensity distributions (Fig. 1 b, c). Processing a single image with MSSR 0 shifts the resolution limit by 26 and 20% according to the Rayleigh and Sparrow limits, respectively, and reduces the FWHM of individual emitters (Fig. 1c vertical continuous lines). A comparison of the shrinkability of MSSR 0 applied to Gaussian and Bessel PSFs are shown in Supplementary Fig. S9. The reduction of FWHM of Bessel PSF at different wavelengths of the visible spectrum are shown in Supplementary Fig. S10.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Space-time wave packets localized in all dimensions [^f546d8a4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The representation in Fig. 1 is particularly useful in identifying a path towards synthesizing 3D ST wave packets. When 45° < θ < 90°, the ST wave packet is superluminal, Ω is positive, and ω o is the minimum allowable frequency in the spectrum. When viewed in-space, the wavelengths are arranged in concentric circles, with long wavelengths (low frequencies) at the center, and shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) extending outward. On the other hand, when 0° < θ < 45°, the ST wave packet is subluminal, Ω is negative, and ω o is the maximum allowable frequency in the spectrum. The wavelengths are again arranged in concentric circles in-space – but in the opposite order: short wavelengths are close to the center and longer wavelengths extend outward. For both subluminal and superluminal 3D ST wave packets, each ω is associated with a single radial spatial frequency k r (ω), and is related to it via the relationship in Eq. (1). This representation indicates the need for arranging the wavelengths in concentric circles with square-root radial chirp, and then converting the spatial spectrum into physical space via a spherical lens. Moreover, adding a spectral phase factor e i ℓ χ, where ℓ is an integer and χ is the azimuthal angle in spectral space, produces OAM in physical space (Supplementary Note 1 B).

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate [^60ef48d2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There is inter-patient variability in the relative potency of opioid drugs and formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral hydrocodone dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral hydrocodone dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose.

In a hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets using Table 1 as a guide for the initial hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets dose. To obtain the initial hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets dose, first use Table 1 to convert the prior oral opioids to a total hydrocodone daily dose and then reduce the calculated daily hydrocodone dose by 25% to account for interpatient variability in relative potency of different opioids.

Consider the following when using the information found in Table 1.

This is not a table of equianalgesic doses.
The conversion factors in this table are only for the conversion from one of the listed oral opioid analgesics to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets.
The table cannot be used to convert from hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets to another opioid. Doing so will result in an over-estimation of the dose of the new opioid and may result in fatal overdose.

### The use of plots in orthopaedic literature [^95fed5f5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Plots are an elegant and effective way to represent data. At their best they encourage the reader and promote comprehension. A graphical representation can give a far more intuitive feel to the pattern of results in the study than a list of numerical data, or the result of a statistical calculation. The temptation to exaggerate differences or relationships between variables by using broken axes, overlaid axes, or inconsistent scaling between plots should be avoided. A plot should be self-explanatory and not complicated. It should make good use of the available space. The axes should be scaled appropriately and labelled with an appropriate dimension. Plots are recognised statistical methods of presenting data and usually require specialised statistical software to create them. The statistical analysis and methods to generate the plots are as important as the methodology of the study itself. The software, including dates and version numbers, as well as statistical tests should be appropriately referenced. Following some of the guidance provided in this article will enhance a manuscript.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^7290ab6b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Standardization of spirometry — display and digitization requirements specify acquisition, graph scaling, and start-of-test display. For digitization of the flow or volume signal, the sampling rate must be ≥ 100 Hz with a minimum resolution of 12 bits. For the flow–volume graph, expiratory flow must be plotted upward and expiratory volume toward the right, and a 2:1 aspect ratio must be maintained so that 2 L/s of flow and 1 L of volume are the same distance on their respective axes. For the start of test display, the volume–time graph must begin at the point of maximum inspiration or 1 second before Time 0, whichever occurs first, and should continue to the end of the plateau or the beginning of inspiration. Displays of flow versus volume provide more detail than volume–time graphs for the first 1 second of the FVC maneuver, whereas volume–time graphs provide more detail for the latter part of the maneuver.

### Gradient matters via filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing [^c3c92cbf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gradient matters with hierarchical structures endow the natural world with excellent integrity and diversity. Currently, direct ink writing 3D printing is attracting tremendous interest, and has been used to explore the fabrication of 1D and 2D hierarchical structures by adjusting the diameter, spacing, and angle between filaments. However, it is difficult to generate complex 3D gradient matters owing to the inherent limitations of existing methods in terms of available gradient dimension, gradient resolution, and shape fidelity. Here, we report a filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing strategy that enables conventional extrusion 3D printers to produce 1D, 2D, and 3D gradient matters with tunable heterogeneous structures by continuously varying the volume of deposited ink on the printing trajectory. In detail, we develop diameter-programmable filaments by customizing the printing velocity and height. To achieve high shape fidelity, we specially add supporting layers at needed locations. Finally, we showcase multi-disciplinary applications of our strategy in creating horizontal, radial, and axial gradient structures, letter-embedded structures, metastructures, tissue-mimicking scaffolds, flexible electronics, and time-driven devices. By showing the potential of this strategy, we anticipate that it could be easily extended to a variety of filament-based additive manufacturing technologies and facilitate the development of functionally graded structures.

### Calculating the absorbed dose from radioactive patients: the line-source versus point-source model [^a61be68e]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In calculations of absorbed doses from radioactive patients, the activity distribution in such patients is generally assumed to be an unattenuated point source and the dose to exposed individuals at a given distance is therefore calculated using the inverse square law. In many nuclear medicine patients, the activity distribution is widely dispersed and does not simulate a point source. In these cases, a line-source model is proposed to more accurately reflect this extended activity distribution.

Methods

Calculations of dose rate per unit activity were performed for a point source and for line sources of lengths of 20, 50, 70, 100, and 174 cm, and the ratios of line-source values to point-source values were calculated. In addition, radionuclide-independent conversion factors, to convert exposure rate constants to dose rates per unit activity, for these line-source lengths at various distances were determined.

Results

The calculated values, substantiated by published data, indicate that the inverse square law approximation is not valid for a line source until a certain distance is reached, dependent on the length of the line source. For the 20-, 50-, 70-, 100-, and 174-cm line sources, the dose rate values estimated by the inverse square law approximation are within approximately 10% of the values estimated using the line-source approach at distances of 20, 45, 60, 85, and 145 cm, respectively. At closer distances, use of the point-source model for a patient with an extended activity distribution will overestimate the radiation absorbed dose to exposed individuals, sometimes by a very significant amount.

Conclusion

The line-source model is a more realistic and practical approach than the traditional point-source model for determining the dose to individuals exposed to radioactive patients with widespread activity distributions.

### Time-resolved 3D contrast-enhanced MRA of an extended FOV using continuous table motion [^24152694]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A method is presented for acquiring 3D time-resolved MR images of an extended (> 100 cm) longitudinal field of view (FOV), as used for peripheral MR angiographic runoff studies. Previous techniques for long-FOV peripheral MRA have generally provided a single image (i.e., with no time resolution). The technique presented here generates a time series of 3D images of the FOV that lies within the homogeneous volume of the magnet. This is achieved by differential sampling of 3D k-space during continuous motion of the patient table. Each point in the object is interrogated in five consecutive 3D image sets generated at 2.5-s intervals. The method was tested experimentally in eight human subjects, and the leading edge of the bolus was observed in real time and maintained within the imaging FOV. The data revealed differential bolus velocities along the vasculature of the legs.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^4bbc4a51]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

### High-resolution tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing [^457c7eee]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing, an entire three-dimensional object is simultaneously solidified by irradiating a liquid photopolymer volume from multiple angles with dynamic light patterns. Though tomographic additive manufacturing has the potential to produce complex parts with a higher throughput and a wider range of printable materials than layer-by-layer additive manufacturing, its resolution currently remains limited to 300µm. Here, we show that a low-étendue illumination system enables the production of high-resolution features. We further demonstrate an integrated feedback system to accurately control the photopolymerization kinetics over the entire build volume and improve the geometric fidelity of the object solidification. Hard and soft centimeter-scale parts are produced in less than 30seconds with 80µm positive and 500µm negative features, thus demonstrating that tomographic additive manufacturing is potentially suitable for the ultrafast fabrication of advanced and functional constructs.

Within-maneuver evaluation and back-extrapolated volume (BEV) — at the point of PEF on the volume–time graph, a tangent is drawn and its intersection on the abscissa defines time 0, which becomes the start for all timed measurements; the BEV is the volume of gas that has already been expired from maximal lung volume to time 0 and is included in the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and FVC (forced vital capacity) measurements; to ensure that the FEV1 comes from a maximal effort, the BEV must be ≤ 5% of the FVC or 0.100 L, whichever is greater; the 0.100-L tolerance is a reduction from the 0.150-L tolerance in the 2005 standards; the hesitation time, defined as the time from the point of maximal inspiration to time 0, should be 2 seconds or less; FEV1 and FVC measurements from a maneuver with BEV exceeding the limit are neither acceptable nor usable, and a large BEV will usually result in an erroneously high FEV1; patients with upper airway obstruction or neuromuscular disease are often unable to initiate a rapid increase in flow, and the BEV limit may be exceeded.

2.1 Dosing Instructions

Treatment with extended release potassium citrate should be added to a regimen that limits salt intake (avoidance of foods with high salt content and of added salt at the table) and encourages high fluid intake (urine volume should be at least two liters per day). The objective of treatment with potassium citrate extended-release tablets is to provide potassium citrate in sufficient dosage to restore normal urinary citrate (greater than 320 mg/day and as close to the normal mean of 640 mg/day as possible), and to increase urinary pH to a level of 6.0 or 7.0.

Monitor serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride and carbon dioxide), serum creatinine and complete blood counts every four months and more frequently in patients with cardiac disease, renal disease or acidosis. Perform electrocardiograms periodically. Treatment should be discontinued if there is hyperkalemia, a significant rise in serum creatinine or a significant fall in blood hematocrit or hemoglobin.

2.2 Severe Hypocitraturia

In patients with severe hypocitraturia (urinary citrate < 150 mg/day), therapy should be initiated at a dosage of 60 mEq /day (30 mEq two times/day or 20 mEq three times/day with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or bedtime snack). Twenty-four hour urinary citrate and/or urinary pH measurements should be used to determine the adequacy of the initial dosage and to evaluate the effectiveness of any dosage change. In addition, urinary citrate and/or pH should be measured every four months. Doses of potassium citrate extended-release tablets greater than 100 mEq/day have not been studied and should be avoided.

2.3 Mild to Moderate Hypocitraturia

In patients with mild to moderate hypocitraturia (urinary citrate > 150 mg/day) therapy should be initiated at 30 mEq/day (15 mEq two times/day or 10 mEq three times/day with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or bedtime snack). Twenty-four hour urinary citrate and/or urinary pH measurements should be used to determine the adequacy of the initial dosage and to evaluate the effectiveness of any dosage change. Doses of potassium citrate extended-release tablet greater than 100 mEq/day have not been studied and should be avoided.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Deconvolution volumetric additive manufacturing [^552e1997]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Polymerization time simulations

The dashed curves in Fig. 3 and solid and dashed curves in S5-S7 were obtained by convolving a unit dose square function (the dose projected to form the disk) by the diffusion kernel and the PSF for each time step. The dose needed to initiate polymerization is found by recording the dose obtained at the (experimentally measured) time of polymerization onset for the thickest disk. The simulated polymerization onset time curve is then found by looping through in time and recording at the time at which the dose for a disk thickness exceeds the dose required for polymerization. We perform this calculation for 100 equally-spaced disk thicknesses (h values) between 0.054 mm and 1.08 mm. The diffusion kernel is updated for each time step (0.5 s) up to a maximum of 375 s. This fine time step yields a denser temporal sampling than would be obtained by only updating every vial rotation, which is how we calculate the PSF for deconvolution purposes. The curves shown in Fig. 3 terminate at the smallest writable disk size within the simulation time of 375 s. In practice, convective flow from the exothermic polymerization reaction and vial wobble further limits the thinnest printable disk. Simulations were all written in Python.

Projection calculations

Projection calculations were performed in a similar manner as previously reported. Briefly, a STL CAD model is imported into Python and voxellized using the Trimesh package. Solid voxels have value 1, empty (background) voxels have value 0. For the bolt/nut (Fig. S12) print, background voxels were set to 0.25. As previously reported, this helps to alleviate artifacts from subsequent ramp filtering (see next paragraph). Next, deconvolution correction was applied via Eqs. 6–7. Note that deconvolution is applied in 3D, not layer-by-layer.

The resulting deconvolved volume is then sliced into layers. Each layer is Radon transformed and then ramp filtered. Negative pixel values are set to 0. The resulting ramp filtered Radon transforms are reassembled into a sequence of 2D images, one image for each angular sample. Calculations are performed at an angular sampling rate of 1 image per degree. Finally, projections are corrected to counteract the lensing effect of the vial and the non-telecentricity of the projector, as in refs.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^4de101b2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 3 c, d shows the topological reconstruction of modular origami structures generated by other templates — a cone and hyperboloid. When we select the same module topologically as the spherical structure in Fig. 3a.6 for the cone and hyperboloid structures in Fig. 3 c, d, the modular origami structures produce the same spatial connection topology and the same reconfigurable mobility (see Supplementary Movie 4). Therefore, the reconfigurability is controlled by the spatial connection of the modules and not by the geometry of the template.

Mobility evaluation

We implement transformation by obtaining the independent dihedral angles, as demonstrated in Figs. 3 b–d and 4. Following the assumption of the rigid face and flexible hinges of prismatic modular origami, we identify the independent dihedral angles from a linearized constraint matrix. We apply additional kinematic constraints on every vertex: the distance between two vertices on an edge remains constant during reconfiguration (see Supplementary Fig. 8 in the SI for further details). While linearizing the constraints with a matrix form, we obtain, whereis the infinitesimal displacement of vertices. We can also obtain the infinitesimal displacement of all the dihedral angles as. In matrix form, the constraints can be expressed as

### Practical guide to choosing an appropriate data display [^63bd2040]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The primary objective of graphing research data is to communicate key information visually in a rapid, accurate, and concise way. Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy", "graphical excellence", and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^aa448439]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Non-quasi-equivalent and higher order rhomb tilings

Extending the CK convention to allow rhombs to represent more than two CPs, as long as their positions on the tile respect the symmetry of the tile, higher numbers of proteins are also conceivable geometrically. This could be achieved, for example, by combining two dimers. The protein stoichiometry for such capsids would be, and the first elements of the series would contain 120, 360 and 480 proteins. Picobirnavirus represents an example of the first element of this series (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This virus forms rhombus-like tiles made up of two protein dimers in parallel orientation, and contains 120 proteins in total. This structure has been traditionally described as a forbiddennumber in the CK framework, but it fits naturally into the new framework as a higher order rhomb tiling. The next elements of this series predict the existence of the forbidden numbers(360 proteins) and(480 proteins). Following this pattern, it is logical to think about the possibility of rhombus-like tiles representing three protein dimers, which would also satisfy the required twofold symmetry. The protein stoichiometry for these capsids would be, and the three smallest geometries of this type would contain 180, 540 and 720 proteins. An example of the first element of this series is Zika virus (Supplementary Fig. 3b) in the Flaviviridae family. In particular, each rhomb tile in its capsid represents six elongated proteins (three dimers in parallel respecting the twofold symmetry of the tile), so that the 30 tiles represent 180 proteins in total. In pioneering work in 2002, the Rossmann lab and collaborators realised that the three E monomers in each icosahedral asymmetric unit of Dengue virusdo not have quasiequivalent symmetric environments in the external, icosahedral scaffold formed from the 90 glycoprotein E dimers. Our approach based on the duals of the Archimedean lattices accommodates such non-quasiequivalent capsid structures.

Our framework thus extends the predictions of quasiequivalence theory by a more detailed understanding of capsid geometry, distinguishing between capsid architectures with different types of capsid protein organisation and interfaces given the same numbers of capsid proteins. This is important for a better understanding of the biophysical properties of viral capsids, such as their stability, and their roles in viral life cycles, e.g. during virion assembly and disassembly, and reveals geometric constraints on viral evolution.

Use in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, comparator trial of 404 subjects with mild-to-moderate COPD defined as FEV1greater than or equal to 35%, FEV1/FVC less than or equal to 70%, and a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and/or small airways disease. Subjects aged 36 to 76 years were randomized to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), 300 mg per day (n = 204) or placebo (n = 200) and treated for 12 weeks. Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), was initiated at 150 mg per day for 3 days while the subject was still smoking and increased to 150 mg twice daily for the remaining treatment period. Abstinence from smoking was determined by subject daily diaries and verified by carbon monoxide levels in expired air. Quitters were defined as subjects who were abstinent during the last 4 weeks of treatment. Table 7 shows quit rates in the COPD Trial.

Postmarketing Neuropsychiatric Safety Outcome Trial

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, active-and placebo-controlled trial that included subjects without a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, n = 3,912) and subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, n = 4003). Subjects aged 18 to 75 years, smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomized 1:1:1:1 to Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) 150 mg twice daily, varenicline 1 mg twice daily, nicotine replacement therapy patch (NRT) 21 mg per day with taper or placebo for a treatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride — methylphenidate hydrochloride — LA [^9d6b2852]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

The absolute oral bioavailability of methylphenidate in children was 22 ± 8% for d-methylphenidate and 5 ± 3% for l- methylphenidate. The relative bioavailability of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) given once daily is comparable to the same total dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart in both children and adults.

The initial rate of absorption for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) is similar to that of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets as shown by the similar rate parameters between the 2 formulations, i.e., initial lag time (Tlag), first peak concentration (Cmax1), and time to the first peak (Tmax1), which is reached in 1 to 3 hours. The mean time to the interpeak minimum (Tminip), and time to the second peak (Tmax2) are also similar for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) given once daily and methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart (see Figure 1 and Table 1), although the ranges observed are greater for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA).

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) given once daily exhibits a lower second peak concentration (Cmax2), higher interpeak minimum concentrations (Cminip), and less peak and trough fluctuations than methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses given 4 hours apart. This is due to an earlier onset and more prolonged absorption from the delayed-release beads (see Figure 1 and Table 4).

### Long-distance teleportation of qubits at telecommunication wavelengths [^8a815836]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Matter and energy cannot be teleported (that is, transferred from one place to another without passing through intermediate locations). However, teleportation of quantum states (the ultimate structure of objects) is possible: only the structure is teleported — the matter stays at the source side and must be already present at the final location. Several table-top experiments have used qubits (two-dimensional quantum systems) or continuous variables to demonstrate the principle over short distances. Here we report a long-distance experimental demonstration of probabilistic quantum teleportation. Qubits carried by photons of 1.3 micro m wavelength are teleported onto photons of 1.55 micro m wavelength from one laboratory to another, separated by 55 m but connected by 2 km of standard telecommunications fibre. The first (and, with foreseeable technologies, the only) application of quantum teleportation is in quantum communication, where it could help to extend quantum cryptography to larger distances.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^52f732dd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4 presents an example of reconfigurable structures assembled with varying geometry and topology of modules for a target DOF. Applying the geometric modification in Eqs. (3)–(6) and topological reconstruction in Eqs. (7)–(10) to 28 unit cells within a volumetric mapping size of 40, we obtain sphere reconfigurable structures for various target DOFs. Our algorithm provides multiple solutions, e.g. multiple combinations of geometry and topology for a target. For example, unit cell #1 with a mapping size ofand unit cell #22 with a mapping size ofprovide several topological options with varyingfor target mobility, as shown in Fig. 4.

We plot the DOFs with varying connecting topology while demonstrating various deformation modes, including uniaxial extension and volumetric shrinkage, as shown in Fig. 4 d, e (see the transformation in Supplementary Movie 5). The mobility can also be validated using a linear eigenmode analysis.

The same unit cell, e.g. a cubic unit cell, provides different reconfigurability depending on the variation of the topological connections, which is controlled by the mapping size. Small-sized polyhedrons with amapping can provide a vaster design space in mobility than large-sized polyhedrons with amapping because of the greater chance of available topology, as illustrated in Fig. 4. A unit cell consisting of two tetrahedrons and one octahedron with amapping produces a maximum of 40 connections, resulting in zero mobility, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Even releasing the connection only produces a narrow range of design space in mobility because of the extruded tubular shapes of the tetrahedron and octahedron being a triangular lattice prism with kinematic mobility of zero.

### Extended field-of-view imaging with table translation and frequency sweeping [^d84f5775]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A new method for MRI of an extended field of view (FOV) has been developed and validated. The method employs concurrent MR data acquisition and patient table motion. Table motion-induced image artifacts are minimized by sweeping the frequency of the receiver at a rate matching the table's speed. Multiple regional images are collected and combined to reconstruct the full FOV. The imaging parameters and table speed are chosen to ensure that each regional image of the subject is collected while the corresponding anatomy is in the useable imaging volume of the scanner. Additional strategies are applied to further reduce field inhomogeneity-induced artifacts, especially distortions due to gradient field nonlinearity. The method is robust and can be easily incorporated into most multislice 2D and volumetric 3D imaging pulse sequences. It is anticipated that this technique will be useful for a variety of applications, including angiographic runoffs, whole-body screening, and short-magnet imaging.

### Multicontrast sequences with continuous table motion: a novel acquisition technique for extended field of view imaging [^c261231c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A novel acquisition technique called multicontrast imaging is presented that provides multiple datasets of different image contrasts covering an extended field of view within one measurement procedure. The technique uses a continuously moving table and is based on the repetitive acquisition of axial volume sections while the patient moves through the scanner once. To compensate for the table motion during the measurement, adaptive slice shifting is applied. Multicontrast imaging is designed to combine the comfort of a moving table examination with the high time efficiency of a multitask protocol and can be used for generating differences in both contrast and spatial parameters of the acquired data. The technique and its properties are demonstrated on healthy human volunteers.

### Evaluating quality of glycemic control: graphical displays of hypo-and hyperglycemia, time in target range, and mean glucose [^3dfd4659]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

There is need for readily understandable graphical displays of glucose data to facilitate interpretation by clinicians and researchers. (1) Display of the percentage of glucose values above a specified threshold for hyperglycemia (%High) versus percentage of glucose values below a specified threshold for hypoglycemia (%Low). If all glucose values fell within the target range, then all data points would fall at the origin. (2) After an intervention, one can plot the change in percentage of glucose values above a specified threshold for hyperglycemia versus the change in percentage of glucose values below a specified threshold defining hypoglycemia: The quadrants of this graph correspond to (a) increased risk of both hyper- and hypoglycemia, (b) decreased hyperglycemia but increased risk of hypoglycemia, (c) decreases in both hypo- and hyperglycemia, and (d) decreased hypoglycemia but increased hyperglycemia. (3) A 2-dimensional triangular graph can be used for simultaneous display of %High, %Low, and percentage in target range. (4) Display of risk of hyper- versus risk of hypoglycemia based on both frequency and severity of departures from the target range can be used. (5) Graphs (1) and (4) can also be presented using percentile scores relative to a reference population. (6) It is also useful to analyze %Hypoglycemia or risk of hypoglycemia versus mean glucose. These methods are illustrated with examples from representative cases and shown to be feasible, practical, and informative. These new types of graphical displays can facilitate rapid analysis of risks of hypo- and hypoglycemia simultaneously and responses to therapeutic interventions for individuals or in clinical trials.

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^8e773aaf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation of optimized design

A simplified girder model may be derived by interpreting the main structural features of the optimized design. To facilitate meaningful comparisons to the conventional design, and to convince structural engineers about feasibility, we strive for a derived model at similar level of geometric and manufacturing complexity. Figure 1 shows the best interpreted design together with the conventional layout, and in the lower left-hand side of Fig. 3, the interpreted design is shown overlaid on the optimized design. For simplicity, only diaphragms built from solid plates are considered, however, the principles are equally valid for truss diaphragms. From the rendering of the interpreted design, it is seen that the number of diaphragms per section is increased from five to six, that four of the six diaphragms are curved towards the hangers, and that longitudinal panels to support the connection between hanger anchorage and diaphragms have been added. Although the changes appear limited, it is important to recognize that even these seemingly small topological modifications could not have been obtained by classical shape optimization without prior knowledge of the morphogenesis outcome. This confirms the need for the giga-scale resolution free-form design methodology. The interpreted model is subsequently imported and analyzed using a commercial finite element product, revealing a significant 12.7% weight saving compared to the conventional design — just based on a quick interpretation (see Methods for the analysis behind these predictions and Supplementary Table 1).

Parametric optimization

From a subsequent sizing optimization of the interpreted design, where the design variables are the thicknesses of the plates (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), the total weight saving reaches 28.4% (see "Methods" for details). In comparison, a weight saving of 13.8% was achieved in ref. where a similar, but more refined parametric sizing optimization was carried out on the conventional design. Owing to the detail and complexity of the parametric model in ref. the reported 13.8% change provides an upper bound for the conventional design. Hence, the application of the giga-scale morphogenesis procedure, followed by a quick interpretation and a simple parametric optimization, leads to weight savings significantly larger than what was possible by modifying the conventional design through simple parametric modifications.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — Bupropion hydrochloride — sr [^7ef7e18d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 5 presents quit rates over time in the multicenter trial by treatment group. The quit rates are the proportions of all subjects initially enrolled (i.e., intent–to-treat analysis) who abstained from Week 4 of the trial through the specified week. Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) (150 or 300 mg per day) was more effective than placebo in helping subjects achieve 4-week abstinence. In addition, treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) (7 weeks at 300 mg per day) was more effective than placebo in helping subjects maintain continuous abstinence through Week 26 (6 months) of the trial.

The second trial was a comparator trial conducted at 4 clinical centers. Four treatments were evaluated: bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) 300 mg per day, nicotine transdermal system (NTS) 21 mg per day, combination of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) 300 mg per day plus NTS 21 mg per day, and placebo. Subjects were treated for 9 weeks. Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) was initiated at 150 mg per day while the subject was still smoking and was increased after 3 days to 300 mg per day given as 150 mg twice daily. NTS 21 mg per day was added to treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR) after approximately 1 week when the subject reached the target quit date. During Weeks 8 and 9 of the trial, NTS was tapered to 14 and 7 mg per day, respectively. Quitting, defined as total abstinence during Weeks 4 through 7, was determined by subject daily diaries and verified by expired air carbon monoxide levels. In this trial, subjects treated with any of the 3 treatments achieved greater 4-week abstinence rates than subjects treated with placebo.

### Limits on fundamental limits to computation [^98c96d2d]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

An indispensable part of our personal and working lives, computing has also become essential to industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy. To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits. Engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet unknown limits.

### Whole-body physics simulation of fruit fly locomotion [^739d7272]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Reference walking data

We obtained single-camera top-down-view videos of several freely behaving Drosophila individuals with 2D key-point tracking(Extended Data Fig. 8a). In brief, groups of ten walking flies (w +; BPp65ADZp (attP40); BPZpGDBD (attP2), 20XUAS-GtACR1-EYFP (attP2); refs.) were recorded at 150 fps in a shallow, flat-bottomed, 50-mm-diameter arena. The 2D positions of 17 key points were predicted with the Animal Part Tracker (APT). From nine such videos, we prepared the walking reference dataset. We used 13 of the 17 key points: 3 on the head, 3 on the thorax, one at the tip of abdomen and the 6 leg tips, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 8. We selected female flies and isolated walking trajectory segments based on the following criteria. At each frame, we required: (i) the distance to the other flies in the arena is larger than one body length; and (ii) the velocity component parallel to the fly body is larger than perpendicular to the body. Then we required (iii) a snippet duration of at least 20 frames (133 ms; roughly corresponds to one fly step); and (iv) a ratio of mean leg-tip speed to mean CoM speed smaller than 1.5. This produced a set of trajectory snippets with flies walking at different speeds, turning and standing still. The average walking speeds per snippet are distributed approximately in the range [0, 4] cm s −1 (Fig. 3e, inset). We then linearly interpolated the walking snippets from 6.7-ms time steps to the walking simulation control of 2-ms time steps.

### Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging guidelines: instrumentation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation [^b4e6d0b4]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging center-of-rotation (COR) calibration — All systems should be checked for correct COR calibration, and if no specific protocol is recommended the COR can be determined by a point source of activity (18 to 37 MBq) on the patient table 10 to 20 cm from the axis of rotation with SPECT data acquired over 360º using patient study parameters; five to ten seconds per frame for 64 views over 360º is sufficient. Center-of-rotation correction values are computed, stored, and used to realign projection data, and the COR is measured as the average position of the point source in two projections acquired 180º apart. It is essential that COR errors be checked for each collimator that is to be used clinically, it is recommended that these measurements be repeated weekly, and new COR calibrations should be performed after changes of the camera, after power surges or outages, and following service of any type with verification that a tomographic point source produces a transaxial point image.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### Synthesis and assembly of extended quintulene [^2901484c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Quintulene, a non-graphitic cycloarene with fivefold symmetry, has remained synthetically elusive due to its high molecular strain originating from its curved structure. Here we report the construction of extended quintulene, which was unambiguously characterized by mass and NMR spectroscopy. The extended quintulene represents a naturally curved nanocarbon based on its conical molecular geometry. It undergoes dimerization in solution via π-π stacking to form a metastable, but isolable bilayer complex. Thermodynamic and kinetic characterization reveals the dimerization process as entropy-driven and following second-order kinetics with a high activation energy. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the assembly of conical nanocarbons. Comparison of optical properties of monomer and dimer points toward a H-type interlayer coupling in the dimer.

### Tacrolimus extended-release capsules (tacrolimus) [^d3133112]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The average recorded starting tacrolimus daily dose, given any time up to day 2 post-transplant, was higher for tacrolimus extended-release capsules than for control (0.14 mg per kg per day versus 0.1 mg per kg per day). Thereafter, to achieve comparable mean tacrolimus trough concentrations, on average 15% higher total mean daily doses of tacrolimus were required for tacrolimus extended-release capsules than for control.

Tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations were monitored on Day 3, Day 7, Day 10, Day 14, and Day 21, then Month 1, Month 2, Month 4, Month 6, Month 8, Month 10, and Month 12. Table 10 shows the tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations measured at protocol-specified time points for tacrolimus extended-release capsules. Approximately 80% of tacrolimus extended-release capsules-treated patients maintained tacrolimus whole trough blood concentrations between 5 ng/mL to 17 ng/mL during Month 1 through Month 2 and between 4 ng/mL to 12 ng/mL from Month 3 through Month 12.

African-American patients required higher tacrolimus extended-release capsules dosages to attain similar trough concentrations as Caucasian patients (see Table 11).

MMF

The initial dose of MMF was 1 gram administered orally or intravenously prior to or within 48 hours of completion of the transplant procedure. Subsequent MMF was administered orally 1 gram twice daily or up to 1.5 grams twice daily in African-American patients. Dose-equivalent three times daily or four times daily dosing was permitted if MMF tolerability was a concern.

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.

### Standardized medical terminology for cardiac computed tomography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^a323313f]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) acquisition terminology — Table 2 (continued) — standardizes key parameters and labels legacy synonyms as not recommended. Widened data acquisition window is defined as acquisition of additional axial CT data beyond the minimum needed for reconstruction to allow reconstruction of series using different phases, and previous terms and abbreviations (not recommended) include Padding, phase tolerance. Acquisition field of view is the diameter or width of the region within the scan plane exposed to x‑rays, expressed in units of mm (noting some units display mm or cm). Scan length is the distance between start and end of data acquisition along the z‑axis (direction of patient movement) for a single scan, expressed in mm. Scan time is the total time required to acquire raw data used to reconstruct all images over the entire scan length; in axial scan mode this includes the time required to increment the table between successive x‑ray exposures.

### Principles of use of biostatistics in research [^43bf6d74]. NeoReviews (2014). Low credibility.

Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data are essential components of biomedical research and require biostatistics. Doing various statistical tests has been made easy by sophisticated computer software. It is important for the investigator and the interpreting clinician to understand the basics of biostatistics for two reasons. The first is to choose the right statistical test for the computer to perform based on the nature of data derived from one's own research. The second is to understand if an analysis was performed appropriately during review and interpretation of others' research. This article reviews the choice of an appropriate parametric or nonparametric statistical test based on type of variable and distribution of data. Evaluation of diagnostic tests is covered with illustrations and tables.

### Successful kinetic impact into an asteroid for planetary defence [^279e2f1e]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

We combined our estimated velocity and the SPC-derived spacecraft positions of the last five images to determine the impact location. Only the last five images were used to locate the impact because heater cycling on the spacecraft introduced cyclic error rates in the inertial attitude knowledge. These rates were estimated to be small at the time of impact owing to the timing of impact relative to heater cycling but at their highest approximately 30 s before impact. Using only the last few images reduced the influence of this known (and cumulative) error source. At each of these five spacecraft positions, we propagated the velocity vector until it intersected with the surface of the Dimorphos shape model. We took the mean of these positions as the impact location. We also computed the spacecraft state at a few different heights above the intersection point to determine the order in which the solar arrays and bus contacted the surface. The propagation from each of the last five images provided the same impact point to within 1 cm. The uncertainties in the impact point location (reported in Table 1) are dominated by the residuals to the fits of the spacecraft position obtained by SPC in the Y and Z directions (Extended Data Fig. 10).

### A biophysical account of multiplication by a single neuron [^874dd274]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Multi-compartment model

We built a passive compartmental model of a T4 neuron (Extended Data Fig. 4c, d) in Python v.3.7 to account for possible space-clamp problems due to neuronal morphology in voltage-clamp experiments and to assess signal propagation between dendrite and soma (Extended Data Fig. 4e, f). The model was based on an electron microscopic reconstruction and comprised 2,012 compartments. A connectivity matrix, which held values of 1 where two compartments were connected and values of 0 otherwise, was used as a template to calculate a conductance matrix M. The latter was based on the three-dimensional coordinates and the length as well as the diameter of each compartment assuming, unless stated otherwise, an axial resistivity (R a) of 150 Ω cm, a membrane resistance (R m) of 28 kΩ cm 2, and a specific membrane capacitance (C m) of 1 µF cm −2. All parameters were on the same scale as those commonly used to model Drosophila neuronsand were considered to be uniform across the entire cell. Varying R a and R m over a biophysically plausible range had negligible effects on model output (Extended Data Fig. 4f, g).

The voltage vector V m (t) indicating the membrane potential of each compartment and at each time point t was determined by using the sparse.linalg.spsolve function of the SciPy v.1.3 module to iteratively solve the matrix equation M × V m (t) = V m (t − 1) × c m /Δ t + E leak × g leak + I (t), where V m (t − 1) denotes the voltage vector at the previous time point, c m is the vector holding the specific capacitances of all compartments, Δ t denotes the time step, E leak denotes the leak reversal potential, g leak denotes the vector holding the specific transmembrane leak conductances of all compartments and I (t) is the vector indicating the current injected at time point t into each compartment. Simulations were performed with a fixed Δ t of 0.1 ms. If only steady-state was considered, the diagonal of the conductance matrix M held no capacitive conductances and the right side of the equation simplified to E leak × g leak + I (t). At the time of transmitter application, synaptic conductances were added both to the diagonal of the conductance matrix and, multiplied by the reversal potential of the current, to the right side of the equation.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^ebad60f3]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

In the sustained WM trial (STEP 4, NCT03548987), 902 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. Those completing a 20‐week run‐in period are being randomly assigned in a 2:1 manner to receive continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for an additional 48 weeks to assess WL (Figure 4, Table 1). Approximately 750 eligible participants will be randomly assigned. In addition, it has a withdrawal trial design to assess the change in weight after switching from semaglutide to placebo.

This is a 68‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐armed, multicenter, multinational withdrawal clinical trial, with 7 weeks of follow‐up without treatment for safety assessments, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) with placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, in people with obesity or overweight. *During the 20‐week run‐in period, participants start a dose escalation (visit 2 [week 0]) with semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity for 20 weeks. The run‐in period includes 4 weeks at the target dose (semaglutide subcutaneously, 2.4 mg once weekly).

In the long‐term WM trial (STEP 5, NCT03693430), 304 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo to assess WL (Figure 5, Table 1) over a 2‐year period.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^d6d8fcbc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirometry reporting specifies that numerical values are given for the FEV1, the FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio; the latter should be reported as a decimal fraction and the space for percent predicted value left blank, and if bronchodilators are given the LLN column need not be repeated with absolute and percent change given only for FEV1 and FVC. Other numerical values such as the forced inspiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75%) and FEF25–75% are not recommended for routine use. Graph requirements include that for the volume–time curve the volume scale should be at least 10 mm/L, the time scale at least 20 mm/s, and 1 second prior to the start of expiration should be displayed; on the flow–volume plot the flow display should be at least 5 l/min/L/s, and the ratio of flow to volume should be 2 L/s to 1 L, and linear and log scales where values are plotted as z-scores relative to the predicted value (z = 0) give an intuitive sense of severity.

### Levetiracetam (Elepsia xr 1, 000 mg) [^a2096f25]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.3 Immediate-Release Levetiracetam in Pediatric Patients 4 Years to 16 Years

The use of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is supported by Study 5, which was conducted using immediate-release levetiracetam. ELEPSIA XR is not indicated in pediatric patients below 12 years of age.

Study 5

The effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients was established in a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted at 60 sites in North America, in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (Study 5). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who still experienced at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either immediate-release levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 198 patients (levetiracetam N = 101; placebo N = 97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalization. Study 5 consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, the immediate-release levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 5 was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week). Table 9 displays the results of this study.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) in Study 5 is presented in Figure 4.
