## Question

How does bigeminy differ from trigeminy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how bigeminy differs from trigeminy, with clear definitions, ECG patterns, clinical significance, and implications for evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and the underlying ectopic mechanism. Then, I should verify the ECG pattern characteristics and how to distinguish them visually. Next, I will consider clinical significance, including hemodynamic effects and when to escalate evaluation. After that, I need to check precipitating factors and etiologies that commonly produce these patterns. Finally, I will review diagnostic confirmation, risk stratification, and management principles, making sure I tie each step to guideline-level sources and contemporary data.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't gloss over anything important. Bigeminy is a repeating pattern of one normal beat followed by one premature beat, whereas trigeminy is a repeating pattern of two normal beats followed by one premature beat; both are forms of ventricular ectopy that can be frequent enough to meet clinically meaningful thresholds when sustained, and they are explicitly recognized in imaging appropriateness criteria and contemporary arrhythmia guidelines as patterns of frequent ventricular premature contractions, which helps anchor their clinical relevance and coding in reports and algorithms [^116K6hu5] [^111dNxmX].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG pattern details so I don't overstate the cadence. In bigeminy, the coupling interval and morphology of the premature beat are typically consistent within a run, producing a regularly irregular rhythm with alternating normal and premature complexes; in trigeminy, the premature beat follows two normal beats, again with relatively fixed coupling and morphology when the pattern is sustained, which makes the rhythm appear as grouped triplets with the third beat premature; these patterns are also explicitly enumerated in machine-learning arrhythmia taxonomies and validated ECG interpretation platforms, reinforcing their morphological distinctness and detectability on single-lead and multi-lead recordings [^115nExAh] [^115EpnZP] [^1139zC9w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact without checking guideline statements. Patients with bigeminy or trigeminy can present with effective bradycardia, a pulse deficit, and relative hypertension with wide pulse pressure, and frequent PVCs in these patterns can lead to inaccurate heart rate estimation; this matters because the effective cardiac output may be reduced even when the nominal heart rate seems acceptable, and the physical examination may reveal irregular, forceful ectopic beats with compensatory pauses, which should prompt a careful search for structural or electrical heart disease and a medication review for proarrhythmic contributors [^112Xc1vW].

> I need to ensure I consider precipitating factors and etiologies that commonly generate these patterns. Digoxin toxicity classically produces unifocal or multiform ventricular ectopy, especially bigeminy or trigeminy, and this remains a high-yield historical and laboratory check when these patterns are observed; catecholaminergic stress and channelopathies such as CPVT can also manifest bigeminy or trigeminy during exercise or epinephrine challenge, and sleep-disordered breathing is associated with increased odds of complex ventricular ectopy including bigeminy and trigeminy, so I should confirm medication exposures, consider provocative testing when appropriate, and screen for OSA in at-risk patients [^116bwSqH] [^115ACyRb] [^1153CK6f] [^116aqfqM] [^113icLzd].

> Next, I should review how to confirm and quantify these patterns in practice. Ambulatory ECG monitoring with Holter or extended patch systems allows accurate quantification of PVC burden and documentation of bigeminy or trigeminy episodes; contemporary algorithms and platforms achieve high F1 performance for detecting ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy, which supports automated detection and physician review workflows, and in selected cases, fetal magnetocardiography can characterize complex atrial or ventricular ectopy patterns in utero, including bigeminy and trigeminy, informing prenatal management decisions [^115EpnZP] [^1139zC9w] [^112xiq16].

> I will now examine the clinical implications and thresholds that should trigger further workup. Frequent ventricular ectopy, including patterns of bigeminy or trigeminy, meets criteria for "frequent" when it exceeds about 30 per hour or is sustained in these patterned forms, which should prompt evaluation for underlying structural heart disease and consideration of multimodality imaging when indicated; in addition, bigeminy and trigeminy can degrade hemodynamics and LV function estimates, and advanced imaging such as self-gated MRI can help quantify beat-to-beat volume differences and the differential impact of ectopic versus sinus beats on stroke volume and ejection fraction, which is useful when echo windows are limited or when beat morphology varies substantially [^116K6hu5] [^111dNxmX] [^111csF14] [^1152vDWk].

> But wait, what if the ectopy burden is very high or refractory to conservative measures; I should double-check ablation considerations. When frequent PVCs in bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy patterns persist and are symptomatic or associated with ventricular dysfunction, electrophysiology mapping and ablation are reasonable, and contemporary mapping studies emphasize that the first rapid bipolar deflection, rather than unipolar −dV/dtmax, better tracks the successful ablation site for endocardial versus intramural origins, which can improve procedural success for outflow tract ectopy that often presents in these patterned forms [^113P9wpy] [^113vjczg].

> Let me reconsider the practical bedside approach so I don't miss simple, reversible drivers. I should confirm the rhythm on a 12-lead ECG when feasible, review all medications for digoxin, QT-prolonging agents, and stimulants, check electrolytes and renal function, screen for sleep apnea if symptoms or risk factors are present, and stratify further testing based on symptoms, PVC burden, and suspicion of structural disease; if bigeminy or trigeminy is frequent or symptomatic, echocardiography is appropriate, and if ventricular function is impaired or the burden is very high, advanced imaging or EP referral can be justified to guide therapy and risk mitigation [^112Xc1vW] [^116K6hu5] [^111dNxmX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the distinction is crystal clear: bigeminy is an alternating normal–ectopic couplet pattern, whereas trigeminy is a normal–normal–ectopic triplet pattern; both represent organized forms of frequent ventricular ectopy that can impair hemodynamics, signal underlying heart disease or toxic/metabolic triggers, and warrant structured evaluation and, when indicated, therapy including medication optimization, treatment of precipitating factors, and catheter ablation for selected cases [^112Xc1vW] [^116K6hu5] [^113P9wpy].

---

Bigeminy and trigeminy are both **ectopic rhythms** characterized by premature beats following normal beats in a repeating pattern [^116K6hu5]. The key difference is the **beat ratio**: bigeminy has a 1:1 pattern (one normal beat, one premature beat), whereas trigeminy has a 2:1 pattern (two normal beats, one premature beat) [^notfound]. Both can cause palpitations, dizziness, or syncope, and are often benign but may indicate underlying heart disease or electrolyte disturbances [^notfound]. Evaluation includes ECG, Holter monitoring, and echocardiography; management focuses on treating underlying causes, correcting electrolytes, and using beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics if symptomatic or frequent [^notfound].

## Definitions and electrocardiographic characteristics

### Bigeminy

- **Definition**: Bigeminy is an ectopic rhythm in which every normal beat is followed by a premature beat, creating a repeating pattern of one normal beat followed by one premature beat (1:1 ratio) [^notfound].
- **Electrocardiographic characteristics**: On ECG, bigeminy appears as alternating normal and premature beats, typically premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or premature atrial contractions (PACs). The premature beats have different morphologies and coupling intervals compared to normal beats [^notfound].

---

### Trigeminy

- **Definition**: Trigeminy is an ectopic rhythm in which two normal beats are followed by one premature beat, repeating in a 2:1 ratio [^notfound].
- **Electrocardiographic characteristics**: On ECG, trigeminy appears as two normal beats followed by a premature beat, repeating in a cyclical pattern. Like bigeminy, the premature beats in trigeminy can be PVCs or PACs [^111PDfFn] [^111ivimK].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Both bigeminy and trigeminy can be **asymptomatic** or cause symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, or syncope [^112Xc1vW]. Their clinical significance depends on the underlying cause, frequency, and presence of structural heart disease [^notfound].

---

## Causes and risk factors

Bigeminy and trigeminy share similar causes and risk factors, including:

- **Structural heart disease**: Coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart defects [^112Xc1vW].
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Digoxin toxicity, antiarrhythmic drugs, and stimulants [^115ACyRb].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and stress [^notfound].
- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with increased risk of complex ventricular ectopy, including bigeminy and trigeminy [^116aqfqM] [^113icLzd].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic evaluation for bigeminy and trigeminy includes:

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To identify the rhythm pattern and differentiate between PVCs and PACs [^113ZwPtW].
- **Holter monitoring**: To quantify the frequency and burden of premature beats over 24–48 hours [^113vjczg].
- **Echocardiography**: To assess for structural heart disease or ventricular dysfunction [^111dNxmX].
- **Electrolyte testing**: To identify and correct electrolyte imbalances [^116bwSqH].

---

## Management strategies

Management of bigeminy and trigeminy focuses on addressing underlying causes, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and reducing the frequency of premature beats. Medical management includes **beta-blockers** or other antiarrhythmic medications to reduce premature beats and control symptoms [^notfound]; catheter ablation may be considered for frequent, symptomatic ectopy — particularly if associated with structural heart disease or ventricular dysfunction [^113P9wpy]. Lifestyle modifications — such as reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, smoking cessation, stress management, and weight loss — are also recommended [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of bigeminy and trigeminy depends on the underlying cause, frequency of premature beats, and presence of structural heart disease. Benign ectopy without structural heart disease generally has a **favorable prognosis**, whereas frequent ectopy associated with structural heart disease may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy [^1136SrsE].

---

Bigeminy and trigeminy are ectopic rhythms differing in their beat ratios: bigeminy has a 1:1 pattern, and trigeminy a 2:1 pattern. Both can be benign or indicate underlying disease; **evaluation and management** should be tailored to symptoms, frequency, and cardiac status [^112Xc1vW].

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) emphasizes that symptoms, particularly in patients with known or discovered structural or electrical heart disease, should prompt focused investigation; identifying precipitating factors and family history is important; and medication review is essential because drugs can provoke arrhythmias. The text states that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and some medications can induce a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF. Patients with bigeminy or trigeminy can present with effective bradycardia, an apical‑radial pulse deficit, and relative hypertension with a wide pulse pressure, and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to inaccurate estimation of heart rate. Physical findings that suggest structural heart disease include carotid bruits or diminished peripheral pulses (atherosclerotic disease associated with ischemic heart disease); jugular venous distention, rales, gallops, and peripheral edema (evidence of HF); cardiac murmurs such as those of aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (associated with HF and VA); and a midsystolic click indicating mitral valve prolapse that can be associated with VA. Many VA are asymptomatic and detected only on an ECG or telemetry, underscoring the need to search for evidence of underlying heart disease.

Appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging in nonvalvular heart disease — definitions of key clinical terms include pretest probability thresholds and arrhythmia criteria. Low pretest probability indicates < 10% probability of disease, moderate is 10% to 90%, and high is > 90% likelihood prior to testing. Ventricular premature contractions are occurring more frequently than 30 times per hour or occurring in a pattern of bigeminy, trigeminy, or runs of ventricular tachycardia, while atrial premature complexes are less than 30 times per hour or less than one per minute. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is a ventricular arrhythmia of 3 or more consecutive complexes but lasting < 30 seconds in duration at a rate > 100 bpm, and sustained ventricular tachycardia is lasting more than 30 seconds or requiring therapy because of hemodynamic compromise in < 30 seconds. Syncope is transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery (not lightheadedness or dizziness alone), presyncope is near loss of consciousness, and a patient is asymptomatic when he/she exhibits none of the typical symptoms. Heart failure is signs and symptoms explainable on the basis of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and the term clinical indication does not necessarily imply that testing is warranted; for some clinical indications, all modalities may be rated as Rarely Appropriate.

### Fetal atrial flutter: electrophysiology and associations with rhythms involving an accessory pathway [^113Y8nir]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The most common form of atrial ectopy was blocked atrial trigeminy due to reentrant PACs. This was present in 6 of 16 (38%) fetuses, including 4 of 5 with AFl and AVRT, 1 of 8 with AFl alone, and 1 of 3 that did not show AFl during fMCG. One fetus with blocked atrial trigeminy (#10) also had blocked atrial bigeminy, which resulted in bradycardia. Three fetuses with blocked atrial trigeminy (#9, 10, and 14) showed blocked atrial couplets, which are relatively rare but have been seen previously in fetuses with blocked atrial bi/trigeminy. 9 One subject (#14) with blocked atrial trigeminy also showed atrial bigeminy due to conducted PACs with a relatively long, variable coupling interval.

### How to use bipolar and unipolar electrograms for selecting successful ablation sites of ventricular premature contractions [^113P9wpy]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Local activation time is often determined by the maximal negative of the extracellular unipolar potential (-dV/dT max). While this is accurate in 2-dimensional uniform tissue, propagation through nonuniform or 3-dimensional structures have shown discordance between -dV/dT max and local activation time.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between bipolar and unipolar electrograms for selecting successful ablation sites of endocardial (superficial) vs intramural (deep) ventricular premature contractions (VPCs).

Methods

This cohort consisted of 66 patients with VPCs presenting for ablation in a bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy pattern. VPCs were classified as endocardial if ablation at the earliest endocardial site resulted in immediate suppression (< 10 seconds) or as intramural if ablation resulted in delayed suppression (≥ 10 seconds), required multiple applications, or was not achieved. Unipolar and bipolar electrograms were analyzed.

Results

In endocardial VPCs, the first rapid bipolar deflection corresponded with unipolar -dV/dT max, occurring 20.5 ms (17.8–26.0 ms) and 16.0 ms (6.8–22.0 ms), respectively, before the QRS onset. In successfully ablated intramural VPCs, the first rapid bipolar deflection preceded the QRS onset by 14.0 ms (11.2–22.6 ms) and coincided with the first rapid unipolar deflection, although -dV/dT max occurred 10.5 ms (0.0–20.8 ms) after the QRS onset and often coincided with far-field activity. In unsuccessfully ablated intramural VPCs, the first rapid bipolar deflection to QRS onset interval was shorter in comparison to successfully ablated intramural VPCs (1.5 ms vs 14.0 ms; P < .001) while the unipolar -dV/dT max to QRS onset interval was similar (P = 0.095).

Conclusion

Mapping of VPCs should be guided by the first rapid bipolar deflection that corresponds to a similarly early unipolar deflection but not with -dV/dT max.

BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Seven-day ECG monitoring

For the 7-day ECG monitoring, a RootiRx (Rooti Labs, Taipei, Taiwan) will be used. RootiRx is an ECG patch monitoring device consisting of an integrated sensor system, a microelectronic board with memory storage and an internal rechargeable battery. RootiRx allows for continuous ECG monitoring for up to 7 days in 250 Hz frequencies with 24-bit high resolution. Recorded data is analysed by Rooti Labs developed algorithms and creates a report which is reviewed and edited by physicians and finally sent back to the referring physician. The final report includes the number of recording days, the amount of recorded beats, the average heart rate (overall, day and night), the maximum and minimum heart rate, the amount of cardiac pauses defined as an interruption in the ventricular rate > 2 s. AF burden is reported as an amount of AF events, time in AF and percentage time in AF. Reported atrial events include atrial ectopic beats and supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular events include ventricular ectopic beats, doublets, triplets, bigeminy, trigeminy and ventricular tachycardia. The performance of RootiRx has been validated against standard 24-hour Holter monitoring in healthy individuals and patients with arrhythmias.

Endpoints

The Master@Heart study's primary endpoint is the difference in the prevalence of mixed plaques in lifelong endurance athletes, late-onset endurance athletes and non-athletic controls. The main secondary endpoints are (1) prevalence of AF on 12-lead ECG, a 24-hour Holter monitoring or a 7-day ECG-monitoring, (2) the presence and quantification of MF as assessed by LGE imaging (% of LV mass) and T1-mapping (% of ECV) and (3) total CAC scores and the presence of > 50% stenosis in proximal coronary segments. Tertiary endpoints include: (1) prevalence of ventricular ectopic beats, non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia, a 24-hour Holter monitoring or a 7-day ECG monitoring; (2) LV and RV systolic function at rest and during exercise; (3) LV diastolic function by two-dimensional echocardiography including speckle tracking imaging; (4) bi-atrial function by two-dimensional echocardiography including speckle tracking imaging; (5) filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures during exercise assessed by exercise echocardiography; (6) arterial stiffness by Sphygmocor; and (7) carotid intima media thickness as assessed by carotid artery ultrasound.

### Quantification of left ventricular function with premature ventricular complexes reveals variable hemodynamics [^1152vDWk]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are prevalent in the general population and are sometimes associated with reduced ventricular function. Current echocardiographic and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging techniques do not adequately address the effect of PVCs on left ventricular function.

Methods and Results

Fifteen subjects with a history of frequent PVCs undergoing cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging had real-time slice volume quantification performed using a 2-dimensional (2D) real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging technique. Synchronization of 2D real-time imaging with patient ECG allowed for different beats to be categorized by the loading beat RR duration and beat RR duration. For each beat type, global volumes were quantified via summation over all slices covering the entire ventricle. Different patterns of ectopy, including isolated PVCs, bigeminy, trigeminy, and interpolated PVCs, were observed. Global functional measurement of the different beat types based on timing demonstrated differences in preload, stroke volume, and ejection fraction. An average of hemodynamic function was quantified for each subject depending on the frequency of each observed beat type.

Conclusions

Application of real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in patients with PVCs revealed differential contribution of PVCs to hemodynamics.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^1139zC9w]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior algorithm development

The ECG interpretation algorithm is a hybrid machine learning model developed separately from and prior to the present study using a different patient cohort. It was originally trained on approximately 3 700 000 annotated single-lead ECGs of US adult patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) monitored at home between 2015 and 2018 (RhythmAnalytics, Biofourmis). The data were captured via Holter monitor at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Without manual preprocessing, the model was trained to autonomously identify AFIB, pause, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular trigeminy and normal sinus rhythm (figure 2). The distribution of arrhythmias in the training set and the model's performance against the training data set are shown in online supplemental tables S1 and S2.

Figure 2
Example ECGs demonstrating arrhythmias. (A) Atrial fibrillation. (B) Sinus bradycardia. (C) Normal sinus rhythm. (D) Pause. (E) Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. (F) Sinus tachycardia. (G) Ventricular bigeminy. (H) Ventricular trigeminy.

The hybrid machine learning model receives input from the unfiltered signal obtained from the single-lead ECG (online supplemental figure S1 and table S3). This signal passes through a 0.5–40 Hz band pass filterand amplitude ratio thresholding to detect and remove artefacts. This is then further filteredto remove contributions from baseline wandering, power line interference, electromyographic (EMG) and motion artefact interference. This filtration is all used to reduce the noise in the ECG signal. The filtered signal is passed to modules that output the peak of the p, q, r, s and t as well as the morphological features for each beat.

3 Results

3.1 Patient Characteristics

A total of 569 patients underwent VPC ablation at our institution between May 2018 and April 2022, of which 476 cases utilized the CARTO 3 mapping system. The following inclusion criteria were applied for enrollment: (1) patients with OT‐VPCs that were endocardially ablated; (2) frequent VPCs in bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy patterns to allow proper assessment of ablation response; (3) sufficient mapping point density; and (4) adequate electrogram quality for reliable analysis. These criteria narrowed the study population to 79 patients with successfully ablated and well‐mapped OT‐VPCs. The baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1. The mean VPC burden, measured by a 24‐h Holter monitor before the procedure, was 26.2 ± 10.1%. VPCs originated from the RVOT in 35 patients (44%) — with 10 from the RVOT free wall and 25 from the RVOT septum — and from the left ventricular OT (LVOT) in 44 patients (56%) — with 25 from the ASC and 19 from the AMC. In all cases, a contact force‐sensing ablation catheter was used, with a mean contact force of 13 g (IQR: 9.5–17.0 g) during radiofrequency ablation. Seven cases (9%) needed ablation from both RVOT and LVOT. As long‐term follow‐up data, the mean VPC burden examined around 1 year after the procedure was decreased to 1.0% [IQR: 0.5–1.9].

Table 1
Patient characteristics (n = 79).

3.2 VPCs Originating From Non‐ASC

Figure 2 illustrates a VPC originating from the RVOT free wall, highlighting the timing and spatial relationship between the bipolar and unipolar potential‐based mappings. In this case, the EASs in both the unipolar and bipolar maps were identical, resulting in a distance of "0 mm" between the two EASs. In contrast, Figure 3 depicts a VPC originating from the RVOT septum. Here, the unipolar −dV/dTmax preceded the QRS onset by 14 ms at the EAS in the unipolar‐based map, while the first rapid bipolar deflection occurred 20 ms before the QRS onset at the EAS in the bipolar‐based map. The spatial distance between the EASs on the two maps was measured at 4.5 mm.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^114uEY6f]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Following this processing, a hybrid approach is adopted by combining traditional ECG feature engineering and a deep neural network (DNN). Established ECG techniques such as r-peak detection, p-wave detection, t-wave offset detection, wavelet transformand sample of entropyare used as inputs to the arrhythmia modules. In addition, the DNN which was trained directly from the ECG signal is used to output morphological features and independent peak detection features. These morphological features and peak detection features are then passed to each of the eight classifiers, allowing for the detection of multiple arrhythmias per strip. This architecture allows a combination of techniques to be used in different independent arrhythmia modules. For example, the arrhythmia module that classifies sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia receives input from r-peak detection and ignores morphological features from the DNN. In contrast, the arrhythmia module that detects ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular bigeminy, ventricular trigeminy and PVC) uses mainly morphological features and peak detection features from the DNN. Lastly, the arrhythmia module that detects atrial arrhythmias (AFIB and PSVT) uses both morphological features from the DNN and other established ECG features such as p-wave detection and sample of entropy.

The model was not tuned or adapted for this validation study. The only differences in inputs between the training set and this study's external validation set came from hardware differences (eg, sampling rate) and the patient population.

### Digoxin (digox) [^1112c4N1]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Adults: Cardiac: Therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause heart block in patients with pre-existing sinoatrial or AV conduction disorders; heart block can be avoided by adjusting the dose of digoxin. Prophylactic use of a cardiac pacemaker may be considered if the risk of heart block is considered unacceptable. High doses of digoxin may produce a variety of rhythm disturbances, such as first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation. Digoxin produces PR prolongation and ST segment depression which should not by themselves be considered digoxin toxicity. Cardiac toxicity can also occur at therapeutic doses in patients who have conditions which may alter their sensitivity to digoxin (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Gastrointestinal: Digoxin may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Rarely, the use of digoxin has been associated with abdominal pain, intestinal ischemia, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestines.

CNS: Digoxin can produce visual disturbances (blurred or yellow vision), headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and mental disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, delirium, and hallucination).

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^1153CK6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CPVT should be considered in patients with a structurally normal heart and a normal resting ECG, presenting with dizziness, palpitations, fainting, seizure‐like episodes, or family history of juvenile sudden cardiac death during physical/emotional stress. During acute episodes, ECG presentations may exhibit 2 distinct types of polymorphic VT. The first type is the typical polymorphic VT with characteristic changing QRS morphology. The other subtype is bidirectional tachycardia characterized by 180‐degree rotation of the QRS complex between one beat and the other. It is important to distinguish normal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from those seen in patients with CPVT. The PVCs in CPVT are typically late coupled and can exhibit a right bundle branch block pattern with a superior axis or a left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. During exercise, the PVCs in patients with CPVT can be distinguished from normal heathy controls due to a variety of characteristics. These include a bigger number of PVCs that start appearing at high cardiac workload, left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis, bigeminy or trigeminy at peak stress, QRS > 120 milliseconds, coupling interval > 400 ms, or disappearance in the first minute of rest. Of those characteristics, the most sensitive and specific one is the left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. This pattern suggests the presence of an RV outflow tract as an ectopic initiation site.

The primary diagnostic tool for CPVT is an exercise stress test. The test is done in a closely monitored environment and followed using a standard Bruce protocol. As the duration and intensity of the test increases, the beats can transition into a bigeminal or trigeminal pattern and may become a ventricular arrhythmia. A negative exercise stress test cannot rule out CPVT as it provokes a VT in around two thirds of patients only. In such cases, a novel "burst" exercise protocol may be used. The hypothesis is that short intense bursts of exercise cause an abrupt surge in heart rate, predisposing to higher risks of calcium dysregulation and arrhythmogenesis. In patients who cannot undergo exercise stress testing, a pharmacological stress test by epinephrine infusion is used. CPVT is diagnosed when the infusion triggers a polymorphic VT with > 10 PVCs per minute or the presence of new T‐wave alternations.

### Ankyrin-B Q1283H variant linked to arrhythmias via loss of local protein phosphatase 2A activity causes ryanodine receptor hyperphosphorylation [^11658uLt]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Telemetry monitoring of the cardiac rhythm in conscious animals revealed no differences in the electrocardiographic parameters between the 2 genotypes under sedentary conditions (Figure 3 A and 3 B and). Because both humans with ANK2 variants and AnkB +/− mice develop exercise- and catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, the KI mice were subjected to a catecholamine stress protocol (an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg epinephrine). Over a 60-minute continuous recording, KI mice were more susceptible to developing a sinus pause and multiple ventricular arrhythmic patterns, including premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy/trigeminy, and nonsustained or sustained VT episodes (Figure 3 C through 3 G). Specifically, 7 of the 10 KI mice had an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, whereas only 1 of the 10 WT mice showed an arrhythmia phenotype (70% in KI versus 10% in WT; P < 0.05) (Figure 3 H). No WT mice presented a VT phenotype, but 50% of the KI mice did present a VT phenotype (50% in KI versus 0% in WT; P < 0.05). None of the VT rhythms deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation or death during the epinephrine challenge. In addition, compared with controls, the KI mice showed a remarkable increase in the arrhythmia score (P < 0.01) (Figure 3 I).

### Contemporary concepts of migraine pathogenesis [^111LHxWY]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of migraine is incompletely understood. Recent discoveries have shed light on the neuronal events mediating both the aura and the headache phases of migraine, identifying a cerebral cortical origin of migraine aura, susceptibility to attacks based on cortical hyperexcitability, and headache originating in the trigeminovascular system and its central projections. Abnormal modulation of brain nociceptive systems, at first transient but becoming permanent with continuing illness and, predisposing to central sensitization, may explain the prolonged headache of the migraine attack and the shift of the migraine phenotype from episodic to chronic headache. Migraine attacks might also originate in abnormal nociceptive neuromodulator centers in the brainstem.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^117M2bYz]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

We sought to evaluate a hybrid machine learning model using real-world single-lead ECG data to classify eight arrhythmias from acutely ill patients receiving care at home in an innovative 'home hospital' programme that provides acute care at home as a substitute for care that would traditionally be provided in the hospital (figure 1).

Figure 1
An acutely ill patient generates continuous single-lead ECG interpreted by traditional computer algorithms during usual care with only fair arrhythmia recognition, generating significant alarm fatigue due to false positives. The hybrid model evaluated in this study demonstrated performance comparable to gold standard annotators when challenged with real-world single-lead ECG data from acutely ill patients. Refer to online supplemental figure S1 for a more detailed schematic of the hybrid model. AFIB, atrial fibrillation; Brady, sinus bradycardia; DNN, deep neural network; NSR, normal sinus rhythm; PSVT, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; Tachy, sinus tachycardia; V. Big, ventricular bigeminy; V. Trig, ventricular trigeminy.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^113ytjmi]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis builds on others' work. A single-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier by Hannun et al classified ECG tracings into 12 rhythmic categories — AFIB/atrial flutter, atrioventricular block, bigeminy, ectopic atrial rhythm, idioventricular rhythm, junctional rhythm, noise, normal sinus rhythm, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), tachycardia and Wenckebach block. Its average F 1 Score when tested against a 10% sample of the PhysioNet data set was 83.7%. A single-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier from Dias et al classified heartbeats as normal, supraventricular ectopic beats or ventricular ectopic beats with F 1 Scores of 52% for supraventricular ectopic beats and 91% for ventricular ectopic beats, lower than the presently considered model for PSVT (92%), ventricular bigeminy (98%) and trigeminy (96%). A 12-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier developed by Baygin et al which classifies ECG tracings into seven rhythmic categories — AFIB, atrial flutter, bradycardia, SVT, tachycardia, sinus irregularity, normal sinus rhythm — achieved a maximum single-lead F 1 Score of 84.0%. A 12-lead ECG analysis neural network from Hughes et al achieved a mean F 1 Score of 81.2% at detecting arrhythmias.

### The electrophysiology of migraine [^1166fKNv]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is currently regarded as a neurovascular disorder of trigeminal sensory processing, generated centrally, probably at the level of the brainstem. In the past, electrophysiological techniques have drawn no definite conclusions on either interictal or ictal changes in migraineurs compared with controls, largely because of methodological differences. Recently, two findings have been shown consistently: an interictal increasing lack of habituation of evoked potentials with a normalization at the start of the attack and strong intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials. These findings substantiate migraine sufferers as having an abnormal trait interictally, with the attack characterized by a change in the state of central processing. Exploitation of these differences may be a useful tool to study the mechanism of action of drugs used for the treatment of migraine.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^116bwSqH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/mL although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase LANOXIN dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue LANOXIN for 1–2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

Other Arrhythmias

Beyond AF, OSA has been linked with a spectrum of other cardiac rhythm disturbances as well as sudden cardiac death. Simantirakis et al reported a 22% prevalence of prolonged pauses and bradycardia in patients with moderate‐to‐severe OSA who received long‐term monitoring with an implanted loop recorder. 119 Patients are considered to have the "tachy‐brady syndrome" when such bradyarrhythmias alternate with AF or other forms of supraventricular tachycardia. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias also appears to be higher among patients with OSA. Mehra et al found a significantly higher prevalence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (5.3% versus 1.2%, P = 0.004) among patients with severe OSA compared with controls. 98 Similarly, severe OSA was associated with a significantly higher overall risk of complex ventricular ectopy, defined as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy (25% versus 14.5%, P = 0.002). Importantly, an increased risk of sudden cardiac death has been reported in patients with severe OSA, particularly among those observed to have nocturnal oxygen desaturation to < 78%. 120 There are limited data suggesting a beneficial effect of CPAP therapy on reducing rhythm disturbances in patients with OSA 119, 121, 122; however, additional study is necessary given the small size and predominantly observational nature of these trials.

Coronary Artery Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease, or Patients Without Established CVD Who Are at High Risk for Future Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Associations have been identified between OSA and other forms of CVD in addition to those described above, in particular coronary artery disease (CAD) 58, 123 and cerebrovascular disease. 124 Among the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking OSA with CAD and cerebrovascular disease are some of those described above as involved in other forms of CVD, including increased sympathetic nervous system activity, oxidative stress, and predilection to poorly controlled and/or resistant hypertension. Additional mechanisms have been identified as well, including endothelial dysfunction, 125, 126 promotion of a procoagulable state, 127 and metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance. 128, 129 Treatment of OSA with CPAP has been shown to mitigate these processes, 127, 130, 131 offering a plausible mechanism by which treating OSA could influence cardiovascular outcomes.

### Self-gated MRI of multiple beat morphologies in the presence of arrhythmias [^111csF14]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Develop self-gated MRI for distinct heartbeat morphologies in subjects with arrhythmias.

Methods

Golden angle radial data was obtained in seven sinus and eight arrhythmias subjects. An image-based cardiac navigator was derived from single-shot images, distinct beat types were identified, and images were reconstructed for repeated morphologies. Image sharpness, contrast, and volume variation were quantified and compared with self-gated MRI. Images were scored for image quality and artifacts. Hemodynamic parameters were computed for each distinct beat morphology in bigeminy and trigeminy subjects and for sinus beats in patients with infrequent premature ventricular contractions.

Results

Images of distinct beat types were reconstructed except for two patients with infrequent premature ventricular contractions. Image contrast and sharpness were similar to sinus self-gated images (contrast = 0.45 ± 0.13 and 0.43 ± 0.15; sharpness = 0.21 ± 0.11 and 0.20 ± 0.05). Visual scoring was highest in self-gated images (4.1 ± 0.3) compared with real-time (3.9 ± 0.4) and ECG-gated cine (3.4 ± 1.5). ECG-gated cine had less artifacts than self-gating (2.3 ± 0.7 and 2.1 ± 0.2), but was affected by misgating in two subjects. Among arrhythmia subjects, post-extrasystole/sinus (58.1 ± 8.6mL) and interrupted sinus (61.4 ± 5.9mL) stroke volume was higher than extrasystole (32.0 ± 16.5mL; P < 0.02).

Conclusion

Self-gated imaging can reconstruct images during ectopy and allowed for quantification of hemodynamic function of different beat morphologies. Magn Reson Med 78:678–688, 2017. © 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

### Deep learning for comprehensive ECG annotation [^115EpnZP]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Increasing utilization of long-term outpatient ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring continues to drive the need for improved ECG interpretation algorithms.

OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this study was to describe the BeatLogic® platform for ECG interpretation and to validate the platform using electrophysiologist-adjudicated real-world data and publicly available validation data.

METHODS

Deep learning models were trained to perform beat and rhythm detection/classification using ECGs collected with the Preventice BodyGuardian® Heart monitor. Training annotations were created by certified ECG technicians, and validation annotations were adjudicated by a team of board-certified electrophysiologists. Deep learning model classification results were used to generate contiguous annotation results, and performance was assessed in accordance with the EC57 standard.

RESULTS

On the real-world validation dataset, BeatLogic beat detection sensitivity and positive predictive value were 99.84% and 99.78%, respectively. Ventricular ectopic beat classification sensitivity and positive predictive value were 89.4% and 97.8%, respectively. Episode and duration F 1 scores (range 0–100) exceeded 70 for all 14 rhythms (including noise) that were evaluated. F 1 scores for 11 rhythms exceeded 80, 7 exceeded 90, and 5 including atrial fibrillation/flutter, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular trigeminy, and third-degree heart block exceeded 95.

CONCLUSION

The BeatLogic platform represents the next stage of advancement for algorithmic ECG interpretation. This comprehensive platform performs beat detection, beat classification, and rhythm detection/classification with greatly improved performance over the current state of the art, with comparable or improved performance over previously published algorithms that can accomplish only 1 of these 3 tasks.

### Current understanding of cortical structure and function in migraine [^111QzziS]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An important role of the cortex in migraine is well acknowledged for the initiation of aura via the electrophysiological phenomenon CSD, and more recently also for the perception of head pain and associated sensations. Structural and functional findings suggest that static and plastic changes within and across cortical regions contribute to enhanced migraine susceptibility and its clinical course by modulating trigeminovascular pain and sensory processing networks.

It is important to acknowledge that clinical morphometric and functional neuroimaging data, as well as neurophysiological data on cortical function, show partially contradicting results. This could relate to shortcomings with respect to: (a) the relatively low number of patients in many studies; (b) there being only a few replication studies given the complexity of protocols and differences in equipment; (c) differences in analyses (e.g. whole-brain imaging vs. selective brain regions, or low-density EEG); (d) variation in methods of data collection; (e) differences in timing of data collection with respect to migraine attack onset; (f) differences in medications and comorbidities that often are not taken into account; (g) study design – longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate how a change in clinical phenotype affects imaging or neurophysiological findings. These methodological differences between studies make meta-analysis difficult. In addition, it remains unclear whether positive findings are consequences and/or causes of migraine. Hypothesis-driven designs should take into account the interplay between cortical regions and subcortical structures such as the brainstem, thalamus and hypothalamus, as well as the static and cyclic effects of internal (e.g. genetics, gender, metabolism) as well as external factors (e.g. stressors, circadian and environmental changes) on these processes.

### Advances in the basic and clinical science of migraine [^111KJHb4]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine continues to be an elephant in the room of medicine: massively common and a heavy burden on patients and their healthcare providers, yet the recipient of relatively little attention for research, education, and clinical resources. Its visibility is gradually increasing, however, as advances in genetics, imaging, epidemiology, and pharmacology produce a more definitive understanding of the condition, and identify more specific and effective treatments. Rapid evolution of concepts regarding its prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical management is leading to growing recognition of migraine as a fundamentally important disorder of the nervous system.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^1133ZFPZ]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

TN that is purely paroxysmal or with concomitant continuous pain

TN with concomitant continuous or near continuous pain occurs in 14%–50% of patients. The importance of differentiating these two subtypes is underlined by recent evidence suggesting that TN with concomitant continuous pain is pathophysiologically different (see the Pathophysiology section) and responds less well to treatments compared with the purely paroxysmal form.

Examination

The physical and neurological examinations are generally normal, though approximately 30% of cases can have sensory changes including mild hypoaesthesia. On rare occasions, during very severe attacks, the pain can evoke ipsilateral facial muscle contraction (tic douloureux).

### Hourly variability in outflow tract ectopy as a predictor of its site of origin [^114Ytzyw]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Before ablation, predicting the site of origin (SOO) of outflow tract ventricular arrhythmia (OTVA), can inform patient consent and facilitate appropriate procedural planning. We set out to determine if OTVA variability can accurately predict SOO.

Methods

Consecutive patients with a clear SOO identified at OTVA ablation had their prior 24-h ambulatory ECGs retrospectively analysed (derivation cohort). Percentage ventricular ectopic (VE) burden, hourly VE values, episodes of trigeminy/bigeminy, and the variability in these parameters were evaluated for their ability to distinguish right from left-sided SOO. Effective parameters were then prospectively tested on a validation cohort of consecutive patients undergoing their first OTVA ablation.

Results

High VE variability (coefficient of variation ≥ 0.7) and the presence of any hour with < 50 VE, were found to accurately predict RVOT SOO in a derivation cohort of 40 patients. In a validation cohort of 29 patients, the correct SOO was prospectively identified in 23/29 patients (79.3%) using CoV, and 26/29 patients (89.7%) using VE < 50. Including current ECG algorithms, VE < 50 had the highest Youden Index (78), the highest positive predictive value (95.0%) and the highest negative predictive value (77.8%).

Conclusion

VE variability and the presence of a single hour where VE < 50 can be used to accurately predict SOO in patients with OTVA. Accuracy of these parameters compares favorably to existing ECG algorithms.

### The association between nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias and sleep-disordered breathing: the DREAM study [^112J6h2d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with cardiac arrhythmia in a clinic-based population with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities and severe SDB.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional analysis of 697 veterans who underwent polysomnography for suspected SDB. SDB was categorized according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): none (AHI < 5), mild (5 ≥ AHI < 15), and moderate-severe (AHI ≥ 15). Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias consisted of: (1) complex ventricular ectopy, (CVE: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy), (2) combined supraventricular tachycardia, (CST: atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia), (3) intraventricular conduction delay (ICD), (4) tachyarrhythmias (ventricular and supraventricular), and (5) any cardiac arrhythmia. Unadjusted, adjusted logistic regression, and Cochran-Armitage testing examined the association between SDB and cardiac arrhythmias. Linear regression models explored the association between hypoxia, arousals, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Results

Compared to those without SDB, patients with moderate-severe SDB had almost three-fold unadjusted odds of any cardiac arrhythmia (2.94; CI 95%, 2.01–4.30; p < 0.0001), two-fold odds of tachyarrhythmias (2.16; CI 95%,1.47–3.18; p = 0.0011), two-fold odds of CVE (2.01; 1.36–2.96; p = 0.003), and two-fold odds of ICD (2.50; 1.58–3.95; p = 0.001). A linear trend was identified between SDB severity and all cardiac arrhythmia subtypes (p value linear trend < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, BMI, gender, and cardiovascular diseases, moderate-severe SDB patients had twice the odds of having nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias (2.24; 1.48–3.39; p = 0.004). Frequency of obstructive respiratory events and hypoxia were strong predictors of arrhythmia risk.

Conclusions

SDB is independently associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk for any cardiac arrhythmia.

### Premature cardiac contractions and risk of incident ischemic stroke [^113ZwPtW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Methods and Population

The public-use ARIC study data were utilized for this analysis. ARIC, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a population-based cohort study of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, in 15 792 African Americans and whites, aged between 45 and 64 years, and randomly selected from 4 communities (Suburban Minneapolis, MN; Washington County, MD; Forsyth County, NC; and Jackson, MS). Baseline examination was conducted between 1987 and 1989. Cohorts were contacted yearly by telephone and followed-up by triennial clinical reexaminations. Follow-up data to 2002 were used in this report, with an average follow-up of 13 years. From the baseline sample we excluded 1299 individuals with baseline history of stroke or CHD, and 81 individuals who developed subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage during follow-up, yielding an effective sample size of 14 493.

A supine resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained using the MAC PC10 personal cardiogram (Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI) and a 2-minute, 3-lead (V1, II, and V5) rhythm strip. Participants were requested to fast and refrain from smoking and consuming caffeinated beverages before examination. Electrocardiographic procedures required the use of identified skin positions and placement of electrodes ≥ 3 minutes before recording. Electrocardiographic data processing, monitoring, and quality controls have been described elsewhere. Rhythm strips were classified 3 times by independent trained coders for total atrial ectopic beats, supraventricular, ventricular complexes and ventricular runs, bigeminy, trigeminy, and multiform complexes. Adjudication of disagreements was performed by the electrocardiographic center principal investigator or coding supervisor. PACs and PVCs were determined from the rhythm strip.

### Progesterone pretreatment reduces the incidence of drug-induced torsades de pointes in atrioventricular node-ablated isolated perfused rabbit hearts [^113odUBd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Higher progesterone concentrations are protective against drug-induced prolongation of ventricular repolarization. We tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with progesterone reduces the incidence of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP).

Methods and Results

Female New Zealand white rabbits (2.5–3.2kg) underwent ovariectomy and were randomized to undergo implantation with subcutaneous 21-day sustained release pellets containing progesterone 50mg (n = 22) or placebo (n = 23). After 20 days, hearts were excised, mounted, and perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. The atrioventricular (AV) node was destroyed manually. Following a 15-minute equilibration period, hearts were perfused with dofetilide 100nM for 30minutes, during which the electrocardiogram was recorded continuously. Incidences of spontaneous TdP, other ventricular arrhythmias and mean QT c intervals were compared. Median serum progesterone concentrations were higher in progesterone vs placebo-treated rabbits (3.8 [range, 2.8–5.1] vs 0.7 [0.4–1.7]ng/mL, P < 0.0001). Median serum estradiol concentrations were similar (58 [22–72] vs 53 [34–62]pg/mL), P = 0.79). The incidence of TdP was lower in hearts from progesterone-treated rabbits (27% vs 61%, P = 0.049). The incidences of bigeminy (36% vs 74%, P = 0.03) and trigeminy (18% vs 57%, P = 0.01) were also lower in hearts from progesterone-treated rabbits. There was no significant difference between groups in incidence of couplets (59% vs 74%, P = 0.54) or monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (14% vs 30%, P = 0.28). Maximum QT c interval and short-term beat-to-beat QT interval variability during dofetilide perfusion were significantly shorter in hearts from progesterone-treated rabbits.

Conclusions

Pretreatment with progesterone reduces the incidence of drug-induced TdP, bigeminy, and trigeminy in isolated perfused AV node-ablated rabbit hearts.

We designed and evaluated our deep-learning system using four publicly available datasets comprising ECGs alongside cardiac arrhythmia labels. The first dataset, which we refer to as Cardiology, includes ECG data collected via a chest patch from 292 patients alongside twelve cardiac arrhythmia labels: AFIB, AVB, BIGEMINY, EAR, IVR, JUNCTIONAL, NOISE, NSR, SVT, TRIGEMINY, VT, and WENCKEBACH. The second dataset, which we refer to as Chapman, includes ECG data collected from 10,646 patients alongside four high-level cardiac arrhythmia labels: AFIB, GSVT, sinus bradycardia, and sinus rhythm. The third dataset, which we refer to as PhysioNet 2020, includes ECG data collected from 6876 patients alongside nine cardiac arrhythmia labels: AFIB, I-AVB, LBBB, Normal, PAC, PVC, RBBB, STD, and STE. The fourth dataset, we which we refer to as PhysioNet 2017, includes 8528 single-lead ECG recordings alongside four labels: normal, AFIB, other, and noisy. Across all datasets, we split patients randomly into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring that there was no patient overlap between sets.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias in various CL scenarios, defined as environments with changing dynamics (described next). The secondary outcome was to mitigate catastrophic forgetting experienced by our deep-learning system as a result of data distribution shift. We define catastrophic forgetting as a hindered ability of the deep-learning system to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias based on data exposed to in the past.

Algorithm development

The deep-learning system involved a lightweight convolutional network which received a single-lead ECG as input and returned a probability distribution over cardiac arrhythmias as output. This clinical task was performed in four distinct CL scenarios. From hereon forward, we refer to our deep-learning system as CLOPS, for the continual learning of physiological signals.

### Migraine [^111ccSGv]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Migraine is a chronic paroxysmal neurological disorder characterised by multiphase attacks of head pain and a myriad of neurological symptoms. The underlying genetic and biological underpinnings and neural networks involved are coming sharply into focus. This progress in the fundamental understanding of migraine has led to novel, mechanism-based and disease-specific therapeutics. In this Seminar, the clinical features and neurobiology of migraine are reviewed, evidence to support available treatment options is provided, and emerging drug, device, and biological therapies are discussed.

### Migraine: from pathophysiology to treatment [^117NZkem]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The last 2 decades have been an incredibly exciting period for clinicians and researchers interested in migraine, as they have seen a rapid increase in studies that have led to a greater knowledge and understanding of the neurobiology of the disorder. From suffering with a condition that was often overlooked and under-managed, migraineurs are now being offered novel treatments that are more and more tailored to their needs, and that are fundamentally re-shaping our approach to the disease.

More research and progress is needed and is expected in the coming years, and hopefully this will continue to raise awareness around a complex phenomenon affecting millions of people all over the world.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^11197ZeW]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### The pathophysiology of migraine: implications for clinical management [^113JZgcS]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

The understanding of migraine pathophysiology is advancing rapidly. Improved characterisation and diagnosis of its clinical features have led to the view of migraine as a complex, variable disorder of nervous system function rather than simply a vascular headache. Recent studies have provided important new insights into its genetic causes, anatomical and physiological features, and pharmacological mechanisms. The identification of new migraine-associated genes, the visualisation of brain regions that are activated at the earliest stages of a migraine attack, a greater appreciation of the potential role of the cervical nerves, and the recognition of the crucial role for neuropeptides are among the advances that have led to novel targets for migraine therapy. Future management of migraine will have the capacity to tailor treatments based on the distinct mechanisms of migraine that affect individual patients.

Fig. 1
Global age‐standardized prevalence of migraine in males and females.

Studies of a rare condition, familial hemiplegic migraine, however, has been more successful in pointing towards a more specific single mechanism — increased sensitivity of central nervour system (CNS) glutaminergic signaling. The debate is still ongoing regarding the importance of peripheral sites as the origin of migraine attacks, posing the question: does migraine start in the dura mater and/or in extracerebral arteries? Do migraine attacks require a peripheral sensory input to be activated? Recent imaging studies suggest that midbrain and brainstem structures are the drivers of migraine attacks. Today, much evidence suggests that migraine attacks may start in the hypothalamus, sometimes already on the day before the headache (the prodromal phase), continue with the activation of the thalamus and the brainstem, and then the trigeminal system. The trigeminovascular system is likely necessary for the characteristic headache (the core of a migraine attack). Finally, after cessation of the headache phase there are imaging data showing that there are still alterations in the brain that correlate with CNS symptoms, such as tiredness (the postdrome). Current debate favors the view that migraine is a CNS disorder, in which attacks starts in subcortical regions, exemplified by studies of premonitory symptoms and supported by a series of elegant studies during continuous scanning of patients during the migraine cycle. The imaging studies collectively point towards a hypothalamus–thalamus–brainstem pathway as a putative driver of the migraine biology. Thus, the functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated brainstem areas to be specifically activated in migraine attacks, sometimes referred to as the "migraine generator". The link from the hypothalamus with the dorsal rostral pons, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and sensory trigeminovascular system, are key parts in understanding the transmission of headache pain.

### Association of nocturnal arrhythmias with sleep-disordered breathing: the sleep heart health study [^113icLzd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Sleep-disordered breathing recurrent intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic nervous system activity surges provide the milieu for cardiac arrhythmia development.

Objective

We postulate that the prevalence of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias is higher among subjects with than without sleep-disordered breathing.

Methods

The prevalence of arrhythmias was compared in two samples of participants from the Sleep Heart Health Study frequency-matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index: (1) 228 subjects with sleep-disordered breathing (respiratory disturbance index ≥ 30) and (2) 338 subjects without sleep-disordered breathing (respiratory disturbance index < 5).

Results

Atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and complex ventricular ectopy (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or bigeminy or trigeminy or quadrigeminy) were more common in subjects with sleep-disordered breathing compared with those without sleep-disordered breathing: 4.8 versus 0.9% (p = 0.003) for atrial fibrillation; 5.3 versus 1.2% (p = 0.004) for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; 25.0 versus 14.5% (p = 0.002) for complex ventricular ectopy. Compared with those without sleep-disordered breathing and adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and prevalent coronary heart disease, individuals with sleep-disordered breathing had four times the odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR], 4.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–15.74), three times the odds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.03–11.20), and almost twice the odds of complex ventricular ectopy (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11–2.74). A significant relation was also observed between sleep-disordered breathing and ventricular ectopic beats/h (p < 0.0003) considered as a continuous outcome.

Conclusions

Individuals with severe sleep-disordered breathing have two- to fourfold higher odds of complex arrhythmias than those without sleep-disordered breathing even after adjustment for potential confounders.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^1119Hya7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been described in the literature as one of the most debilitating presentations of orofacial pain. This review summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the medical and surgical treatment of TN. Fundamentally, TN remains a clinical diagnosis that must be distinguished from other types of trigeminal neuropathic pain and/or facial pain associated with other neuralgias or headache syndromes. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsant medical therapy. Patients who fail this have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerol or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are ineligible for invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo open surgical procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option — provided the patient understands that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for patients in locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### Cardiac magnetic resonance predicts ventricular arrhythmias in scleroderma: the scleroderma arrhythmia clinical utility study (SAnCtUS) [^116FKGSm]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

CMR data analysis

CMR evaluation included assessment of left and right ventricular function, oedema (T2 ratio) and replacement fibrosis [late gadolinium enhancement (%LGE)]. All CMR data acquisition methods are described in detail in the supplementary material, section Supplementary Methods, available at Rheumatology online.

Analysis of 24 h Holter recordings

The 24 h Holter data were obtained from all included patients and were analysed by three independent observers (S.M. L.G. and K.B.) blinded to clinical and CMR data, according to criteria used in similar SSc studies. The 24 h Holter data were analysed collectively as supraventricular, ventricular or any rhythm disturbances as follows:

Supraventricular rhythm disturbances: Atrioventricular block Atrial fibrillation Run of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
Ventricular rhythm disturbances: Any presence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) Polymorphic PVCs PVCs in couples PVCs in triplets Bigeminy/trigeminy/quadrigeminy Run of non-sustained VT [three or more consecutive beats arising below the atrioventricular node with an RR interval of < 600 ms (> 100 beats/min) and lasting < 30 s] Run of sustained VT [a series of consecutive PVCs (⩾120 beats/min) and lasting > 30 s]

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^111tBV7x].

Trigeminal neuralgia — clinical features for identifying symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN): seven papers (one graded Class IV) assessed clinical characteristics distinguishing STN from classic TN (CTN), including sensory deficits, age at onset, first trigeminal division involvement, bilateral trigeminal involvement, and unresponsiveness to treatment; one study was graded Class III, and four cohort studies with broad spectra were graded Class II due to retrospective data collection; across studies, first-division involvement and unresponsiveness were not associated with increased STN risk, while younger age was significantly associated with increased risk but its diagnostic accuracy was too low to be clinically useful for discriminating CTN and STN.

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a key molecule released in acute migraine attacks-successful translation of basic science to clinical practice [^116Dgv2H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current view suggests that migraine has an elusive genetic background. Various triggers may elicit attacks, whether due to stress or fluctuations in hormones, which trigger cells in the hypothalamus to initiate the attack. The connectivity in the brain implies the involvement of the thalamus and brainstem regions, ultimately resulting in enhanced activity in the trigeminal system and sensitization at both central and peripheral sites. The new specific CGRP‐directed medications aim to play down this activity.

CGRP was earlier proposed to be involved in migraine pathophysiology and later basic and clinical research formed the foundation for a new group of specific remedies, mAbs directed towards CGRP or the CGRP receptor, and small molecule drugs (gepants) acting on the CGRP receptor. The mAbs are now approved for prophylaxis of migraine, and the first of the gepants are in clinical use. The experience has been reviewed by several groups and is very encouraging. It took basic research more than 3 decades to be translated to clinical practice, but the result for the patients has been extraordinary. Ongoing work aims to unravel the biology of CGRP signaling, expand the clinical evidence for the role of CGRP in migraine headache, and potentially find other ways to treat the different patient groups of primary headache disorders, like cluster headache, inter alia. All in all, the latest findings have provided new insights into the central role of the trigeminal system in the pathophysiology of migraine pain.

The patient was also started on oral minoxidil 0.625 mg daily for 1 month and increased to 1.25 mg daily thereafter. In addition to the scalp biopsy, other interventions included a chest x-ray to rule out lung cancer, a complete blood count, thyroid stimulation hormone levels, and thyroid peroxidase antibody. All of the results were normal.

### Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of cluster headache [^115xBiK3]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache is a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia characterised by extremely painful, strictly unilateral, short-lasting headache attacks accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms or the sense of restlessness and agitation, or both. The severity of the disorder has major effects on the patient's quality of life and, in some cases, might lead to suicidal ideation. Cluster headache is now thought to involve a synchronised abnormal activity in the hypothalamus, the trigeminovascular system, and the autonomic nervous system. The hypothalamus appears to play a fundamental role in the generation of a permissive state that allows the initiation of an episode, whereas the attacks are likely to require the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Triptans are the most effective drugs to treat an acute cluster headache attack. Monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide, a crucial neurotransmitter of the trigeminal system, are under investigation for the preventive treatment of cluster headache. These studies will increase our understanding of the disorder and perhaps reveal other therapeutic targets.

### Electrocardiographic responses to deer hunting in men and women [^111KhUMc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Deer hunting includes various stimuli resulting in augmented sympathetic activity, increased heart rate (HR) response, and rhythm changes. Collectively, these superimposed stresses may increase an individual's risk for cardiovascular events. We undertook this study to evaluate HR and rhythm responses in multiple phases of deer hunting in men and women with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

Nineteen participants age 38.3 ± 13.8 years (mean ± SD) with body mass index 29.2 ± 6.9 kg/m(2) followed their normal hunting routine. HR and rhythm were recorded continuously during the hunt using a small leadless electrocardiogram (ECG) patch monitor.

Results

Data were collected on 13 of 19 hunters while hiking. Three hunters recorded HR ≥ 85% of their age-predicted heart rate maximum (HRmax) for 1 to 2 minutes. Arrhythmias were detected in both participants with CVD and in 8 without CVD. Recorded rhythms included premature atrial, junctional, and ventricular complexes. Six hunters climbed a tree stand; 3 of them recorded HR ≥ 85% HRmax with sustained elevated HR response for 2 to 3 minutes with premature junctional contractions. Four of 19 participants dragged deer carcasses. During the drag, 1 male hunter recorded an HR of 91% HRmax, and another male hunter without CVD recorded an exercise-induced ischemic ECG. Fifteen of 19 hunters experienced "buck fever" (acute extreme excitation), with 7 reaching ≥ 85% HRmax for up to 1 minute. Ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy and ventricular couplets were observed in 1 subject during buck fever.

Conclusions

Men and women with and without CVD recorded substantial increases in HR and clinically relevant arrhythmias while deer hunting.

### Cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias 3 Months after hospitalization for COVID-19 [^1136SrsE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Information concerning persisting cardiac arrhythmias has, to our knowledge, not been reported in previous studies of patients with COVID‐19. In a worldwide survey of 4526 hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, associated arrhythmias were common and found in 18%. In a meta‐analysis comprising 9 studies, cardiac arrhythmias during hospitalization with COVID‐19 were found in 19% of patients, slightly lower compared with our study. The clinical implications of persistent ventricular arrhythmia following COVID‐19 are not clear, but ventricular ectopy has been linked to an increased risk of cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. Ventricular ectopy is usually a benign arrhythmia, but may in some patients cause persisting palpitations, chest pain, and dizziness leading to reduced quality of life. Potential serious ventricular arrhythmias such as NSVT were observed in 5%, which is twice as many compared with a Norwegian population‐based study with 2.6% NSVT among 498 participants, and in total, 9% had complex ventricular ectopy (bigeminy, trigeminy, or NSVT). Frequent PVCs (> 5 per hour, 120 per 24 hours) were observed in 9% and were associated with significantly higher concentrations of NT‐proBNP and high‐sensitivity troponin I. We found twice as many PVCs using a stricter definition (> 200 PVCs per 24 hours). In healthy volunteers, > 200 PVCs per 24 hours were observed in 3% and NSVT in 0.7%. However, without a matched control group, it is difficult to conclude the relation to COVID‐19. A modest correlation between PVCs and NT‐proBNP and hs‐cTn levels during hospitalization and at 3 months was found in our study. These arrhythmias may be more closely related to myocardial damage reflected in increased hs‐cTn concentrations than RV function because there was no correlation between RVLS and hs‐cTn. A recent retrospective cohort study, conducted by reviewing electronic medical records from a global federated health research network, showed that 718 365 patients with COVID‐19 (6.5%) developed new‐onset perimyocarditis. The extent of micro scars is unknown in COVID‐19, which could be triggers for arrhythmias.

### Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein [^112ULdMH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Ala96 HRC Mice Have an Increased Incidence of Ventricular Ectopy on Catecholamine Challenge

We previously reported that the human HRC genetic variant (Ser96Ala) was associated with fatal arrhythmias in DCM patients. Thus, we subjected the Ala96 HRC mice to catecholaminergic stress to determine whether that would induce cardiac arrhythmias in vivo. To test this, the surface ECG was monitored on intraperitoneal injection of ISO. ISO caused frequent premature ventricular complexes in the form of bigeminy and trigeminy (Figure 8 A) and episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in Ala96 mice (Figure 8 B). Arrhythmias typically began 3 to 5 minutes after catecholamine injection and lasted 20 minutes into recovery. Of 8 Ala96 mice, 4 displayed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, while none of the Ser96 HRC mice showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia events (Figure 8 C). Although all VT events were monomorphic, heart rates never exceeded 1000 bpm, and VT rhythms never deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation. The Ser96 mice showed only benign and expected arrhythmias under stress conditions, such as infrequent atrial premature contractions.

Figure 8.

### Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^114UeeEY]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Rhythm and conduction disturbances and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are important manifestations of cardiac involvement in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a major cause of SCD is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, leading to acute coronary syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial ectopic beats are the major cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, sinus tachycardia may be the only manifestation of cardiac involvement. The most frequent cardiac rhythm disturbances in systemic sclerosis (SSc) are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), often appearing as monomorphic, single PVCs, or rarely as bigeminy, trigeminy or pairs. Transient atrial fibrillation, flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are also described in 20–30% of SSc patients. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was described in 7–13%, while SCD is reported in 5–21% of unselected patients with SSc. The conduction disorders are more frequent in ARD than the cardiac arrhythmias. In RA, infiltration of the atrioventricular (AV) node can cause right bundle branch block in 35% of patients. AV block is rare in RA, and is usually complete. In SLE small vessel vasculitis, the infiltration of the sinus or AV nodes, or active myocarditis can lead to first-degree AV block in 34–70% of patients. In contrast to RA, conduction abnormalities may regress when the underlying disease is controlled. In neonatal lupus, 3% of infants whose mothers are antibody positive develop complete heart block. Conduction disturbances in SSc are due to fibrosis of sinoatrial node, presenting as abnormal ECG, bundle and fascicular blocks and occur in 25–75% of patients.

### Recent advances in diagnosing, managing, and understanding the pathophysiology of cluster headache [^112Y5G6f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Cluster headache, characterised by attacks of severe, recurrent, unilateral headache and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, remains a primary headache with an elusive pathophysiology. Recent advances have introduced effective treatments and broadened understanding of the clinical features of cluster headache. These features are similar in patients globally, but regional differences in prevalence and burden exist. International collaborations have led to identification of eight genetic loci associated with cluster headache. The pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood but recent studies show that targeting the trigeminal autonomic reflex by neurostimulation, or targeting the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), might lessen the attack burden. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CGRP, as the first specific preventive treatment for episodic cluster headache. However, a preventive effect was not replicated in chronic cluster headache, and the European Medicines Agency did not approve galcanezumab, restricting its availability in Europe. Owing to the low prevalence of cluster headache, continued collaboration through multicentre clinical trials and data sharing will be imperative for further breakthroughs in understanding and management.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^1163vp25]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Facial and intraoral territories of innervation of the 3 trigeminal branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular). The white areas are innervated by cervical nerves. The light gray areas in the back of tongue and throat are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Pain qualifying as possible TN must have a paroxysmal character. Abrupt onset and termination of each paroxysm are unmistakable, whereas the actual description of the paroxysms may vary. Typical characterizations include notions of brief, sudden, stabbing, electric shock–like, and severe pain attacks. The paroxysms may last up to 2 minutes, but their duration is usually limited to a few seconds. Frequency of the pain attacks may range from 1 to over 50 a day. Refuting earlier assumptions, a recent study in 200 patients with classical TN did not find evidence supporting an increase in frequency or duration of the pain paroxysms with the disease duration. Unlike other forms of neuropathic pain, TN enters into periods of complete remission in up to 63% of patients. These periods may last from weeks to years.

Painful symptoms associated with TN are virtually always unilateral. Bilateral TN is very rare except for TN caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). Occasional reports of bilateral classical TN reflect successive episodes of unilateral pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides. A meta-analysis did not reveal any report of truly bilateral TN in 234 patients with classical TN. We reviewed studies of MS associated with TN and identified 5 reports describing 24 out of 252 patients (∼10%) with bilateral TN.

Previous definitions of TN emphasized a stereotypic character of the pain. Stereotypy, however, is not a unique feature of TN. A uniform pain character occurs in other conditions of neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain and should not be considered a defining diagnostic criterion. In addition, it is not uncommon for TN to change its sensory quality over the course of the disease.

### Cardiac arrhythmias associated with volume-assured pressure support mode in a patient with autonomic dysfunction and mitochondrial disease [^1132daMe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

None

A 15-year-old boy with autonomic dysfunction and mitochondrial disease was diagnosed with sleep-related hypoventilation at 6 years of age and treated with bilevel positive airway pressure therapy. At 12 years of age, treatment was transitioned to volume-assured pressure support (VAPS) due to clinical evidence of respiratory muscle weakness. Subsequent titration polysomnogram revealed the emergence of cardiac arrhythmia (isolated premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, and trigeminy) while on VAPS mode that improved after transition to bilevel positive airway pressure therapy. During the titration study, higher tidal volumes correlated with increased pressures and the presence of arrhythmia. Prior to initiation of VAPS therapy, the patient had normal electrocardiogram evaluations. This case highlights the potential relationship between VAPS therapy and cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with underlying conditions with associated cardiac abnormalities, such as autonomic dysfunction and mitochondrial disease. While using VAPS mode, patients should be closely monitored for cardiac rhythm abnormalities.

### Transient cardiac effects in a child with acute cholinergic syndrome due to rivastigmine poisoning [^1122USxA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We report a case of rivastigmine poisoning resulting in a full cholinergic syndrome with nicotinic, muscarinic, and central effects requiring supportive or intensive care in a pediatric patient.

Case Report

A 3-year-old girl was admitted to the Emergency Department suspected of having ingested one or two pills of rivastigmine. The child was hyporeactive, with symptoms of altered mental status, sialorrhea, sweating, and diarrhea. Subsequently, she started showing signs of respiratory failure, severe tracheobronchial involvement, and gastric and abdominal distension. An electrocardiogram recorded frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats with bigeminy and trigeminy. Long-term follow-up showed a transient dysrhythmia.

Conclusion

Poisoning with rivastigmine can be a life-threatening condition. Timely identification and appropriate management of the toxic effects of this drug are essential and often life-saving. This is particularly true in cases of cholinergic syndrome subsequent to drug poisoning. Patients with cholinergic syndrome should also be assessed for possible cardiac complications such as dysrhythmias. The main factors predisposing to the development of such complications are autonomic disorder, hypoxemia, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance.

### Near-term prediction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias applying artificial intelligence to single-lead ambulatory electrocardiogram [^111LMBea]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

To capture information related to potential triggers, we utilized clinical data and quantitative measurements derived from the ECG recordings, which have been previously associated with VT risk (Figure 1B). Additionally, to obtain a more comprehensive view of the global rhythm profile over an extended period, we introduced a new representation of the 24 h recording in the form of an HRDP. The clinical data consist of patient age and sex, and the measurements included 19 parameters: PVC burden (%), repetitive character (number of consecutive PVC, mean, and standard deviation), coupling interval between sinus beats and PVCs (mean and standard deviation), QRS duration (mean and standard deviation), non-sustained VT characteristics [count, maximum heart rate (HR), and longest duration], and HR variability (HRV, including SDNN, SDANN, SDNNI, pNN50, RMSSD, and HF power), premature atrial complex (PAC) burden (%), and counts of PVC couplets, bigeminy, and trigeminy. The identification of sinus beats, PACs, PVCs, and VT was performed by the Cardiologs algorithm, as described in the previous work. The clinical data and measurements were normalized and provided to two fully connected layers to generate a feature representation.

An HRDP is a 3D representation of the instantaneous HR during the monitoring period (Figure 1C). The x -axis represents time, the y -axis represents HR, and the z -axis consists of three channels corresponding to each beat's classification as either: sinus, PVC, or PAC. The HRDP backbone consisted of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a transformer encoder, and an attention-based pooling layer. The CNN is based on the ResNet-50 architecture, which takes as input an HRDP to extract spatial feature maps from the recording. An attention-pooling layerwas used to aggregate spatial feature maps across the HR-axis (y -axis) resulting in temporal feature maps. A transformer encoder, composed of four multi-headed attention layers, is used to exploit relationships across the temporal features. A final attention-pooling layer is then used to generate a global feature representation of the HRDP.

### The trigeminal pathways [^112583RN]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of the trigeminal system in facial and dural sensitivity has been recognized for a long time. More recently, the trigeminal system has also been considered a prominent actor in brain nociceptive innervation. It is the anatomical substrate of several frequent conditions, such as primary or secondary headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and other orofacial pains. Appreciation of the delicate anatomical arrangement of the trigeminal pathway is one of the keys to understanding these conditions' pathophysiology and to proposing innovative treatments. This review provides a structured presentation of existing knowledge about the trigeminal system, from classical anatomical data to the most recent literature. First, we present the organization of the trigeminal pathway from the trigeminal divisions, nerve, and nuclei to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. We describe the neurons and fibers' repartition at each level, depending on the location (somatotopic organization) and the type of receptors (modal organization). Such a dual somatotopic-modal arrangement of the trigeminal fibers is especially clear for the juxtapontine segment of the trigeminal nerve and the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. It has significant clinical consequences both for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we explore how the trigeminal system is modulated and involved in reflexes, for instance the trigemino-cardiac and the trigemino-autonomic reflexes, which could play an essential role in the autonomic symptoms observed in cluster headache. Finally, we present how to interact with this complex system to relieve pain mediated by the trigeminal system. This section covers both neuromodulatory and lesional approaches.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^113u5ztc]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Imaging

TN is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, and as such, neuroimaging and laboratory tests are not mandatory to make a diagnosis. Patients with a characteristic history and a normal neurologic examination other than pain may be treated without further workup. However, modern workup of patients with TN usually includes elective imaging for all patients to exclude secondary causes of TN, such as inflammatory or mass lesions. As computer tomography (CT) is limited in evaluating the brain parenchyma, skull base nerves, and CSF cisterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution sequences at the skull base is usually the modality of choice. According to a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, routine head imaging identifies nonvascular, structural causes of TN in up to 15% of TN patients.

### Postnatal outcome of fetal bradycardia without significant cardiac abnormalities [^1128evZx]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A heart rate < 100 beats/min may be present in 5% of fetuses with arrhythmia. In this study, we sought to define the feasibility of in utero diagnosis of the underlying mechanisms and the postnatal outcome.

Methods

The types of fetal bradycardia were defined by fetal echocardiogram. Fetuses with transient sinus bradycardia were excluded.

Results

From 1995–2000, a total of 18 fetuses were found to have bradycardia. Postnatal 12-lead electrocardiograms made at least 3 times during follow-up confirmed the cardiac rhythm in all except those terminated during pregnancy. Sick sinus bradycardia was noted in 4 patients (22%), of whom 1 had a positive family history and 2 received permanent pacemakers at age 4 and 5 years. Frequent nonconducted atrial premature beats or nonconducted atrial bigeminy or trigeminy were noted in 5 (28%). All of them revealed normal sinus rhythm after birth. Atrioventricular (AV) block was noted in 6 (33%), of whom 3 were terminated due to severe heart failure, and another 2 fetuses received permanent pacemaker implantation soon after birth. Only 1 fetus whose mother showed normal levels of C3 and C4 recovered at late gestation. Most importantly, 3 patients (17%) developed intermittent bradycardia (AV block) and ventricular tachycardia during the fetal stage. They were found to have long QT syndrome. Two of them died during early infancy. One received in utero propranolol and postnatal propranolol and nicorandil with satisfactory control.

Conclusion

The mechanisms responsible for fetal bradycardia were diverse and could be characterized by fetal echocardiography. The prognosis was poor in those with long QT syndrome manifested as intermittent fetal bradycardia and tachycardia with AV dissociation.

### Gender aspects of CGRP in migraine [^115nci19]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

CGRP and migraine

CGRP, a neuropeptide with pleiotropic effects, is involved in different biological processes such as neuromodulation, cardiovascular regulation, inflammation, metabolic function, and aging. Two homolog isoforms have been identified, namely, α-CGRP and β-CGRP. α-CGRP is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide widely distributed throughout the nervous system and predominantly expressed in sensory Aδ- and C-fibers. It is produced by transcription and alternative RNA splicing of the primary transcript of the calcitonin gene. β-CGRP is encoded by a second calcitonin gene, differing by only a single amino acid in rats and by three residues in humans, and predominantly expressed in the enteric nervous system. Considering that the majority of studies focus on α-CGRP, this review will be limited to this isoform, with a focus on the trigeminovascular system because of its relevance in migraine.

Migraine pathophysiology has long been related with activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular system, a functional pathway consisting of pseudounipolar neurons peripherally innervating the cranial vasculature and the dura mater, whose cell bodies are located in the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion, and centrally projecting axons to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and the upper two cervical divisions, known as the trigeminocervical complex. CGRP is highly expressed throughout the trigeminovascular system, it is synthetized in neuronal cell bodies and co-stored with tachykinins (especially substance P) in large granular secretory vesicles. During the headache phase of a migraine attack, CGRP is released in the perivascular space, producing neurogenic vasodilatation and nociceptive transmission.

Different experimental migraine models have focused on the various components of the trigeminovascular system. These models indirectly assess peripheral nociceptors in the dura mater and cranial arteries (i.e. neurogenic dilation of pain-sensitive dural blood vessels) or directly study nociceptive trigeminal fibers. The next sections will review animal and human experimental studies focusing on CGRP in the trigeminovascular system, where sex-related differences have been addressed.

### Electrophysiologic features of fetal ventricular aneurysms and diverticula [^111PDfFn]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital ventricular wall defects are very rare and include congenital ventricular aneurysms (CVAs) and diverticula (CVDs).

Method

We report a series of five fetuses: three with CVAs and two with CVDs referred due to fetal arrhythmia. In addition to routine fetal echocardiography, fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) was used. The literature in CVA and CVD is reviewed.

Results

Incessant premature ventricular contractions (PVC), mainly bigeminy and trigeminy were found in three fetuses with CVAs and in one with CVD, who also had ventricular couplets. The other fetus with CVD, referred because of PVCs, had only sinus tachycardia. ST elevation was noted in two. Fetal movement had a variable impact on PVCs. Postnatal evaluation demonstrated two persistent left ventricular aneurysms and one persistent right CVD; one CVD resolved at 35-week gestation. Two neonates had incessant PVCs. Both arrhythmias resolved spontaneously while being treated with propranolol.

Conclusion

FMCG is complementary to echocardiographic imaging. In fetuses with left ventricular wall defects, additional electrophysiological diagnosis can be made by fMCG, including the complexity of ventricular ectopy, arrhythmic response to fetal movement, presence of ST-T wave abnormalities, and atrial amplitude increases. Prenatal risk factor assessment using fMCG can additionally support post-natal treatment and follow-up.

### Uncommon primary headaches [^1148cei8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The new International Classification of Headache Disorders was recently published by the International Headache Society. Several uncommon primary headaches, including some new clinical entities (e.g. hypnic headache), were included in the section on 'Cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic neuralgias' and 'Other primary headaches'. The recent classification offers an interesting opportunity to evaluate the clinical role and to discuss the mechanisms of some of the more relevant uncommon primary headaches.

Recent Findings

Due to the low incidence of these uncommon headache forms, their diagnostic criteria, pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy are still debated. Differential diagnosis versus secondary headaches is also a crucial issue. In this review, some of the most important uncommon primary headaches are discussed in light of the most recent contributions to the literature.

Summary

The review focuses on the update of the main uncommon primary headaches, intending to clarify some controversial points and to indicate some headlines for further research.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^112p6VfX]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Few authors suggest that sensory deficits are detectable on bedside examination of patients with classical TN, and absence of a sensory deficit is one criterion for the diagnosis of classical TN in the International Classification of Headache Disorders–3-beta. However, subtle sensory abnormalities are often found upon quantitative sensory testing. Clinical deficits of discriminatory sensory functions are highly suspicious of TN caused by a major underlying disease. They occurred in 25 out of 67 patients (37%) with TN secondary to tumors or MS. Consequently, if sensory deficits are found during a routine clinical examination, they should always be followed up with additional investigations under the assumption of secondary TN. It is important to note that the reverse conclusion is not true: absence of a sensory deficit does not rule out secondary TN.

The diagnosis of clinically established TN should prompt treatment implementation and allow enrollment of a patient into a clinical trial. Additional information about the underlying etiology and definite evidence of neuropathic pain may be preferred for pathophysiologic studies.

Does treatment response support the diagnosis of TN?

Frequency-dependent sodium channel blockers that increase the refractory period of action potentials are currently the most effective treatment of TN. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, the first-line recommended medications in many clinical guidelines, reduce pain in approximately 90% of patients. A positive response to these drugs, possibly as a single application of a small dose, might therefore be regarded an operant criterion of TN. However, no standardized criteria or generally accepted rules exist for the definition of satisfactory pain relief (e.g. complete vs partial suppression of pain paroxysms). In addition, it would not be possible to apply a treatment-related criterion to those patients who do not tolerate the side effects of carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Therefore, we decided against the inclusion of treatment response as diagnostic criterion of TN.

Etiologically established TN.

This level of diagnostic certainty, based on identification of a cause for the TN, corresponds to 2 categories: classical and secondary TN are defined by an underlying cause. Both diagnostic entities qualify as definite neuropathic pain. However, in a relatively small proportion of patients with clinically established TN, even the most advanced diagnostic investigations fail to show a cause. This condition is categorized as idiopathic TN (figure 1).

### CGRP release in an experimental human trigeminal pain model [^112NYeog]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

The question remains whether the acute trigeminal pain is a trigger for α-CGRP release also in idiopathic headache disorders. This problem cannot be answered by our experimental study, we can only conclude that severe pain in the first trigeminal branch is a trigger for α-CGRP release in healthy subjects. It might be that this is an unspecific effect. It might also be that in idiopathic headache disorders the pain also initiates α-CGRP release but that this release again increases pain intensity leading to a vicious circle. It should be noted in this context that the α-CGRP level increases by about 100% in migraine or even more in cluster headache as compared to baseline whereas in our study the increase was only about 40%.

There are some limitations to be discussed with respect to this study. First, we did not investigate the second branch which could show different results. Sometimes, in migraine (so-called facial migraine) and in trigemino-autonomic cephalalgias, the second branch is even more affected than the first branch. Also, it would be interesting to observe α-CGRP activation in different phases of a migraine cycle. Second, the subject sample was quite small and very homogenous. It is, however, difficult to find volunteers for such painful studies who never had migraine themselves or in their family; this was also the reason why more male subjects were included than expected from migraine epidemiology. However, we are not aware of sex differences in α-CGRP levels. We first aimed to look into the applicability of the study procedure in order to study other pain locations later. From our results, it seems that this method of pain and α-CGRP measurements is possible and thus presents a model to study the involvement of α-CGRP in human pain processing.

### A review of current perspectives on facial presentations of primary headaches [^114VNv8F]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

One hypothesis for the involvement of the non-V1 dermatome is the initiation and establishment of central sensitization, which leads to the spread of pain beyond the primary region into the lower trigeminal branches, or in some cases even outside the cranium (eg, arm). Alternatively, the neurovascular activation of the V1 branch during certain headache types may lead to coactivation of the adjacent trigeminal branches, which subsequently leads to facial pain. A third possibility is that neurovascular activation occurs in V2 and/or V3 without the involvement of V1. We aim to provide an overview of the facial presentations of primary headache disorders, including their possible pathophysiology, and how to differentiate the "facial pain presentations" of headache disorders from primary facial pain disorders.

### Headache: a striking prodromal and persistent symptom, predictive of COVID-19 clinical evolution [^116G7LPw]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Headache associated with COVID-19 is a frequent symptom, predictive of a shorter COVID-19 duration. A relevant number of patients without a headache history have headache persisting for more than 6 weeks even when other COVID-19 symptoms resolve. Persistent headache often represents a prodromal, difficult to treat and disabling symptom of COVID-19, for which patients may seek medical attention. Efforts in the future will have to focus on better understanding its pathophysiological mechanisms, possibly involving the peripheral activation of the trigeminovascular system by inflammation or a direct role of SARS-CoV-2, in order to provide better care and new therapeutic solutions to patients.

### Machine phenotyping of cluster headache and its response to verapamil [^115xgmdj]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cluster headache is the most common type of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, a class of disorders characterized by recurrent, unilateral attacks of excruciating cranial pain accompanied by prominent, ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Though relatively rare at a population prevalence of 0.2%, the intensity of the pain causes great distress, sometimes to the point of suicidal ideation. A complex interplay of hypothalamic, trigeminovascular and cranial autonomic dysfunction has been posited, but the precise mechanism of causation, and the role of the many molecular and genetic factors implicated in the disorder, remain unknown. The absence of a clear molecular target early in the causal pathway has hindered the development of new agents, limiting treatment options. Crucially, as no treatment response has ever been robustly linked to any clinical or physiological parameter, treatment selection remains heuristic, executable no faster than the weeks-long period of dose escalation needed to evaluate each candidate agent.

Verapamil, the first-line therapy for cluster headache, demands a particularly lengthy evaluation, for the risk of heart block mandates that the high doses typically necessary to produce an effect are reached in incremental steps of at least 14 days. Patients may endure many weeks of excruciating attacks until the dose reached is high enough to indicate an absence of response and another agent can be considered. There is therefore an urgent need for a means of distinguishing those who are likely to respond to first-line therapy from those who will not. In the absence of a known mechanism of causation, it cannot be assumed that the characteristics — both clinical and physiological — on which the distinction depends could be adequately measured by a small number of 'biomarkers'. The consequent obligation to explore a wide array of potential predictive factors has not been previously fulfilled for two reasons: first, because of the lack of mathematical techniques with the power to render the problem computationally tractable; and second, because of the lack of patient cohorts of sufficient size and data quality.

### Myocardial fibrosis and arrhythmic burden in systemic sclerosis [^1122MxTy]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography

All patients underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring with a 3-lead, 24-h Holter monitor (PocketECG, Medicalgorithmics S. A. Warsaw, Poland). Complete traces were assessed for the presence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The number of atrial and ventricular ectopic beats was recorded. Ventricular arrhythmias of interest were ventricular couplets or triplets, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular trigeminy and ventricular tachycardia. Ambulatory ECG data were analysed by one investigator (A.L.G.), blinded to clinical and CMR data.

All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Ethics approval was granted by St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC181/18) and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study data were collected and managed using the REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at The University of Melbourne.

Statistical analyses

Continuous variables are presented as mean (.) or median (inter quartile range). Categorical variables are presented as number (percentage). The paired sample t test or the Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign-rank test was used to compare continuous variables, as appropriate. The χ 2 test was used to compare dichotomous data. The relationship between rhythm abnormalities and myocardial fibrosis was evaluated using linear regression analysis for continuous outcome variables and logistic regression analysis for categorical outcome variables. A p -value of0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Cluster headache [^112Yikxg]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Cluster headache is an excruciating, strictly one-sided pain syndrome with attacks that last between 15 minutes and 180 minutes and that are accompanied by marked ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, such as lacrimation and conjunctival injection. The pain is so severe that female patients describe each attack as worse than childbirth. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in the understanding of the pathophysiological background of cluster headache and has implicated the brain, particularly the hypothalamus, as the generator of both the pain and the autonomic symptoms. Anatomical connections between the hypothalamus and the trigeminovascular system, as well as the parasympathetic nervous system, have also been implicated in cluster headache pathophysiology. The diagnosis of cluster headache involves excluding other primary headaches and secondary headaches and is based primarily on the patient's symptoms. Remarkable progress has been achieved in developing effective treatment options for single cluster attacks and in developing preventive measures, which include pharmacological therapies and neuromodulation.

### Diffuse myocardial fibrosis reduces electrocardiographic voltage measures of left ventricular hypertrophy independent of left ventricular mass [^115J2BhE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Patients

In this cross‐sectional observational study, patients were identified from a prospectively acquired database of 1707 enrolled patients who had undergone a clinically indicated CMR scan at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC; Pittsburgh, PA) between 2010 and 2014. Inclusion criteria were ECG with sinus rhythm with a heart rate < 100 beats/min and an ECG acquired within 30 days of CMR. The study was approved by the UPMC Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were ECG confounders such as previous myocardial infarction (MI) or nonischemic myocardial scar as determined by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR, treatment with digitalis, atrial fibrillation or flutter, bundle branch‐ or fascicular block, abundant premature ventricular contractions (bigeminy/trigeminy), abundant premature atrial contractions, QRS duration > 110 ms, paced rhythm, LV end‐diastolic volume (EDV) index (EDVI) > 120 g/m 2, body mass index (BMI) < 18 or > 30 kg/m 2, previous cardiac surgery, pathologic cardiac stress perfusion CMR, cardiac amyloidosis, severe valvular disease, and significant coronary artery stenosis by invasive angiography.

Based on an alpha of 0.05, power of 0.9, and a minimum detectable correlation coefficient (r) of 0.4, our power calculation 13 resulted in a required sample size of n = 62. In order to provide a margin of error, we set our target sample size at n = 80 patients. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the CMR parameters of LVMI and ECV, as shown in Figure 1, with a target sample size of n = 20 in each group, with as equal contributions of both sexes as possible. Selection of subjects into groups was performed before ECG analysis in order to achieve a study population with a balanced and broad range of ECV and LVMI findings. A total of 77 patients were identified; 20 in 3 groups and 17 in the group with increased ECV and high LVMI, because of a shortage of eligible patients in that group who did not have ECG confounders.

### Fetal atrial flutter: electrophysiology and associations with rhythms involving an accessory pathway [^111ivimK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Nineteen fMCGs were performed on 16 singleton fetuses at 20 to 38 (mean 28) weeks' gestation (Table). One fetus (#16) had Ebstein's anomaly; 1 had an HCN4 channelopathy (#12) with bradycardia; all others had structurally normal hearts. Nine fetuses were on medication at the time of fMCG (Table).

Table 1
Summary of fMCG Results

The observed rhythms and their prevalence are compiled in Table. The rhythms included sinus rhythm, AFl, AVRT, and complex atrial ectopy. AFl showed conduction ratios of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1, and variable conduction in which the ratio cycled between 2:1 and 4:1 in a regular pattern. Complex atrial ectopy showed 2 forms. The most common was premature atrial contractions (PACs) with fixed coupling interval, presumed to be reentrant PACs, which resulted in atrial bigeminy/trigeminy or couplets. The other was conducted PACs with a longer, variable coupling interval, presumed to arise from an automatic focus, which resulted in atrial bigeminy.

Two fetuses (#15 and #16) referred with a diagnosis of AFl showed only sinus rhythm during the fMCG study and another (#14) showed frequent ectopy but no tachycardia. The remaining 13 showed AFl. Two fetuses (#2 and #13) were studied in multiple sessions. An interesting and notable finding is that 4 of 14 fetuses (29%) presented with AFl during the second trimester, including 2 that had brief periods of AFl prior to 22 weeks gestation (#13 and #11).

Nine fetuses showed periods of 4:1 conduction (Figure 1 B) and/or variable conduction that oscillated between 2:1 and 4:1 (Figures 1 C and 3B). In all 7 fetuses with sustained 2:1 and 4:1 AFl, the mean RR interval in 4:1 AFl was less than twice the RR interval in 2:1 AFl, implying that the AFl rate was faster during 4:1 than 2:1 conduction.

Conclusions

The recent recognition of migraine as a debilitating neurological condition is an important advance in directing more resources to the development of new treatments and their deployment to patients. The last two decades have seen a number of important studies in the area of primary headaches leading to an extremely exciting era for researchers interested in this disorder. New treatments are rapidly becoming available for patients and a better understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms is allowing a greater awareness of the complexity of a brain disease which has often been overlooked and under-managed.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^1128F4JD]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal reflex testing and trigeminal evoked potentials — diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) from classic trigeminal neuralgia (CTN): Across studies, trigeminal reflex testing showed sensitivity range 59 to 100% and specificity range 93 to 100%, with pooled sensitivity 94% (95% CI, 91–97) and pooled specificity 87% (95% CI, 77–93). Evoked potentials did not distinguish STN from CTN with high accuracy, with sensitivity 60 to 100% and specificity 49 to 76%, and pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73–92) and pooled specificity 64% (95% CI, 56–71), and many patients with STN had normal evoked potentials while many with CTN had abnormal evoked potentials. Abnormal trigeminal reflexes are probably useful in distinguishing STN from CTN.

### Gender aspects of CGRP in migraine [^114WBo8K]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Migraine is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men, but the mechanisms involved in this gender disparity are still poorly understood. In this respect, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology and, more recently, the functional interactions between ovarian steroid hormones, CGRP and the trigeminovascular system have been recognized and studied in more detail.

Aims

To provide an overview of CGRP studies that have addressed gender differences utilizing animal and human migraine preclinical research models to highlight how the female trigeminovascular system responds differently in the presence of varying ovarian steroid hormones.

Conclusions

Gender differences are evident in migraine. Several studies indicate that fluctuations of ovarian steroid hormone (mainly estrogen) levels modulate CGRP in the trigeminovascular system during different reproductive milestones. Such interactions need to be considered when conducting future animal and human experiments, since these differences may contribute to the development of gender-specific therapies.

### Gender aspects of CGRP in migraine [^112HEfj2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Another non-invasive technique commonly used to study the trigeminal nociceptive system is functional neuroimaging. Within this context, Maleki et al. used high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in male and female migraineurs to determine interictal alterations in brain structures using a thermal pain stressor. Female migraineurs had stronger activation of the spinal trigeminal nucleus compared with male migraineurs and healthy controls. These findings were attributed to differences in sensitivity of the trigeminal system due to hormonal processes, but female participants were studied without assessing the stage of the menstrual cycle.

A further remarkable study recently reported a female migraine patient who had a high-field MRI every day for 30 days, while standardized trigeminal nociceptive stimulation was done during the experiment. It was found that the hypothalamus, depending on the state of the migraine cycle, exhibited an altered functional coupling with the spinal trigeminal nucleus, with the greatest functional coupling in the last 24 h preceding the onset of the migraine attack. Regrettably, the relationship between the stage of the menstrual cycle and the activation of the trigeminal nucleus was not reported in this patient. Using MRI seems a promising tool for detecting cyclic activation of the trigeminovascular system during the different stages of the menstrual cycle, and to the best of our knowledge, these studies have not yet been performed.

Overall, sex-related differences in the trigeminal nociceptive system are evident. Notwithstanding, further experimental research will be required to demonstrate whether the fluctuations of ovarian hormones levels produce: (i) a direct effect on trigeminally innervated blood vessels; (ii) a modulation of prejunctional channels that release CGRP in the dura mater; or (iii) a modulation of trigeminal central pain pathways (Figure 1).

### Compression degree of trigeminal nerve and type of conflicting vessels determine short-and long-term complete pain relief in adult patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia after microvascular decompression: a three-year retrospective study of 200 adult patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia [^116FuGb8]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main clinical manifestation of primary trigeminal neuralgia (PTN) is touch-evoked sudden unilateral transient burning or shock-like paroxysmal or continuous onset of stabbing pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve (TN), which seriously lowers patient's quality-of-life (QOL). Long-term suffering from this refractory excruciating neuralgia may result in sleep disturbance, interference in activities of daily living, anxiety, depression, and even suicide in extreme cases. Multiple known genes and the subsequent ion channels and other downstream products they produce may play a role in the genetic predisposition to PTN. In addition to other unknown etiologies, pathological demyelination along the trigeminal afferent pathway triggered by neurovascular conflict (NVC) with physical compression and morphological changes of TN is the predominant pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanism of PTN, and subsequent activated neuroimmune cells, released inflammatory cytokines, significant molecular changes, channelopathies, and electrophysiological abnormalities pave the way for a generation of ectopic impulses and ephaptic crosstalk. In adult patients with PTN, three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) prior to surgery has demonstrated a better capacity to identify the presence of NVC with nearby specific offending vessels, and thus neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high resolution can be available as a reliable objective imaging predictor of therapeutic responsiveness and outcome to neurosurgical interventions.

The initial standard management of adult patients with PTN is conventional pharmacotherapy with different action mechanisms, either monotherapy or combination therapy. However, up to half of adult patients with PTN require neurosurgical procedures when it is not sufficiently controlled or poorly tolerated with pharmacotherapies. Microvascular decompression (MVD), one of many different neurosurgical procedures, is currently recommended as the first-line neurosurgical option and gold standard for PTN because it is an efficient and secure neurosurgical intervention to directly alleviate or eliminate NVC. Till now, few clinical trials have focused on potential candidates suitable for MVD and short- and long-term complete pain relief (CPR) after sufficient decompression of TN during MVD in adult patients with PTN. To address the above issue, we aimed to explore the demographic and clinical factors that could determine short- and long-term CPR after sufficient decompression of TN during MVD in adult patients with PTN, which will contribute to better characterizing potential candidates suitable for MVD and thus optimizing the planning and implementation of MVD.

### Clinical reasoning: a teenager with right-sided headache and periorbital changes [^111vyJHd]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

While migraine is the most common headache disorder in children and adolescents presenting to a neurologist, other primary headache disorders are important to recognize. Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias represent a rare group of primary headache disorders with different characteristics, workup, and management. In this study, we present an adolescent with 1 common and 1 unique headache phenotype, followed by a guided discussion of the differential diagnoses, workup, treatments, and a brief summary of further management considerations.

### Quality improvement in neurology: headache quality measurement set [^116F2yni]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology Headache Quality Measurement Set — headache is the most frequent reason for a person to seek care from a neurologist and is the fourth leading cause of emergency department visits, with 1.2 million encounters annually in US emergency departments for migraine alone. In population burden, migraine alone affects 12% of the population in any given year; the most severe form, chronic migraine, features a 1% population prevalence and recent estimates demonstrate a total annual societal cost on average for a person with chronic migraine exceeding $8,000 and for episodic migraine approximating $3,000. According to the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study, migraine ranks second among causes of years lived with disability and is the top cause of YLD worldwide among persons aged 15–49 years. For cluster headache, the most common trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, lifetime prevalence is 1 in 1,000 persons, and people with cluster headache are twice as likely to miss work and 3 times as likely to have depression. In 2015, the American Academy of Neurology published the first set of quality measures for headache to provide a standard to measure and improve care for patients with headache disorders.

### Pharmacological opportunities and pitfalls in the therapy of migraine [^11541Bmh]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The mild vasoconstrictor effects of modern antimigraine drugs, such as serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine)1B/D agonists, have led to a search for nonvasoconstrictor approaches to therapy. Such approaches have included substance P (neurokinin I) antagonists, endothelin antagonists and highly specific 5HT1D agonists. All of these substances are effective in animal models and have no significant vasoconstrictive effects. However, all of them failed to demonstrate any antimigraine effects. Current clinical and experimental evidence therefore supports the view that isolated peripheral trigeminal nerve inhibition is insufficient to relieve acute migraine.

### Trigeminal neuralgia (part I): revisiting the clinical phenotype [^1148KAsL]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

We conducted a cross-sectional study to re-examine the clinical profile of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN).

Methods

Inclusion criteria consisted of the International Headache Society's published classification of CTN. For the specific purposes of the study, features such as autonomic signs, persistent background pain, attack durations of > 2 minutes and reports of pain-related awakening were included. The demographic and clinical phenotype of each patient were carefully recorded for analysis.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 81 patients and based on reported attack duration these were divided into short (≤ 2 minutes, n = 61) and long (> 2 minutes, n = 20) groups for further analysis. The group with short attack duration neatly fit most of the criteria for CTN while the long attack group presents a more challenging diagnosis. There were no significant differences in pain severity, quality and location between the short and long attack groups. The frequency of persistent background pain was significantly higher in the long (70%) compared to the short attack group (29.5%, p = 0.001). There were significantly more reports of pain-related awakenings in the long (55%) than in the short attack groups (29.5%, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in the frequency of autonomic signs between the short (21.3%) and long attack groups (40%, p = 0.1). In the short attack group, the presence of autonomic signs was significantly associated with longer disease duration, increased pain-related awakenings, and a reduced prognosis.

Conclusion

There are clear diagnostic criteria for CTN but often patients present with features, such as long pain attacks, that challenge such accepted criteria. In our cohort the clinical phenotype of trigeminal, neuralgiform pain with or without autonomic signs and background pain was observed across both short and long attack groups and the clinical implications of this are discussed.

### Contribution of fetal magnetocardiography to diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of fetal arrhythmia [^112xiq16]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Sinus Bradycardia

Thirty‐four cases were referred for unspecified fetal bradycardia. Four showed a spontaneous return of sinus rhythm.

In 29 (85%) a change in diagnosis was found.

Concerning the change in diagnosis, complex atrial rhythms were found in 5 fetuses, blocked atrial bigeminy (BAB) in another 5, and intermittent AVB in 1. In 9 fetuses, QTc prolongation, related to previously undiagnosed LQTS, was found; torsades was found in 2, both with QRS and T wave alternans (TWA) as well as late premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Fetal demise occurred in these 2 fetuses (de novo LQTS); all others had sinus bradycardia with additional findings such as short PR interval (ectopic atrial rhythm).

Twenty‐five of 34 (73%) also had a change in management, with moderate changes in 17 subjects (50%) and major in 8 (23%) subjects. These changes included closer surveillance and change in prognosis. Concerning the major changes (23%), 3 fetuses were recommended to wean or stop short‐course dexamethasone therapy after an alternate diagnosis (BAB instead of 2° AVB) was found and before SSA results, and 2 fetuses had severe LQTS with torsades and were started on transplacental therapy with magnesium and β‐blockers.

AVB

Fifteen fetuses were referred for what was thought to be SSA negative AVB (14 for 2° AVB, 1 for 3° AVB). Two resolved and were probably either transient AVB or BAB.

Thirteen of 15 fetuses had a change in diagnosis as fMCG showed more precision.

Changes of diagnosis included PVCs (n = 1), severe QTc prolongation with TdP (n = 2), blocked atrial quadrigeminy and trigeminy in 1 fetus each, and finally BAB with ectopy (n = 3). (Figures 2A through 2D, 3A through 3D, 4A and 4B). Twelve fetuses had a change in management of which 9 were major, including closer surveillance and LQTS protocol. In 6 fetuses transplacental management was added (magnesium 3, high‐dose propranolol 2, mexiletine 2, lidocaine 1), 3 had withdrawal of short‐course dexamethasone (pending SSA results). Two fetuses died in utero despite treatment. Both had 2°AVB because of de novo LQTS.

### The role of imaging in the pathophysiology and diagnosis of headache [^114HYBzP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Functional neuroimaging in headache patients has revolutionized our understanding of these syndromes and provided unique insights into some of the most common maladies in humans, suggesting that at least migraine and cluster headache are driven primarily from the brain. This review highlights new studies and recent advances in studying headache using neuroimaging.

Recent Findings

Concerning the diagnostics of headache, an EFNS Task Force evaluated recently the usefulness of imaging procedures in non-acute headache patients on the basis of evidence from the literature and defined guidelines on when to use magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Regarding the pathophysiology of primary headache syndromes, repeated and independent findings reinforce the crucial role for the brainstem in acute and probably also in chronic migraine, and the hypothalamic grey in several trigemino-autonomic headaches. If further studies confirm these findings, a better understanding will be gained of where and how acute and preventive therapy can be targeted.

Summary

Given the rapid advances in functional neuroimaging, in particular newer techniques such as voxel-based morphometry and magnetic resonance spectrometry, functional imaging continues to play a significant role and opens new avenues in targeting the neural substrates in individual primary headache syndromes.

### Headache and facial pain: differential diagnosis and treatment [^111nG9ry]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Headaches affect 90% of the population sometime during their life. Most are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical is necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and to guide the choice of testing to make an accurate diagnosis. The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review. They are divided into primary and secondary headache disorders as classified by the International Headache Society. Primary headache disorders include migraine without and with aura, cluster and tension-type headaches. Secondary headaches are those that occur as a result of some other disorder and include brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

### New insights into headache: an update on functional and structural imaging findings [^1161YfwA]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

One of the most exciting developments in modern neuroscience has been the application of imaging techniques to provide new insights into the organization of the human brain in vivo. Functional imaging methods, such as PET and functional MRI, have become the preferred techniques for detection of the structure-function relationships within the brain that are characteristic of headache. This Review focuses on neuroimaging as a diagnostic tool for headache and highlights the advances made with functional and structural neuroimaging techniques in the study of primary headache syndromes such as migraine and trigeminal autonomic headaches. Several independent functional studies have reinforced the crucial role of the brainstem in acute and chronic migraine and of the hypothalamic area in trigeminal autonomic headaches. Structural abnormalities that have been identified in the visual network of motion-processing areas could account for, or result from, the cortical hyperexcitability observed in patients with migraine. Several morphometric studies suggest that gray matter volume and/or concentration is decreased in pain-transmitting areas in patients with migraine or tension-type headache. Given the rapid advances in functional neuroimaging, this technique will continue to be of paramount importance in patients with headache and might ultimately serve as the bridge between molecular and clinical domains in headache research.

### Headache and non-headache symptoms provoked by nitroglycerin in migraineurs: a human pharmacological triggering study [^114xZVYT]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Given the study design, all subjects had experienced nitroglycerin infusion prior to the randomised part of the study, and this could have impacted on symptom reporting at each subsequent visit following screening. In addition, given the side effects of nitroglycerin, there are potential issues with maintaining the blind in a study of this kind, as subjects may have become aware of what to expect following the active infusion. However, as can be seen from the placebo data, only in a small number of subjects were similar symptoms experienced following placebo infusion and headache ensued in a small proportion, as would be expected with a migraine placebo response. We did our best to maintain the blind within the remits of the study.

In addition, the subject cohort was heterogeneous and included those with and without aura and those on preventive therapy due to recruitment issues. For the purposes of formal comparison of subjects on and not on preventive treatment, we did not have sufficient statistical power in each group to establish whether there would be a triggering rate difference but would like to pursue this as a question going forwards.

A potential issue when using a pharmacological experimental model, in particular with NTG, is the potential for tolerance with repeated exposure to the substance; that is, the possibility that with serial exposure higher doses may be required to provoke headache or other symptoms, and it is possible that to some extent NTG tolerance could explain some of the variabilities in symptom reporting and headache development in this study. In addition, with each repeated visit, there were fewer subjects involved and therefore a subsequent loss in statistical power, and of course that there are several other environmental and lifestyle factors that were not specifically controlled for in this study and could be modulating the migraine threshold and display of symptomatology across the time in between visits. A short note on terminology is apposite. We have referred to the symptoms occurring before the onset of head pain as the premonitory phase. This has been the term of art to be found in the Definition of terms since ICHD-1, which was continued in ICHD-2 and ICHD-3 beta. ICHD-3, apparently addlepated and without data, reversed the terms prodrome and premonitory symptoms in verbage. We take this to be an error, and understand its correction is in hand with the Classification Committee. Since the literature has dominantly used the term premonitory symptom over the last 30 years, we advocate its continued use.

### Deep in the brain: changes in subcortical function immediately preceding a migraine attack [^111TZCRy]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

The neural mechanism responsible for migraine remains unclear. While the role of an external trigger in migraine initiation remains vigorously debated, it is generally assumed that migraineurs display altered brain function between attacks. This idea stems from relatively few brain imaging studies with even fewer studies exploring changes in the 24 h period immediately prior to a migraine attack. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured infra-slow oscillatory activity, regional homogeneity, and connectivity strengths of resting activity in migraineurs directly before (n = 8), after (n = 11), and between migraine attacks (n = 26) and in healthy control subjects (n = 78). Comparisons between controls and each migraine group and between migraine groups were made for each of these measures. Directly prior to a migraine, increased infra-slow oscillatory activity occurred in brainstem and hypothalamic regions that also display altered activity during a migraine itself, that is, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsal pons, and hypothalamus. Furthermore, these midbrain and hypothalamic sites displayed increased connectivity strengths and regional homogeneity directly prior to a migraine. Remarkably, these resting oscillatory and connectivity changes did not occur directly after or between migraine attacks and were significantly different to control subjects. These data provide evidence of altered brainstem and hypothalamic function in the period immediately before a migraine and raise the prospect that such changes contribute to the expression of a migraine attack.

### Headache: a striking prodromal and persistent symptom, predictive of COVID-19 clinical evolution [^1119cdfa]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

It could be interesting for future studies to assess whether a sensitisation of the trigeminovascular system persists once these pathological noxae have resolved, leading to headache persistence and chronification. In this context, it is worth noticing that a relevant proportion of patients without a personal history of headache had persistent headache. This fact makes us wonder whether a post-infectious aetiology may represent, in our clinical practice, an underdiagnosed cause of new daily headache. However, we are aware that to fully assess headache persistence these patients should be followed up for at least 3 months.

This is, at present, the only prospective study conducted on headache and COVID-19. We report the highest proportion of headache observed in literature, which reflects the fact that, for the first time, neurologists, working as general clinicians at the ER, could properly directly assess headache in the acute phase of a viral disease. However, we cannot estimate in our study the real prevalence of headache attributed to COVID-19 since we only included those patients attended by the investigators, who were only a part of the huge number of patients visited at the ER daily during the study period. However, it is important to point out that our results are in line with that of the European COVID-19 cohort, where headache and other COVID-19 symptoms were also directly assessed by clinicians through a structured questionnaire. Our strength is that the neurologists' direct involvement made data collection on previous headache history and headache characteristics more reliable. As for the other limitations, we could not include severe COVID-19 patients due to the impossibility of conducting a full interview, or very mild patients who have gone undiagnosed and were unlikely to come to the ER, our cohort not being representative of the entire spectrum of COVID-19 patients. This fact makes it more difficult to properly assess possible associations between headache and the clinical evolution of COVID-19 in a population different from the hospitalised one. Nevertheless, a more homogeneous group makes our findings more generalisable in this specific group and useful to guide clinicians in case of future new disease peaks. Another limitation is represented by the fact that not all patients could have a confirmed diagnosis through an RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 due to hospital protocols, although all patients in our cohort were highly suspected cases. Moreover, we also have to consider that, as observed in a recent study, the false negative rate with RT-PCR can be high, reaching 29% (36). In addition, we did not investigate secondary causes of headache during disease evolution, making it difficult to exclusively attribute to SARS-CoV-2 possible changes in headache features during the course of COVID-19. Finally, we are also aware that the analysis of inflammatory biomarker evolution during hospitalisation counts on a small sample size. These findings should be further assessed in larger patient groups, although they represent a starting point in hypothesising and studying the link between headache, COVID-19 and IL-6.

### Selective inhibition of meningeal nociceptors by botulinum neurotoxin type A: therapeutic implications for migraine and other pains [^111jsbKx]. Cephalalgia (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine

Migraine is a complex neurological disorder involving multiple sensory pathways, emotional networks, autonomic systems and cortical functions. The pain-related symptoms are similar to those experienced in other pain states and thus fit into a scientific framework generally consistent with the current understanding of chronic pain states. Under normal conditions, pain-sensing organs (and pathways) are designed to be sufficiently sensitive and function as an early warning mechanism for avoidance of potentially harmful stimuli. Under pathological conditions, however, pain-processing systems can change their state in a way that leads to the perception of pain in the absence of a noxious stimulus and consequently provide no benefit to the individual. While central nervous system (CNS) pathologies that predispose an individual to migraine attacks, and factors leading to attack initiation, are not fully elucidated, it is generally believed that some aspects of migraine and some of its associated symptoms reflect abnormal excitability in both central and peripheral neurons.

The trigeminovascular system

The heavily studied trigeminovascular pathway is thought to play a key role in the headache phase of a migraine attack. It consists of (a) first-order sensory neurons of the trigeminal nerve whose axons convey nociceptive information from the face, skull, meninges and intracranial blood vessels; (b) second-order neurons of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, extending between the obex and the upper three segments of the cervical spinal cord, that receive input from the intracranial meninges, occipital region of the head and neck muscles; (c) third-order thalamic neurons; and (d) higher-order neurons in cortical regions that process this information. Relevant to the current study is the notion that intrinsic neuronal hypersensitivity in localized regions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus reflects sensory and nociceptive signals that come from any one of the many organs supplied by meningeal and ophthalmic branches of the trigeminal nerve, and branches of the greater and lesser occipital nerves. These organs include the intracranial meninges and blood vessels, head and neck muscles, and the different layers of the scalp (Figure 1). Physiologically, as in other pain conditions, the clinical manifestation of intrinsic neuronal hyperexcitability include (a) allodynia whereby pain thresholds are lowered so that normally innocuous stimuli become painful, (b) hyperalgesia whereby noxious stimuli produce exaggerated and prolonged pain, and (c) pain that persists long after injury or pain stimulus. Current knowledge supports the view that, like in other chronic pain states, the pathophysiology of chronic migraine and some of its associated clinical symptoms involve peripheral and central sensitization.

### Drug-induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone… [^112Xa2zQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

QTc and methadone daily dose were weakly but significantly correlated. Other observations on the electrocardiogram are depicted: 6 patients presented with torsades de pointes and 3 with bigeminy. QTc values with and without methadone use in 13 patients. QTc values are displayed for each patient receiving methadone treatment and after opioid rotation or discontinuation. The bold dashed line represents the median values. We computed pharmacokinetic interaction scores for different cytochrome P-450 enzymes and for each patient using data on prescribed medications. The following CYP enzymes were analyzed: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. For each patient and each individual cytochrome, a global interaction score was obtained by summing the contributions of the patient's different comedications.

The methadone dose among patients with documented TdP ranged from 40 to 200 mg/d, and the QTc length on the ECG preceding TdP ranged from 0. 43 second½ to
0. 75 second½. In 2 cases, TdP was preceded by ventricular bigeminy. One patient presented bigeminy without documented TdP. Two significant interaction terms in the model indicated that the influence of lower potassium levels was increased at lower prothrombin levels and in the presence of higher CYP3A4 interaction scores. The model including the 4 predictors and their interactions accounted for 31. 8% of QTc variability. The major hepatic enzyme involved in the N-demethylation of methadone is CYP3A4. 25 Inhibition of CYP3A4 has been shown to markedly increase plasma concentrations of a congener of methadone. 26 The predictive value of prothrombin level in our model is also most likely due to a pharmacokinetic effect because severe liver disease has been reported to decrease methadone clearance.

25 Pharmacodynamic interactions were evaluated, and no additional risk for QT interval prolongation could be demonstrated. However, medications known to prolong the QT interval were infrequent in our patient population, and a correlation might be masked by the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors because the substance specificities often overlap. Hypokalemia, the fouth factor in our model, is a well-recognized risk factor for QT prolongation. 2.
