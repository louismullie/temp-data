## Question

Diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosiis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and rigorous exclusion of secondary causes. Then, I should review HRCT technique and pattern classification as the imaging cornerstone. Next, I will map actions to HRCT categories, clarify when to use MDD, BAL, and biopsy, and weigh surgical versus cryobiopsy. After that, I need to examine histopathology criteria and the emerging role of genomic classifiers. Finally, I will integrate probability-based diagnostic confidence and translate endpoints into management implications, including antifibrotic therapy and comorbidity screening, making sure I cross-check each step against guideline standards and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical starting point: in a patient over 60 with progressive exertional dyspnea, bibasilar "Velcro" crackles, and no obvious alternative cause, IPF moves up the differential, but I need to pause and systematically exclude exposures, drugs, rheumatic disease, and familial ILD, and obtain serologies and baseline PFTs including DLCO before labeling disease "idiopathic" because missing a secondary cause changes management entirely [^113U9XXW] [^1178bTX6] [^113U9XXW].

> Next, I should review the imaging protocol, because suboptimal technique can misclassify patterns; wait, let me verify that we are using a high-resolution CT with ≤ 1.5 mm slices, appropriate reconstruction kernels, end-inspiratory scans, and supplemental prone imaging when needed to minimize dependent artifact and maximize detection of subpleural disease, as this quality bar underpins all subsequent decisions [^1144VC7o] [^114qtsha] [^113PdceK].

> I will now examine pattern recognition on HRCT, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about honeycombing until we separate it from paraseptal emphysema and airspace enlargement with fibrosis; radiologists should categorize the study as UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate for UIP, or alternative diagnosis because this classification directs whether tissue sampling is needed and how confident we can be clinically [^112PERpW] [^114fgch3] [^111WQgqx] [^111cvzSR].

> If the HRCT shows a definite UIP pattern in the right clinical context, I should confirm that a surgical lung biopsy would not add value and may cause harm; strong recommendations are against SLB, TBLB, and TBLC here, and there is a conditional recommendation against BAL, so the prudent next step is to proceed to multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) to consolidate a noninvasive diagnosis and exclude mimics before finalizing IPF [^112PERpW] [^116UsWhr] [^115k7VK8].

> For a probable UIP pattern, wait, I should verify risk and pre-test probability before defaulting to biopsy; guidelines conditionally consider SLB after MDD, but the Fleischner perspective and 2022 updates recognize that in an appropriate clinical context we can sometimes make a confident IPF diagnosis without SLB, and BAL can be selectively used to exclude infections or HP rather than to "confirm" IPF per se [^112PERpW] [^115Jtz5k] [^114fgch3] [^113f7aMQ].

> When HRCT is indeterminate for UIP or suggests an alternative diagnosis, I should double-check that additional data will likely change management before pursuing tissue; conditional recommendations support SLB or, when appropriate, TBLC, with the caveat that TBLC has sampling limitations and is more likely to yield probable UIP than definite UIP, and targeted BAL may help rule out infection, malignancy, or HP when the radiology is equivocal [^112PERpW] [^112uHc3D] [^113f7aMQ].

> Let me consider the central role of MDD now; I need to ensure that pulmonology, radiology, and pathology with ILD expertise review the case because MDD improves accuracy and reduces interobserver variability, and then I should assign a diagnostic confidence band (definite, high, low confidence, or low probability) to align subsequent decisions with Bayesian post-test probability rather than binary thinking [^113abwYg] [^113mypiN] [^113zkrzW] [^115k7VK8].

> I should review the role of BAL carefully; hold on, I should verify that in definite UIP on HRCT, BAL is generally avoided, while in probable or indeterminate patterns or suspected alternatives, BAL can be considered to look for lymphocytosis suggestive of HP or NSIP and to exclude infection or malignancy, recognizing that neutrophil or eosinophil elevations are nonspecific and BAL is not diagnostic or prognostic for IPF itself [^116UsWhr] [^113f7aMQ] [^112Udran] [^112gBJ4G].

> Now, about tissue sampling: I need to ensure that SLB is reserved for cases in which diagnostic uncertainty persists and potential results would alter management, while avoiding SLB when HRCT is definite UIP or surgical risk is high; I should verify operative risk, comorbidities, and physiologic reserve because post-operative mortality and morbidity can outweigh benefits in older or frail patients [^112PERpW] [^112mQBaa].

> Turning to histopathology, let me double-check the UIP criteria: patchy dense fibrosis with architectural distortion or honeycombing, subpleural/paraseptal predominance, fibroblast foci, and absence of features suggesting an alternative diagnosis define definite UIP, whereas partial features without alternative explanations define probable UIP; I must correlate pathology with clinical and imaging data, acknowledge TBLC's subpleural sampling limitations, and consider that a genomic classifier from transbronchial samples can support UIP with pooled sensitivity ~68% and specificity ~92%, though this remains an adjunct and not a stand-alone diagnostic substitute [^112uHc3D] [^115UTCMT] [^116M2aHh].

> But wait, what if probable UIP on CT is enough — should I merge it with definite UIP; hmm, wait a minute, the 2022 committee debated merging categories given similar behavior but kept them distinct due to generalizability and overlap with other fibrotic ILDs, and I should also remember that in real-world practice, the PPV of CT probable UIP for histologic UIP may be as low as 38–46%, with notable interobserver variability, so I must not overstate certainty without context and MDD [^114fgch3] [^113bETkA].

> Next, I should review how diagnostic confidence drives treatment; if MDD yields definite IPF or high-confidence IPF, I should initiate antifibrotic therapy such as nintedanib or pirfenidone without delay, screen for and treat comorbidities, assess for pulmonary hypertension with echocardiography when suspected and refer to PH centers if severe or uncertain, consider ILD center referral including transplant evaluation, and note that updated guidance does not support antacid therapy solely to improve respiratory outcomes in unselected IPF, while still treating symptomatic GERD as indicated [^111KDKff] [^112MQjPa] [^111hs38H] [^111QFQeT] [^115rLgmb] [^114HoiS8] [^114Fu67p].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overarching principle to ensure consistency: diagnosing IPF is probabilistic and anchored in high-quality HRCT technique, disciplined exclusion of secondary causes, judicious use of BAL and tissue sampling, and MDD-driven integration to a confidence category that guides therapy and follow-up, recognizing that early detection and standardized imaging protocols improve the chance of a timely, noninvasive, and accurate diagnosis [^113zkrzW] [^113PdceK] [^114qtsha].

---

The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis relies on a **multidisciplinary approach** integrating clinical assessment, HRCT [^1144VC7o], and selective histopathology, with HRCT as the central noninvasive test [^114fGbpw]. A **UIP pattern on HRCT** allows confident diagnosis of IPF without biopsy [^111cvzSR], whereas probable or indeterminate patterns [^113bETkA] require multidisciplinary discussion [^114fgch3] and may require biopsy. BAL is reserved for cases with probable or indeterminate UIP [^113f7aMQ] to exclude alternative diagnoses, and serologic testing helps rule out connective tissue disease [^1178bTX6]. Early, accurate diagnosis enables timely antifibrotic therapy and improves outcomes [^113PdceK] [^111KDKff].

---

## Clinical evaluation

History and physical examination should include a detailed review of **medications and environmental exposures** [^113U9XXW] to exclude known causes of ILD. Common symptoms include progressive dyspnea [^112MQjPa], dry cough, and bibasilar inspiratory crackles. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) typically reveal a **restrictive ventilatory defect** [^116KddEp] with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

---

## Imaging studies

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the **cornerstone** [^111cvzSR] of pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis, providing detailed imaging of the lung parenchyma and enabling identification of characteristic patterns.

- **UIP pattern**: Subpleural, basal-predominant reticulation [^114fGbpw], honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis [^111WQgqx]. A definite UIP pattern on HRCT allows a confident diagnosis of IPF without biopsy [^111cvzSR].

- **Probable UIP pattern**: Similar to UIP but without honeycombing [^114fgch3]. Requires multidisciplinary discussion and may necessitate biopsy [^111cvzSR].

- **Indeterminate pattern**: Non-specific findings requiring further evaluation and often biopsy [^1144VC7o].

- **Alternative diagnosis**: Features suggesting other ILDs, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis [^113XEDap].

---

## Histopathological examination

Histopathological analysis is **essential** [^115UTCMT] when imaging findings are inconclusive or to exclude alternative diagnoses.

- **UIP pattern**: Patchy dense fibrosis with architectural distortion, fibroblast foci [^112uHc3D], and honeycombing. Absence of features suggesting alternative diagnoses [^114SnhKW].

- **Probable UIP**: Similar features [^112uHc3D] but lacking some definitive characteristics of UIP.

- **Indeterminate**: Non-specific fibrosis [^112uHc3D] requiring further clinical correlation.

- **Alternative diagnosis**: Features suggesting other ILDs [^112uHc3D], such as NSIP or hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

---

## Role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)

BAL is **useful** in specific clinical scenarios, particularly when alternative diagnoses such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or infection are suspected [^112Udran]. Indications include **probable UIP**, **indeterminate UIP**, or an alternative diagnosis on HRCT [^113f7aMQ], whereas **contraindications** include a **definite UIP pattern** on HRCT [^116UsWhr].

---

## Serological testing

Serological testing is **recommended** [^1178bTX6] to exclude connective tissue diseases as potential causes of ILD.

---

## Multidisciplinary discussion (MDD)

MDD involving pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists experienced in ILD diagnosis [^113abwYg] is **strongly recommended** to improve diagnostic accuracy and confidence [^115k7VK8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)

The diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of **other known causes** of ILD (environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, drug toxicity) [^116fgYr6], and the presence of a UIP pattern on HRCT or specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy findings [^111cvzSR].

---

## Challenges and limitations

- **Diagnostic delay**: Nonspecific symptoms [^115GQ9Kt] and lack of awareness among primary care physicians contribute to delayed diagnosis [^113hMema].

- **Interobserver variability**: Variability in HRCT and histopathology [^113bETkA] interpretation can affect diagnostic accuracy.

- **Invasive procedures**: Surgical lung biopsy [^112mQBaa] carries risks, particularly in patients with advanced disease or comorbidities.

---

## Emerging diagnostic tools

Genomic classifier testing is an emerging tool [^116M2aHh] with **moderate sensitivity** and **high specificity** for UIP pattern identification [^112uHc3D]. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve **diagnostic accuracy** and reduce interobserver variability in **HRCT interpretation** [^113sj3zJ].

---

The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis requires a **multidisciplinary approach** integrating clinical evaluation, HRCT imaging, histopathological examination, BAL, and serological testing [^113XEDap]. Early and accurate diagnosis is **essential** [^113PdceK] for timely initiation of antifibrotic therapy and improved patient outcomes [^111KDKff].

### Patient registries in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^114VtB7Z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Registries are perhaps the most important source of data on practices in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and will ultimately allow evaluation of temporal trends in diagnostic procedures. For example, surgical lung biopsies have been performed in 13–35% of patients enrolled in registries. In eurIPFreg, 20–30% of patients diagnosed with IPF in 2010–2011 had open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy, but these numbers declined in the following years.

Rates of bronchoscopy and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) vary widely across registries, with analysis of BALF conducted in 85% of patients in eurIPFreg and 62% of patients in INSIGHTS-IPF, whereas bronchoscopy was performed in only about 20% of patients in the Australian IPF registry and a smaller proportion of patients in the IPF-PRO Registry. Data from the INSIGHTS-IPF, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, and IPF-PRO registries suggest that multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) was performed at the enrolling center in 22%, 40%, and 42% of patients, respectively.

It is unclear to what extent diagnoses made without MDD reflect clinicians' belief that MDD was not required to make a diagnosis of IPF in a particular patient, rather than a lack of access to a multidisciplinary team. In the Australian IPF Registry, a central multidisciplinary review was implemented to overcome the paucity of local access to MDD. It should also be noted that there is no standard definition of MDD in the diagnosis of IPF, and different sites/registries may have interpreted "MDD" in very different ways. Interestingly, recent data from the Australian IPF Registry…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ALAT/ATS/ERS/JRS 2018 guidelines recommend eliciting a detailed history of both medication use and environmental exposures at home, work, and other places the patient frequently visits to exclude potential causes of ILD.

### Diagnosis: To biopsy or not to biopsy: Assessing the role of surgical lung biopsy in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113mypiN]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disorder associated with a poorer prognosis than subacute idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). IPF can be differentiated from other IIPs based on its histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Although a surgical lung biopsy specimen showing a UIP pattern is required for the definitive diagnosis of IPF, clinical criteria can be used in the absence of a lung biopsy specimen to make a likely diagnosis of IPF.

The predictive value of these criteria largely depends on the expertise of the clinician and radiologist, but considerable interobserver variability exists even when evaluations are performed by experts in the field. Moreover, these criteria lead to misdiagnosis in about 25 to 35% of cases. Interobserver variability is reduced and diagnostic accuracy is improved in cases where a diagnosis is made with a high degree of confidence. Diagnostic accuracy is also higher when the diagnosis is made by a core group of experts rather than by a referring center.

The decision on whether or not to perform a surgical lung biopsy is difficult. It is clearly indicated in cases where clinical or radiologic findings are atypical or when the diagnosis is made with a low degree of certainty.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^11499ph9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Some believe that the opinion of experts in the field is driven by their understanding of the clinical problem and their accurate interpretation of the underlying literature; therefore, such recommendations may be considered, in effect, evidence-based. This approach has gone wrong on many occasions. Using a transparent and structured process in guideline development not only mandates a linkage of evidence to recommendation development but also ensures this linkage is explicit and systematically demonstrated. In effect, this helps to limit the potential for bias.

Guideline panel members may have strong opinions or academic bias surrounding a specific area in which they have clinical expertise, or they may have other biases related to interactions with academic colleagues or industry partners. In an attempt to address this, GRADE requires systematic or pragmatic searches of the literature and the production of evidence summaries, such as evidence profiles, ideally based on pooled treatment effects and produced by panel members without conflict of interest (COI) or independent methodologists. The latter helps to ensure a fair and reproducible assessment of the literature addressing a specific clinical question.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114fgch3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

There are several reasons why merging the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and probable UIP categories was considered: 1) Increasing evidence shows that patients with the probable UIP pattern and UIP pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have similar disease behavior and clinical courses; 2) The likelihood of histologic confirmation of UIP in patients with the probable UIP pattern ranges from 80% to 85%; and 3) In the appropriate clinical context, histopathological confirmation of the UIP pattern is not required to ascertain the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in patients with either the probable UIP pattern or the UIP pattern.

Despite these reasons, the guideline committee opted to maintain the differentiation between the two patterns for several reasons: 1) Studies describing the correlation of probable UIP with histopathological UIP are from expert settings, and correlation in alternative settings is unknown; 2) There is evidence suggesting that patients with probable UIP might have better survival; 3) The predictive value of the probable UIP CT pattern for histologic UIP is slightly lower than for the UIP CT pattern, suggesting that the probable UIP CT pattern may show more overlap with other fibrotic lung diseases such as fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP); and 4) There is evidence that the predictive value of a probable UIP pattern for histologic UIP is lower in individuals with relatively mild fibrosis and in younger individuals. Although the UIP pattern and probable UIP pattern remain separate, the diagnostic approaches for these entities are suggested.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ALAT/ATS/ERS/JRS 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring multidisciplinary discussion between pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists experienced in the diagnosis of ILD to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of IPF.

### Integrating clinical probability into the diagnostic approach to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: An international working group perspective [^113zkrzW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

When considering the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), experienced clinicians integrate clinical features that help differentiate IPF from other fibrosing interstitial lung diseases, thus generating a "pre-test" probability of IPF. The aim of this international working group perspective was to summarize these features using a tabulated approach similar to chest HRCT and histopathologic patterns reported in the international guidelines for the diagnosis of IPF, and to help formally incorporate these clinical likelihoods into diagnostic reasoning to facilitate the diagnosis of IPF.

- **Methods**: The committee group identified factors that influence the clinical likelihood of a diagnosis of IPF. This was categorized as a pre-test clinical probability of IPF into "high" (70–100%), "intermediate" (30–70%), or "low" (0–30%). After integrating radiological and histopathological features, the post-test probability of diagnosis was categorized into "definite" (90–100%), "high confidence" (70–89%), "low confidence" (51–69%), or "low" (0–50%) probability of IPF.

- **Findings**: A conceptual Bayesian framework was created, integrating the clinical likelihood of IPF ("pre-test probability of IPF") with the HRCT pattern, the histopathology pattern when available, and/or the pattern of observed disease behavior, into a "post-test probability of IPF". The diagnostic probability of IPF was expressed using an adapted diagnostic ontology for fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.

- **Interpretation**: The present approach will help incorporate clinical judgment into the diagnostic process, thus enhancing the accuracy and reliability of diagnosing IPF.

### Bronchoalveolar lavage in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: What does it tell us [^112gBJ4G]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has only a limited role in the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A finding of raised neutrophils (> 5%) and eosinophils (> 2%) is characteristic but not diagnostic of IPF. BAL cell count does not clearly differentiate between fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia and IPF, either diagnostically or prognostically. BAL in IPF should be considered in all patients with suspected infection, malignancy, or acute exacerbations. In such cases, it may be diagnostic. Due to few and conflicting results, BAL fluid analysis has very little clinical relevance in determining prognosis and response to treatment in IPF.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^111yQ7Hm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis is based on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and biopsy patterns, developed through consensus by discussion. "Clinically suspected of having IPF" is defined as unexplained patterns of bilateral pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiography or chest computed tomography, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and age > 60 years.

- **Middle-aged adults**: Over 40 and 50 years old, or a woman over 60 years old, present with extensive (> 30%) reticulation on HRCT and age > 70 years.
- **Increased neutrophils and/or absence of lymphocytosis in BAL fluid**: This observation is critical for diagnosis.
- **Multidisciplinary discussion**: Produces a confident diagnosis of IPF.

- **Indeterminate for IPF**:
	- **Without an adequate biopsy**: Remains indeterminate.
	- **With an adequate biopsy**: May be reclassified to a more specific diagnosis after multidisciplinary discussion and/or additional consultation.

### ESR essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European Society of Thoracic Imaging [^113PdceK]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients with clinico-functional suspicion of pulmonary fibrosis, as well as those at high risk due to predisposing diseases or family history, should undergo a chest CT with high-resolution technique to identify as early as possible signs of lung fibrosis. Fibrotic lung diseases may show progressive behavior, leading to reduced survival. Thus, early diagnosis is crucial to grant prompt antifibrotic treatment. Radiologists have a pivotal role not only in the early identification and non-invasive diagnosis of fibrosis but also in the evaluation of disease progression and complications. Interdisciplinary cooperation with pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and pathologists is mandatory for accurate patient management.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112PERpW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This document provides clinical recommendations for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It represents a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Society.

- **Methods**: The evidence syntheses were discussed and recommendations formulated by a multidisciplinary committee of IPF experts. The evidence was appraised and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

- **Results**: The guideline panel updated the diagnostic criteria for IPF. Previously defined patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were refined to patterns of UIP, probable UIP, indeterminate, and alternate diagnosis. For patients with newly detected interstitial lung disease (ILD) who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of probable UIP, indeterminate, or an alternative diagnosis, conditional recommendations were made for performing BAL and surgical lung biopsy; because of lack of evidence, no recommendation was made for, or against performing transbronchial lung biopsy or lung cryobiopsy. In contrast, for patients with newly detected ILD who have a high-resolution computed tomography scan pattern of UIP, strong recommendations were made against performing surgical lung biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, and lung cryobiopsy, and a conditional recommendation was made against performing BAL. Additional recommendations included a conditional recommendation for multidiscipline collaboration.

### The 2018 diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis guidelines: Surgical lung biopsy for radiological pattern of probable usual interstitial pneumonia is not mandatory [^115Jtz5k]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The radiological patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) described in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines are similar to those described in a statement from the Fleischner Society; however, the two documents seemingly make different recommendations about whether to perform surgical lung biopsy (SLB) in patients with the radiological probable UIP pattern by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Specifically, the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines make a conditional recommendation for SLB after multidisciplinary discussions (MDDs), whereas the Fleischner Society statement indicates that a confident diagnosis of IPF can be made without SLB in the right clinical context. This reflects differences in methodology and terminology rather than any substantive difference in principles and recommended practices.

It is apparent that the recommendations in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines are subject to misinterpretation as a mandate for SLB in patients with probable UIP. Avoiding this misinterpretation is precisely why the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendation was assigned a strength of "conditional", a grading option that was not available to the authors of the Fleischner Society statement. A conditional recommendation conveys that the course of action is appropriate for most patients but may not be appropriate for a sizeable minority of patients. The guideline panel anticipated that among patients who meet HRCT criteria for probable UIP, there will be a spectrum of suspicion for IPF ranging from high to low depending on the clinical context.

### The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Current and future approaches [^112wy7iA]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

With the recent development of two effective treatments for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an accurate diagnosis is crucial. The traditional approach to diagnosis emphasizes the importance of thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations to exclude secondary causes of the disease. High-resolution CT is a critical initial diagnostic test and acts as a tool to identify patients who should undergo surgical lung biopsy to secure a definitive histological diagnosis of the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern.

This diagnostic approach faces several challenges. Many patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis present with atypical high-resolution CT characteristics but are unfit for surgical lung biopsy, thereby preventing a confident diagnosis. An iterative, multidisciplinary process that incorporates available clinical, laboratory, imaging, and histological features is suggested. Recent research has explored genomic techniques to molecularly phenotype patients with interstitial lung disease.

In the future, clinicians will probably use blood-specific or lung-specific molecular markers in combination with other clinical, physiological, and imaging features to enhance diagnostic efforts, refine prognostic recommendations, and influence initial or subsequent treatment options. There is an urgent and increasing need for well-designed, large, prospective studies measuring the effect of different diagnostic approaches, which will ultimately help to inform the development of guidelines and tailor clinical practice for the benefit of patients.

### Histopathologic assessment of suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Where we are and where we need to go [^115UTCMT]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) requires a multidisciplinary approach, including clinical, radiologic, and often pathologic assessment. In 2018, the American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, the Latin American Thoracic Society (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT), and the Fleischner Society each published guidelines for the diagnosis of IPF, which include criteria for four categories of confidence concerning a histologic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern.

- **Objective**: To identify the role of the guidelines in the pathologic assessment of UIP, analyze the four guideline categories — including potential areas of difficulty, and determine steps the Pulmonary Pathology Society and the broader pulmonary pathology community can take to improve guideline criteria and histopathologic diagnosis of interstitial lung disease.

- **Data Sources**: Data were derived from the guidelines, published literature, and clinical experience.

- **Conclusions**: Both guidelines provide pathologists with a tool to communicate to the clinician the likelihood that a biopsy represents UIP and serve as an adjunct, not a replacement, for traditional histologic diagnosis. There are multiple challenges with implementing the guidelines, including a lack of clarity on the quantity and quality of histologic findings required, a lack of recognition that histologic features cannot be assessed independently, and a lack of guidance on how pathologists should incorporate clinical and radiographic information.

### 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^115rLgmb]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines discuss medical management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, especially in relation to pulmonary hypertension. The guidelines recommend optimizing the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and, where indicated, addressing hypoxemia, sleep-disordered breathing, and/or alveolar hypoventilation in patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension.

### Re-evaluation of diagnostic parameters is crucial for obtaining accurate data on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111Yyx45]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In order to systematically evaluate the nationwide prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in different geographical areas, we narrowed the study population to five university hospital cities and their populations at the end of the year 2012. The university hospitals represent tertiary hospitals, the most specialized level of public health care. All IPF patients who gave informed consent and lived during 2012 in the university hospital cities of Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, Kuopio, or Oulu were included. In Finland, patients are referred to specialist centers according to their living address, and practically all IPF patients are initially evaluated in the public health care system.

The patient registries of the five university hospitals were screened for the ICD-10 diagnosis codes J84.1 (other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis) and J84.9 (interstitial pulmonary disease). The diagnostic criteria of the ATS/ERS statement from 2011 were used. An experienced pulmonary physician re-evaluated the patients' data by reviewing the patient charts. It was found that 70–80% of patients' diagnoses did not meet the clinical criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The disqualified cases were other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP), most commonly NSIPs (non-specific interstitial pneumonias).

### An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline: Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An update of the 2011 clinical practice guideline [^112wsGeZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

This document updates the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association guideline on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment.

- **Methods**: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize all available evidence pertinent to our questions. The evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied, and recommendations were formulated, written, and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists.

- **Results**: After considering the confidence in effect estimates, the importance of outcomes studied, desirable and undesirable consequences of treatment, cost, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention, and implications to health equity, recommendations were made for, or against specific treatment interventions.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations in favor of or against treatment interventions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^111WQgqx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The radiological features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which are the hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), were described in detail in the 2018 guidelines for the diagnosis of IPF. The guideline committee concluded that several radiological features warrant reiteration in the guideline for emphasis, and they reconsidered the categories of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) patterns.

Lung fibrosis is confidently recognized when traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis (Figure 1) and/or honeycombing (Figure 2) are identified. Honeycombing must be distinguished from paraseptal emphysema (Figure 3) and airspace enlargement with fibrosis (Figure 4). Pathologic–computed tomography correlations have demonstrated that honeycombing and traction bronchiolectasis are closely related. Honeycombing corresponds to bronchiolar cysts, developed after collapse of fibrotic alveolar septa and dilatation of terminal airways. The cystic structures sometimes can be followed throughout the lobular core and seem to be connected with each other and are in continuity with the bronchial tree.

Honeycombing cysts consist of both dilatation of peripheral airspaces due to surrounding alveolar septal fibrosis and tangentially viewed traction bronchiolectasis. HRCT findings typical of UIP and honeycombing on HRCT correlate best with bronchiolectasis histologically. Recent observations have underlined that in IPF, the remodeling process appears to be a continuum from traction bronchiectasis to honeycombing.

### ESR essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European Society of Thoracic Imaging [^114fGbpw]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

CT with high-resolution technique is the recommended imaging modality to correctly recognize signs, patterns, and distribution of pulmonary fibrosis. A systematic interpretation of the CT pattern according to international guidelines leads to a non-invasive, accurate diagnosis of fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs) or helps narrow down the differential diagnosis in the context of interdisciplinary discussion. Biopsy is recommended in indeterminate and discordant cases.

FLDs may show progressive behavior and reduced survival, and individuals with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) might also be at increased risk of disease progression. The major task is to detect these subjects and direct them to the correct management. Early diagnosis of fibrosis and prompt identification of disease progression are crucial to grant antifibrotic treatment to patients showing a progressive phenotype. FLD patients may also develop complications such as acute exacerbations (AEs), which are commonly associated with a worsening prognosis.

In this field, radiologists play a pivotal role. Careful comparison with previous CT examinations is essential to assess progression and complications. The use of reconstructions to provide information on fibrosis distribution, change in pattern, and increased extent of lung fibrosis should be recommended. Final diagnosis and therapeutic decisions should be achieved in collaboration with pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and pathologists, working together to improve FLD patients' management.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Early detection and referral [^114HoiS8]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) with no known cause or cure, is the most common and deadly of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. With a median survival of 3–5 years following diagnosis, IPF is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function and quality of life in most patients. Vigilance among clinicians in recognizing IPF early in the disease course remains critical to properly caring for these patients, as this provides the widest range of management options.

When IPF is suspected, a multidisciplinary evaluation (MDE) by a clinician, radiologist and pathologist with ILD expertise should occur, as this improves diagnostic agreement in both community and academic settings. When community MDE is not possible, or diagnostic doubt exists, referral to an ILD center should be considered. ILD center referral may also provide access to specialized care, including clinical trials and lung transplantation, and should be considered for any patient with an established diagnosis of IPF.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^113XEDap]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An international, multidisciplinary committee of experts described radiological and histopathological features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), diagnostic testing for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in IPF. The committee also defined progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF); described the physiological, radiological, and histopathological features of PPF; and addressed antifibrotic treatment of PPF. Two specific questions pertaining to the diagnosis of IPF, two specific questions pertaining to the treatment of IPF, and two specific questions pertaining to pharmacotherapy for PPF were answered with evidence-based, graded recommendations.

These recommendations are not mandates, as they cannot account for all unique clinical circumstances, and they should be revisited as new evidence is published. This guideline was reviewed by the ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee; it was determined that none of the recommendations are appropriate targets for performance measures.

### Practical application and validation of the 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT and Fleischner Society guidelines for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113bETkA]. Respiratory research (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is essential to inform prognosis and treatment. In 2018, the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT and Fleischner Society released new diagnostic guidelines for usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP)/IPF, adding Probable UIP as a CT category based on prior studies demonstrating this category had relatively high positive predictive value (PPV) for histopathologic UIP/Probable UIP. This study applies the 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT and Fleischner Society guidelines to determine test characteristics of CT categories in academic clinical practice.

Methods

CT and histopathology were evaluated by three thoracic radiologists and two thoracic pathologists. Comparison of consensus categorization by the 2018 ATS and Fleischner Society guidelines by CT and histopathology was performed.

Results

Of patients with CT UIP, 87% (PPV, 95% CI: 60–98%) had histopathologic UIP with 97% (CI: 90–100%) specificity. Of patients with CT Probable UIP, 38% (PPV, CI: 14–68%) had histopathologic UIP and 46% (PPV, CI: 19–75%) had either histopathologic UIP or Probable UIP, with 88% (CI: 77–95%) specificity. Patients with CT Indeterminate and Alternative Diagnosis had histopathologic UIP in 27% (PPV, CI: 6–61%) and 21% (PPV, CI: 11–33%) of cases with specificities of 90% (CI: 80–96%) and 25% (CI: 16–37%). Interobserver variability (kappa) between radiologists ranged 0.32–0.81.

Conclusions

CT UIP and Probable UIP have high specificity for histopathologic UIP, and CT UIP has high PPV for histopathologic UIP. PPV of CT Probable UIP was 46% for combined histopath

Chest CT with a high-resolution technique is the recommended imaging modality to correctly recognize signs, patterns, and distribution of pulmonary fibrosis. A slice thickness of ≤ 1.5 mm and a high-resolution reconstruction algorithm are basic requirements for a high-quality technique (Level of evidence: low). The accurate interpretation of CT patterns, combined with clinical and laboratory data, often leads to a non-invasive diagnosis of specific fibrotic lung diseases (FLDs). Biopsy is recommended for cases with indeterminate radiologic-clinical features or in situations that impact therapeutic decision-making (Level of evidence: low). FLDs may show progressive behavior and reduced survival. An early diagnosis of fibrosis and prompt identification of disease progression are crucial for starting antifibrotic treatment for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as well as for non-IPF patients showing a progressive phenotype (Level of evidence: low). Careful comparison with previous CT examinations is essential to assess progression.

### Focus on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Advancing approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^1113RatU]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause that is associated with substantial health-care utilization and high rates of mortality. The clinical symptoms of IPF are nonspecific and overlap with many pulmonary and cardiac diseases, making differential diagnosis challenging. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) guidelines strongly recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases; however, there are several limitations to the feasibility of this approach in clinical practice.

Although early diagnosis is relevant to any chronic, progressive, and irreversible disorder, it is crucially important that effective treatments for IPF are prescribed without delay since a window of opportunity may exist during which time treatment can have optimal outcomes. Evidence on the clinical management of IPF is rapidly evolving, and key updates were made to the most recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. The widely used combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine has now been associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death compared with placebo in patients with IPF.

These treatments and others for IPF have been mostly supportive, but recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib have demonstrated efficacy in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management [^114AtRGF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines summarize the available evidence using a comprehensive literature research approach and provide unbiased recommendations reflecting this evidence. However, this emphasis on methodology eventually results in a lack of practicability and guidance in areas with a dearth of evidence. The empirical approach based on expert advice can provide guidance, especially in areas with little or no formal evidence, but is vulnerable to biased recommendations. Thus, both approaches may adversely affect patients. A synthesis of these potentially complementary approaches seems appropriate to provide optimal guidance in the treatment of all patients.

### What causes cough in pulmonary fibrosis, and how should we treat it [^113rqQ5N]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cough is a common and challenging symptom in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, significantly impacting their quality of life. The pathophysiology of cough in pulmonary fibrosis is complex and involves several mechanisms. An increased understanding of these mechanisms has led to the development of effective treatments aimed at managing this debilitating symptom.

- **Current treatments**: Traditional therapies include antitussives and neuromodulators that have shown variable efficacy. However, recent advancements in targeted therapies offer promising results in managing pulmonary fibrosis-related cough.

- **Emerging therapies**: Molecular and genetic research have paved the way for novel treatment strategies, focusing on reducing inflammation and targeting fibrosis pathways. Clinical trials continue to explore these innovative approaches, aiming to improve patient outcomes.

Understanding the biopsychosocial aspects of cough in pulmonary fibrosis is critical for developing comprehensive management plans. It is essential for healthcare providers to stay abreast of the latest research and treatment options to provide optimal care for their patients.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: An official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^116YtoiG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Tertiary prevention strategies that focus on established pulmonary fibrosis have had limited impact on the morbidity and mortality associated with ILD. Identifying individuals before the onset of clinically evident lung fibrosis, i.e. when findings qualify as ILA, provides an opportunity to intervene before the lung is extensively and irreversibly scarred, i.e. primary and secondary prevention if effective and well-tolerated treatments can be identified.

This document presents a comprehensive literature review of ILAs that supports updates to the previous ILA definition made by the Fleischner Society, establishes a working definition of ILD, and provides evidence-based suggestions for the evaluation and management of ILAs. Together, these advances will improve clinical care and support future research by standardizing the approach to ILAs. In addition, this document highlights important unanswered questions, providing a direction for future initiatives while emphasizing the need to identify treatment options for ILA.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management [^117Dy9pi]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The art of clinical decision-making

As indicated by Rochwerg et al, evidence-based guidelines provide a comprehensive summary of the available evidence and a transparent process leading to recommendations not biased by personal experiences or opinions of individual experts. The strength of the GRADE methodology used in this process lies in the systematic and pragmatic literature search, which leads to an unbiased overview of the available evidence on a given topic. Its shortcoming is the fact that the methodology tends to exclude any clinical experience and common sense not supported by formal evidence from well-designed clinical trials, as succinctly discussed by Wells. This approach eventually leads to recommendations that lack practicability, as exemplified in the diagnostic algorithm of the IPF guideline, which foresees a surgical lung biopsy for patients with a non-informative HRCT. However, this procedure cannot be performed in a large portion of these patients due to disease severity, comorbidities, or cost. Consequently, a significant number of patients remain without a diagnosis or treatment.

This differentiation has gained significance since the recent approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone, as the issue of whether these drugs should also be used in probable and possible IPF remains unresolved. While possible IPF patients were included in the INPULSIS trials with nintedanib, only definite IPF patients were allowed in the ASCEND trial with pirfenidone. However, neither of these studies has led to a definite solution.

Three distinct patterns of pulmonary fibrosis, including usual interstitial pneumonia, fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and airway-centered fibrosis, can be identified on surgical lung biopsies.

- **Objectives**: To compare the pathologic definitions, clinical and radiographic presentations, etiologies and differential diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses of usual interstitial pneumonia, fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and airway-centered fibrosis patterns, and to address the challenges and controversies related to pulmonary fibrosis.

- **Data sources**: Data were derived from published literature and clinical experience.

- **Conclusions**: Although there may be overlap, identification of the dominant form of fibrosis in a particular case can provide a general category of disease and assist in identifying an etiology.

The committee asked, "Should genomic classifier testing be performed for the purpose of diagnosing UIP in patients with ILD of undetermined type who are undergoing transbronchial forceps biopsy?" The systematic review that informed the committee's recommendation is published independently; we summarize the salient findings. Diagnostic test characteristics were rated as critical outcomes, while diagnostic agreement, diagnostic confidence, and the adverse consequences of misclassification were rated as important outcomes.

The systematic review identified four relevant studies, which included a total of 195 patients with ILD of unknown type. All of the studies were accuracy studies. Two of the studies also measured agreement in the categorization of UIP and non-UIP when a genomic classifier was or was not used, as well as diagnostic confidence before and after the use of a genomic classifier.

All four studies reported diagnostic test characteristics of genomic classifier testing and were included in a meta-analysis. The individual studies reported sensitivity ranging from 59% to 80% and specificity ranging from 78% to 100% using histopathological diagnosis from samples obtained by SLB, TBLC, or MDD as the reference standard. When aggregated by meta-analysis, genomic classifier testing identified the UIP pattern with sensitivity and specificity of 68% and 92%, respectively, in patients with ILD of unknown type.

Two studies reported diagnostic agreement and confidence. Multidisciplinary teams evaluated anonymized clinical information and radiology data to ascertain the level of agreement and confidence in diagnosis when using genomic classifiers.

### Patient characteristics and survival for progressive pulmonary fibrosis using different definitions [^116Xyr1Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) exhibit heterogeneous disease courses, with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) being the prototypic subtype with a mean survival of four years. A large proportion of patients with non-IPF fibrotic ILD have similar courses and nearly identical therapeutic responses to antifibrotic therapy compared with patients with IPF. These patients are now labeled as having progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF); however, its optimal definition remains uncertain. Different thresholds and combinations of symptom, physiological, and radiological criteria, with varying observation durations, have been used to define PPF in clinical trials and a recent clinical practice guideline.

In this multicenter cohort study, we examined the characteristics of patients with PPF according to recent guidelines and clinical trials. We compared their survival with that of patients with IPF, hypothesizing that patient characteristics and survival would vary across definitions of PPF. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis — a systematic review on methodology for the collection of epidemiological data [^1141YZCU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostics and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are currently undergoing changes. In the most recent guidelines, the diagnostic criteria of IPF are defined more accurately than they have been previously. Simultaneously, IPF treatment is undergoing the biggest shift in its history; the first drug intended for the prevention of IPF progression, pirfenidone, is entering clinical use in Europe, Canada, and Asia. In addition, an interim publication of the PANTHER trial revealed that the commonly used triple-drug treatment — namely prednisolone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine — may be harmful to IPF patients, since compared to those who received placebo, individuals receiving triple-drug therapy had increased mortality.

Epidemiological data of IPF are sparse. Moreover, changes in the classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) and diagnostics make the comparison of data from various decades difficult. Until the 1990s, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis covered a heterogeneous group of different interstitial diseases. The ATS/ERS consensus statement on diagnosis and treatment in 2000 and the classification of IIPs in 2002 defined IPF more accurately than it had been previously. In the new guideline, radiological and histological criteria of UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) are defined more precisely: if high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features reveal a typical UIP pattern, IPF can be diagnosed without histological analysis. Conversely, if HRCT features show either possible UIP or no UIP features, a surgical lung biopsy should be considered.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, specifically concerning diagnosis, the 2011 guidelines from ALAT/ATS/ERS/JRS recommend establishing the diagnosis of IPF based on the following criteria:

- **Exclusion of other known causes of ILD**: This includes domestic and occupational environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and drug toxicity.

- **Presence of a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on HRCT**: This criterion applies to patients not subjected to a surgical lung biopsy.

- **Specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy pattern**: This applies to patients subjected to a surgical lung biopsy.

### Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease: Clinical uncertainties, consensus recommendations, and research priorities [^115kM7dR]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Within the spectrum of fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is a subset of patients who experience inexorable progression of pulmonary fibrosis despite treatment, which is known as the progressive fibrotic phenotype. Although the concept of progressive fibrosing ILD has been applied largely to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), there is now an increasing focus on irreversible progressive fibrosis in a proportion of patients with a range of underlying ILD diagnoses. Evidence has emerged to support a possible role for antifibrotic therapy in these patients.

In this position paper, the importance of retaining diagnostic scrutiny within the multidisciplinary team is discussed, and a multidomain definition for progressive fibrosis is suggested. The potential role of antifibrotic drugs as second-line therapy in the treatment algorithm for patients with progressive non-IPF ILD is considered. Risk factors that might predispose individuals to developing progressive fibrosis are highlighted. Finally, key uncertainties and future directions for research and clinical practice are discussed.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112uHc3D]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The histopathological criteria that characterize UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) and probable UIP were reviewed and confirmed. A diagnosis of UIP made by biopsy is predicated on a combination of the following: 1) patchy dense fibrosis with architectural distortion (i.e. destructive scarring and/or honeycombing); 2) a predilection for subpleural and paraseptal lung parenchyma; 3) fibroblast foci; and 4) the absence of features that suggest an alternative diagnosis. When all of these features are present, a UIP pattern can be established with confidence. "Probable UIP" refers to biopsies in which some of these findings are present in the absence of features to suggest an alternative diagnosis.

The committee concluded that the evolving use of TBLC (transbronchial lung cryobiopsy) merits commentary. Application of the histopathological criteria for UIP is more challenging with TBLC specimens because 1) the subpleural predominance of pathologic changes may not be readily appreciated and 2) the potential for sampling error results in less confident exclusion of features that may suggest an alternative diagnosis. Compared with surgical lung biopsy (SLB), TBLC is more likely to demonstrate a probable UIP pattern than a definite UIP pattern given the limited sampling of subpleural lung parenchyma in most cases. Nevertheless, a combination of patchy fibrosis, fibroblast foci, and the absence of features to suggest an alternative diagnosis is usually sufficient to establish a probable UIP pattern on TBLC.

Combining UIP and probable UIP patterns in the context of multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) results in confidently establishing the diagnosis.

### Significance of bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112Udran]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

According to the 2002 ATS/ERS Consensus Classification, a confident diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) without a surgical lung biopsy is made with consistent clinical/physiological findings and the typical features on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and/or transbronchial biopsy, one of four major criteria in the 2000 ATS/ERS IPF Statement, was no longer essential in the diagnostic algorithm of the 2002 ATS/ERS Consensus Classification.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the additional utility of BAL for the diagnosis of IPF.

- **Methods**: A total of 101 patients with suspected IPF on HRCT were studied. Twenty-seven patients were excluded due to lack of functional impairment (n = 20), an underlying condition causing fibrosis (n = 5), or a clinical history inconsistent with IPF (n = 2). The remaining 74 patients met all the criteria recommended in the 2002 ATS/ERS Consensus Classification for making a diagnosis in the absence of surgical biopsy. The final diagnosis was made with further examinations, including pathological analysis, in patients who showed inconsistent findings for IPF on BAL.

- **Measurements and main results**: A cut-off level of 30% for lymphocytes in BAL demonstrated a favorable discriminative power for the diagnosis of IPF. Six of the 74 patients (8%) showed a lymphocytosis of 30% or greater in BAL. Their final diagnoses were idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (n = 3) and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (n = 3). The change in perception of the diagnosis was validated by a surgical biopsy in two cases and…

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112MQjPa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause that is associated with radiological and histologic features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). It occurs primarily in older adults and is characterized by progressive worsening of dyspnea and lung function; it has a poor prognosis. Diagnosis and management of IPF were addressed in prior guidelines. A formal American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) proposal process determined that several topics from the previous guidelines warrant reassessment, including the following: radiological and histopathological features of UIP, diagnostic criteria, diagnostic and treatment approaches, and prior evidence-based recommendations about antacid medications and transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC). In addition, it was decided that new questions about antireflux surgery and genomic classifier testing should be addressed.

The acceptance of antifibrotic therapies for IPF led to the investigation of such therapies in other fibrotic lung diseases. While the IPF guidelines were being updated, a clinical trial reporting a beneficial effect of antifibrotic medication in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) other than IPF that manifest progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) was published, prompting a paradigm shift toward an en bloc approach to antifibrotic therapy. Given the importance and timeliness of the issue, the guideline committee was approved to expand its scope to also define progression of pulmonary fibrosis and to decide whether the en bloc approach should be recommended.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^113ckTe9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines have undergone an incredible transformation over the last number of years. Significant advances include explicit linkages of systematic evidence summaries to the strength and direction of recommendations, consideration of all patient-important factors, transparent reporting of the recommendation generation process including conflict of interest management strategies, and the production of clinical practice guidelines using simple and clear language. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology provides a framework for guideline development and was employed to produce the recently published ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT update on treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Herein, we discuss the advantages of using an evidence-based approach for guideline development, using the IPF process and resultant document as an example.

### Diagnostic likelihood thresholds that define a working diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111jWdgZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The level of diagnostic likelihood at which physicians prescribe antifibrotic therapy without requesting surgical lung biopsy (SLB) in patients suspected of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine how often physicians advocate for SLB in patient subgroups defined by IPF likelihood and the associated risk with SLB, and to identify the level of diagnostic likelihood at which physicians prescribe antifibrotic therapy without requesting SLB.

An international cohort of respiratory physicians evaluated 60 cases of interstitial lung disease, providing:

1. Differential diagnoses with diagnostic likelihood
2. A decision on the need for SLB
3. Initial management decisions.

Diagnoses were stratified according to diagnostic likelihood bands described by Ryerson and colleagues.

- **Measurements and main results**: A total of 404 physicians evaluated the 60 cases, resulting in 24,240 physician-patient evaluations. IPF was part of the differential diagnosis in 9,958 out of 24,240 (41.1%) evaluations. SLB was requested in 8.1%, 29.6%, and 48.4% of definite, provisional high-confidence, and provisional low-confidence diagnoses of IPF, respectively. In 63.0% of provisional high-confidence IPF diagnoses, antifibrotic therapy was prescribed without requesting SLB. No significant mortality difference was observed between cases given a definite diagnosis of IPF (90–100% diagnostic likelihood) and those given a provisional high-confidence IPF diagnosis (hazard ratio, 0.97; P = 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.04). Most respiratory physicians participated in these evaluations.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114Fu67p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The guideline committee drew conclusions based on observational and indirect evidence. The primary question focused on patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who had confirmed gastroesophageal reflux (GER). However, the evidence reviewed included unselected patients with IPF, both with and without confirmed GER. The committee debated whether to provide guidance specifically for patients with IPF and confirmed GER or to extend guidance to all IPF patients regardless of GER confirmation. Ultimately, they voted by a two-thirds majority to offer guidance for all patients with IPF, irrespective of GER confirmation.

In the absence of definitive benefits, the committee made a conditional recommendation against treating patients with IPF with antacid medication solely to improve respiratory outcomes. However, the committee emphasized three important points:

- **Influence of GER on therapy efficacy**: Antacid therapy might benefit patients with confirmed GER. Including both GER and non-GER patients in studies might have negated such effects. Future guidance may change if the efficacy of antacid medications is evaluated separately for subgroups with or without confirmed GER.

- **Quality of evidence**: The quality of evidence was very low, and the committee expressed low confidence in the estimated effects; hence, these findings should be interpreted cautiously.

- **Treatment for GERD symptoms**: Antacid medication might be indicated for patients with IPF experiencing symptoms of GERD to improve GER-related outcomes.

### Therapeutic intervention: Assessing the role of the international consensus guidelines [^113fhaZh]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The consensus statement released by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society provides guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with IPF. These guidelines suggest the use of conventional treatment options, including therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The guidelines acknowledge that there is little good-quality evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such therapies in patients with IPF. The statement was published in 2000 and was based on an extensive review of the literature up to and including December 1998. The goal of this review is to reexamine the treatment recommendations of the guidelines in the context of data that has since become available.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^116UsWhr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, more specifically with respect to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis, the ALAT/ATS/ERS/JRS 2018 guidelines recommend avoiding cellular analysis of BAL fluid in patients with definite usual interstitial pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Current and future directions [^113sj3zJ]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and is increasingly recognized. Prior to the advent of effective therapies, achieving an early diagnosis was arguably of little prognostic consequence given IPF was considered an untreatable and uniformly fatal disease. The advent of new drug treatments has given hope for the future and raised the profile of IPF. International management guidelines highlight the critical role of radiology as part of an interstitial lung disease multidisciplinary team approach in reaching an accurate and early diagnosis of IPF.

The diagnostic criteria and levels of diagnostic confidence for the radio-pathological pattern associated with the clinical syndrome of IPF, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), appear seemingly straightforward. However, with increasing research and recognition of radiopathological interobserver variability, limitations of this classification model are becoming increasingly apparent. This review describes ancillary radiological features, comorbidities, and emerging new entities that potentially co-exist with IPF. Beyond diagnosis, radiology is developing as a key prognostic tool to inform longitudinal patient evaluation. These diagnostic and prognostic clinical challenges and the future role of radiology in IPF are discussed.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Challenges and opportunities for the clinician and investigator [^113j4BJJ]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive and typically fatal interstitial lung disease. Besides its grave natural history and prognosis, three aspects of IPF challenge clinicians and investigators: (1) recent changes in the conceptual framework and definition of IPF complicate interpretation of prior clinical investigations; (2) while most patients with suspected IPF do not undergo open-lung biopsy, clinical definitions that do not include biopsy criteria have not been validated prospectively; and (3) available treatments have not been shown to be effective.

To optimize clinical care and facilitate clinical investigation, a major goal of IPF research should be to develop validated sets of clinical diagnostic and prognostic criteria. Studies have shown the diagnostic value of high-resolution CT scans and identified important prognostic variables; many of these observations await prospective validation. While previous therapeutic studies have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of a placebo control group, and insufficient attention to patient-centered outcomes, the recent study of interferon gamma-1b demonstrated the feasibility of a large-scale, multicenter clinical trial in IPF.

In this article, we discuss how overcoming challenges in IPF research will enable future investigators to conduct well-designed observational studies and clinical trials, whose meaningful results will advance our understanding of IPF, its management, and its impact on patients' lives.

### Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An international working group report [^116z56bm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is defined as an acute, clinically significant respiratory deterioration of unidentifiable cause. The objective of this international working group report on acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was to provide a comprehensive update on the topic. A literature review was conducted to identify all relevant English text publications and abstracts. Evidence-based updates on the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, prognosis, and management of acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are provided.

To better reflect the state of knowledge and improve the feasibility of future research into its etiology and treatment, the working group proposes a new conceptual framework for acute respiratory deterioration in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This includes a revised definition and diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (f-IPF) [^112483D6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Distribution of diagnoses in f-IPF vs. s-IIP cohort**: Of the 28 identified index patients, all were diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), with the following levels of diagnostic confidence: 24 definite, three probable, and one possible. Along with the 51 affected family members, totaling 79 patients, these individuals were diagnosed with IPF (56%), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP, 3%), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (u-IIP, 1%), and other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD, 40%). The IPF diagnosis followed the Official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Clinical Practice Guideline 2011.

	- In cases where clinical, radiological, and pathological information was available and met the guideline criteria, the diagnosis of IPF could be settled or confirmed. However, we did not receive complete information for all relatives of the index patients. In some cases, especially where relatives had died earlier, it was not possible to retrieve reliable further information. In such instances, a diagnosis of DPLD was considered without further differentiation. Evidence level A for f-IPF was met by 14 families, while the remaining 14 families corresponded to evidence level B.

	- Compared to these, the sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (s-IIP) group, consisting of 286 patients, showed the following distribution of diagnoses: IPF (51.2%), NSIP (5.9%), u-IIP (24%), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP, 14.6%), and other DPLD (4%).

### Early diagnosis of fibrotic interstitial lung disease: Challenges and opportunities [^115GQ9Kt]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Many patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) develop pulmonary fibrosis, which can lead to reduced quality of life and early mortality. Patients with fibrotic ILD often experience considerable diagnostic delay, are subjected to unnecessary and costly diagnostic procedures, and receive ineffective and potentially harmful treatments. Non-specific and insidious presenting symptoms, along with limited knowledge of fibrotic ILD among primary care physicians and non-ILD experts, are significant contributors to diagnostic delay.

Here, we outline and discuss the challenges facing both patients and physicians in making an early diagnosis of fibrotic ILD, and explore strategies to facilitate early identification of patients with fibrotic ILD, both in the general population and among individuals at the highest risk of developing the disease. Finally, we discuss controversies and key uncertainties in screening programs for fibrotic ILD. Timely identification and accurate diagnosis of patients with fibrotic ILD pose several substantial clinical challenges but could potentially improve outcomes through the early initiation of appropriate management.

### Assessment of current practice in the diagnosis and therapy of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113hR8AU]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The consensus statement on the diagnosis and therapy of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), formulated by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS), was published in 2000. Acceptance and implementation of these guidelines have not been assessed. We surveyed the fellows of the American College of Chest Physicians (FCCP) to establish practice patterns regarding the diagnosis and therapy of IPF.

- **Methods**: We electronically distributed a 32-item questionnaire to all 6,443 pulmonary medicine board-certified fellows of the American College of Chest Physicians. The response rate was 13%. Demographic characteristics were similar between respondents and non-respondents.

- **Results**: Seventy-two percent of respondents were familiar with the ATS/ERS consensus statement, and 63% found it clinically useful. However, a similar number of respondents indicated that an update is needed. Bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy are used infrequently. Forty-five percent of pulmonary physicians advocate providing only supportive care for patients outside of clinical trials. If pharmacological therapy is recommended, prednisone (either alone or in combination with azathioprine) or off-label agents are preferentially prescribed. Despite physician awareness (79%) of clinical trials, interested patients are not consistently referred. A majority of respondents (61%) felt that lung transplantation represents the only effective therapy for IPF, and 86% refer their patients to lung transplant centers.

- **Conclusions**: There is substantial variability among pulmonary physicians in the approach to diagnosing and treating IPF.

### Critical reappraisal of underlying histological patterns in patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115NbEeN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern is the histologic marker of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the usefulness of ancillary histologic findings may help discriminate idiopathic from secondary UIP.

Recent findings indicate that alternative less invasive procedures may identify the UIP pattern, thereby preventing the need for conventional surgical lung biopsies. Additionally, genomic analysis can potentially recognize the UIP pattern from samples that are otherwise poorly diagnostic.

High-resolution computed tomography identifies a 'definite' UIP pattern in about half of the cases, yet fails to recognize UIP in the absence of honeycombing or in cases of limited disease. While radiologic criteria for UIP need redefinition to improve their diagnostic yield, the histologic features of UIP have not significantly changed since the 1960s. They continue to represent a major diagnostic tool, particularly in challenging interstitial lung diseases. A careful recognition of certain histologic ancillary findings in UIP, such as cellular or follicular bronchiolitis with germinal centers, chronic pleuritis, interstitial granulomas or giant cells, and bridging fibrosis, may be helpful in distinguishing secondary forms (e.g. connective tissue disease, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia) from IPF.

Cryobiopsy and awake-biopsy are promising approaches to obtain representative lung tissue, potentially preventing the need for conventional surgical lung biopsies. Genomic techniques have recently demonstrated good-to-high sensitivity and specificity in disclosing UIP patterns starting from RNA obtained in transbronchial biopsy, possibly soon replacing or complementing traditional histology.

### Association of early suspected acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with subsequent clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization [^114a37g4]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may be complicated by episodes of acute exacerbation. This study quantified the association between the occurrence of suspected acute exacerbations of IPF (AEx-IPF) in the six months post-IPF diagnosis with clinical outcomes and IPF-related healthcare resource utilization (HRU).

- **Methods**: U.S. pulmonologists participated in a retrospective chart review of IPF patients. Patient eligibility criteria included: 1) ≥ 40 years of age and a confirmed date of first IPF diagnosis with HRCT and/or lung biopsy between January 2011 and June 2013; 2) two separate FVC results recorded around the first diagnosis and six months post-diagnosis. Patients with a suspected AEx-IPF within six months post-diagnosis were categorized as "early AEx-IPF". Subsequent clinical outcomes and IPF-related HRU were assessed from six months post-diagnosis until the latest physician contact date.

- **Results**: The sample included 490 IPF patients from 168 pulmonologists; 72 (15%) patients had a suspected early AEx-IPF. At IPF diagnosis, the mean (SD) age was 61 (11) years, 68% were male, and the mean FVC percent predicted was 60% (26%). Compared to patients without a suspected early AEx-IPF, patients with an early AEx-IPF had higher mortality risk (HR = 2.87, p < 0.001) and higher rates of subsequent suspected AEx-IPF (IRR = 3.87, p < 0.001), outpatient visits (IRR = 1.46, p < 0.001), ER visits (IRR = 4.39, p < 0.001), hospitalizations (IRR = 7.96, p < 0.001), and ICU stays (IRR = 9.74, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Using a large sample of IPF patients from varied practice settings, we found that early suspected AEx-IPF is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes and increased healthcare resource utilization.

### "Any fool can make a rule and any fool will mind it" [^114j8Fmq]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Currently, in roughly half of IPF patients, ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 diagnostic criteria for IPF are not satisfied, and the disease remains unclassifiable. In this setting, clinicians must speculate on the best course of action — whether to manage the disease according to a diagnosis of alternative disorders or to apply IPF-validated anti-fibrotic therapies. In a nutshell, the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 IPF diagnostic guidelines are 'broken'.
How has it come to this? The pace of recent events is partly to blame. In 2009/2010, when the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines were formulated, there was no universally accepted therapy known to delay disease progression, and it was generally agreed that the best management consisted of participation in a novel treatment trial. Rigorous diagnostic criteria are required in drug trials. However, and perhaps more importantly, a treatment option, in the form of triple therapy with low-dose prednisolone, azathioprine, and N-acetyl cysteine, was available. This option could, until recently, reasonably be applied equally in IPF or in the realistic differential diagnoses in which immune dysregulation is thought to play a primary pathogenetic role.

Thus, the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 guidelines provided appropriate diagnostic rigour for trial purposes, and at that time, it could be argued that patients disenfranchised by IPF diagnostic criteria were not disadvantaged for practical management purposes. Perhaps it was not possible in 2011 to do better than this. However, everything changed irrevocably when IPF-specific therapies were validated, and particularly when…

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^116cmc3S]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines have undergone intense evolution over the last 15 years. The main driver behind this transformation has been the change in focus from what used to be called expert- or consensus-based to evidence-driven recommendations. This distinction represents a typical misunderstanding, as even in the era of evidence-based guidelines, recommendations are developed by clinical experts in the field and require consensus of panel members on the best possible treatment options. It is the transparent link between the evidence and the recommendations, along with the requirement of making structured expert judgments, that represents a shift in the guideline development paradigm. This is true even for evidence-based guidelines that focus on complex and rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

In 2000, a selected panel of international experts in the field of interstitial lung diseases provided a guideline for the diagnosis and management of IPF. Due to the paucity of evidence available and the relatively immature field of guideline methodology, this document was developed using the conventional consensus-approach based on the opinions of the few expert panel members without a systematic review of the literature or formal quality of evidence evaluation. Regardless, this document, then considered state of the art for the disease, provided useful direction to clinicians in diagnosing and managing patients with IPF. Over the next decade, an increasing number of studies in the field of IPF were published based on this guidance document.

### Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A Fleischner Society white paper [^111cvzSR]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). High credibility.

This review provides an updated approach to the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), based on a systematic search of the medical literature and the expert opinion of members of the Fleischner Society. A checklist is provided for the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The role of CT is expanded to permit diagnosis of IPF without surgical lung biopsy in select cases when CT shows a probable UIP pattern. Additional investigations, including surgical lung biopsy, should be considered in patients with either clinical or CT findings that are indeterminate for IPF.

A multidisciplinary approach is particularly important when deciding to perform additional diagnostic assessments, integrating biopsy results with clinical and CT features, and establishing a working diagnosis of IPF if lung tissue is not available. A working diagnosis of IPF should be reviewed at regular intervals since the diagnosis might change. Criteria are presented to establish confident and working diagnoses of IPF.

### Overview of pulmonary fibrosis [^111Piiq5]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a component of over 200 interstitial lung diseases. Some have known etiologies; however, for many diseases, the etiology remains unknown or obscure. This brief review examines the prevalence and classification of these diseases, the approach to be taken for the investigation of a patient suspected of having pulmonary fibrosis, the indications for the performance of a lung biopsy, and thoughts concerning the pathogenesis of the idiopathic forms of fibrotic lung disease. A brief review of established and emerging therapeutic strategies is included.

### The revised ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — practical implications [^112mQBaa]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

A deficiency common to all guideline statements is the absence of pragmatic guidance on the level of risk of SLB in individual patients. A clearer separation between patients who can undergo an SLB with an acceptably low risk and those in whom SLB should be avoided would be helpful to clinicians. The presence of major co-morbidity is an obvious contraindication to SLB; however, the level of severity of IPF associated with a significant increase in post-operative mortality has not been sufficiently addressed.

It is acknowledged that in the absence of definitive data, broad statements based on indirect evidence might be required. However, guidance on this point, even if based solely on expert opinion, would be extremely useful as a means of facilitating patient participation in decisions based on "risk-benefit" thinking.

### Diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Implications for respiratory care [^116KddEp]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Although poorly understood, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common of the idiopathic interstitial lung diseases. Its etiology is unknown, but how this fibrotic process develops in the lung has been studied over the last 60 years. It is a relatively rare disease, afflicting individuals aged 50 to 70, and is slightly more common among men than women, without racial predilection. The most common complaint is progressive shortness of breath. Pulmonary function testing reveals a restrictive ventilatory defect with a diminished diffusion capacity. Radiographic and pathologic examination of the lungs demonstrate fibrotic and cystic areas interspersed with normal lung tissue.

No definitive medical treatment is available, although most patients are given trials of corticosteroids, alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. On average, patients survive 2 to 4 years after diagnosis. Lung transplantation has been the only therapy shown to improve survival in those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
