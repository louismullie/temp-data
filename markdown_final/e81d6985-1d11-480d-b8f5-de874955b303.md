## Question

what is the treatment for lateral epicondylitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the treatment is for lateral epicondylitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition's natural history and prognosis to anchor expectations. Then, I should verify first-line conservative strategies and their evidence. Next, I will examine injection therapies, especially corticosteroids versus PRP, and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to review adjunctive modalities like bracing, ESWT, and acupuncture. Finally, I will consider surgical indications and options, and close with a practical, staged algorithm and key takeaways, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and prognosis so I don't jump to conclusions: lateral epicondylitis is a degenerative tendinopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin, typically self-limited, with about 80–90% improving within 6–12 months and a roughly 50% chance of recovery every 3–4 months; poor prognostic factors include manual labor, high baseline pain, and dominant-side involvement, so I should set expectations accordingly and avoid overtreatment early on [^111EwuPk] [^116pAfB4] [^114ZiJ67].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative care and make sure I'm aligning with high-quality evidence: activity modification to avoid forceful gripping and repetitive wrist extension, NSAIDs for short-term analgesia, and a structured physical therapy program emphasizing eccentric strengthening and progressive loading are foundational; wait-and-see is reasonable given the benign natural history, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse these basics before escalating care [^1125GW11] [^113WjNJg] [^1153RJy8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about injections; I need to check corticosteroids carefully: high-quality trials and meta-analyses show corticosteroid injections provide short-term pain relief at 2–6 weeks but are associated with worse long-term outcomes, higher recurrence, and inferior 1-year recovery versus placebo or physiotherapy; even placebo-controlled work shows no added benefit of excising ECRB over sham, underscoring the risk of overtreatment, so I should avoid routine corticosteroids except perhaps for short-term bridging in select cases with informed consent [^111nv7cS] [^1157siAr] [^1153RJy8] [^115xSJXu].

> Wait, let me verify PRP because the literature is mixed: some RCTs and meta-analyses suggest PRP yields better medium- to long-term pain and function than corticosteroids, with durable benefits up to 2 years in certain trials, but other high-quality syntheses, including a Cochrane review, find little to no clinically important benefit versus placebo at 3–12 months; reconciling this, PRP may help some patients, particularly with higher platelet concentration and in chronic cases, but heterogeneity and cost remain substantial, so shared decision-making and realistic expectations are essential [^1127o8y7] [^113dmj82] [^1178q91o] [^1153FicN].

> I should double-check other injectables briefly: botulinum toxin can reduce pain but causes temporary extensor weakness and is not clearly superior to corticosteroids beyond the early window; prolotherapy and hyaluronic acid show signals in some network meta-analyses but evidence quality is low; importantly, even saline injections can produce clinically meaningful improvements, highlighting a robust placebo response and the need for caution when interpreting injection trials [^116FPYsb] [^1167W7X4] [^111xBzgK] [^116nXK6Q].

> Let me consider bracing and orthoses next: counterforce bracing provides short-term pain reduction and improved function over 2–12 weeks compared with placebo, and can be a useful adjunct during activity modification; however, prolonged immobilization or rigid splinting may increase limited duty and costs without clear benefit, so I should favor brief, task-specific bracing rather than sustained immobilization [^112zNXgj] [^116TphG8].

> I need to check ESWT because it's often offered: earlier meta-analyses and RCTs suggested minimal or no clinically important benefit, and a 2020 meta-analysis found no meaningful improvement in pain or grip strength overall, though a subgroup with symptoms beyond 6 months showed small, short-lived gains; given cost and equivocal benefit, ESWT should not be a routine first-line choice, though a monitored trial in chronic cases may be reasonable [^113oQtCq] [^113UAsLS] [^1168FrAB].

> But wait, what about acupuncture and dry needling; I should verify the strength of evidence: systematic reviews suggest manual acupuncture may offer short-term pain relief, while dry needling integrated with multimodal therapy shows superior outcomes at 3 months in some trials; overall certainty is low, so these can be considered adjuncts when available, with counseling about expected benefits and timelines [^1114L32D] [^114huACZ].

> Next, I should review when surgery is appropriate and which technique to choose: surgery is reserved for persistent, disabling symptoms beyond 6–12 months despite comprehensive conservative care; high-level evidence shows no clinically significant differences between open, percutaneous, and arthroscopic approaches at 1 year, and a randomized sham-controlled trial found no benefit of ECRB excision over placebo surgery, so expectations must be tempered; if surgery is pursued, arthroscopic debridement allows inspection for concomitant intra-articular pathology and may facilitate faster recovery in experienced hands, but technique should be individualized to surgeon expertise [^111Px7k2] [^114sp6BQ] [^115xSJXu] [^111Bpt8E].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence: start with education, activity modification, NSAIDs as needed, and a loading-focused physical therapy program; if symptoms persist beyond 3–6 months, consider a single PRP injection recognizing mixed evidence and cost, or a monitored wait-and-see approach; reserve corticosteroid injection only for short-term bridging with explicit counseling on recurrence risk; if failure after 6–12 months of optimized conservative care, discuss surgical options with transparent counseling about limited superiority over continued nonoperative care and the role of placebo effects; throughout, address workplace ergonomics and modifiable risk factors to improve prognosis [^1125GW11] [^113WjNJg] [^116pAfB4] [^114ZiJ67].

> Hold on, I should verify key takeaways to avoid overstatement: lateral epicondylitis is usually self-limited, so conservative management centered on activity modification and progressive loading is first-line; corticosteroid injections offer transient relief but worsen long-term outcomes and should be avoided routinely; PRP may benefit some patients, especially with higher platelet concentration, but evidence is heterogeneous and cost is nontrivial; most patients improve without surgery, and when surgery is considered, outcomes across techniques are broadly similar and expectations must be realistic [^111nv7cS] [^1157siAr] [^1127o8y7] [^111Px7k2].

---

The most effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis is **eccentric strengthening plus stretching** [^111Y68rW] as the core of physical therapy, with **NSAIDs and bracing** as adjuncts for short-term relief [^1125GW11] [^112zNXgj]. Corticosteroid injections offer **short-term pain relief** [^1153RJy8] but have higher recurrence and worse long-term outcomes [^111nv7cS], so they should be used sparingly [^115iz9Fw]. PRP may provide **superior long-term pain and function** compared with steroids [^1127o8y7] [^113dmj82], though evidence is mixed and costlier [^1178q91o]. Most patients improve with **conservative care over 6–12 months** [^111EwuPk]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases after 6–12 months, with no clear superiority among open, arthroscopic, or percutaneous techniques [^114sp6BQ] [^111Px7k2].

---

## Conservative management

### Physical therapy

- **Eccentric strengthening**: Highly effective for pain and function [^111Y68rW]; include wrist extensor eccentric loading with gradual progression.

- **Stretching**: Regular wrist extensor stretching improves flexibility and reduces strain.

- **Manual therapy**: Deep friction massage and joint mobilization can reduce pain and improve function [^notfound].

- **Education**: Activity modification and ergonomic training are essential to prevent recurrence [^1125GW11].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

- **NSAIDs**: Short-term pain relief; topical NSAIDs are preferred to minimize GI risk [^1125GW11].

- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for patients with NSAID contraindications [^1125GW11].

---

### Bracing and orthoses

Counterforce bracing reduces pain and improves function in the **short term** [^112zNXgj]; **wrist splinting** may help in acute phases but is less effective long term [^notfound].

---

## Injection therapies

### Corticosteroid injections

Corticosteroid injections provide **short-term pain relief** [^1153RJy8] but have higher recurrence and worse long-term outcomes than other treatments [^111nv7cS]; therefore, **use sparingly** [^115iz9Fw].

---

### Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections

PRP shows **superior long-term pain and function** versus steroids [^1127o8y7] [^113dmj82], but evidence is mixed and costs are higher [^1178q91o]; consider for refractory cases after conservative care [^114W3yQt].

---

### Other injections

Botulinum toxin can reduce pain but may cause **temporary weakness** [^116FPYsb]; prolotherapy shows promise but needs more high-quality evidence [^1167W7X4].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is indicated for persistent symptoms despite 6–12 months of conservative care; **no technique is clearly superior**, and outcomes are similar among open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous approaches [^114sp6BQ] [^111Px7k2].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Treatment modality** | **Short-term effectiveness** | **Long-term effectiveness** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Eccentric strengthening | High | High | First-line |
| NSAIDs | Moderate | Low | Adjunctive |
| Counterforce bracing | Moderate | Low | Adjunctive |
| Corticosteroid injection | High | Low | Sparingly |
| PRP injection | Moderate | Moderate | Refractory cases |
| Surgery | High | High | Refractory cases |

---

Eccentric strengthening plus stretching is the **most effective conservative approach** [^notfound]; **NSAIDs and bracing** provide short-term relief [^1125GW11] [^112zNXgj]. Corticosteroids offer transient benefit with long-term drawbacks [^116M4fjH], whereas PRP may yield better long-term outcomes at greater cost [^1127o8y7]. Most patients improve with **conservative care** over 6–12 months [^115or1sq]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases, with no clear superiority among techniques [^114sp6BQ] [^111Px7k2].

### Surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review [^114sp6BQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

For the minority of people with lateral epicondylitis who do not respond to nonoperative treatment, surgical intervention is an option, but confusion exists because of the plethora of options. The surgical techniques for treating lateral epicondylitis can be grouped into three main categories: open, percutaneous, and arthroscopic. Our primary question was whether there was clear evidence suggesting one of these three approaches was superior in relieving pain, restoring strength, or reducing time to return to work. A 2002 Cochrane Collaboration Database review found no conclusions could be drawn regarding the efficacy of operative treatment given the lack of controlled trials. Although there is not enough literature to conduct a meta-analysis, we systematically reviewed the available literature to address our questions. Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each procedure, no technique appears superior by any measure. Therefore, until more randomized, controlled trials are done, it is reasonable to defer to individual surgeons regarding experience and ease of procedure.

### Is eccentric exercise an effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis? A systematic review [^111Y68rW]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the effectiveness of eccentric exercise as a treatment intervention for lateral epicondylitis.

Data Sources

ProQuest, Medline via EBSCO, AMED, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL.

Review Methods

A systematic review was undertaken to identify randomized and controlled clinical trials incorporating eccentric exercise as a treatment for patients diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis. Studies were included if: they incorporated eccentric exercise, either in isolation or as part of a multimodal treatment protocol; they assessed at least one functional or disability outcome measure; and the patients had undergone diagnostic testing. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Modified Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group score sheet.

Results

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Three were deemed 'high' quality, seven were 'medium' quality, and two were 'low' quality. Eight of the studies were randomized trials investigating a total of 334 subjects. Following treatment, all groups inclusive of eccentric exercise reported decreased pain and improved function and grip strength from baseline. Seven studies reported improvements in pain, function, and/or grip strength for therapy treatments inclusive of eccentric exercise when compared with those excluding eccentric exercise. Only one low-quality study investigated the isolated effects of eccentric exercise for treating lateral epicondylitis and found no significant improvements in pain when compared with other treatments.

Conclusion

The majority of consistent findings support the inclusion of eccentric exercise as part of a multimodal therapy programme for improved outcomes in patients with lateral epicondylitis.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^111C6Sb9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Lateral epicondylitis affects 1% to 3% of the population and is the most commonly diagnosed musculoskeletal condition of the elbow. A number of treatment options have been developed for tennis elbow, yet the optimal management remains controversial. As such, it is important to identify and characterize the most widely cited investigations on lateral epicondylitis to provide practitioners with the studies that have helped our understanding of this pathology and provided evidence for various treatment options.

Our study identified the 50 most-cited articles pertaining to lateral epicondylitis. It should be noted that this list cannot be comprehensive because only two measures of impact (ie, citation number and density) were used as a proxy for academic influence. Citation frequency has been used as a marker of an article's impact on a specific specialty because it is an indicator of readership and influence on further research. We are aware that several articles may have been excluded despite having a significant impact on the understanding of lateral epicondylitis. However, we feel that this list includes a number of articles that have greatly contributed to the understanding of the pathoanatomy and surgical and nonsurgical treatments of lateral epicondylitis, which is evidenced by the fact that five of the articles in this top 50 cited list were also included in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons elbow curriculum guide on lateral epicondylitis.

### Open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review [^111Px7k2]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

Background: Approximately 10% of patients with lateral epicondylitis go on to have surgical treatment; however, multiple surgical treatment options exist. The purpose of this study was to review the literature for the clinical outcomes of open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous treatment of lateral epicondylitis. The authors hypothesized that the clinical outcome of all 3 analyzed surgical treatments would be equivalent. Methods: A systematic review was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar in July 2016 to compare the functional outcome, pain, grip strength, patient satisfaction, and return to work at 1-year follow-up for open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Results: Six studies (2 Level I and 4 Level II) including 179 elbows (83 treated open, 14 arthroscopic, 82 percutaneous) were analyzed. Three outcome measures (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [DASH] score, visual analog scale [VAS], and patient satisfaction) were reported for more than one category of surgical technique. Of these, the authors noted no clinically significant differences between the techniques. Conclusions: This is the first systematic review looking at high-level evidence to compare open, percutaneous, and arthroscopic techniques for treating lateral epicondylitis. There are no clinically significant differences between the 3 surgical techniques (open, arthroscopic, and percutaneous) in terms of functional outcome (DASH), pain intensity (VAS), and patient satisfaction at 1-year follow-up.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^116136bG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study identifies the 50 most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis or "tennis elbow" and includes foundational investigations that have provided knowledge and understanding of the underlying etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. This list may be used to aid in the education of orthopaedic residency and fellowship trainees because it serves as a source for establishing a reading curriculum on lateral epicondylitis. Many of the articles included were randomized controlled trials showing the modern-day emphasis on evidence-based medicine to evaluate outcomes for a condition for which the optimal management remains controversial.

### Editorial commentary: for surgical treatment of elbow lateral epicondylitis, arthroscopic treatment is recommended for surgeons with elbow arthroscopy training [^111Bpt8E]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a commonly encountered and persistent problem in the active, middle-aged population, with a reported annual incidence as high as 3.4%. Lateral epicondylitis is often treated successfully with conservative measures but may necessitate surgical intervention in refractory cases. Most of the review literature has failed to definitively identify arthroscopic or open debridement as the superior surgical approach. We favor the arthroscopic approach because it allows for the examination and treatment of concomitant intra-articular pathologies, which may be underappreciated on magnetic resonance imaging, and for minimal disruption of the superficial extensors to access the pathologic structures. In addition, this approach often allows for a quick resolution of symptoms and expeditious return to work and sport with a low rate of complications or revisions. For surgeons who are not experienced in elbow arthroscopy, the option of open debridement remains a reasonable approach. However, our preferred management of surgically indicated tennis elbow is arthroscopic repair of the affected extensor tendons along with addressing any concomitant pathology, when present. In our opinion, this leads to optimized long-term outcomes.

### Acupuncture for the alleviation of lateral epicondyle pain: a systematic review [^114huACZ]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Lateral epicondyle pain is a common complaint in North America. In the past 10 yr acupuncture has become increasingly recognized as an alternative treatment for pain, including epicondyle pain. This review evaluates the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for lateral epicondylitis using the appropriate analysis.

Methods

Online bibliographic database searches in any language from Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Healthstar, PMID, CAM, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review (3rd quarter 2003), articles listed in reference lists of key articles and the author's personal files were performed. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials examining the effects of acupuncture on lateral epicondyle pain were selected. From the six studies that met inclusion criteria, the first author, year of publication, population studied, dropout rate, treatment plan, assessment scale and outcome measures were extracted. Study quality was determined by using the Jadad scale, in which all studies were rated as high quality. A best evidence synthesis approach was used to analyse the data presented in the six studies.

Results

All the studies suggested that acupuncture was effective in the short-term relief of lateral epicondyle pain. Five of six studies indicated that acupuncture treatment was more effective compared to a control treatment.

Conclusions

There is strong evidence suggesting that acupuncture is effective in the short-term relief of lateral epicondyle pain.

### Efficacy of nonoperative treatments for lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WjNJg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis is a common overuse injury affecting approximately 1 to 3 percent of the population. Although symptoms may disappear spontaneously within 1 year, the clinical guidelines for conservative treatment are not clear. The authors' objective was to examine the outcomes of nonsurgical treatments for lateral epicondylitis through a meta-analysis and provide a treatment recommendation using the available evidence.

Methods

The authors searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify primary research articles studying conservative treatments (electrophysiotherapy, physical therapy, and injections) for lateral epicondylitis. The authors included randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Data related to outcomes (pain, grip strength, Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score) and complications were extracted.

Results

Fifty-eight randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Electrophysiotherapy was effective in improving pain [mean difference, -10.0 (95 percent CI, -13.8 to -6.1)], Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation score [mean difference, -10.7 (95 percent CI, -16.3 to -5.0)], and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score [mean difference, -11.9 (95 percent CI, -15.8 to -7.9)]; and physical therapy improved pain [mean difference, -6.0 (95 percent CI, -9.7 to -2.3)] and Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation scores [mean difference, -7.5 (95 percent CI, -11.8 to -3.2)] compared to placebo. Injections did not improve any outcome measures. Patients who received electrophysiotherapy and injections reported higher adverse effects than physical therapy patients.

Conclusions

Patients who received electrophysiotherapy and physical therapy reported statistically and clinically improved scores in pain and function compared to placebo. Injections may put patients at higher risk for adverse effects compared to other conservative treatments. When managing lateral epicondylitis conservatively, electrophysiotherapy and physical therapy should be prioritized before other interventions.

### Management of lateral epicondylitis: current concepts [^1148Vsxa]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a common cause of elbow pain in the general population. Traditionally, lateral epicondylitis has been attributed to degeneration of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin, although the underlying collateral ligamentous complex and joint capsule also have been implicated. Nonsurgical treatment, the mainstay of management, involves a myriad of options, including rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, cortisone, blood and botulinum toxin injections, supportive forearm bracing, and local modalities. For patients with recalcitrant disease, the traditional open débridement technique has been modified by multiple surgeons, with others relying on arthroscopic or even percutaneous procedures. Without a standard protocol (nonsurgical or surgical), surgeons need to keep abreast of established and evolving treatment options to effectively treat patients with lateral epicondylitis.

### Does the type of extracorporeal shock therapy influence treatment effectiveness in lateral epicondylitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oQtCq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been used in various musculoskeletal disorders, including lateral epicondylitis. However, in 2005, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that ESWT provides minimal or no benefit in terms of pain and function in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Since the review, several randomized controlled trials including different types of ESWT such as radial type for lateral epicondylitis have been published. Investigations of the effect modifiers such as symptom and follow-up duration on the effects of ESWT on lateral epicondylitis have not been performed.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does ESWT reduce pain and improve grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis? (2) Which type of ESWT, radial or focused, is more effective? (3) Is the duration of symptoms associated with the efficacy of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis? (4) Do improvements in pain scores remain in patients with longer follow-up?

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched up to July 2019 for articles published in English or Korean. Studies were included if patient allocation was randomized, the sample was composed of patients with lateral epicondylitis, interventions were ESWT (focused or radial), comparison group only received sham stimulation or no additional treatment, and the study outcome was pain intensity or grip strength. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twelve studies including 1104 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference for pain reduction and improvement in grip strength was calculated.

Results

The meta-analysis showed no clinically important difference in the VAS score (2.48 ± 7.55 versus 3.17 ± 9.78, mean difference -0.68 [95% confidence interval -1.17 to -0.19]; p = 0.006) and grip strength (38.02 ± 70.56 versus 34.85 ± 108.26, mean difference 3.33 [95% CI 0.93 to 5.73]; p = 0.007) after ESWT relative to the comparison group's score. Even though radial ESWT showed more improvement than focused, the mean difference for VAS did not exceed the minimal clinically important differences threshold. There were no clinically important effects on the VAS scores of patients with lateral epicondylitis (2.78 ± 5.57 versus 3.92 ± 6.29, mean difference -1.13 [95% CI -1.84 to -0.42]; p = 0.002) and focused ESWT did not improve pain in patients with lateral epicondylitis. In the subgroup analysis, ESWT was effective in patients with a symptom duration of more than 6 months (2.28 ± 8.48 versus 3.31 ± 11.81, mean difference -0.95 [95% CI -1.75 to -0.15]; p = 0.02) but not for those with shorter symptom duration. The effects did not last beyond 24 weeks (2.52 ± 9.19 versus 3.34 ± 5.93, mean difference -0.82 [95% CI -2.57 to 0.93]; p = 0.36).

Conclusions

ESWT did not show clinically important improvement in pain reduction and grip strength. Radial ESWT, symptom duration of longer than 6 months, and short follow-up duration (less than 24 weeks) were related to better effects. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate protocol and elucidate the effects according to the intervention type and specific disease condition.

### Lateral epicondylitis: review and current concepts [^115rbi49]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a painful and functionally limiting entity affecting the upper extremity and is frequently treated by hand surgeons. The anatomic basis of the injury to the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin appears to be multifaceted, involving hypovascular zones, eccentric tendon stresses, and a microscopic degenerative response. Although many treatments have been advocated, there is little clear consensus on which modality works best, for both conservative and operative options. In this article, we present an overview of this difficult problem and an evidence-based review of treatment choices.

### A survey of fellowship-trained upper extremity surgeons on treatment of lateral epicondylitis [^117ND4V5]. Hand (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The aim of the study is to investigate current management strategies for lateral epicondylitis by fellowship-trained upper extremity surgeons. Methods: A 17-question survey of treatment approaches and outcomes related to lateral epicondylitis was sent to 3354 surgeons using the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons member databases. Results: Six hundred twelve upper extremity surgeons completed the survey. The 6 most frequently prescribed nonoperative treatments for lateral epicondylitis were home exercise program/stretching (81%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (75%), steroid injection (71%), counterforce bracing (68%), formal physical therapy (65%), and wrist brace (47%). Less commonly performed nonoperative treatment measures included platelet-rich plasma injection (16%), Tenex procedure (6%), and iontophoresis (2%). Conclusions: There is a lack of consensus in the literature for the management of lateral epicondylitis, which is reflected by individual variation in clinical treatment among the experts. Future prospective randomized control studies are needed to establish evidence-based practice standards for this common diagnosis.

### Does nonsurgical treatment improve longitudinal outcomes of lateral epicondylitis over no treatment? A meta-analysis [^117CpSpS]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis is a painful tendinopathy for which several nonsurgical treatment strategies are used. Superiority of these nonsurgical treatments over nontreatment has not been definitively established.

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether nonsurgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis compared with observation only or placebo provides (1) better overall improvement, (2) less need for escape interventions, (3) better outcome scores, and (4) improved grip strength at intermediate- to long-term followup.

Methods

The English-language literature was searched using PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any form of nonsurgical treatment with either observation only or placebo at followup of at least 6 months were included. Nonsurgical treatments included injections (corticosteroid, platelet-rich plasma, autologous blood, sodium hyaluronate, or glycosaminoglycan polysulfate), physiotherapy, shock wave therapy, laser, ultrasound, corticosteroid iontophoresis, topical glyceryl trinitrate, or oral naproxen. Methodologic quality was assessed with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, and 22 RCTs containing 2280 patients were included. Pooled analyses were performed to evaluate overall improvement; requirement for escape interventions (treatment of any kind, outside consultation, and surgery); outcome scores (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation [PRTEE]; DASH; Pain-Free Function Index [PFFI]; EuroQoL [EQ]-5D; and overall function); and maximum and pain-free grip strength. Sensitivity analyses were performed using only trials of excellent or good quality. Heterogeneity analyses were performed, and funnel plots were constructed to assess for publication bias.

Results

Nonsurgical treatment was not favored over nontreatment based on overall improvement (risk ratio [RR] = 1.05 [0.96–1.15]; p = 0.32), need for escape treatment (RR = 1.50 [0.84–2.70]; p = 0.17), PRTEE scores (mean difference [MD] = 1.47, [0.68–2.26]; p < 0.001), DASH scores (MD = -2.69, [-15.80 to 10.42]; p = 0.69), PFFI scores (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.25, [-0.32 to 0.81]; p = 0.39), overall function using change-from-baseline data (SMD = 0.11, [-0.14 to 0.36]; p = 0.37) and final data (SMD = -0.16, [-0.79 to 0.47]; p = 0.61), EQ-5D scores (SMD = 0.08, [-0.52 to 0.67]; p = 0.80), maximum grip strength using change-from-baseline data (SMD = 0.12, [-0.11 to 0.35]; p = 0.31) and final data (SMD = 4.37, [-0.65 to 9.38]; p = 0.09), and pain-free grip strength using change-from-baseline data (SMD = -0.20, [-0.84 to 0.43]; p = 0.53) and final data (SMD = -0.03, [-0.61 to 0.54]; p = 0.91).

Conclusions

Pooled data from RCTs indicate a lack of intermediate- to long-term clinical benefit after nonsurgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis compared with observation only or placebo.

Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a self-limiting condition in most patients. Surgery is often offered to patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment. However, there is no evidence to support the superiority of surgery over continued nonoperative care or no treatment. New evidence also suggests that the prognosis of tennis elbow is not influenced by the duration of symptoms, and that there is a 50% probability of recovery every three to four months. This finding challenges the belief that failed nonoperative care is an indication for surgery. In this annotation, we discuss the clinical and research implications of the benign clinical course of tennis elbow.

### Corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see policy for lateral epicondylitis: a randomised controlled trial [^1153RJy8]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis is generally treated with corticosteroid injections or physiotherapy. Dutch clinical guidelines recommend a wait-and-see policy. We compared the efficacy of these approaches.

Methods

Patients with lateral epicondylitis of at least 6 weeks' duration were recruited by family doctors. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 6 weeks of treatment with corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or a wait-and-see policy. Outcome measures included general improvement, severity of the main complaint, pain, elbow disability, and patient satisfaction. Severity of elbow complaints, grip strength, and pressure pain threshold were assessed by a research physiotherapist who was unaware of treatment allocation. We assessed all outcomes at 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The principal analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis.

Findings

We randomly assigned 185 patients. At 6 weeks, corticosteroid injections were significantly better than all other therapy options for all outcome measures. Success rates were 92% (57) compared with 47% (30) for physiotherapy and 32% (19) for wait-and-see policy. However, recurrence rate in the injection group was high. Long-term differences between injections and physiotherapy were significantly in favour of physiotherapy. Success rates at 52 weeks were 69% (43) for injections, 91% (58) for physiotherapy, and 83% (49) for a wait-and-see policy. Physiotherapy had better results than a wait-and-see policy, but differences were not significant.

Interpretation

Patients should be properly informed about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options for lateral epicondylitis. The decision to treat with physiotherapy or to adopt a wait-and-see policy might depend on available resources, since the relative gain of physiotherapy is small.

### Corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review [^116M4fjH]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) are frequently treated with corticosteroid injections, in order to relieve pain and diminish disability. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by a highly sensitive search strategy in six databases in combination with reference tracking. Two independent reviewers selected and assessed the methodological quality of RCTs that included patients with lateral epicondylitis treated with corticosteroid injection(s), and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome measure. Standardised mean differences were computed for continuous data and relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted, weighting the studies with respect to their internal validity, statistical significance, clinical relevance, and statistical power. Thirteen studies consisting of 15 comparisons were included in the review, evaluating the effects of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo injection (n = 2), injection with local anaesthetic (n = 5), another conservative treatment (n = 5), or another corticosteroid injection (n = 3). Almost all studies had poor internal validity scores. For short-term outcomes (≤ 6 weeks), statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were found on pain, global improvement and grip strength for corticosteroid injection compared to placebo, local anaesthetic and conservative treatments. For intermediate (6 weeks-6 months) and long-term outcomes (≥ 6 months), no statistically significant or clinically relevant results in favour of corticosteroid injections were found. Although the available evidence shows superior short-term effects of corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of injections, due to the lack of high quality studies. No beneficial effects were found for intermediate or long-term follow-up. More, better designed, conducted and reported RCTs with intermediate and long-term follow-up are needed.

### Non-surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^112dMirJ]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-surgical approaches to treatment of lateral epicondylitis are numerous. The aim of this systematic review is to examine randomized, controlled trials of these treatments.

Methods

Numerous databases were systematically searched from earliest records to February 2013. Search terms included "lateral epicondylitis", "lateral elbow pain", "tennis elbow", "lateral epicondylalgia", and "elbow tendinopathy" combined with "randomized controlled trial". Two reviewers examined the literature for eligibility via article abstract and full text.

Results

Fifty-eight articles met eligibility criteria: (1) a target population of patients with symptoms of lateral epicondylitis; (2) evaluation of treatment of lateral epicondylitis with the following non-surgical techniques: corticosteroid injection, injection technique, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin A injection, prolotherapy, platelet-rich plasma or autologous blood injection, bracing, physical therapy, shockwave therapy, or laser therapy; and (3) a randomized controlled trial design. Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that is usually self-limited. There may be a short-term pain relief advantage found with the application of corticosteroids, but no demonstrable long-term pain relief. Injection of botulinum toxin A and prolotherapy are superior to placebo but not to corticosteroids, and botulinum toxin A is likely to produce concomitant extensor weakness. Platelet-rich plasma or autologous blood injections have been found to be both more and less effective than corticosteroid injections. Non-invasive treatment methods such as bracing, physical therapy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy do not appear to provide definitive benefit regarding pain relief. Some studies of low-level laser therapy show superiority to placebo whereas others do not.

Conclusions

There are multiple randomized controlled trials for non-surgical management of lateral epicondylitis, but the existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence that there is one preferred method of non-surgical treatment for this condition. Lateral epicondylitis is a condition that is usually self-limited, resolving over a 12- to 18-month period without treatment.

### To improve pain and function, platelet-rich plasma injections may Be an alternative to surgery for treating lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review [^113fogR5]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection for lateral epicondylitis offers patients comparable outcomes to lateral epicondylar surgery.

Methods

Embase, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE databases were searched using the terms lateral epicondylitis, lateral elbow pain, tennis elbow, lateral epicondylalgia, and elbow tendinopathy individually and combined with the terms platelet-rich plasma injections and lateral epicondylar surgery. We compared pain relief, function between the 2 treatment options, and identified whether PRP injection reduced the incidence of lateral epicondylar surgery. Studies must have compared PRP injections with lateral epicondylar surgery for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis; be of Level I, II, or III evidence; and be written in the English language.

Results

Three studies (1 Level II and 2 Level III) met inclusion criteria. Two of the studies suggested that PRP injections offer similar relief as surgery in the short and mid-term, one study reported that PRP injections and surgery had similar outcomes in pain improvement and return to work, whereas 1 study reported that surgery may be a better long-term solution.

Conclusions

In comparison with lateral epicondylar surgery, PRP injections offer similar improvements in pain and function for patients suffering from lateral epicondylitis, especially in the short- and mid-term in 2 of the 3 included investigations. Therefore, PRP injections are an appropriate alternative for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, Systematic Review of Level III or greater evidence.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^117LGch2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine has updated the treatment guidelines in its Elbow Disorders chapter through revision processes begun in 2006. This abbreviated version of that chapter highlights some of the evidence and recommendations developed.

Methods

Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel and extensive peer-review to develop evidence-based guidance. Consensus recommendations were formulated when evidence was lacking and often relied on analogy to other disorders for which evidence exists. A total of 108 high- or moderate-quality trials were identified for elbow disorders.

Results

Guidance has been developed for 13 major diagnoses and includes 270 specific recommendations.

Conclusion

Quality evidence is now available to guide treatment for elbow disorders, particularly for lateral epicondylalgia.

### Efficacy of botulinum toxin in treating lateral epicondylitis-does injection location matter? a systematic review [^115znNnr]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of botulinum toxin in treating recalcitrant lateral epicondylitis have demonstrated varied results and differed greatly in methodology. The objective of this systematic review was to demonstrate injection location as a significant contributor to outcome heterogeneity.

Design

Two reviewers independently conducted a systematic review using Scopus, Embase, and PubMed for randomized controlled trials assessing botulinum toxin in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to abstracts and reviewing the full-text articles, seven studies were found representing six separate injection locations. Reduction in visual analog scale pain and change in grip strength were the principal outcomes of interest.

Results

The largest reduction in pain was seen in injection at 1/3 of the length of the forearm from the lateral epicondyle at 16-wk follow-up, whereas the smallest reduction was seen at 12-wk follow-up after injection at the 0-cm mark. Differences were also identified in grip strength, although all studies reported return to baseline strength by weeks 12–18.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates injection location as a potential source of heterogeneity. This clinical question warrants further evaluation with direct comparison of outcomes at different injection locations while controlling for dosage, toxin type, and ultrasound/electromyographic guidance.

### Surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^115xSJXu]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A number of surgical techniques for managing tennis elbow have been described. One of the most frequently performed involves excising the affected portion of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). The results of this technique, as well as most other described surgical techniques for this condition, have been reported as excellent, yet none have been compared with placebo surgery.

Hypothesis

The surgical excision of the degenerative portion of the ECRB offers no additional benefit over and above placebo surgery for the management of chronic tennis elbow.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

This study investigated surgical excision of the macroscopically degenerated portion of the ECRB (surgery; n = 13) as compared with skin incision and exposure of the ECRB alone (sham; n = 13) to treat patients who had tennis elbow for > 6 months and had failed at least 2 nonsurgical modalities. The primary outcome measure was defined as patient-rated frequency of elbow pain with activity at 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included patient-rated pain and functional outcomes, range of motion, epicondyle tenderness, and strength at 6 months and 2.5 years. All outcome measures up to and including the 6-month follow-up were measured in person; the longer-term questionnaire was conducted in person or over the phone.

Results

The 2 groups, surgery and sham, were similar for age, sex, hand dominance, and duration of symptoms. Both procedures improved patient-rated pain frequency and severity, elbow stiffness, difficulty with picking up objects, difficulty with twisting motions, and overall elbow rating > 6 months and at 2.5 years (P < .01). Both procedures also improved epicondyle tenderness, pronation-supination range, grip strength, and modified Orthopaedic Research Institute-Tennis Elbow Testing System at 6 months (P < .05). No significant difference was observed between the groups in any parameter at any stage. No side effects or complications were reported. The study was stopped before the calculated number of patients were enrolled (40 per group); yet, a post hoc futility analysis was conducted that showed, based on the magnitude of the differences between the groups, > 6500 patients would need to be recruited per group to see a significant difference between the groups at 26 weeks in the primary outcome (patient-rated frequency of elbow pain with activity).

Conclusion

With the number of available participants, this study failed to show additional benefit of the surgical excision of the degenerative portion of the ECRB over placebo surgery for the management of chronic tennis elbow.

### Platelet-rich plasma has better results for long-term functional improvement and pain relief for lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1127o8y7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids (CS) have shown good short-term performance in terms of pain relief and functional improvement. However, the safety and long-term efficacy of this treatment remains controversial. Several studies have reported good results of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of tendinopathies. However, whether its use in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis (LE) is superior to that of CS remains controversial.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of original studies to determine whether the prognosis of LE patients treated with PRP is better than that of CS.

Study Design

Meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Two independent reviewers searched online databases from January 2000 to July 2022 according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to evaluate prospective studies of PRP versus CS injection for LE. A third author addressed any discrepancies. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Risk ratios for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables were used to compare clinical outcomes. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Eleven randomized controlled trials with 730 patients were included in this review. PRP provided a significantly worse short-term (< 2 months) improvement in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (MD, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.42 to 1.44]; I² = 85%; p = 0.0003) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score (MD, 10.23 [95% CI, 9.08 to 11.39]; I² = 67%; P < .0001) but better long-term (≥ 6 months) improvement in the VAS score (MD, -2.18 [95% CI, -3.13 to -1.22]; I² = 89%; P < .0001), DASH score (MD, -8.13 [95% CI, -9.87 to -6.39]; I² = 25%; P < .0001), and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MD, 16.53 [95% CI, 1.52 to 31.53]; I² = 98%; p = 0.03) than CS. The medium-term (2–6 months) reduction in the VAS score was not significantly different between the 2 groups. After sensitivity analysis, none of the results changed except for the short-term VAS scores (MD, 0.53 [95% CI, -0.13 to 1.19]; I² = 78%; p = 0.12).

Conclusion

Both PRP and CS injections are effective treatments for patients with LE. CS provides better short-term (< 2 months) functional improvement and may be more advantageous in terms of short-term pain relief, while PRP provides better long-term (≥ 6 months) functional improvement and better performance regarding long-term pain relief.

### Lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^115Rfet1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow", is a common musculotendinous degenerative disorder of the extensor origin at the lateral humeral epicondyle. Repetitive occupational or athletic activities involving wrist extension and supination are thought to be causative. The typical symptoms include lateral elbow pain, pain with wrist extension, and weakened grip strength. The diagnosis is made clinically through history and physical examination; however, a thorough understanding of the differential diagnosis is imperative to prevent unnecessary testing and therapies. Most patients improve with nonoperative measures, such as activity modification, physical therapy, and injections. A small percentage of patients will require surgical release of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon. Common methods of release may be performed via percutaneous, arthroscopic, or open approaches.

### Effect of normal saline injections on lateral epicondylitis symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111xBzgK]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a painful degenerative disorder that commonly occurs in adults between 40 and 60 years of age. Normal saline (NS) injections have been used as placebo through a large number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

Purpose

This meta-analysis of RCTs aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of NS injections on lateral epicondylitis symptoms and compare results with established minimal clinically important difference criteria.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for clinical trials reporting pain and joint function with the visual analog scale, Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand in patients with lateral epicondylitis. The meta-analysis was conducted with a random effects model and generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity was tested with the I 2 statistic index.

Results

A total of 15 RCTs included in this meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in pain (mean difference, 3.61 cm [95% CI, 2.29–4.92 cm]; P < .00001; I² = 88%; visual analog scale) and function (mean difference, 25.65 [95% CI, 13.30–37.99]; P < .0001; I² = 82%; Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation / Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) after NS injection (≥ 6 months).

Conclusion

NS injections yielded a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pain and functional outcomes in patients with lateral epicondylitis. New research should focus on better methods to diminish the potential confounders that could lead to this effect because NS injections could mask the real effect of an active therapeutic intervention in RCT.

### Management of lateral epicondylosis [^113GMVy9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lateral epicondylosis is a common cause of lateral elbow pain and can lead to disability and overall diminished quality of life. Repetitive gripping and wrist extension is thought to lead to microtearing and degeneration of the extensor tendons. In general, patients with symptoms of lateral epicondylosis experience relief of symptoms with non-operative management alone. However, controversy remains concerning the role of non-surgical management and which modality facilitates the quickest recovery. Moreover, debate remains throughout the literature regarding surgical intervention and other treatment options for refractory cases. This article serves to provide an updated review of the various treatment options and management for treating lateral epicondylosis.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow? [^112bsjWR]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tennis elbow (or lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy) is a common condition causing lateral elbow pain and disability in middle-aged adults. Its prevalence is strongly associated with age, rising sharply after the age of 30 years, peaking between the ages of 45 and 65 years, and being rare after the age of 65 years.

Indirect evidence suggests that tennis elbow has a benign clinical course. A screening study found that between 1% and 2% of people between the ages of 35 and 55 years have typical clinical findings of tennis elbow, but the reported incidence in the same age group is less than half of that. - ⁠ This suggests that many patients with tennis elbow never see a doctor. Furthermore, about half of those who are diagnosed with tennis elbow only visit a doctor once or twice, and three-quarters are no longer seeking care three months after their initial visit. Another indicator of its excellent long-term prognosis is that despite the lack of a specific cure, the condition is rare in people aged > 65 years.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^116Kbjtu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Results

A list of the 50 most-cited publications on lateral epicondylitis and their respective number of citations and citation densities can be found in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table 1). In total, these articles were cited a combined 6,368 times in the literature. The number of citations ranged from 72 to 332 citations (mean, 127.4 ± 59.5), and citation densities ranged from 1.6 to 34.0 citations per year (mean, 9.4 ± 7.3). The two articles with the greatest number of citations were "Treatment of chronic elbow tendinosis with buffered platelet-rich plasma" by Mishra and Pavelko(332 citations) and "Tennis elbow: The surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis" by Nirschl and Pettrone(314 citations). The randomized controlled trial titled "Positive effect of an autologous platelet concentrate in lateral epicondylitis in a double-blind randomized controlled trial: Platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroid injection with a 1-year follow-up" by Peerbooms et alhad the greatest citation density (34.0 citations per year) in this investigation.

The top 50 articles on lateral epicondylitis were published in 26 different journals, 13 of which only had a single publication on the list (see Supplemental Digital Content 2, Table 2). The largest number of articles (n = 7; 14%) were published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine (AJSM) followed by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery — American Volume (JBJS-AM) (n = 6; 12%). The publication years ranged between 1936 and 2013 (Figure 1). By decade, 48% were published in the 2000s, 34% from the 1990s, and 6% from the 1970s. Articles published in the 1970s had the greatest mean number of citations (211.3), whereas those published in the 2010s had the greatest mean citation density (25.6) (Figure 2). Over the past 3 decades, the citation density for articles on lateral epicondylitis has grown such that the mean citation density rose from 6.03 in the 1990s to 10.1 in the 2000s and 25.63 in the 2010s.

Question 4: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Tendinopathies Using Injectable Biologics?

In the current and subsequent sections of the guideline, we summarize evidence for injectable biologics for specific painful indications. Study data are also summarized in–.

Lateral Epicondylitis

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), or tennis elbow, describes an overuse injury of the extensor tendons attaching to the lateral humerus. While typically self-limited, injuries failing the initial healing response can lead to chronic, degenerative tendinopathy. Consequently, the focus of treatment may shift from anti-inflammatory medication to regenerative approaches. Corticosteroid injections (CSI) have traditionally been used in LE refractory to conservative management. While they can provide short-term symptomatic relief, their use is increasingly discouraged due to questionable efficacy, high rates of recurrence, and risk of further tissue damage. Dextrose prolotherapy has yielded outcomes comparable or superior to CSI and placebo. A meta-analysis of nine trials demonstrated positive outcomes with dextrose prolotherapy, although there was a moderate risk of bias.

The use of autologous blood products has gained interest as an alternative intervention for recalcitrant LE. RCTs comparing either leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) or leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) to placebo demonstrated significant improvements in pain and function with both types over a year of follow-up.RCTs also reported superiority of PRP injections to CSI at 3 months to 2 years. Some trials reported that CSI may be equivalent or more effective for pain relief in the short-term, but this effect declined over time. Meta-analyses have reiterated this association: CSI demonstrates efficacy for 2 to 8 weeks, while PRP remains superior in the longer term (3 months to 2 years).PRP injections also yielded similar benefits to surgical intervention in multiple studies. However, they have not demonstrated efficacy as an adjuvant to surgery or tenotomy. Unlike PRP, autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) injections failed to show significant improvements versus placebo over 6 months in small RCTs. However, they were superior to CSI in a larger RCT with 1-year follow-up.

### Editorial commentary: the needle or the knife? Platelet-rich plasma versus surgery for lateral epicondylitis [^113oQ8Rd]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The most efficacious treatment for patients with lateral epicondylitis who have not adequately improved despite being treated for extended periods with commonly used nonoperative measures is controversial. Are locally applied platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections more effective than a surgical procedure, such as arthroscopic lateral epicondylitis debridement, in reducing symptoms for such patients? Level II evidence shows that long-term clinical benefits are much less likely to occur in patients receiving PRP injections. Moreover, in patients treated with PRP injection, progressively worsening pain is more likely to develop during activity at 1 and 2 years of follow-up in contradistinction to arthroscopically managed patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of injection therapies in lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1167W7X4]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Injection therapy with glucocorticoids has been used since the 1950s as a treatment strategy for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). Lately, several novel injection therapies have become available.

Purpose

To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of injection therapies in patients with lateral epicondylitis.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing different injection therapies for lateral epicondylitis were included provided they contained data for change in pain intensity (primary outcome). Trials were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Network (random effects) meta-analysis was applied to combine direct and indirect evidence within and across trial data using the final end point reported in the trials, and results for the arm-based network analyses are reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs).

Results

Seventeen trials (1381 participants; 3 [18%] at low risk of bias) assessing injection with 8 different treatments-glucocorticoid (10 trials), botulinum toxin (4 trials), autologous blood (3 trials), platelet-rich plasma (2 trials), and polidocanol, glycosaminoglycan, prolotherapy, and hyaluronic acid (1 trial each)-were included. Pooled results (SMD [95% confidence interval]) showed that beyond 8 weeks, glucocorticoid injection was no more effective than placebo (-0.04 [-0.45 to 0.35]), but only 1 trial (which did not include a placebo arm) was at low risk of bias. Although botulinum toxin showed marginal benefit (-0.50 [-0.91 to -0.08]), it caused temporary paresis of finger extension, and all trials were at high risk of bias. Both autologous blood (-1.43 [-2.15 to -0.71]) and platelet-rich plasma (-1.13 [-1.77 to -0.49]) were also statistically superior to placebo, but only 1 trial was at low risk of bias. Prolotherapy (-2.71 [-4.60 to -0.82]) and hyaluronic acid (-5.58 [-6.35 to -4.82]) were both more efficacious than placebo, whereas polidocanol (0.39 [-0.42 to 1.20]) and glycosaminoglycan (-0.32 [-1.02 to 0.38]) showed no effect compared with placebo. The criteria for low risk of bias were only met by the prolotherapy and polidocanol trials.

Conclusion

This systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a paucity of evidence from unbiased trials on which to base treatment recommendations regarding injection therapies for lateral epicondylitis.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^11687281]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the growing contemporary evidence against CS injection use for treatment of LE, beginning with an impactful meta-analysis in 2010, current recommendations for CS injections in treating LE are to use them for short-term relief. Amidst these guidelines and the growing body of literature against the use of CS, it remains unknown if physician behavior has changed in treating LE. In this study, we examined the annual usage of CS injections for treatment of LE from 2010 through 2017, with the primary goal of determining if utilization of this treatment modality changed throughout the 8-year period. As a secondary goal, we will provide an overview on trends in diagnosis and treatment throughout this period by examining the annual utilization of other treatment modalities, including bracing treatment, PT, and surgery.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^115or1sq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), commonly known as "tennis elbow", affects 1% to 3% of the population annually and is associated with risk factors such as smoking, obesity, increased age, repetitive movements, and movements with high physical load. Overuse of the extensor muscles results in degenerative tendinopathy, most commonly that of the extensor carpi radialis brevis. This can result in tenderness of the lateral epicondyle and proximal wrist extensor muscle mass, painful resisted extension of the wrist with a flexed elbow, or painful passive flexion of the wrist with an extended elbow — impairments which can markedly hinder work-related and daily living activities. Poorer prognoses are associated with severe pain at presentation, concomitant neck pain, greater daily physical demands, and higher levels of baseline pain because such risk factors are associated with a longer duration of symptoms and greater pain scores 1 year from disease onset. Treatment of LE entails nonsurgical treatment such as activity modification, bracing treatment, NSAIDs, corticosteroid (CS) injections, and physical therapy (PT); surgery is rarely needed because most patients have symptom resolution within 1 year.

There remains a lack of consensus regarding the preferred method of nonsurgical treatment of this condition. Among the most common of these nonsurgical practices is CS injections. Early studies demonstrated the effectiveness of CS in reducing LE pain 6 weeks after injection. However, more recent studies report an increased rate of relapse of LE pain and functional impairment, as indicated by measures of grip strength and pain rating, in patients who received CS injections compared with those who did not, with no notable benefit compared with controls at 3 months after treatment. Additional findings suggest that although CS can relieve acute LE symptoms, they are contraindicated for long-term cases, as evidenced by decreased rates of symptom improvement or resolution among patients receiving CS compared with those receiving other nonsurgical treatments. Additional concerns around increased rates of postoperative infection, need for revision surgeries, and the suggestion that CS injections may be less cost-effective than other nonsurgical treatments have been documented.

### Autologous blood and platelet-rich plasma injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis [^117SUX6o]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a frequent cause of elbow pain; most patients (80%-90%) are successfully treated with standard nonoperative methods (rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bracing, and physical therapy). Autologous blood injections and platelet-rich plasma injections are the two most frequently used orthobiologic techniques in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Studies of the effectiveness of autologous blood injections and platelet-rich plasma report varying outcomes, some citing significant clinical relief and others reporting no beneficial effect. More research is needed to determine how to best use orthobiologics in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

### Comparative effectiveness of physical therapy and electrophysiotherapy for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a network meta-analysis [^117Mw3tx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis is a common enthesopathy, possibly caused by overuse and repetitive activity. Although nonoperative management is the primary approach for treating lateral epicondylitis, clinical guidelines and the literature fail to identify the most effective nonoperative treatment. Therefore, the authors conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of physical therapy and electrophysiotherapy treatments for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of physical therapy and electrophysiotherapy treatments. Data related to article characteristics and outcomes (grip strength and pain visual analog scale score) were collected.

Results

Twenty-three clinical trials including 1363 participants (mean age ± SD, 47.4 ± 7.5 years; 53.1 percent women) were included in this study. Pain visual analog scale demonstrated significant reductions in scores after treatment with magnetic field [mean difference (95 percent CI), -1.88 (-2.66 to -1.11)], exercise [-0.90 (-1.69 to -0.1)], and acoustic waves [-0.83 (-1.37 to -0.29)] compared with placebo. For grip strength, no treatment modality was found to be significantly effective. A sensitivity analysis that excluded studies with high publication bias and high degrees of heterogeneity produced similar results to the main analysis with the exception of statistically improved grip strength after light therapy [mean difference (95 percent CI), 5.38 (1.71 to 9.04)] and acoustic wave therapy [7.79 (2.44 to 13.15)].

Conclusions

Electrophysiotherapy treatments should be prioritized over physical therapy. Magnetic field therapy was associated with pain reduction, whereas acoustic wave and light therapy were associated with increased grip strength.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^113dZRvS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. The small number of articles included on our list increases the possibility of excluding high-impact investigations on this subject. The specific inclusion of only 50 articles was selected because this value has been used in previous citation analyses of orthopaedic and clinical subspecialties. Furthermore, to fulfill the ultimate purpose of serving as a reading curriculum for orthopaedic training programs, 50 articles were felt to be both appropriate and manageable for a postgraduate orthopaedic trainee. Our chosen measures of impact also exclude some cardinal articles on lateral epicondylitis, to which we would recommend future efforts to identify alternative measures of influence other than citation density (ie, inclusion in high-impact journals). There is also a risk that crossover studies examining specific treatments may extend over several disciplines or conditions and also affect citation density. For example, there is the possibility that citation analyses of PRP may include an abundance of lateral epicondylitis articles because this treatment is commonly implicated in its management. In addition, our list selectively includes only peer-reviewed articles and excludes any lectures, presentations, textbooks, or non–peer-reviewed literature that contributes to our knowledge of lateral epicondylitis.

Our chosen measures of influence are also at risk of confounding effects. For one, self-citation driven by partnering authors, journals, recency, article exposure time, and journal impact factor characterizes a phenomenon described by Lefaivre et alwhere the scientific community tends to favor the ongoing citation of articles because of a record of previous citations, rather than for content or quality. This fact would produce inflated citation rates and give an inaccurate assessment of an article's influence. There is also a question of publication bias where positive or controversial study results attract more attention and thus increased citations compared with studies reporting negative or no significant results. Although still possible, in high-impact orthopaedic journals such as JBJS, this bias seems to be reduced.

### Conservative treatment of lateral epicondylitis: brace versus physical therapy or a combination of both-a randomized clinical trial [^113PFgfi]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The authors evaluated the effectiveness of brace-only treatment, physical therapy, and the combination of these for patients with tennis elbow.

Methods

Patients were randomized over 3 groups: brace-only treatment, physical therapy, and the combination of these. Main outcome measures were success rate, severity of complaints, pain, disability, and satisfaction. Data were analyzed using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Follow-up was 1 year.

Results

A total of 180 patients were randomized. Physical therapy was superior to brace only at 6 weeks for pain, disability, and satisfaction. Contrarily, brace-only treatment was superior on ability of daily activities. Combination treatment was superior to brace on severity of complaints, disability, and satisfaction. At 26 weeks and 52 weeks, no significant differences were identified.

Conclusion

Conflicting results were found. Brace treatment might be useful as initial therapy. Combination therapy has no additional advantage compared to physical therapy but is superior to brace only for the short term.

### Comparative effectiveness of botulinum toxin versus non-surgical treatments for treating lateral epicondylitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FPYsb]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the effectiveness of botulinum toxin compared with non-surgical treatments in patients with lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

Data sources including PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Airity Library from the earliest record to February 2017 were searched. Study design, patients' characteristics, dosage/brand of botulinum toxin, injection techniques, and measurements of pain and hand grip strength were retrieved. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) in pain relief and grip strength reduction were calculated at the following time points: 2–4, 8–12, and 16 weeks or more after injection.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials (321 participants) comparing botulinum toxin with placebo or corticosteroid injections were included. Compared with placebo, botulinum toxin injection significantly reduced pain at all three time points (SMD, -0.729, 95% confidence interval, -1.286 to -0.171; SMD, -0.446, 95% CI, -0.740 to -0.152; SMD, -0.543, 95% CI, -0.978 to -0.107, respectively). Botulinum toxin was less effective than corticosteroid at 2–4 weeks (SMD, 1.153; 95% CI, 0.568–1.737) and both treatments appeared similar in efficacy after 8 weeks. Different injection sites and dosage/brand did not affect effectiveness. Botulinum toxin decreased grip strength 2–4 weeks after injection, and high equivalent dose could extend its paralytic effects to 8–12 weeks.

Conclusions

When treating lateral epicondylitis, botulinum toxin was superior to placebo and could last for 16 weeks. Corticosteroid and botulinum toxin injections were largely equivalent, except the corticosteroid injections were better at pain relief in the early stages and were associated with less weakness in grip in the first 12 weeks.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials on physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia [^1168FrAB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of physical interventions for lateral epicondylalgia (tennis elbow) was carried out. Seventy six randomised controlled trials were identified, 28 of which satisfied the minimum criteria for meta-analysis. The evidence suggests that extracorporeal shock wave therapy is not beneficial in the treatment of tennis elbow. There is a lack of evidence for the long term benefit of physical interventions in general. However, further research with long term follow up into manipulation and exercise as treatments is indicated.

Academic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain and the second most frequently diagnosed musculoskeletal disorder in the neck and upper limb in a primary care setting. Many therapeutic options, including conservative, surgical, and minimally invasive procedures, have been advocated for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Although numerous small studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of various treatments, there are conflicting results with no clear consensus on the optimal treatment. In an economic environment with limited health care resources, it is paramount that optimal cost-effective therapies with favorable patient-important outcomes be identified.

Methods and Analysis

This is a protocol paper which outlines a multicenter, multidisciplinary, single-blinded, four-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing platelet-rich plasma (PRP), whole blood injection, dry needle tendon fenestration, and sham injection with physical therapy alone for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Patients are screened based on pre-established eligibility criteria and randomized to one of the four study groups using an Internet-based system. The patients are followed at 6-week, 12-week, 24-week, and 52-week time points to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. The primary outcome is pain. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life and ultrasound appearance of the common extensor tendon. Two university centers (McMaster University and the University of Michigan) are currently recruiting patients. We have planned a sample size of 100 patients (25 patients per arm) to ensure over 80% power to detect a three-point difference in pain scores at 52 weeks of follow-up.

Ethics and Dissemination

This study has ethics approval from the McMaster University Research Ethics Board (REB# 12–146) and the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB# HUM00067750). Successful completion of this proposed study will significantly impact clinical practice and enhance patients' lives. More broadly, this trial will develop a network of collaboration from which further high-quality trials in ultrasound-guided interventions will follow.

### Dynamic extensor brace for lateral epicondylitis [^113ouLdg]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a common, often disabling ailment. Based on the failure of current therapies, a new dynamic extensor brace has been developed. In this study, the effects of application of this brace for 3 months on the most important and disabling symptoms of patients with lateral epicondylitis were assessed. After prestratification for the duration of complaints (ie, ≤ 3 months and ≥ 3 months), 63 patients initially were assigned randomly to 12 weeks of brace treatment (Group 1; n = 30) or no brace treatment (Group 2; n = 33). Outcome measures included pain (VAS), pain-free grip strength, maximum grip strength, and functionality of the arm. All outcomes were assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Brace treatment resulted in significant pain reduction, improved functionality of the arm, and improvement in pain-free grip strength. The beneficial effects of the dynamic extensor brace observed after 12 weeks were significantly different from the treatment group that received no brace. The beneficial effects were sustained for another 12 weeks. No correlation between duration of symptoms and treatment effects of the brace was revealed. The dynamic extensor brace is an effective therapeutic tool for treating lateral epicondylitis.

### A randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) [^113UAsLS]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial were to determine whether ultrasound-guided extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) reduced pain and improved function in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) in the short term and intermediate term.

Methods

Sixty-eight patients from community-based referring doctors were randomized to receive 3 ESWT treatments or 3 treatments at a subtherapeutic dose given at weekly intervals. Seven outcome measures relating to pain and function were collected at followup evaluations at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after completion of the treatment. The mean changes in outcome variables from baseline to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months were compared for the 2 groups.

Results

The groups did not differ on demographic or clinical characteristics at baseline and there were significant improvements in almost all outcome measures for both groups over the 6-month followup period, but there were no differences between the groups even after adjusting for duration of symptoms.

Conclusion

Our study found little evidence to support the use of ESWT for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and is in keeping with recent systematic reviews of ESWT for lateral epicondylitis that have drawn similar conclusions.

### The effect of platelet-rich plasma on clinical outcomes in lateral epicondylitis [^114v6cpX]. Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the evidence for application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

We carried out a systematic review of the current evidence on the effects of PRP in lateral epicondylitis on clinical outcomes. We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Embase databases using various combinations of the commercial names of each PRP preparation and "lateral epicondylitis" (with its associated terms), looking specifically at human studies. Data validity was assessed and collected on clinical outcome.

Results

Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 5 were randomized controlled trials. Two cohort studies showed that PRP improved clinical satisfaction scores. One case-control study showed that PRP yielded a significantly greater improvement in symptoms compared with bupivacaine. Two randomized controlled trials compared the effect of injections of PRP and blood. Only 1 of the studies noted a significant difference at the 6-week time point. Three randomized controlled trials compared corticosteroids with PRP. Two of the smaller trials, which had follow-up periods of 6 weeks and 3 months, showed no significant difference between treatment groups. The largest randomized controlled trial found that PRP had significant benefit compared with corticosteroids with regard to pain and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores at 1- and 2-year time points.

Conclusions

This review highlights the limited but evolving evidence for the use of PRP in lateral epicondylitis; however, further research is required to understand the concentration and preparation that facilitate the best clinical outcome. Characterizing the timing of the intervention would optimize the health economics behind the decision to treat for the patient and health care provider.

### Acupuncture therapy for extremity musculoskeletal pain: a clinically focused evidence synthesis with therapeutic implications [^1114L32D]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Acupuncture for Lateral Epicondylitis (LE)

Two randomized controlled trials evaluated acupuncture's efficacy for LE. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) was more effective than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for LE in the short term. Evidence from a multicenter randomized clinical trial revealed that integrating electrical dry needling and thrust manipulation into a multimodal physical therapy regimen exhibited greater reductions in pain intensity and functional limitations in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy compared to multimodal therapy alone at 3-month follow-up. The results underscore the therapeutic value of adjunctive acupuncture therapy in optimizing multimodal management for LE.

Three systematic reviews assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture for LE. Navarro-Santana et alreported moderate short-term pain reduction for manual acupuncture (MA), but not for electroacupuncture (EA). Another meta-analysis (10 RCTs, n = 796) concluded acupuncture was superior to medicine therapy and blocking therapy in clinical efficacy rates. In contrast, a 2021 systematic review noted very low-certainty evidence that corticosteroid injections outperformed dry needling for LE pain at short-term, while dry needling showed superior long-term (≥ 12 weeks) effects.

Current evidence suggests that manual acupuncture may exert short-term therapeutic effects on lateral epicondylitis, whereas dry needling appears to demonstrate superior long-term efficacy. For patients with LE, a course of MA can be considered for short-term symptom control. For those seeking long-term recovery, treatment plans should prioritize interventions that incorporate DN. However, substantial heterogeneity exists across studies regarding pathological complexity and severity, acupuncture modalities, treatment duration, and choice of comparison groups. These methodological variations necessitate cautious interpretation of the pooled findings.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^112c9xbU]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The article titled "Tennis elbow: The surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis" was also a foundational study that identified the characteristic histologic findings of fibroblastic invasion and vascular infiltration at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis. These findings were later found to be consistent with the pattern of repetitive microinjury and attempted healing. The study also described a surgical approach, with elements still in practice today, involving incision of the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin and visualization and subsequent débridement of pathologic lesions. Last, the study provided initial outcome data in favor of surgical intervention and reassuring prognosis for return to sport.

Most articles included in our study were published in either AJSM or JBJS-AM, both well-regarded, high-impact orthopaedic journals based on the most recent (2016) Thomas Reuters Journal Citation Report.JBJS-AM had the highest impact factor of journals under the category "Orthopedics" with a score of 5.163, and AJSM was ranked third, with an impact factor of 4.517. Previous studies have examined the impact factor of orthopaedic journals and cite AJSM as the specialized orthopaedic journal with the greatest impact factor and JBJS-AM as the general orthopaedic journal with the greatest impact factor. In addition to their inclusion in high-impact journals, many of the articles on our most-cited list were performed under rigorous study designs as supported by their designations as level I studies. This scenario is in contrast to previous orthopaedic citation analyses. For instance, the number of level I and II evidence studies included in the top 50 articles published on ACL research, femoroacetabular impingement, and shoulder surgery were 6, 0, and 9, respectively. Furthermore, in an investigation on the 100 most-cited articles in orthopaedic surgery, Lefaivre et alfound that < 10 articles were level I or II evidence. The reason for the relatively high number of level I and II evidence articles in the current investigation is twofold. First, compared with other orthopaedic pathologies, lateral epicondylitis is often successfully treated nonsurgically, making comparative investigations significantly easier for investigators to perform. As such, all 12 randomized controlled trials included in this investigation looked at various nonsurgical treatments. Second, there has been a more recent emphasis on evidence-based investigations, and most of the level I studies included in this list were published between 1996 and 2013. This fact is in contrast to previous investigations reviewing the classic articles published on ACL research, shoulder surgery, and general orthopaedic surgery, which found that the most studies were published in the 1990s, 1970s, and 1970s, respectively. Interestingly, despite the recent, high-quality works on comparative treatments for lateral epicondylitis, the literature remains inconclusive on the ideal management.

Administration of BMAC was associated with symptom relief from 2 to 12 weeks in one uncontrolled trial. Two uncontrolled pilot studies reported progressive improvements in pain, performance, and anatomical findings noted on MRI over a year with A-MSCs. The use of these biologics deserves further investigation with high-quality RCTs.

Consensus Point 4. PRP injection for lateral epicondylitis is associated with superior long-term relief (3 months to 2 years) compared to corticosteroid injection (Level I, Grade B).

Consensus Point 5. Limited evidence suggests that BMAC and adipose-derived MSC injection for lateral epicondylitis may be associated with improvement in pain, physical function, and anatomical findings (Level II-3, Grade C).

Consensus Point 6. Intra-tendinous ACP injection is likely ineffective for improving pain control or functionality in lateral epicondylitis and other tendinopathies (Level I, Grade D).

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^1129vsbb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corticosteroid (CS) injections are a frequently used treatment modality for lateral epicondylitis (LE) despite an increasing number of studies suggesting their lack of efficacy. The objective of this study was to review the annual utilization of CS injections for treatment of LE, as well as that of other nonsurgical treatments and surgical treatments, to understand how recent publications have affected the practice of physicians in treating LE.

Methods

Patients with LE from 2010 to 2017 were identified within a national insurance database and grouped by treatment modalities of CS injections, physical therapy, bracing treatment, and surgery. Epidemiologic and demographic data were reported using descriptive statistics. The number of patients receiving each treatment and the number of CS injections per patient were quantified for each year, and annual trends were analyzed using logistic regression.

Results

Among 80,169 qualifying patients, 16,476 received CS injections, 12,180 received physical therapy, 1,874 received bracing treatment, and 2,650 underwent surgery, with patients receiving multiple modalities being members of each respective group. We found a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with LE receiving CS injections from 23.3% in 2010 to 18.8% in 2017 (R2 = 0.956, P < 0.001). Interestingly, the number of CS injections per patient increased during this period from 1.33 to 1.83 (R2 = 0.843, P = 0.001). No notable changes in utilization trends for other modalities were found.

Discussion

Overall, our data support a decline in the use of CS injection as a treatment modality for LE from 2010 to 2017. Although correlational, this trend may reflect the increasing body of published evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of CS injections for the treatment of LE. In addition, the increasing number of injections per patient among those who received injections contrasts with the overall decrease in steroid utilization among all patients. Further study is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these trends.

### A systematic review on the efficacy of different types of platelet-rich plasma in the management of lateral epicondylitis [^112HEyF7]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is reported as an effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis (LE). Theoretically, different types of PRP have different therapeutic effects. However, there is controversy on the effects of different types of PRP in the treatment of LE. The purpose of this study was to systematically compare pain relief, functional improvement, and the success rate of treatment using 2 different types of PRP by reviewing and summarizing the data available in the current literature on LE after PRP injection.

Methods

The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were reviewed. A computerized literature search was performed for related studies published from database inception to August 2021 using the following terms: lateral epicondylitis, tennis elbow, tendinopathy, lateral elbow pain, PRP, and platelet-rich plasma. The PRP patients included in our study were divided into those receiving leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) and those receiving leukocyte-rich PRP (LR-PRP) according to the different preparation methods. Outcomes of interest included patient characteristics, types and preparations of PRP, clinical outcomes, success rates, and the safety of treatment at short- and long-term follow-up.

Results

A total of 33 studies were evaluated in our analysis, including 2420 LE patients. LP-PRP was used in 19 of these studies, LR-PRP was used in 13, and both LP-PRP and LR-PRP were used in 1. Patients in both PRP groups showed significantly improved clinical outcomes after treatment compared with before treatment. The mean visual analog scale scores ranged from 6.1 to 8.0 before treatment, ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 at short-term follow-up, and ranged from 0.6 to 3.3 at long-term follow-up in the LR-PRP group. The mean visual analog scale scores ranged from 4.2 to 8.4 before treatment, 1.6 to 5.9 at short-term follow-up, and 0.7 to 2.7 at long-term follow-up in the LP-PRP group. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores in the LR-PRP and LP-PRP groups ranged from 47.0 to 54.3 and 30.0 to 67.7, respectively, before treatment and ranged from 20.0 to 22.0 and 5.5 to 19.0, respectively, at long-term follow-up. The success rates in the LR-PRP and LP-PRP groups ranged from 70% to 100% and 36% to 100%, respectively. The complication rate was lower in the LP-PRP group (3.9%) than in the LR-PRP group (6.4%, P = .029), with the main complication being temporary pain after PRP treatment.

Conclusion

PRP treatment demonstrated significant improvements in terms of pain relief and functional improvement in LE patients regardless of the type of PRP. There were no significant differences in pain relief and functional improvement between LR-PRP and LP-PRP. The main complication was temporary pain after PRP injection, and the complication rate in the LP-PRP group was lower than that in the LR-PRP group.

Patients with LE from 2010 to 2017 were identified within a national insurance database and grouped by treatment modalities of CS injections, physical therapy, bracing treatment, and surgery. Epidemiologic and demographic data were reported using descriptive statistics. The number of patients receiving each treatment and the number of CS injections per patient were quantified for each year, and annual trends were analyzed using logistic regression.

Results:

Among 80,169 qualifying patients, 16,476 received CS injections, 12,180 received physical therapy, 1,874 received bracing treatment, and 2,650 underwent surgery, with patients receiving multiple modalities being members of each respective group. We found a significant decrease in the proportion of patients with LE receiving CS injections from 23.3% in 2010 to 18.8% in 2017 (R 2 = 0.956, P < 0.001). Interestingly, the number of CS injections per patient increased during this period from 1.33 to 1.83 (R 2 = 0.843, P = 0.001). No notable changes in utilization trends for other modalities were found.

Discussion:

Overall, our data support a decline in the use of CS injection as a treatment modality for LE from 2010 to 2017. Although correlational, this trend may reflect the increasing body of published evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of CS injections for the treatment of LE. In addition, the increasing number of injections per patient among those who received injections contrasts with the overall decrease in steroid utilization among all patients. Further study is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these trends.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^113JRCp1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our analysis shows that the usage of CS injections for treatment of LE has decreased from 2010 to 2017. However, there was an increase in the average number of injections among patients with LE receiving injections. These findings were consistent across age and sex and demonstrate that although there has been a decrease in overall usage of corticosteroids because of the growing quantity of impactful literature, many providers' practice has remained unaffected.

### Platelet-rich plasma versus tenex in the treatment of medial and lateral epicondylitis [^114jwjPD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Medial epicondylitis and lateral epicondylitis are among the most common elbow pathologies affecting people aged between 40 and 50 years. Although epicondylitis is often a self-limiting condition that improves with conservative treatment, the condition can be difficult to eradicate. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections and ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy (Tenex) for the treatment of medial or lateral epicondylitis. Our hypothesis was that the Tenex procedure would not be inferior to PRP injections in the treatment of medial or lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

In this retrospective review, 62 of 75 patients were available for contact via phone and e-mail to complete post-procedure patient-reported outcome surveys. Subjective assessment of pain and function included a visual analog scale for pain; the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire; and the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. The inclusion criteria included ageof 18 years or older and previous failure of nonoperative treatment.

Results

The average ages in the PRP and Tenex groups were 47 years and 51 years, respectively. The PRP cohort (n = 32) included 10 female and 22 male patients, whereas the Tenex cohort (n = 30) included 12 female and 18 male patients. The PRP and Tenex groups both demonstrated clinical and statistical improvement in visual analog scale pain scores; Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores; and EuroQol-5D scores. No statistically significant difference was found between the 2 treatment modalities.

Conclusion

The PRP and Tenex procedures were both successful in producing clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life.

### Denervation of the lateral humeral epicondyle for treatment of chronic lateral epicondylitis [^112UHWgS]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic lateral epicondylitis remains a treatment challenge. Traditional surgical treatments for lateral epicondylitis involve variations of the classic Nirschl lateral release. Anatomic studies reveal that the posterior branch or branches of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm consistently innervate the lateral humeral epicondyle. We undertook the present study to determine the effectiveness of denervation of the lateral humeral epicondyle in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved prospective study included 30 elbows in 26 patients. Inclusion criteria included failure to respond to nonoperative treatment for more than 6 months and improvement in grip strength and in visual analog pain scale after diagnostic nerve block of the posterior branches of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm proximal to the lateral humeral epicondyle. We excluded patients who had undergone previous surgery for lateral epicondylitis. Outcome measures included visual analog pain scale and grip strength testing. Denervation surgery involved identification and transection of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm branches with implantation into the triceps. The presence of radial tunnel syndrome was noted but did not affect inclusion criteria; if it was present, we did not correct it surgically. We used no postoperative splinting and permitted immediate return to activities of daily living.

Results

At a mean of 28 months of follow-up, the average visual analog scale score decreased from 7.9 to 1.9. Average grip strength with the elbow extended improved from 13 to 24 kg. A total of 80% of patients had good or excellent results, as defined by an improvement of 5 or more points on the visual analog scale for pain.

Conclusions

Denervation of the lateral epicondyle was effective in relieving pain in 80% of patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis who had a positive response to a local anesthetic block of the posterior branches of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Radial nerve compression syndromes must be evaluated as a confounding source of symptoms and may require additional treatment in patients who fail to improve with denervation alone.

### Effect of corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, or both on clinical outcomes in patients with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia: a randomized controlled trial [^111nv7cS]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy, common treatments for lateral epicondylalgia, are frequently combined in clinical practice. However, evidence on their combined efficacy is lacking.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, multimodal physiotherapy, or both in patients with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A 2 × 2 factorial, randomized, injection-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a single university research center and 16 primary care settings in Brisbane, Australia. A total of 165 patients aged 18 years or older with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 6 weeks' duration were enrolled between July 2008 and May 2010; 1-year follow-up was completed in May 2011.

Interventions

Corticosteroid injection (n = 43), placebo injection (n = 41), corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy (n = 40), or placebo injection plus physiotherapy (n = 41).

Main Outcome Measures

The 2 primary outcomes were 1-year global rating of change scores for complete recovery or much improvement and 1-year recurrence (defined as complete recovery or much improvement at 4 or 8 weeks, but not later) analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis (P < .01). Secondary outcomes included complete recovery or much improvement at 4 and 26 weeks.

Results

Corticosteroid injection resulted in lower complete recovery or much improvement at 1 year vs placebo injection (83% vs 96%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.86 [99% CI, 0.75–0.99]; p = 0.01) and greater 1-year recurrence (54% vs 12%; RR, 0.23 [99% CI, 0.10–0.51]; P < .001). The physiotherapy and no physiotherapy groups did not differ on 1-year ratings of complete recovery or much improvement (91% vs 88%, respectively; RR, 1.04 [99% CI, 0.90–1.19]; p = 0.56) or recurrence (29% vs 38%; RR, 1.31 [99% CI, 0.73–2.35]; p = 0.25). Similar patterns were found at 26 weeks, with lower complete recovery or much improvement after corticosteroid injection vs placebo injection (55% vs 85%, respectively; RR, 0.79 [99% CI, 0.62–0.99]; P < .001) and no difference between the physiotherapy and no physiotherapy groups (71% vs 69%, respectively; RR, 1.22 [99% CI, 0.97–1.53]; p = 0.84). At 4 weeks, there was a significant interaction between corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy (P = .01), whereby patients receiving the placebo injection plus physiotherapy had greater complete recovery or much improvement vs no physiotherapy (39% vs 10%, respectively; RR, 4.00 [99% CI, 1.07–15.00]; p = 0.004). However, there was no difference between patients receiving the corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy vs corticosteroid alone (68% vs 71%, respectively; RR, 0.95 [99% CI, 0.65–1.38]; p = 0.57).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among patients with chronic unilateral lateral epicondylalgia, the use of corticosteroid injection vs placebo injection resulted in worse clinical outcomes after 1 year, and physiotherapy did not result in any significant differences.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^111vgt9R]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Using previously described methods, a systematic query of the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science database (v5.22.3; Thomson Reuters) was performed using the Advanced Search tool on October 13, 2016. The authors expanded the search to include all journals, not only those listed under the Web of Science Category of "Orthopedics". The authors searched for all published articles with a topic listed as "lateral epicondylitis", or "tennis elbow". The retrieved articles were sorted according to the total number of citations, and the 50 most-cited articles were selected for analysis. The full text of each article was individually evaluated by two authors to ensure that the reviewed material was related to lateral epicondylitis.

For each of the 50 most-cited articles, the following characteristics were recorded: citation number, citation density, journal, publication year, country of origin, and language. Citation density was defined as the numbers of citations per year since the date of publication. Two independent evaluators characterized each article by type, including basic science, clinical, or diagnostic. Clinical articles were further subtyped as a systematic review or meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial, prospective or retrospective cohort study, case-control study, case series, cross-sectional study, review article, or expert opinion. The classification system developed by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS) was used to determine the level of evidence for each clinical article. Interobserver agreement for analyzed subjective variables was 100% for article type, 100% for subtype, and 97.5% for level of evidence. Discrepancies between authors were resolved using consensus. The obtained results were analyzed to determine which characteristics were common among the included articles.

### Corticosteroid injections for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis are superior to platelet-rich plasma at 1 month but platelet-rich plasma is more effective at 6 months: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of level 1 and 2 studies [^1162Vjah]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing local injections of either platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or corticosteroid for the treatment of lateral elbow epicondylitis.

Methods

A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed, and all level 1 and 2 randomized studies from 2000 to 2022 were included. Clinical symptoms, patient perceived outcomes, and pain were assessed by the DASH (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire) and pain by the visual analog scale (VAS). Publication bias and risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools. The modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) and the GRADE system were used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Heterogeneity was assessed using χ 2 and I 2 statistics.

Results

Thirteen studies were included in the analysis. Five studies had a high risk of bias, and the risk of bias across studies was assessed as unclear. There was no publication bias identified. Two of the four GRADE domains (inconsistency of results, imprecision of results) were downgraded to low quality, and the final GRADE assessment was downgraded to a low quality of evidence. The mean CMS score was 62.8, indicating fair quality. The pooled estimate for VAS at 1 month favored corticosteroids (P = .75) but favored PRP at three (P = .003) and six months (P = .0001). The pooled estimate for the DASH score favored corticosteroids at 1 month (P = .028) but favored PRP at three (P = .01) and six months (P = .107) CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that PRP has no advantage over steroid injections within the first month of treatment, but that it is superior to steroids at both 3 and 6 months. These results also suggest that corticosteroids have a short-term beneficial effect during the early treatment period, although the quality of the available evidence is not very robust in support of this finding. However, these findings must all be viewed with caution as the high risk of bias and moderate to low quality of the included studies may not justify a recommendation of one treatment over another.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the elbow region [^112RqGQX]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the elbow is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for the elbow joint, medial and lateral epicondylitis, and olecranon bursitis are reviewed. Persistent pain related to inflammatory conditions responds well to injection in the region. Indications for elbow joint injection include osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Corticosteroid injection is an accepted treatment option for medial and lateral epicondylitis. Olecranon bursa aspiration and injection are useful when that bursa is inflamed. The proper techniques, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up essential for effective outcomes are discussed.

### Prognostic factors in lateral epicondylitis: a randomized trial with one-year follow-up in 266 new cases treated with minimal occupational intervention or the usual approach in general practice [^114ZiJ67]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether minimal intervention by occupational specialists involving information about the disorder, encouragement to stay active and instruction in graded self-performed exercises could enhance the prognosis of lateral epicondylitis compared with the treatment usually given in general practice, to quantify workplace factors associated with the prognosis, and to consider treatments given in general practice.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial was performed in a cohort of 266 consecutive new cases of lateral epicondylitis diagnosed in general practice. Workplace factors were assessed with questionnaires at the time of inclusion, and patients completed follow-ups at 3, 6 and 12 months. Status at 1 yr was assessed as overall improvement and pain reduction compared with the time of diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) registered the treatments given for both cases and controls during follow-up. Numbers of contacts with GPs and physiotherapists were obtained from the National Health Insurance registry. Prognostic factors were analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis.

Results

After 1 yr, 83% of cases showed improvement in the condition, but the intervention was found to have had no advantage. Poor overall improvement was associated with employment in manual jobs [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–8.7], a high level of physical strain at work (OR 8.5, CI 1.0–74.7) and a high level of pain at baseline (OR 2.3, CI 1.0–5.3). Pain reduction less than 50% was associated with manual jobs (OR 2.3, CI 1.1–5.1), high physical strain at work (OR 3.6, CI 1.0–12.9), high baseline distress (OR 1.9, CI 1.0–4.0) and tennis elbow on the dominant side (OR 3.1, CI 1.4–6.8). The intervention group received less treatment and fewer treatment modalities, but the intervention was not followed by a reduction in the number of visits to GPs and physiotherapist clinics during 12 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

Poor prognosis at 1 yr of follow-up for lateral epicondylitis was related to manual work and high baseline pain, whilst no relation was found between the type of medical treatment given/chosen and prognosis. This may have implications for the future management of lateral epicondylitis in terms of a greater focus on interaction with the workplace regarding job modification to reduce physical demands during recovery.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^114MXznt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

First, although the aforementioned study noted a relative increase in CS utilization compared with other treatment modalities, it did not address the overall utilization among all patients with LE, including those receiving no treatment. Our study demonstrated an overall decrease in CS usage, along with no notable changes of utilization of the other treatment modalities of PT, bracing treatment, and surgery. Therefore, these findings suggest a growing number of LE cases that are treated with a wait-and-see approach, which has been reported to be equally as effective in long-term treatment of tennis elbow as CS injections and physiotherapy.

Second, our study highlights a population of providers who may be reluctant to change their practice in the face of growing evidence against the use of CSs for tennis elbow. This is apparent in the aforementioned increase in usage of CS injections relative to other treatments and our own finding of an increasing number of injections received per patient, among patients receiving injections. Numerous examples of the slow adoption of new evidence litter the medical landscape with many changes sometimes taking years, for example, the reported decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for patients with osteoarthritis after an impactful publication. Further promulgation and acceptance of decreasing CS usage among providers can benefit from evidence-based guidelines published by professional organizations because such guidelines have been shown to result in notable changes in practice.

### The efficacy of platelet-rich plasma for improving pain and function in lateral epicondylitis: a Systematic review and meta-analysis with risk-of-bias assessment [^115fKrJa]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for lateral epicondylitis and evaluate its impact on pain and functional outcomes.

Methods

This study followed Preferred Reporting Items and Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in September 2019 and repeated in April 2020 using electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library. Baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month data were extracted for visual analog scale (VAS), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), and modified Mayo Clinic performance index for the elbow (MAYO) scores. Only level 1 studies with patients who had not undergone surgery were included. Outcomes data, study design, demographic variables, PRP formulation, and comparator treatments were recorded. Statistical analyses of pooled weighted mean differences (WMDs) were performed and compared with estimated minimal clinically important difference (MCID) values. The Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) was used to assess methodological quality, and the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment was performed.

Results

This review included 16 level I studies, 9 of which (581 total patients, 281 receiving single injections of PRP) were quantitatively analyzed. The average age was 41.5 years, 56.8% of patients were female, and mean follow-up was 7.5 months. The mean CMS was 78.94 ± 12.74 (range 59 to 97), and 5 of 16 studies were at low risk for bias. Patients who received PRP had significantly improved VAS scores at 3 months (WMD -0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.03, -0.66; P < .01) and 6 months (WMD -0.74; 95% CI -0.98, -0.50; P < .01) compared with those who received autologous whole blood, though MAYO scores were statistically equivalent. Comparing PRP to corticosteroids, VAS and DASH scores were not significantly different at 3 months, although PRP was superior at 6 months for VAS (WMD -1.70; 95% CI -2.65, -0.75; P < .01) and DASH (WMD -6.23; 95% CI -10.78, -1.69; P < .01). Most differences in VAS and DASH scores exceeded the 5% absolute difference estimate for their respective MCIDs but fell short of the 10% estimate.

Conclusion

Considering the small number of comparable studies, lack of quantification of specific PRP content, considerable heterogeneity between randomized control trials, and most effect sizes being equivocal within the framework of 2 estimated MCID values, the authors can neither scientifically support nor discourage the usage of PRP for lateral epicondylitis despite finding statistically significant improvements in pain and functional outcomes.

### N of 1, two contemporary arm, randomised controlled clinical trial for bilateral epicondylitis: a new study design [^112NkhqX]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

At end of the trial, both arms were almost pain-free, but the drop in pain in the treated arm was greater than in the control arm. This allows several different conclusions to be drawn on efficacy of platelet lysate in chronic refractory epicondylitis:

1) It is effective, since drop in pain was steeper in the treated arm
2) It is not effective, and improvement was due to the natural course of lateral epicondylitis
3) It is effective, and the parallel improvement in the untreated arm could have been mediated by the improvement in the treated arm, by allowing a more equal distribution of workload
4) Both arms benefited from participation into a clinical trial
5) More studies are needed.

### Initial PROMIS scores correlate with operative and nonoperative management of lateral epicondylitis [^113H2uzp]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a common source of elbow pain. Treatment options include physical therapy (PT), corticosteroid injection, or surgery, but the efficacy of each remains unclear. In this study, we compare Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores between patients treated both operatively and nonoperatively for LE.

Methods

Patients presenting to a tertiary academic medical center from February 2015 to December 2018 with a diagnosis of LE were identified. Those with initial and follow-up PROMIS physical function (PF), pain interference (PI), and Depression scores were included and stratified according to treatment. Single-factor analysis of variance testing was used to compare PROMIS scores between intervention types.

Results

In all, 982 patients were initially identified with the diagnosis of LE and documented PROMIS scores. Initial treatment consisted of 266 patients receiving formal PT, 238 patients receiving injections, 20 patients undergoing surgery, and 296 patients receiving no formal treatment. At final follow-up, 235 (44.8%) patients had been treated with isolated PT, 237 (45.1%) with injections, and 52 (9.9%) with surgery. Patients who underwent formal PT had the highest initial PF scores when compared with all other interventions. Patients who underwent operative management had higher initial PI scores than those who pursued nonoperative management.

Conclusions

Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PF and PI may be useful for determining which treatment course patients suffering from LE are likely to pursue. Pain as a limiting factor in daily living may be a better indication for operative management as opposed to physical metrics.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^114kPPvw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses'(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each relevant article.

### Autologous blood and platelet-rich plasma injection therapy for lateral elbow pain [^1178q91o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are commonly used to treat lateral elbow pain (also known as tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis or epicondylalgia). Based on animal models and observational studies, these injections may modulate tendon injury healing, but randomised controlled trials have reported inconsistent results regarding benefit for people with lateral elbow pain.

Objectives

To review current evidence on the benefit and safety of autologous whole blood or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection for treatment of people with lateral elbow pain.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for published trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal for ongoing trials, on 18 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing autologous whole blood or PRP injection therapy to another therapy (placebo or active treatment, including non-pharmacological therapies, and comparison between PRP and autologous blood) for lateral elbow pain. The primary comparison was PRP versus placebo. Major outcomes were pain relief (≥ 30% or ≥ 50%), mean pain, mean function, treatment success, quality of life, withdrawal due to adverse events, and adverse events; the primary time point was three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 studies with 2337 participants; 56% of participants were female, mean age varied between 36 and 53 years, and mean duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 22 months. Seven trials had three intervention arms. Ten trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection to placebo injection (primary comparison). Fifteen trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection to glucocorticoid injection. Four studies compared autologous blood to PRP. Two trials compared autologous blood or PRP injection plus tennis elbow strap and exercise versus tennis elbow strap and exercise alone. Two trials compared PRP injection to surgery, and one trial compared PRP injection and dry needling to dry needling alone. Other comparisons include autologous blood versus extracorporeal shock wave therapy; PRP versus arthroscopic surgery; PRP versus laser; and autologous blood versus polidocanol. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases, mainly due to inadequate allocation concealment and lack of participant blinding. We found moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) to show that autologous blood or PRP injection probably does not provide clinically significant improvement in pain or function compared with placebo injection at three months. Further, low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests that PRP may not increase risk for adverse events. We are uncertain whether autologous blood or PRP injection improves treatment success (downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness) or withdrawals due to adverse events (downgraded for bias and twice for imprecision). No studies measured health-related quality of life, and no studies reported pain relief (> 30% or 50%) at three months. At three months, mean pain was 3.7 points (0 to 10; 0 is best) with placebo and 0.16 points better (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 better to 0.29 worse; 8 studies, 523 participants) with autologous blood or PRP injection, for absolute improvement of 1.6% better (6% better to 3% worse). At three months, mean function was 27.5 points (0 to 100; 0 is best) with placebo and 1.86 points better (95% CI 4.9 better to 1.25 worse; 8 studies, 502 participants) with autologous blood or PRP injection, for absolute benefit of 1.9% (5% better to 1% worse), and treatment success was 121 out of 185 (65%) with placebo versus 125 out of 187 (67%) with autologous blood or PRP injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.00; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; 4 studies, 372 participants), for absolute improvement of 0% (11.1% lower to 12.4% higher). Regarding harm, we found very low-certainty evidence to suggest that we are uncertain whether withdrawal rates due to adverse events differed. Low-certainty evidence suggests that autologous blood or PRP injection may not increase adverse events compared with placebo injection. Withdrawal due to adverse events occurred in 3 out of 39 (8%) participants treated with placebo versus 1 out of 41 (2%) treated with autologous blood or PRP injection (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.92; 1 study), for an absolute difference of 5.2% fewer (7.5% fewer to 14.8% more). Adverse event rates were 35 out of 208 (17%) with placebo versus 41 out of 217 (19%) with autologous blood or PRP injection (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; 5 studies; 425 participants), for an absolute difference of 2.4% more (4% fewer to 12% more). At six and twelve months, no clinically important benefit for mean pain or function was observed with autologous blood or PRP injection compared with placebo injection.

Authors' Conclusions

Data in this review do not support the use of autologous blood or PRP injection for treatment of lateral elbow pain. These injections probably provide little or no clinically important benefit for pain or function (moderate-certainty evidence), and it is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence) whether they improve treatment success and pain relief > 50%, or increase withdrawal due to adverse events. Although risk for harm may not be increased compared with placebo injection (low-certainty evidence), injection therapies cause pain and carry a small risk of infection. With no evidence of benefit, the costs and risks are not justified.

### The effect of impactful articles on clinical practice in the United States: corticosteroid injection for patients with lateral epicondylitis [^113siYpr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Following publication of high-level evidence demonstrating that it is not an effective treatment for lateral epicondylitis, a reduction in the corticosteroid injection rate would be expected. The authors aimed to clarify current clinical practice pattern for lateral epicondylitis and identify factors that influence the introduction of evidence into clinical practice.

Methods

In this administrative claims analysis, the authors used 2009 to 2015 Truven MarketScan data to extract claims for corticosteroid injection, physical therapy, platelet-rich plasma injection, and surgery for lateral epicondylitis. The authors performed multivariable analysis using a generalized estimating equation model to identify the variables that potentially affect the odds of receiving a given treatment.

Results

Among 711,726 claims, the authors found that the odds of receiving a corticosteroid injection increased slightly after publication of contradictory evidence (OR, 1.7; 95 percent CI, 1.04 to 1.11 in 2015). Being male (OR, 1.21; 95 percent CI, 1.19 to 1.23), older (OR, 1.16; 95 percent CI, 1.13 to 1.19), and having managed care insurance (OR, 1.15; 95 percent CI, 1.13 to 1.18) significantly contributed to increased odds of receiving corticosteroid injections. Patients seen at facilities in the South (OR, 1.33; 95 percent CI, 1.30 to 1.36 compared with the Northeast) and by plastic/orthopedic surgeons (OR, 2.48; 95 percent CI, 2.43 to 2.52) also had increased odds of receiving corticosteroid injection.

Conclusions

Corticosteroid injection use did not decrease after publication of impactful articles, regardless of provider specialty or other patient-related factors. This finding emphasizes that there are various barriers for even high-level evidence to overcome the inertia of current practice.

### Counterforce bracing of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^112zNXgj]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Counterforce bracing is one of the common treatment modalities for tennis elbow. The objective of this study was to determine whether counterforce bracing offers any additional benefit over placebo bracing in the treatment of tennis elbow.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigated the use of counterforce bracing (n = 17) compared with placebo bracing (n = 14) in the management of acute tennis elbow. Outcome measures included patient-rated pain and functional outcomes, epicondyle tenderness, and strength at 6 months and long term. Follow-up occurred at 2, 6, 12, and 26 weeks, as well as long term (mean follow-up, 3 years). The study duration was 5 years.

Results

The 2 groups, counterforce and placebo, were similar in age, sex, hand dominance, and duration of symptoms. Both braces improved patient-rated pain frequency and severity (P < .01), difficulty with picking up objects and twisting motions, and overall elbow function (P < .001) at 6 months and 3 years. Both braces also improved lateral epicondyle tenderness, grip strength (P < .01), and modified ORI-TETS (Orthopaedic Research Institute-Tennis Elbow Testing System) force (P < .05) at 6 months. Significant intergroup differences were detected for frequency of pain at rest at 6 and 12 weeks (P < .05), level of pain at rest at 2 weeks (P < .001), and patient-rated overall elbow function at 26 weeks (P = .041).

Conclusion

The counterforce brace provides significant reduction in the frequency and severity of pain in the short term (2–12 weeks), as well as overall elbow function at 26 weeks, compared with the placebo brace.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^115xyyD4]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multispecialty guideline summarizes the existing evidence for use of injectable biologics to treat various chronic pain indications, including their mechanisms of action, best peri-procedural practices to optimize injectate yield and treatment outcomes, ethical considerations, and adverse events. Further, we appraised the available evidence by providing a list of consensus points with level of evidence and degree of recommendation. Per the Delphi method, these consensus points achieved > 80% consensus among the expert panel. This guideline builds on the foundation from prior guidelines on injectable biologics for low back painand on the use of PRP.

An important theme of this guideline is the mechanism of action of injectable biologics, which is specific to the type of biologic. While improvement in anatomical findings (eg OA or osteochondral defects) have been demonstrated after infiltration with injectable biologics in some studies, regeneration of new body tissue and healing of anatomical defects have not been consistently observed in every study. The improvement in pain intensity and physical functioning after treatment with injectable biologics is likely multifactorial, with a significant component attributed to promotion and secretion of cytokines, growth factors, and other cells that reduce the pro-inflammatory milieu. While this may not necessarily mean that the injected area will return to its pre-degenerative status, the injected biologic may function as an immunomodulator and may attenuate catabolic pathways, improve influx of nutrients, and stabilize the mechanical loading properties.

Another theme of this guideline was the high uncertainty of evidence for using injectable biologics for chronic pain indications. This partly relates to the lack of data on clear description of patient demographics, disease severity, and injectable biologic characteristics (eg, platelet/MSC count, leukocyte profile, preparation methods, etc). Our guideline highlights that if conservative treatments such as physical therapy have been exhausted, injectable biologics may be a reasonable approach for some indications including lateral epicondylitis, knee OA, shoulder OA, plantar fasciitis, and SIJ arthritis. However, we emphasize the need for additional high-quality, double-blinded, prospectively designed RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of injectable biologics versus other non-operative injectable treatments such as corticosteroid and HA injections. Further, due to the lack of standardization in technique, preparation, and administration of injectable biologics, we call for future trials to clearly report these elements.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections and other injections for management of tendinopathy: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1157siAr]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Few evidence-based treatment guidelines for tendinopathy exist. We undertook a systematic review of randomised trials to establish clinical efficacy and risk of adverse events for treatment by injection.

Methods

We searched eight databases without language, publication, or date restrictions. We included randomised trials assessing efficacy of one or more peritendinous injections with placebo or non-surgical interventions for tendinopathy, scoring more than 50% on the modified physiotherapy evidence database scale. We undertook meta-analyses with a random-effects model, and estimated relative risk and standardised mean differences (SMDs). The primary outcome of clinical efficacy was protocol-defined pain score in the short term (4 weeks, range 0–12), intermediate term (26 weeks, 13–26), or long term (52 weeks, ≥ 52). Adverse events were also reported.

Findings

3824 trials were identified and 41 met inclusion criteria, providing data for 2672 participants. We showed consistent findings between many high-quality randomised controlled trials that corticosteroid injections reduced pain in the short term compared with other interventions, but this effect was reversed at intermediate and long terms. For example, in pooled analysis of treatment for lateral epicondylalgia, corticosteroid injection had a large effect (defined as SMD > 0·8) on reduction of pain compared with no intervention in the short term (SMD 1·44, 95% CI 1·17–1·71, p < 0·0001), but no intervention was favoured at intermediate term (-0·40, -0·67 to -0·14, p < 0·003) and long term (-0·31, -0·61 to -0·01, p = 0·05). Short-term efficacy of corticosteroid injections for rotator-cuff tendinopathy is not clear. Of 991 participants who received corticosteroid injections in studies that reported adverse events, only one (0·1%) had a serious adverse event (tendon rupture). By comparison with placebo, reductions in pain were reported after injections of sodium hyaluronate (short [3·91, 3·54–4·28, p < 0·0001], intermediate [2·89, 2·58–3·20, p < 0·0001], and long [3·91, 3·55–4·28, p < 0·0001] terms), botulinum toxin (short term [1·23, 0·67–1·78, p < 0·0001]), and prolotherapy (intermediate term [2·62, 1·36–3·88, p < 0·0001]) for treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. Lauromacrogol (polidocanol), aprotinin, and platelet-rich plasma were not more efficacious than was placebo for Achilles tendinopathy, while prolotherapy was not more effective than was eccentric exercise.

Interpretation

Despite the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in the short term, non-corticosteroid injections might be of benefit for long-term treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. However, response to injection should not be generalised because of variation in effect between sites of tendinopathy.

Funding

None.

### Comparison of autologous blood, corticosteroid, and saline injection in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study [^114LVidX]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared saline, corticosteroid, and autologous blood injections for lateral epicondylitis in a prospective, blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The null hypothesis was that patient-rated outcomes after autologous blood injection would not be superior to corticosteroid and saline injections.

Methods

Patients with clinically diagnosed lateral epicondylitis of less than 6 months' duration were randomized into 1 of 3 groups to receive a 3-mL injection of saline and lidocaine, corticosteroid and lidocaine, or autologous blood and lidocaine. Of 34 subjects who enrolled, 28 completed follow-up. A total of 10 were randomized to the saline group, 9 to the autologous blood group, and 9 to the steroid group. Every participant had 3 mL blood drawn, and the injection syringe was foil-covered to prevent the subject from knowing the contents. The primary outcome measure was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. Patients completed a pain visual analog scale, DASH, and the Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation before injection and at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months after injection. We performed statistical analysis using repeated measures of analyses of variance.

Results

There were no significant differences in DASH scores among the 3 groups at 2- and 6-month follow-up points, with the mean scores for saline at 20 and 10, respectively, compared with 28 and 20 for autologous blood and 28 and 13 for steroid injections. Secondary measures showed similar findings, with outcomes scores showing improvement in all 3 groups.

Conclusions

In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, autologous blood, corticosteroid, and saline injection provide no advantage over placebo saline injections in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Patients within each injection group demonstrated improved outcome scores over a 6-month period.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^116yw9on]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Mishra and Pavelkohad the most-cited article (332 citations), with the second highest citation density (33.2 citations per year), followed by the landmark publication on the surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis by Nirschl et al(314 citations). Mishra and Pavelkoinvestigated the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections as a modality for the nonsurgical management of lateral epicondylitis. Previously, nonsurgical management involved rest, NSAID medications, bracing treatment, physical therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and botulinum toxin; however, the superiority and efficacy of these treatments are unclear. This article's position as a platform for the continued evaluation of PRP therapy can explain its high citation number. This claim is further supported by the inclusion of four other articles on our list comparing PRP with other injectable modalities (ie, corticosteroids, whole blood, and saline). This includes the randomized controlled trial by Perbooms et alcomparing PRP with corticosteroid injections for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, which was found to have the highest citation density in this investigation (34.0 citations per year). These authors found that PRP was more effective than corticosteroids, with regard to pain reduction and increased function, with 24% and 22% more patients treated with PRP having improved visual analog scale and Disabilities of the Arm and Shoulder scale scores, respectively.

### Strong evidence against platelet-rich plasma injections for chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy: a systematic review [^114xBsBb]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy is frequent in athletes, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is being used increasingly in its treatment.

Objective

To systematically review the literature on the efficacy of PRP injections for chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy.

Methods

The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Medline OvidSP, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched in October 2013. Inclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy, a randomised controlled trial, an intervention with a PRP injection and the outcome measures described in terms of pain and/or function. One author screened the search results and two authors independently assessed the study quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) score. A study was considered to be of high quality if its PEDro score was ≥ 6. A best evidence synthesis was used to identify the level of evidence.

Results

6 studies were included, of which four were considered to be of high quality. Three high-quality studies (75%) and two low-quality studies showed no significant benefit at the final follow-up measurement or predefined primary outcome score when compared with a control group. One high-quality study (25%) showed a beneficial effect of a PRP injection when compared with a corticosteroid injection (corticosteroid injections are harmful in tendinopathy). Based on the best evidence synthesis, there is strong evidence that PRP injections are not efficacious in chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy.

Conclusions

There is strong evidence that PRP injections are not efficacious in the management of chronic lateral elbow tendinopathy.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^117Ac6RJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to report current trends in CS usage for the treatment of LE. We found a notable decrease in the utilization of this treatment modality, from 23.3% in 2010 to 18.8% of patients in 2017, with notable decreases occurring every 1 to 2 years throughout this period. In addition, our study showed a notable increase in the mean number of injections received per patient from 1.33 in 2010 to 1.83 in 2017.

Overall, these findings demonstrate a change in physician practice for the nonsurgical treatment of LE. This is especially evident given the lack of similar declines in alternative treatment modalities such as bracing treatment and PT and suggests this is a specific trend. We suggest this trend may reflect the increasing quantity of impactful studies indicating the lack of efficacy of this treatment modality for long-term cases. In addition to the studies by Coombes et al, other investigations have found evidence of CS injections having similar detrimental effects on tendinopathies of the rotator cuff, Achilles, and patellar tendon. These findings of increased incidences of symptom recurrence and pain exacerbation were first reported for LE as early as 1990.

However, these earlier findings likely failed to change physician practice in treatment of tennis elbow at their time of publication because of small sample sizes and the lack of contemporary publications on the same topics. Reported CS utilization for tennis elbow varied heavily in the early 1990s between 14% and 38%. This variation persists in more recent studies, with 17% to 40% of tennis elbow patients receiving injections as recently as 2016.

Although our study shows a decrease in overall utilization of CS in our population, this change is unlikely to be ubiquitous among providers, as demonstrated by observed increase in the number of injections received per patient throughout the same 8-year period. Previous database studies have shown a relative increase in utilization of CS injections and decrease in utilization of physiotherapy among physicians treating LE. Among plastic and orthopaedic surgeons, CS injection use for tennis elbow increased from 550 per 1,000 treatments in 2009 to 663 per 1,000 treatments in 2015, whereas use of PT decreased from 406 per 1,000 treatments to 300 per 1,000 treatments over the same span. These findings, in conjunction with our own, indicate two important changes in physician practices in treatment of LE.

### Platelet concentration explains variability in outcomes of platelet-rich plasma for lateral epicondylitis: a high dose is critical for a positive response: a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression [^1153FicN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the management of lateral epicondylitis (LE) have been characterized by substantial variability in reported outcomes. The source of this heterogeneity is uncertain.

Purpose

To determine the effect of estimated platelet concentration on the efficacy of PRP for the management of LE.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

All RCTs evaluating the efficacy of PRP in managing LE were identified. RCTs were classified according to whether the study documented a platelet concentration factor of PRP representing a greater than 3-fold increase over whole blood or a supraphysiological platelet dose (high-dose vs low-dose PRP). The primary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in the visual analog scale (VAS) score at latest follow-up. Random-effects and mixed-effects meta-analyses were performed, and meta-regression was used to evaluate whether differences in outcomes after treatment with PRP could be explained by differences in the concentration of PRP used.

Results

Overall, 13 RCTs with a total of 791 patients were included in this analysis, with 5 that utilized low-dose PRP and 8 that used high-dose PRP. Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies that used high-dose PRP resulted in an MD of -1.31 (95% CI, -1.87 to -0.75) in favor of PRP over all alternative treatment strategies (P < .001). Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies that used low-dose PRP resulted in an MD of 0.08 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.68), suggesting no difference in the effect between PRP and all alternative treatment strategies (P = .79). The platelet concentration factor of PRP used in each RCT was found to be strongly predictive of the VAS score at final follow-up in meta-regression (P < .001), with 58.5% of the heterogeneity in the outcomes of PRP between studies explained by the platelet concentration factor alone.

Conclusion

The platelet concentration of PRP may play a significant role in the outcomes of patients with LE. A direct linear relationship was observed between the platelet concentration factor of PRP used and the magnitude of patient-reported symptom relief after the management of LE with PRP. Clinicians should ensure a supraphysiological platelet concentration when preparing PRP for the management of LE.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^114ZfAdJ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Lateral epicondylosis and olecranon bursitis — recommendations (Box 4): For lateral epicondylosis, an administration of corticosteroid injection (CSI) may be considered for short-term treatment of pain unless contraindicated (Grade C). For non-septic olecranon bursitis, aspiration with injection of corticosteroid may be offered (Grade B), and aspiration followed by CSI is described as safe and potentially providing earlier symptom improvement; level of certainty is low.

### Efficacy of platelet-rich plasma injections for symptomatic tendinopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised injection-controlled trials [^117E5jB6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

The sample sizes of most PRP studies for symptomatic tendinopathy were too small to statistically detect clinically meaningful treatment effects. To detect the effect size of PRP observed in this meta-analysis, a sample size of 146 patients (73 per group) would be required. In this review, only 1 of 18 groups enrolled at least this number of patients. In fact, the median sample size in this review was only 35 patients. This observation likely explains why many individual studies showed no benefit of PRP, yet the results of the pooled analysis showed a statistically significant, moderate benefit relative to control injections.

A similar observation can be made about the systematic review by de Vos et al who concluded that there was strong evidence against PRP for chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy. This conclusion was based on the observation that only one of six included studies showed a positive benefit of PRP, yet no attempt was made at quantitative data synthesis. (What was the effect size and direction of the analysis when you reviewed it?) These results underscore the need for investigators to perform power analyses with realistic assumptions during study planning and for systematic reviewers to consider meta-analytic techniques, where appropriate, to quantify treatment effects with more precision than simple counts of positive studies.

### The therapeutic benefits of saline solution injection for lateral epicondylitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing saline injections with nonsurgical injection therapies [^116nXK6Q]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To quantify the effect of saline solution injections on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and to determine whether this effect is clinically relevant by comparing it with minimal clinically important difference (MCID) criteria.

Methods

A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials of lateral epicondylitis interventions comparing saline solution injections with nonsurgical injection therapies. Among included studies, saline solution was compared with platelet-rich plasma, autologous conditioned plasma, corticosteroid, and botulinum toxin injections. By use of data from included studies, a random-effects model was used to calculate overall mean differences (MDs) in pre- and post-injection PROMs in a pair-wise fashion. Calculated MDs were then compared with MCID criteria.

Results

Of 458 identified studies, 10 met the inclusion criteria and encompassed 283 patients. At 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, statistically significant improvements in MDs in visual analog scale (VAS) scores were noted as follows: MD of 16.11 (95% confidence interval, 8.29–23.93) at 1 month; MD of 22.50 (95% CI, 11.45–33.55) at 3 months; MD of 40.40 (95% CI, 27.48–53.32) at 6 months; and MD of 47.04 (95% CI, 39.43–54.66) at 12 months. At 6 months, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores showed a statistically significant improvement (MD, 23.92; 95% CI, 9.47–38.37).

Conclusions

Improvements in Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores at 6 months (23.92) surpassed MCID criteria for conservatively managed upper-extremity musculoskeletal pathology (10.83)-suggesting that saline solution injections have a clinically relevant effect. VAS MCID criteria are poorly established, but VAS scores at 6 and 12 months surpassed MCID criteria for conservative treatments for common orthopaedic conditions. In all but 1 study, no statistically significant difference in PROMs was found between saline solution and non-saline solution injections.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, meta-analysis of Level I and II randomized controlled trials.

### Ongoing positive effect of platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroid injection in lateral epicondylitis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^113dmj82]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been shown to be a general stimulation for repair and 1-year results showed promising success percentages.

Purpose

This trial was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of PRP compared with corticosteroid injections in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis with a 2-year follow-up.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

The trial was conducted in 2 Dutch teaching hospitals. One hundred patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis were randomly assigned to a leukocyte-enriched PRP group (n = 51) or the corticosteroid group (n = 49). Randomization and allocation to the trial group were carried out by a central computer system. Patients received either a corticosteroid injection or an autologous platelet concentrate injection through a peppering needling technique. The primary analysis included visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome scores.

Results

The PRP group was more often successfully treated than the corticosteroid group (P < .0001). Success was defined as a reduction of 25% on VAS or DASH scores without a reintervention after 2 years. When baseline VAS and DASH scores were compared with the scores at 2-year follow-up, both groups significantly improved across time (intention-to-treat principle). However, the DASH scores of the corticosteroid group returned to baseline levels, while those of the PRP group significantly improved (as-treated principle). There were no complications related to the use of PRP.

Conclusion

Treatment of patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis with PRP reduces pain and increases function significantly, exceeding the effect of corticosteroid injection even after a follow-up of 2 years. Future decisions for application of PRP for lateral epicondylitis should be confirmed by further follow-up from this trial and should take into account possible costs and harms as well as benefits.

### The effects of splinting on outcomes for epicondylitis [^116TphG8]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of splinting on outcomes for injured workers with epicondylitis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study using propensity score methodology to statistically control for all observed pretreatment differences between patients with and without splints.

Setting

Nationwide network of 253 occupational medicine clinics.

Participants

All injured workers (N = 4614) receiving primary care for lateral or medical epicondylitis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes 726.31 or 726.32).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Physician-prescribed rates of duty restrictions and lost time, treatment duration, specialist referrals, and medical and physical therapy (PT) visits and charges.

Results

Overall, patients with splints had higher rates of limited duty (P < .001), more medical visits and charges (P < .001), higher total charges (medical and PT, P < .001), and longer treatment durations (P < .01) than patients without splints. Evaluating differences for patients who did and did not receive PT, significant differences remained for rates of limited duty (P < .05), medical visits (P < .01), and medical charges (P < .01).

Conclusions

Splinting patients with epicondylitis may not optimize outcomes, including rates of limited duty, treatment duration, and medical costs.

### An alternative approach to treating lateral epicondylitis. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study [^113k4M9x]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of noxious level electrical stimulation on pain, grip strength and functional abilities in subjects with chronic lateral epicondylitis.

Design

Randomized, placebo-control, double-blinded study.

Setting

Physical Therapy Department, North Georgia College and State University.

Subjects

Eighteen subjects with chronic lateral epicondylitis between the ages of 24 and 72 years participated in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned into treatment or placebo groups.

Interventions

Subjects received six sessions of low-frequency electrical stimulation over the palpated tender points. The intensity of electrical stimulation was set at 0 in the placebo group.

Main Measurements

Grip strength, functional status, pain intensity and limited activity due to pain were assessed before and after treatment. Six-month follow-up data were collected in treatment group only.

Results

Both clinically and statistically significant improvements in average grip strength were found (treatment group: 28% increase; placebo group: 2.5% decrease; P = 0.04), functional activity (treatment group: 110% increase; placebo group: 22% increase; P = 0.003), pain intensity (treatment group: 3.1 point decrease; placebo group: 0.2 point increase; P = 0.01) and activity limitation due to pain (treatment group: 4.1 points increase; placebo group: 1.9 point decrease; P = 0.003) between the treatment and placebo groups. Follow-up data showed that 100% of subjects maintained the improved function, and 83% remained pain-free for at least six months post treatment.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicated that symptoms of chronic lateral epicondylitis could be effectively treated by noxious level low-frequency electrical stimulation.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^112PqCnB]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), also known as tennis elbow or lateral elbow tendinopathy, is an overuse injury of the short extensor of the wrist (extensor carpi radialis brevis), and a common cause of pain in the lateral side of the elbow. The etiology of LE is not completely understood, but it is assumed that overuse leads to increased tenocyte proliferation and production of ground substance.

LE is most prevalent among people of working age between 20 and 65 years. It is a frequently reported condition in several working populations, such as computer users, manufacturing workers, and service workers.LE might become a chronic disorder, as, for example, a study of Nilson et al. showed that 54% and 55% of patients respectively still experienced pain and function loss after 2 years.LE can result in loss of function, such as decreased handgrip strength. As a result, LE can lead to the long‐term and frequent sick leave of workers, and potential productivity loss. As recovery can take more than a year, LE in workers puts a high burden on society.

While there are several treatment options for LE, such as corticosteroids injections and platelet‐rich plasma injections and surgery, evidence on the effectiveness of these treatments is inconclusive. As the majority of cases of LE are self‐limiting when the patient avoids aggravating activities, the prevention of overuse that causes LE is crucial. Effective interventions to prevent work‐related LE should be based on evidence‐based risk factors. This indicates that knowledge of the risk factors of LE is needed to implement appropriate preventive measures.

Recently, three systematic reviews addressed risk factors associated with LE. Sayampanathan et al. found that personal risk factors, such as female sex and having a smoking history, were associated with LE. However, this study did not report on work‐related risk factors. The study of Curti et al. concluded that limited evidence was found for a causal relationship between occupational exposure to biomechanical risk factors and LE based on a qualitative best‐evidence data synthesis. This review did not provide a meta‐analysis. Moreover, not only were prospective cohort studies included — one of the preferred designs in etiological studies — but case referent and cross‐sectional studies were, too. These same two limitations are applicable to the systematic review of Seidel et al. who wrote about work‐related physical risk factors.

### Comparison of extracorporeal shock-wave therapy and wrist-extensor splint application in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis: a prospective randomized controlled study [^114kffPv]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a common disease characterized by decreased grip and upper-extremity strength, along with pain on the outside of the elbow. It is pathology of the musculoskeletal system, secondary to recurrent microtrauma because of overuse of the upper extremity, causing pain and tenderness in the elbow area.–It is also known as "tennis elbow", and is observed in 5%–10% of tennis players. The annual incidence in the population is 1%–3%, with people aged 35–50 years and older being most commonly affected. Clinically, it is characterized by pain radiating from the lateral aspect of the elbow to the forearm and loss of function because of decrease in grip strength secondary to tenderness and pain at compression in the lateral epicondyle, and it is more frequently seen in the dominant hand.

Conservative approaches or surgical therapy can be used in the treatment of LE. The purpose of conservative treatment is to decrease pain, control inflammation, accelerate healing, and ensure that the patient performs daily life activities smoothly. While progressive strengthening is the most commonly used method among conservative treatment methods, other methods include watchful waiting, local injection, ultrasound, manipulation, manual therapy, Cyrax, lateral glide technique, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT), laser, splinting, resting, hot–cold application, electrotherapy, massage, and oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recently, ESWT has been used more commonly than other treatment methods, because it is noninvasive, well tolerated by patients, and has fewer side effects. However, the efficacy of ESWT in LE is controversial. Some studies have reported that ESWT is barely effective or as effective as placebo in LE. However, some other studies have reported that it is quite effective and could even be an alternative to surgery.

### Positive effect of an autologous platelet concentrate in lateral epicondylitis in a double-blind randomized controlled trial: platelet-rich plasma versus corticosteroid injection with a 1-year follow-up [^114jBUeD]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has shown to be a general stimulation for repair. Purpose To determine the effectiveness of PRP compared with corticosteroid injections in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Patients

The trial was conducted in 2 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. One hundred patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis were randomly assigned in the PRP group (n = 51) or the corticosteroid group (n = 49). A central computer system carried out randomization and allocation to the trial group. Patients were randomized to receive either a corticosteroid injection or an autologous platelet concentrate injection through a peppering technique. The primary analysis included visual analog scores and DASH Outcome Measure scores (DASH: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand).

Results

Successful treatment was defined as more than a 25% reduction in visual analog score or DASH score without a reintervention after 1 year. The results showed that, according to the visual analog scores, 24 of the 49 patients (49%) in the corticosteroid group and 37 of the 51 patients (73%) in the PRP group were successful, which was significantly different (P < .001). Furthermore, according to the DASH scores, 25 of the 49 patients (51%) in the corticosteroid group and 37 of the 51 patients (73%) in the PRP group were successful, which was also significantly different (P = .005). The corticosteroid group was better initially and then declined, whereas the PRP group progressively improved.

Conclusion

Treatment of patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis with PRP reduces pain and significantly increases function, exceeding the effect of corticosteroid injection. Future decisions for application of the PRP for lateral epicondylitis should be confirmed by further follow-up from this trial and should take into account possible costs and harms as well as benefits.

### Economic evaluation favours physiotherapy but not corticosteroid injection as a first-line intervention for chronic lateral epicondylalgia: evidence from a randomised clinical trial [^115c8nY2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy and a combination of these interventions, compared to a reference group receiving a blinded placebo injection.

Methods

165 adults with unilateral lateral epicondylalgia of longer than 6weeks duration from Brisbane, Australia, were randomised for concealed allocation to saline injection (placebo), corticosteroid injection, saline injection plus physiotherapy (eight sessions of elbow manipulation and exercise) or corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy. Costs to society and health-related quality of life (estimated by EuroQol-5D) over the 1year follow-up were used to generate incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratios for each intervention relative to placebo.

Results

Intention-to-treat analysis was possible for 154 (93%) of trial participants. Physiotherapy was more costly, but was the only intervention that produced a statistically significant improvement in quality of life relative to placebo (MD, 95% CI 0.035, 0.003 to 0.068). Similar cost/QALY ratios were found for physiotherapy ($A29343; GBP18962) and corticosteroid injection ($A31750; GBP20518); however, the probability of being more cost-effective than placebo at values above $A50000 per quality-adjusted life year was 81% for physiotherapy and 53% for corticosteroid injection. Cost/QALY was far greater for a combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy ($A228000; GBP147340).

Summary

Physiotherapy was a cost-effective treatment for lateral epicondylalgia. Corticosteroid injection was associated with greater variability, and a lower probability of being cost-effective if a willingness to pay threshold of $A50000 is assumed. A combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy was ineffective and cost-ineffective. Physiotherapy, not corticosteroid injection, should be considered as a first-line intervention for lateral epicondylalgia.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^111rq6WW]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the Evidence Basis for Variants of Standard Platelet Biologics?

Due to the variability of the different PRP products and production protocols (eg, preparation, dosing, delivery), as well as lack of clear description of PRP components in studies, there is no consensus regarding the most appropriate PRP product to administer for each specific pathology. Research is warranted to determine best practices regarding the number of injections needed per pathology, the interval of multiple injections, dose-effect with platelet concentration, best practices for LR-PRP versus LP-PRP products, the need for exogenous platelet activation, and the use of local anesthetics which may reduce the pain associated with the procedure but also may have a negative effect on platelet function.

Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP)

ACP is a specific commercially available preparation of PRP, consisting of a single-spin LP-PRP injectate (ACP, Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA). As this is an LP-PRP, it would be expected to have similar beneficial use as other LP-PRP preparations. There has been minimal evidence to support that ACP has specific use or benefit over other PRP preparations. In a study of ACP in knee OA, intra-articular injections of ACP had mixed results, suggesting possible benefit over HA. However, real-world data has not demonstrated clinically beneficial effects from ACP in pain or functional outcome scores. Overall, there is insufficient evidence supporting the use of ACP over other PRP preparations, or for its specific use for musculoskeletal conditions.

Leukocyte-Rich PRP

There is debate on the utility of including leukocytes in PRP preparations due to potential for secreted cytokines to cause inflammation. However, these preparations may also have potential in preventing infection and improving healing. The evidence to support the optimal leukocyte concentration in PRP formulations is controversial and has not been well-established in vivo. In tendon pathology, a laboratory study suggests that LR-PRP may be superior to LP-PRP on tenocyte proliferation. This is contrary to in vitro studies that suggest the opposite effect. A three-arm comparison of LR-PRP versus LP-PRP versus saline showed no difference in all three treatment groups in patellar tendinopathy, with all three cohorts demonstrating similar benefit at 1 year. This is consistent with a study of lateral epicondylitis, in which LR-PRP, LP-PRP, and saline cohorts had similar favorable outcomes at 8 weeks.

### Local injection treatment for lateral epicondylitis [^116v8qZb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

In a prospective randomized study of lateral epicondylitis, 120 patients were treated with 2 mL lidocaine (Group A, n = 60) or 1 mL lidocaine combined with 1 mL triamcinolone (Group B, n = 60). All injections were done using the peppering technique: after inserting the needle the tender area was peppered with 40 to 50 injections by injecting, withdrawing, redirecting, and reinserting without emerging from the skin. All patients were followed up for 1 year. Fifty-six patients in Group A and 57 patients in Group B had excellent results. There was statistically no difference between the groups. Both groups had excellent results and because the injection of local anesthetics is known to have no long-term effect in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis, the peppering technique seems to be a reliable method of treatment.
