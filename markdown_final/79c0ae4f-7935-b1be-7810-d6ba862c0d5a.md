## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which metabolic process is most directly inhibited by increased malonyl-CoA in skeletal muscle during hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and to choose among fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, or glycogenolysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what malonyl-CoA is and where it is generated. Then, I should verify its canonical regulatory target in muscle. Next, I will consider the physiological context of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and how that alters malonyl-CoA levels. After that, I need to check whether malonyl-CoA directly inhibits the other options or only indirectly affects them. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely answer and confirm it against the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical identity and location of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) from acetyl-CoA and is a key intermediate in fatty acid synthesis; importantly, in muscle, ACC2 localizes near mitochondria and generates malonyl-CoA that regulates mitochondrial fatty acid handling, which is distinct from ACC1 in lipogenic tissues [^113NFGBF].

> Wait, let me verify the canonical target of malonyl-CoA in muscle. Multiple sources converge on carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) as the primary target: malonyl-CoA allosterically inhibits CPT1, thereby blocking mitochondrial uptake and β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. This is a direct, well-established regulatory mechanism in muscle and other oxidative tissues [^115ixoo9] [^113NFGBF].

> I need to check the physiological context next. Hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia increases glucose flux and insulin signaling, which activates ACC and increases malonyl-CoA in skeletal muscle; this has been demonstrated in human studies and aligns with the Randle cycle concept where high glucose availability suppresses fatty acid oxidation via malonyl-CoA–mediated CPT1 inhibition [^113zXPbn] [^112ipkkG] [^113R8zdu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the other options. I should confirm whether malonyl-CoA directly inhibits fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, or glycogenolysis. Malonyl-CoA is a substrate for fatty acid synthase and is not an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis; rather, ACC activity and malonyl-CoA generation are upstream of synthesis, so option B is incorrect. Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are hepatic processes regulated by insulin and glucagon, not directly by malonyl-CoA; while insulin suppresses both, malonyl-CoA does not directly inhibit their enzymatic steps, making C and D incorrect as direct targets of malonyl-CoA.

> Let me synthesize and double-check the causal chain. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase ACC activity and malonyl-CoA in muscle; elevated malonyl-CoA directly inhibits CPT1, which reduces mitochondrial fatty acid import and β-oxidation; this preserves fatty acids for storage and coordinates substrate use toward glucose oxidation, consistent with human metabolic flexibility data and insulin-resistant phenotypes where malonyl-CoA is elevated and fatty acid oxidation is suppressed [^113zXPbn] [^111MN6wn] [^113R8zdu].

> Conclusion: The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation by allosteric inhibition of CPT1, so the correct answer is A. Fatty acid oxidation [^112PQ7s3] [^115ixoo9] [^113NFGBF].

---

The correct answer is **A. Fatty acid oxidation**. Malonyl-CoA is a potent allosteric inhibitor of **CPT-1**, the rate-limiting enzyme for mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation. In hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, **ACC activity rises**, increasing malonyl-CoA and thereby suppressing fatty acid oxidation; this spares fatty acids for storage and supports glucose oxidation, consistent with the Randle cycle and observed in human muscle during hyperinsulinemic clamps [^113zXPbn] [^111MN6wn] [^113R8zdu].

---

## Biochemical role of malonyl-CoA

Malonyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by **acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)** and is a key intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. It also has a critical regulatory role: **malonyl-CoA allosterically inhibits CPT-1**, which controls mitochondrial import of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs for β-oxidation [^112PQ7s3] [^115ixoo9].

---

## Regulation of malonyl-CoA levels

Malonyl-CoA levels are tightly regulated by nutritional and hormonal states. Insulin activates ACC, increasing malonyl-CoA, whereas **AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates ACC**, decreasing malonyl-CoA and promoting fatty acid oxidation [^113NFGBF].

---

## Effect of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on malonyl-CoA levels

Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase glucose uptake and glycolysis, generating citrate — an ACC activator — and insulin signaling, which activates ACC. Together, these effects **increase malonyl-CoA** in skeletal muscle [^113zXPbn] [^111MN6wn].

---

## Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by malonyl-CoA

Elevated malonyl-CoA **directly inhibits CPT-1**, reducing mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation. This preserves fatty acids for storage and supports glucose oxidation, aligning with the Randle cycle [^113zXPbn] [^112PQ7s3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation

Clinical studies show that hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps increase muscle malonyl-CoA and decrease fatty acid oxidation, while **ACC inhibition or MCD activation** lowers malonyl-CoA and increases fatty acid oxidation, confirming the regulatory role of malonyl-CoA [^111MN6wn] [^113fhYGy].

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **B. Fatty acid synthesis**: Malonyl-CoA is a substrate for fatty acid synthesis, not an inhibitor; its accumulation does not directly inhibit this pathway.

- **C. Gluconeogenesis**: Gluconeogenesis is primarily hepatic and regulated by insulin, glucagon, and substrate availability; malonyl-CoA does not directly inhibit it.

- **D. Glycogenolysis**: Glycogenolysis is regulated by insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine; malonyl-CoA does not directly inhibit glycogen breakdown.

---

## Conclusion

Increased malonyl-CoA in skeletal muscle during hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia **directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation** by inhibiting CPT-1, thereby promoting glucose oxidation and sparing fatty acids for storage [^113zXPbn] [^111MN6wn].

### Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic relevance [^113R8zdu]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia contributes to the accumulation of toxic lipid metabolites leading to protein kinase-C activation (PKC-ε isoform, with no changes observed for PKC-α, PKC-δ, and PKC-θ isoforms) and inhibition of insulin signaling, glucose transport, and insulin-mediated vasodilation, supporting the concept of glucolipotoxicity. The intracellular accumulation of lipids may require the presence of hyperglycemia in the liver and β-cells, and the presence of hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia in muscle, leading to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Under these conditions, increased intracellular glucose metabolism increases the formation of malonyl-CoA a potent inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1, the enzyme that mediates the transport of NEFA into the mitochondria to be oxidized, thereby favoring their storage in the cytosol and the formation of toxic products inhibiting glucose transport/metabolism.

The sequence of events following NEFA oversupply to tissues has been comprehensively described by Roden and Shulman using euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic clamps and [31 P]- and [1 H]-MRS. In the liver, activation of pyruvate carboxylate flux by NEFAs and the use of glycerol as a substrate stimulate gluconeogenesis and EGP; the development of insulin resistance further upregulates gluconeogenesis and reduces insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and glucose disposal aggravating postprandial hyperglycemia. In muscle, NEFAs and glycerol are rapidly esterified to triglycerides; accumulation of toxic NEFA metabolites (diacylglycerol, ceramides, fatty acyl CoA) interferes with insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate-1–associated PI3 kinase leading to a primary inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT-4 translocation and glucose disposal followed by a subsequent reduction of glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation inducing insulin resistance (Fig. 5). Toxic lipid metabolites can also lead to stimulation of inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress.

### Increased malonyl-CoA levels in muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects lead to decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased lipogenesis; thiazolidinedione treatment reverses these defects [^111MN6wn]. Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Increased accumulation of fatty acids and their derivatives can impair insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by skeletal muscle. To characterize the nature of the defects in lipid metabolism and to evaluate the effects of thiazolidinedione treatment, we analyzed the levels of triacylglycerol, long-chain fatty acyl-coA, malonyl-CoA, fatty acid oxidation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, and fatty acid transport proteins in muscle biopsies from nondiabetic lean, obese, and type 2 subjects before and after an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp as well as pre-and post-3-month rosiglitazone treatment. We observed that low AMPK and high ACC activities resulted in elevation of malonyl-CoA levels and lower fatty acid oxidation rates. These conditions, along with the basal higher expression levels of fatty acid transporters, led accumulation of long-chain fatty acyl-coA and triacylglycerol in insulin-resistant muscle. During the insulin infusion, muscle fatty acid oxidation was reduced to a greater extent in the lean compared with the insulin-resistant subjects. In contrast, isolated muscle mitochondria from the type 2 subjects exhibited a greater rate of fatty acid oxidation compared with the lean group. All of these abnormalities in the type 2 diabetic group were reversed by rosiglitazone treatment. In conclusion, these studies have shown that elevated malonyl-CoA levels and decreased fatty acid oxidation are key abnormalities in insulin-resistant muscle, and, in type 2 diabetic patients, thiazolidinedione treatment can reverse these abnormalities.

### Metabolic flexibility as an adaptation to energy resources and requirements in health and disease [^113zXPbn]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
Systemic response to insulin. Upon glucose sensing, the pancreas increases the insulin/glucagon ratio. The rise in insulin stimulates many metabolic processes in the key metabolic organs: the liver, heart, brain, white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Collectively, these metabolic processes switch metabolism from a preference of fatty acid oxidation to glucose uptake and oxidation.

During fasting, the decrease in circulating dietary carbohydrates and lipids and decline in insulin-glucagon ratio induces a switch toward FAO. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and ketogenesis, and the decrease in insulin suppresses hepatocyte malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis and lipogenesis, with concomitant activation of FAO. After an overnight fast, ketone bodies are in the micromolar range (∼30 μM for women and ∼60 μM for men), which is not detected by most assays. This is important because it emphasizes that an overnight fast already induces changes in metabolic flexibility in healthy humans.

Hydrolytic processes in white adipose tissue (WAT) are increased converting stored triacylglycerol to free fatty acids that are used in the periphery as fuel, particularly in the skeletal muscle and heart. Additionally, lipolytic processes in the muscle aid in increasing lipid supply. Because adipose tissue is the predominant source of free fatty acids, the capacity of adipose tissue to store fatty acids during caloric availability and release fatty acids during caloric restriction is an important determinant of metabolic flexibility.

Biochemical transition between feeding and fasting

Cellular fuel selection depends on the type and amount of nutrient available. Cellular responses to the changes in nutritional state are predominantly assigned to the mitochondria (see "Mitochondrial function is essential for metabolic flexibility" and "Endocrine regulation of metabolic flexibility"). As proposed in Randle's glucose-fatty acid cycle hypothesis, in vitro studies have shown that FAO is suppressed when glucose consumption is increased and vice versa (Fig. 2). In the postprandial period of a carbohydrate-rich meal when glucose and insulin are high, glucose uptake, glycolysis, and pyruvate oxidation are favored and FAO is suppressed. These glucose-dependent processes increase the concentration of malonyl-CoA, which allosterically inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), which transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for β -oxidation. Fatty acids are then alternatively used for triglyceride synthesis and stored. Additionally, the rise in pyruvate from glycolysis inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), which reduces the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenases (PDHs), resulting in an increased glucose oxidation.

### Uteroplacental insufficiency down regulates insulin receptor and affects expression of key enzymes of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) metabolism in skeletal muscle at birth [^112ipkkG]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2008). Low credibility.

In humans, Jaquet et al. demonstrated that insulin resistance is associated with an impaired regulation of GLUT4 gene expression by insulin in IUGR-born subjects in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

Impairment of muscle fat metabolism is highly associated with insulin resistance. Our study shows for the first time that uteroplacental insufficiency leads to reduced ACS and ACCα mRNA expression in skeletal muscle at birth. In intramuscular lipid metabolism, ACS is the key enzyme for converting free fatty acids into LCFA-CoA. ACC catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA, an essential substrate for fatty acid synthesis in lipogenic tissues and a key regulatory molecule in muscle, brain, and other tissues. Three CPT1 isoforms with various tissue distributions and encoded by distinct genes have been identified: liver (CPT1A), muscle (CPT1B), and brain (CPT1C) Cellular levels of malonyl-CoA repress CPT1 activity and decrease LCFA-CoAs oxidation. Therefore, the final effect of reduced expression of both ACS and ACCα would be the decrease of intramuscular LCFAs. This finding is consistent with our recent study in hypothalamus of IUGR rats, showing significant decreased ACCα and ACCβ expression at birth. Taken together these findings suggest that intrauterine programming may affect key enzymes of lipid metabolism at multiple levels. In muscle, however, ACCα protein content was not affected thus suggesting post-transcriptional regulation.

Lipids are implicated in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. This seems to be linked to an imbalance between lipid supply and lipid oxidation, the latter being related to decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity in states of insulin resistance. In humans, it has been described that during physiological hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinemia and maintained FFA concentrations (i.e. a condition that mimics the insulin-resistant state), human skeletal muscle malonyl-CoA concentrations are significantly increased and are directly associated with a reduction in LCFA oxidation and functional CPT-1 activity.

As LCFA oxidative capacity in mitochondria is low in subjects with insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and thereby decreased lipid oxidation has been considered to play a key role in the development of insulin resistance. Lane et al. reported an increase in triglyceride levels in IUGR rats Accordingly, a connection between mitochondrial dysfunction, increased intramuscular triacylglycerol levels, and insulin resistance has been described in insulin-resistant offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Malonyl coenzymeA decarboxylase regulates lipid and glucose metabolism in human skeletal muscle [^113fhYGy]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (MCD) is a key enzyme responsible for malonyl-CoA turnover and functions in the control of the balance between lipid and glucose metabolism. We utilized RNA interference (siRNA)-based gene silencing to determine the direct role of MCD on metabolic responses in primary human skeletal muscle.

Research Design and Methods

We used siRNA to silence MCD gene expression in cultured human myotubes from healthy volunteers (seven male and seven female) with no known metabolic disorders. Thereafter, we determined lipid and glucose metabolism and signal transduction under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions.

Results

RNA interference-based silencing of MCD expression (75% reduction) increased malonyl-CoA levels twofold and shifted substrate utilization from lipid to glucose oxidation. RNA interference-based depletion of MCD reduced basal palmitate oxidation. In parallel with this reduction, palmitate uptake was decreased under basal (40%) and insulin-stimulated (49%) conditions compared with myotubes transfected with a scrambled sequence. MCD silencing increased basal and insulin-mediated glucose oxidation 1.4- and 2.6-fold, respectively, compared with myotubes transfected with a scrambled sequence. In addition, glucose transport and cell-surface GLUT4 content was increased. In contrast, insulin action on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, tyrosine-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) phosphorylation was unaltered between myotubes transfected with siRNA against MCD versus a scrambled sequence.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence that MCD silencing suppresses lipid uptake and enhances glucose uptake in primary human myotubes. In conclusion, MCD expression plays a key reciprocal role in the balance between lipid and glucose metabolism.

### Regulation of muscle malonyl-CoA levels in the nutritionally insulin-resistant desert gerbil, psammomys obesus [^116bmZu2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Malonyl-CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase, controls the oxidation of fatty acids in muscle and other tissues by regulating their entrance into mitochondria. The level of malonyl-CoA in muscle is influenced by the uptake of energy substrates such as glucose, the precursor of its synthesis. The desert gerbil, Psammomys obesus, develops a severe insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia when transferred from its native nutrition to a relative high-energy (HE) rodent chow. In keeping with this it shows a low rate of glucose transport and a failure of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

Methods

The concentration of malonyl-CoA has been determined by radio-enzymatic assay together with the levels of citrate and malate in the gastrocnemius muscle of diabetes-prone (DP) and diabetes-resistant (DR) P. obesus during the administration of exogenous insulin, during an hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and following a 48-h fast.

Results

Muscle GLUT4 protein was reduced by 44% in DP Psammomys on a HE diet, compared with normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic animals on a low-energy (LE) diet. Muscle levels of malonyl-CoA, its precursor citrate and the citrate counter-ion malate were not elevated in DP Psammomys on the HE diet despite the hyperinsulinemia. Likewise, the administration of external insulin in subcutaneous (sc) implants to DP Psammomys did not evoke hypoglycemia, decrease glucose production or increase the concentration of malonyl-CoA and citrate in muscle, as it did in both albino rats and a selected line of DR Psammomys. In contrast, fasting significantly reduced muscle malonyl-CoA and citrate levels in the DP and DR Psammomys and promoted the fat oxidative pathway.

Conclusion

Since non-diabetic Psammomys on a LE diet already show insulin resistance in the fed state, the sustained low malonyl-CoA levels in these animals imply a readiness for the oxidation of fatty acids. In a desert gerbil, adjusted to a food-scarce environment, such a continuing utilization of fatty acids as energy substrate by muscle would preserve the available glucose for glucose-dependent tissues and would diminish the need for gluconeogenesis.

### Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes: association with truncal obesity, impaired fitness, and atypical malonyl coenzyme A regulation [^11773tad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal obesity and physical inactivity are associated with insulin resistance in humans and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Likewise, sustained increases in the concentration of malonyl coenzyme A (CoA), an inhibitor of fatty-acid oxidation, have been observed in muscle in association with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in various rodents. In the present study, we assessed whether these factors are present in a defined population of slightly overweight (body mass index, 26.2 kg/m2), insulin-resistant patients with type 2 diabetes. Thirteen type 2 diabetic men and 17 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched control subjects were evaluated. Insulin sensitivity was assessed during a two-step euglycemic insulin clamp (infusion of 0.25 and 1.0 mU/kg x min). The rates of glucose administered during the low-dose insulin clamp were 2.0 ± 0.2 vs. 0.7 ± 0.2 mg/kg body weight x min (P < 0.001) in the control and diabetic subjects, respectively; rates during the high-dose insulin clamp were 8.3 ± 0.7 vs. 4.6 ± 0.4 mg/kg body weight x min (P < 0.001) for controls and diabetic subjects. The diabetic patients had a significantly lower maximal oxygen uptake than control subjects (29.4 ± 1.0 vs. 33.4 ± 1.4 ml/kg x min; P = 0.03) and a greater total body fat mass (3.7 kg), mainly due to an increase in truncal fat (16.5 ± 0.9 vs. 13.1 ± 0.9 kg; P = 0.02). The plasma concentration of free fatty acid and the rate of fatty acid oxidation during the clamps were both higher in the diabetic subjects than the control subjects (P = 0.002–0.007). In addition, during the high-dose insulin clamp, the increase in cytosolic citrate and malate in muscle, which parallels and regulates malonyl CoA levels, was significantly less in the diabetic patients (P < 0.05 vs. P < 0.001). Despite this, a similar increase in the concentration of malonyl CoA was observed in the two groups, suggesting an abnormality in malonyl CoA regulation in the diabetic subjects. In conclusion, the results confirm that insulin sensitivity is decreased in slightly overweight men with mild type 2 diabetes and that this correlates closely with an increase in truncal fat mass and a decrease in physical fitness. Whether the unexpectedly high levels of malonyl CoA in muscle, together with the diminished suppression of plasma free fatty acid, explains the insulin resistance of the diabetic patients during the clamp remains to be determined.

### Malonyl-CoA signaling, lipid partitioning, and glucolipotoxicity: role in β-cell adaptation and failure in the etiology of diabetes [^114aKDcq]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

Beta-cells possess inherent mechanisms to adapt to overnutrition and the prevailing concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, and other fuels to maintain glucose homeostasis. However, this is balanced by potentially harmful actions of the same nutrients. Both glucose and fatty acids may cause good/adaptive or evil/toxic actions on the beta-cell, depending on their concentrations and the time during which they are elevated. Chronic high glucose dramatically influences beta-cell lipid metabolism via substrate availability, changes in the activity and expression of enzymes of glucose and lipid metabolism, and modifications in the expression level of key transcription factors. We discuss here the emerging view that beta-cell "glucotoxicity" is in part indirectly caused by "lipotoxicity", and that beta-cell abnormalities will become particularly apparent when both glucose and circulating fatty acids are high. We support the concept that elevated glucose and fatty acids synergize in causing toxicity in islets and other organs, a process that may be instrumental in the pleiotropic defects associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia alter insulin secretion are discussed and a model of beta-cell "glucolipotoxicity" that implicates alterations in beta-cell malonyl-CoA concentrations; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c expression; and lipid partitioning is proposed.

### Acylcarnitines: reflecting or inflicting insulin resistance? [^115bCFQf]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Alternatively, more recent mechanistic and metabolomic studies associated obesity-induced insulin resistance with intramitochondrial disturbances. In this model, lipid overload leads to increased rather than decreased FAO in skeletal muscle. This coincides with accumulating acylcarnitines, an inability to switch to carbohydrate substrate, and a depletion of TCA intermediates, suggesting that FAO flux does not match TCA flux, leading to incomplete FAO. In vitro interfering with FA uptake in L6 myocytes or a coordinate induction of FAO and TCA enzymes by exercise or PPARγ coactivator 1α overexpression prevented insulin resistance. Moreover, using carnitine to stimulate FAO without affecting the TCA in these myocytes was dose-dependently associated with insulin resistance. Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, a model for more severe insulin resistance, had higher acylcarnitines but lower TCA intermediates (such as citrate, malate, and succinate) in skeletal muscle, again suggesting that increased FAO induces insulin resistance when not followed by proportionally increased TCA activity. Additionally, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase −/− mouse that had decreased FAO due to higher malonyl-CoA concentrations resisted diet-induced insulin resistance, which further implicated FAO in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The available studies on acylcarnitine metabolism and the relationship with insulin resistance will be discussed in the next sections with a focus on human studies.

The effect of increased lipid flux on mitochondrial FA uptake and oxidation: implications for insulin sensitivity.

Insulin-dependent DM2 patients had lower (∼25%) carnitine concentrations, especially with longer-standing or complicated disease. Interestingly, carnitine infusions increased FAO in lean healthy subjects, but only when high-dose insulin was coadministered, which may be explained by an increased muscle OCTN2 expression under these conditions. The importance of insulin for cellular carnitine uptake is underscored by the finding that insulin and carnitine administration lowered muscle malonyl-CoA and lactate concentrations, whereas muscle glycogen increased. These findings are supported by animal studies, which demonstrated that carnitine levels were diminished in skeletal muscle of multiple insulin-resistant rat models. A high-fat diet (HFD) exacerbated the age-related decrease of tissue carnitine content in these rats (primarily skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney). Moreover, carnitine supplementation of HFD animals decreased plasma glucose levels and homeostasis model assessment indices. Likewise, carnitine supplementation improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in mouse models of diet-induced obesity and genetic diabetes. Recently, it was shown that 6 months of carnitine supplementation improved glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant humans.

### Short-term hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia increase myocardial lipid content in normal subjects [^114KREma]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

However, elevation of plasma FFAs by a high-fat, high-energy diet for 3 days did not increase MYCL but did increase hepatic lipid content, suggesting that short-term meal studies preferentially target liver metabolism. It is of note that only plasma insulin, but not glucose concentrations, was increased. Thus, the available data on the potential direct effects of plasma FFAs on MYCL are inconsistent and do not sufficiently explain cardiac steatosis in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes.

Given that (postprandial) hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are central and early features of metabolic diseases, we hypothesized that combined hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia induce myocardial lipid accumulation.

We previously have shown that insulin infusion in patients with type 2 diabetes leads to lipid accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle, likely resulting from insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis and lipid oxidation, stimulation of intracellular triglyceride synthesis, and/or increased uptake of circulating FFAs. The resulting competition of glucose and fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation further decreases myocellular fatty acid utilization. Reduced fatty acid oxidation, together with insulin-stimulated FFA uptake and trigylceride synthesis, results in net lipid storage. However, whether hyperglycemia and consequent hyperinsulinemia might also affect lipid accumulation in the heart currently is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of acute hyperglycemia and consequent hyperinsulinemia on MYCL and function in healthy subjects.

### Metabolic syndrome: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and malonyl coenzyme a… [^114DdVLf]. Obesity (2006). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome can be defined as a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, and a predisposition to type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, premature atherosclerosis, and other diseases. An increasing body of evidence has linked the metabolic syndrome to abnormalities in lipid metabolism that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction. We review here the hypothesis that, in many instances, the cause of these lipid abnormalities could be a dysregulation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) fuel-sensing and signaling mechanism. Such dysregulation could be reflected by isolated increases in malonyl CoA or by concurrent changes in malonyl CoA and AMPK, both of which would alter intracellular fatty acid partitioning. The possibility is also raised that pharmacological agents and other factors that activate AMPK and/or decrease malonyl CoA could be therapeutic targets.

### Hepatic malonyl-CoA synthesis restrains gluconeogenesis by suppressing fat oxidation, pyruvate carboxylation, and amino acid availability [^1114LjzY]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) promotes prandial liver metabolism by producing malonyl-CoA, a substrate for de novo lipogenesis and an inhibitor of CPT-1-mediated fat oxidation. We report that inhibition of ACC also produces unexpected secondary effects on metabolism. Liver-specific double ACC1/2 knockout (LDKO) or pharmacologic inhibition of ACC increased anaplerosis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, and gluconeogenesis by activating hepatic CPT-1 and pyruvate carboxylase flux in the fed state. Fasting should have marginalized the role of ACC, but LDKO mice maintained elevated TCA cycle intermediates and preserved glycemia during fasting. These effects were accompanied by a compensatory induction of proteolysis and increased amino acid supply for gluconeogenesis, which was offset by increased protein synthesis during feeding. Such adaptations may be related to Nrf2 activity, which was induced by ACC inhibition and correlated with fasting amino acids. The findings reveal unexpected roles for malonyl-CoA synthesis in liver and provide insight into the broader effects of pharmacologic ACC inhibition.

### Noninvasive assessment of exercise-related intramyocellular acetylcarnitine in euglycemia and hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes using ¹ H magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a randomized single-blind crossover study [^114KgwQY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the present study, levels of IMAC were assessed noninvasively in skeletal muscle of individuals with type 1 diabetes in euglycemia and hyperglycemia before and after moderate aerobic exercise. The principal finding was a significantly higher increase in IMAC in euglycemia than in hyperglycemia.

The effect of euglycemia and hyperglycemia on exercise-related substrate oxidation has also been assessed in healthy individuals, however, without determination of IMAC. Still, previous reports do not suggest genuinely different levels of acylated carnitine in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with nondiabetic control subjects. Conversely, a recent study in patients with type 1 diabetes investigated levels of IMAC during exercise in euglycemia but with differing insulin levels. The authors reported a similar increase in IMAC in euglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, implying that the flux through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is independent of insulin concentrations. Taken together, these results indicate that in individuals with type 1 diabetes, levels of IMAC are influenced by the availability of energy substrates, in particular systemic glucose, whereas levels of insulin seem to have less influence. Of note, IMAC has been shown to increase after a few minutes of high-intensity exercise. This result has been hypothesized to be due to the production of acetyl-CoA exceeding its utilization by the Krebs cycle, the acetyl groups consequently being transferred to carnitine by carnitine acetyltransferase, which results in increases in IMAC as well as in free CoA. Although IMAC may thus reflect the imbalance of the fluxes through the PDC and the Krebs cycle in high-intensity exercise, its role during exercise at lower intensity or at rest is less clear. Interestingly, previous studies in healthy individuals have suggested an association of IMAC with increased β-oxidation. Compatible with these findings, the present study revealed a higher contribution of net lipid oxidation to overall substrate oxidation in euglycemia than in hyperglycemia together with a tendency toward increased consumption of intramyocellular lipids in euglycemia (data published in ref.). Whether this association is due to a direct effect of substrate fluxes (e.g. increased glucose flux in hyperglycemia compared with euglycemia) on fuel metabolism or whether indirect regulation of key enzymes (PDC and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) were involved remains speculative because noninvasive determination of IMAC precluded further analysis of intramyocellular metabolic pathways in the present study.

### Effects of sustained hyperglycemia on skeletal muscle lipids in healthy subjects [^116NcXJJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Sustained increases in plasma glucose promote skeletal muscle insulin resistance independent from obesity and dyslipidemia (ie, glucotoxicity). Skeletal muscle lipids are key molecular determinants of insulin action, yet their involvement in the development of glucotoxicity is unclear.

Objective

To explore the impact of mild physiologic hyperglycemia on skeletal muscle lipids.

Design

Single group pretest-posttest.

Participants

Healthy males and females with normal glucose tolerance.

Interventions

72-hour glucose infusion raising plasma glucose by ~50 mg/dL.

Main Outcome Measures

Skeletal muscle lipids, insulin sensitivity, lipid oxidation.

Results

Despite impairing insulin-mediated glucose disposal and suppressing fasting lipid oxidation, hyperglycemia did not alter either the content or composition of skeletal muscle triglycerides, diacylglycerides, or phospholipids. Skeletal muscle ceramides decreased after glucose infusion, likely in response to a reduction in free fatty acid concentrations.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that the major lipid pools in skeletal muscle are unperturbed by sustained increases in glucose availability and suggest that glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity drive insulin resistance through distinct mechanistic pathways.

### Prolonged fasting identifies skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction as consequence rather than cause of human insulin resistance [^117KaQCe]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Besides reduced insulin action, the hyperglycemia associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has also been suggested to exert harmful effects on mitochondrial functional capacity via induction of oxidative stress. Indeed, hyperglycemia has been shown to increase mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells, as well as in other cell types. In addition, it was reported that severe hyperglycemia inhibited respiration in human skeletal muscle, which was restored upon insulin treatment.

It should be noted that the insulin-resistant state after prolonged fasting was accompanied by hypoinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Mitochondrial function was thus assessed after exposure to low insulin and glucose concentrations. It is therefore unlikely that the reduced mitochondrial functional capacity observed here is caused by hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperglycemia associated with reduced insulin action. However, it remains possible that chronic hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia may negatively affect mitochondrial function in type 2 diabetes patients.

An alternative candidate to explain the observed reduction in mitochondrial capacity upon fasting is prolonged exposure to elevated plasma FFA levels. This is underscored by previous findings in isolated mouse and human skeletal muscle mitochondria showing a dosage-dependent inhibition of ATP synthesis upon incubation with high but physiologic levels of FFA metabolites. Furthermore, it was shown in mice that prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet for the duration of 16 weeks reduced mitochondrial function. Also in human in vivo studies, negative associations between high fatty acid availability and markers for mitochondrial function have been reported. Thus, PGC-1α expression and the insulin-stimulated increase in skeletal muscle ATP synthesis were reduced upon lipid infusion. Furthermore, it was recently shown that mitochondrial membrane potential was impaired upon short-term lipid infusion in healthy individuals, although several other markers of mitochondrial function remained unaffected. Despite the reported negative associations between mitochondrial function and (plasma) FFA, there are also several lines of evidence suggesting the opposite. Thus, raising plasma FFA by high-fat feeding combined with daily heparin injections for 4 weeks in rats increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial enzymes involved in fat oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain. Furthermore, we previously showed that high-fat feeding for 8 weeks in rats resulted in a twofold increase of PGC-1α protein levels.

### The impact of dietary interventions on cardiometabolic health [^111kxV8v]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers of cardiometabolic health

CMH refers to the health of the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. It is influenced by multiple risk factors that collectively determine the likelihood of developing CVD, T2DM, and other related conditions. A practical evaluation of CMH can be achieved by assessing adiposity, blood glucose levels, blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, and the presence or absence of clinical CVD. Skeletal muscle plays a central role in energy metabolism, as approximately 80% of postprandial carbohydrate oxidation occurs in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle can emerge decades before the onset of β-cell failure. Chronic positive energy balance tends to elevate glucose levels, prompting increased insulin production. Hyperinsulinemia suppresses hepatic glucose production and shifts liver metabolism toward the conversion of carbohydrates into fat. This results in increased hepatic lipid production (e.g. triacylglycerols, commonly called triglycerides), fat accumulation in the liver, and ultimately the development of fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Pathophysiological background of the clinical biomarkers (adapted from ref). During excess calorie intake, de novo lipogenesis processes carbohydrates that cannot be stored as glycogen, promoting fat accumulation in the liver. Because this process is stimulated by insulin, individuals with some degree of insulin resistance (determined by genetic and lifestyle factors) accumulate liver fat more quickly due to higher insulin concentrations. Increased liver fat further exacerbates resistance to the suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin. A small increase in plasma glucose triggers increased insulin secretion to maintain euglycemia. This resulting hyperinsulinemia further enhances the conversion of excess calories into liver fat, creating a vicious cycle. Fatty liver leads to an increased export of VLDLs into the circulation, which promotes fat delivery to all tissues, including the pancreas. Moreover, high levels of VLDL, in concert with increased CETP activity, result in the enrichment of LDL and HDL with triacylglycerols, while depleting their cholesterol content. This leads to the typical lipid triad: high triacylglycerols, low HDL cholesterol, and small LDL particles. Excess fatty acids in the pancreatic islets can impair insulin secretion in response to ingested food, leading to postprandial hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemia further increases insulin secretion, which consequently elevates hepatic lipogenesis, speeding up the liver cycle and driving the pancreas cycle. Eventually, the inhibitory effects of fatty acids and glucose on the islets reach a threshold, triggering β-cell failure and a fairly sudden onset of clinical diabetes.

### Some paradoxes and unresolved aspects of hepatic de novo lipogenesis [^112GfGkc]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

How does DNL enable hepatic triglyceride accumulation?

Hepatic triglyceride levels are normally kept in balance through the matching of fatty acid appearance rates with those of fatty acid oxidation plus export of triglyceride via very-low-density lipoprotein. Hepatic DNL activity is now considered to be a key determinant of increased hepatic fatty acid appearance during MASLD development –. Hepatic triglyceride is formed by the sequential esterification of glycerol-3-phosphate by fatty acyl-CoA with an estimated 15–25% of these originating from DNL. Depending on the prandial state, the majority of fatty acid precursors originate either from dietary lipid via chylomicron remnants, or from circulating free-fatty acids released by adipose tissue lipolysis. These fatty acids include both essential and non-essential species with each of the three esterification enzymes having different affinities for saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. DNL (which in this context also includes fatty acid elongation and desaturation) contributes either saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids to this pool. Specific fatty acyl-CoA precursors are also recruited for the biosynthesis of other lipid species, notably palmitoyl-CoA for ceramide formation. While DNL activity directly adds to hepatic fatty acid overflow, it can also indirectly contribute via the inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation by its malonyl-CoA intermediate. The fractional contribution of DNL to the total hepatic fatty acid pool is relatively small, while the capacity for hepatic β-oxidation is up to 45–90 g of fatty acids per day in humans. This estimate is based on hepatic Krebs cycle fluxes of 0.5–1.0 mmol/min per 1.5 kg liver mass measured by stable-isotope tracers, and assuming that all acetyl-CoA is derived from β-oxidation of fatty acids. This rate of acetyl-CoA utilization is equivalent to 0.125–0.250 mmol/min of palmitate consumption. Over 24 h, this amounts to 180–360 mmol, or ~45–90 g of fatty acids. Ketogenesis accounts for up to an additional 10–20% of fatty acid disappearance. it is possible that the inhibitory effect of DNL on β-oxidation may be at least as important as its direct contribution of newly synthesised fatty acids. The extent to which the direct versus indirect actions of DNL contribute to hepatic triglyceride overload may depend on several factors including dietary sugar intake– notably fructose, and the feeding/fasting state. On the one hand, a number of studies have demonstrated that NAFLD onset is characterized by either increases in fatty acid β-oxidation, or no change, which appears to be inconsistent with the expected inhibitory effects of malonyl-CoA. On the other hand, the discovery of low but persistent fasting DNL activity in NAFLD subjects that showed a strong negative correlation with hepatic β-oxidation and ketogenesisdemonstrates the importance of DNL in the inhibition of oxidative fatty acid clearance under these fasting conditions. Given that there is a substantial inflow of fatty acids into the liver from adipose tissue lipolysis in fasting as well as fed states, this action is likely to be a significant contributor to elevated hepatic triglyceride levels. Finally, in the setting of chronic overfeeding and diet-induced obesity, reciprocal control of hepatic DNL and fatty acid oxidation is additionally perturbed by circadian enhancers such as Rev-erbα. These not only potentiate hepatic DNL in a periodic manner, but also unexpectedly increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation.

### Regulation and function of AMPK in physiology and diseases [^113NFGBF]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic functions of AMPK

The key metabolic functions of AMPK are discussed below and summarized in Figure 2.

Lipid metabolism

The first known function of AMPK is the regulation of lipid metabolism. AMPK inhibits de novo synthesis of fatty acids (FAs), cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), and activates FA uptake and β-oxidation (FAO). AMPK inhibits FA synthesis (FAS) by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of two targets: (1) acetyl-coA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in FA synthesis by converting acetyl-coA to malonyl-coA, and (2) sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), a transcription factor that promotes the expression of multiple lipogenic enzymes, including ACC1 and FA synthase. Excessive accumulation of FAs in cells are stored as TGs. The first committed step in TG synthesis is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, which is inhibited by AMPK; however, it is unclear whether AMPK inhibits this step through direct phosphorylation or indirect regulation. AMPK also inhibits cholesterol synthesis by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.

In addition to the inhibition of lipid anabolism, AMPK activates lipid catabolism. AMPK increases FA uptake by controlling the translocation of FA transporter CD36 to the plasma membrane; however, the mechanism underlying this is unclear. Once inside cells, FAs are transported into the mitochondria for β-oxidation by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). AMPK increases CPT-1 activity and activates FAO by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC2, which is localized to the outer membrane of the mitochondria near CPT-1 where it inhibits production of malonyl-CoA, a potent allosteric inhibitor of CPT-1. However, AMPK inhibits lipolysis by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase in the adipose tissue. These data suggest that the central role of AMPK in lipid metabolism involves controlling the concentration of circulating free FAs (FFAs) by activating FAO, and by inhibiting lipolysis and lipogenesis.

### A critical assessment of fasting to promote metabolic health and longevity [^113duWGz]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In the preceding 2 paragraphs, we have described the attenuation of glucose utilization and the augmentation of fatty acid utilization as distinct; however, these processes are not independent of one another. Randle first postulated that substrate availability — ie, competition between glucose and fatty acids — is a determinant of fuel utilization. Although specific mechanistic details of Randle's hypothesis have been questioned, particularly with respect to the underlying role of lipids in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, human and mouse genetic models support the general concept that fatty acid metabolism can regulate glucose utilization with fasting. For example, homozygous loss of function of many of the genes involved in fatty acid oxidation predisposes to hypoglycemia with fasting. In mice, genetic knock out of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a key enzymatic mediator of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, phenocopies fasting mediated hypoglycemia in part by augmenting glucose uptake and utilization. These genetic models suggest that attenuation of inhibitory mechanisms operative during fasting that are dependent on fatty acid catabolism augments glucose utilization; conversely, intact fatty acid oxidation during fasting reinforces the switch from glucose to lipid metabolism by actively suppressing key nodes in glucose uptake and/or catabolism.

Ketogenesis

Ketones are produced from ketogenic amino acids and from the products of fatty acid catabolism. The production of ketones by the liver requires many of the same steps of fatty acid uptake and oxidation in mitochondria that have already been discussed. The key branch point occurs after generation of acetyl-CoA. Instead of supplying the TCA cycle as occurs in skeletal muscle, 3 acetyl-CoA molecules are converted to acetoacetate by the sequential actions of acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA lyase. β-hydroxybutyrate is generated from acetoacetate by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate are 2 ketones used by extrahepatic tissues for energy.

### Beta-cell mitochondria and insulin secretion: messenger role of nucleotides and metabolites [^116Wz8zN]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

The beta-cell mitochondria are known to generate metabolic coupling factors, or messengers, that mediate plasma membrane depolarization and the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), the triggering event in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Accordingly, ATP closes nucleotide-sensitive K(+) channels necessary for the opening of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. ATP also exerts a permissive action on insulin exocytosis. In contrast, GTP directly stimulates the exocytotic process. cAMP is considered to have a dual function: on the one hand, it renders the beta-cell more responsive to glucose; on the other, it mediates the effect of glucagon and other hormones that potentiate insulin secretion. Mitochondrial shuttles contribute to the formation of pyridine nucleotides, which may also participate in insulin exocytosis. Among the metabolic factors generated by glucose, citrate-derived malonyl-CoA has been endorsed, but recent results have questioned its role. We have proposed that glutamate, which is also formed by mitochondrial metabolism, stimulates insulin exocytosis in conditions of permissive, clamped cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations. The evidence for the implication of these and other putative messengers in metabolism-secretion coupling is discussed in this review.

### Muscle perfusion: its measurement and role in metabolic regulation [^113HL7gp]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

In a series of studies using either contrast ultrasound or the A-V concentration difference for 1-MX as an index of the endothelial surface perfused, we observed that insulin at physiologic concentrations enhanced the microvascular volume perfused within either human forearm or rat hind leg muscle. This occurs within 15 min of onset of hyperinsulinemia at modest physiologic insulin concentrations and is blocked by inhibition of NOS. Importantly, loss of insulin's ability to enhance microvascular volume either by a blockade of NOS or as a result of endogenous insulin resistance secondary to obesity, diabetes, or experimental conditions (e.g. elevating FFA or tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations) impedes skeletal muscle glucose disposal. This recruitment process is illustrated in Fig. 3.

FIG. 3.
Upper panel: Summary of the pathway by which insulin binds to and activates its receptor, thereby enhancing signaling through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3-K) Akt pathway to phosphorylate endothelial NOS (eNOS) and increase its enzymatic activity, augmenting the production of NO. NO can readily diffuse to nearby smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and act both to increase the production of cyclic GMP and to directly nitrosylate specific proteins to promote smooth muscle relaxation. Lower panel: Effect of this relaxation on resistance and terminal arterioles is illustrated. Relaxing the former can increase overall blood flow, while relaxing the latter increases the number of capillaries perfused within the tissue (indicated by the increased numbers of red capillaries in the right panel) at any one time. It should be noted that this is a dynamic process, and because of flowmotion, the particular capillaries that are perfused at any time will vary over time scales from 2 to 40 s.

### Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibition reduces de novo lipogenesis in overweight male subjects: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^1112yoqu]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent hepatic pathology in the Western world, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most severe form of NAFLD, is estimated to occur in 10%‐30% of patients with NAFLD. 1 Dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, including increased fatty acid synthesis and impaired fatty acid oxidation, has been implicated in the etiology of NAFLD and NASH. 2, 3 De novo lipogenesis (DNL), the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitate from carbohydrates or amino acids, occurs primarily in the liver. The ensuing increase in hepatic steatosis results in formation of complex lipid signaling molecules, leading to lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrosis. 3 Therefore, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis coupled with stimulation of fatty acid oxidation has the potential to favorably affect a variety of metabolic diseases including NASH. The acetyl‐coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC) isozymes ACC1 and ACC2 are critical enzymes in de novo fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, respectively. ACC catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate–dependent carboxylation of acetyl‐CoA to form malonyl‐CoA, the rate‐limiting and first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. 2, 4, 5 Malonyl‐CoA also acts as an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. 2, 4 Due to this unique position in intermediary metabolism, 2, 4, 6 pharmacologic inhibition of ACC represents an attractive approach to limiting fatty acid synthesis in lipogenic tissues while simultaneously stimulating fatty acid oxidation in oxidative tissues. 2 Mice with targeted mutations that maintain ACC in a constitutively activated state demonstrate histological and clinical signs of NASH, including an elevation in hepatic malonyl‐CoA, enhanced lipogenesis, elevated hepatic triglycerides, insulin resistance, and liver fibrosis. 7

### Hypothalamic leucine metabolism regulates liver glucose production [^113u8mMk]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

KIC metabolism to malonyl-CoA and glucose homeostasis.

Acetyl-CoA moieties derived from the metabolism of KIC (Fig. 3 A) can be further metabolized to malonyl-CoA through the action of ACC, which is in turn inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). To test whether the conversion of KIC to malonyl-CoA was required for the effects of intrahypothalamic KIC, we coinfused the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) (Fig. 3 A) with KIC. The coinfusion of AICAR blunted the effects of KIC on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose production (Fig. 3 B – D and), supporting the idea that formation of malonyl-CoA in the MBH is necessary for the glucoregulatory action of KIC. AICAR alone did not alter glucose fluxes under similar experimental conditions (Table 1). Malonyl-CoA is converted back to acetyl-CoA through the action of MCD (Fig. 3 A); thus, an alternative approach to test the role of malonyl-CoA was to enhance the activity of MCD in the MBH. We injected AAV MCD (Fig. 3 E) into the MBH of rats, and overexpression of MCD was demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 F). Importantly, overexpression of MCD in the MBH blunted the effect of central leucine on glucose homeostasis and on hepatic glucose metabolism (Fig. 3 G – I and). No significant effect of MCD overexpression per se was observed (Table 1). These results showed that the metabolism of KIC → acetyl-CoA → malonyl-CoA within the MBH is required for the inhibitory effect of leucine on liver glucose production. To further validate the specificity of these effects, we asked whether the activation of the central melanocortin pathway was required for the action of leucine. The pharmacological antagonism of central melanocortin receptors by SHU9119 failed to alter the effects of central leucine/KIC on glucose production. To directly test the hypothesis that leucine/KIC-derived hypothalamic malonyl-CoA leads to an increase in the levels of oleyl-CoA (Fig. 3 A), we measured the levels of long-chain acyl-CoAs in the MBH. Animals that received central infusions of leucine or KIC displayed a significant increase in the levels of oleyl-CoA (C18:1), while other long-chain acyl-CoAs (e.g. linoeyl-CoA, C18:2) did not change compared with vehicle-infused animals (Fig. 4 A).

### Oxidative stress and calcium dysregulation by palmitate in type 2 diabetes [^116oqyWh]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are important sources of fuel required for efficient cellular energy production. FFAs enter mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and undergo β-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA, which serves as a substrate for the Krebs cycle. Fatty acid metabolism generates reducing equivalents used by the electron transport chain (ETC) for ATP synthesis. Increased β-oxidation attenuates further mitochondrial FFA uptake through the formation of malonyl CoA, an inhibitor of CPT1. Excess FFA critically induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, resulting in lipotoxicity associated with ER stress, calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.

Palmitate, stearate and oleate are the most abundant FFAs, accounting for 70–80% of total plasma FFAs.FFA concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes are significantly higher than in healthy subjects. Compared with normal subjects, rates of palmitate appearance in plasma are 1.5- and 3-fold higher in type 2 diabetic individuals during nocturnal and postprandial states, respectively. In the Paris Prospective Study, increased plasma FFA concentration and decreased 2-h plasma insulin levels are considered to be independent predictors of type 2 diabetes in subjects with a history of impaired glucose tolerance. Among impaired glucose tolerance subjects who develop type 2 diabetes, 78% are in the highest tertile of fasting FFA concentrations. It has been suggested that lipotoxicity is associated with uncompensated insulin secretion in patients with insulin resistance, leading to overt type 2 diabetes.

In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms leading to palmitate-induced toxicity in type 2 diabetes, including sources of ROS generation and Ca 2+ -mediated pathogenic changes. These mechanisms show harmful cross-interactions. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ release due to palmitate-induced oxidative stress results in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload, which may further accelerate ROS generation from mitochondria and facilitate permeability transition (PT) pore opening. The activation of store-operated Ca 2+ (SOC) entry triggered by ER Ca 2+ depletion augments the persistent Ca 2+ load. The interruption of such vicious cycles of ROS formation and Ca 2+ dysregulation may be a good therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases related to lipotoxicity.

### Short-term hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia increase myocardial lipid content in normal subjects [^114nsE5R]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current study provides evidence that combined hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia induce myocardial lipid accumulation in normal subjects, despite insulin-mediated suppression of plasma FFAs. We also show that the increase in insulin concentrations during sustained hyperglycemia is tightly associated with the increase in MYCL and acute changes in cardiac function (EF and ESV).

It has been convincingly shown that elevation of plasma FFAs is associated with an increase in MYCL. The underlying mechanism is thought to be an overstrain of the cellular FFA oxidation machinery, which results in accumulation of toxic lipid by-products in the cytosol. Here, we show that even in the presence of suppressed circulating FFAs, combined hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are able to induce myocardial lipid accumulation in normal subjects. The tight association between the increase in MYCL and the extent of glucose-induced insulin release indicates that insulin is the key mediator. This conclusion is supported by a previous study, which showed that hyperglycemia in the presence of low insulin concentrations (attributed to deprivation of insulin dosage) does not affect MYCL in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Nutrient sensors and their crosstalk [^112PQ7s3]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Early studies proposed that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), a mitochondrial enzyme, has a rate-limiting role in intracellular fatty acid utilization. CPT1 catalyzes the esterification of long chain acyl-CoA into acyl-carnitines to boost their entry into the mitochondria, which is the critical step for FAO. Although later studies questioned its role in the control of fatty acid uptake, CPT1 is still regarded as the regulator of mitochondrial β-oxidation. Malonyl-CoA is the intermediate precursor of the fatty acid synthesis pathway and is produced from acetyl-CoA by the rate-limiting step catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl-CoA was first demonstrated to be capable of acting as an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1. Under conditions of extensive fatty acid synthesis, accumulated malonyl-CoA blocks CPT1 activity to stop fatty acid β-oxidation and favors fatty acid biosynthesis. Therefore, malonyl-CoA is the key surrogate intermediate that is sensed by CPT1 to coordinate the catabolism and anabolism of fatty acids in a cell. Notably, the sensing of malonyl-CoA by CPT1 has been regarded as very important in the brain. Several studies have shown that this particular sensing mechanism is implicated in the control of food intake, weight loss, and other important biological functions in the regulation of the fate of neural stem cell precursors, development of axons, and metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes.

### Ketone body infusion with 3-hydroxybutyrate reduces myocardial glucose uptake and increases blood flow in humans: a positron emission tomography study [^112wQDbc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Myocardial Glucose Uptake Is Halved by Hyperketonemia

Several ex vivo studies have established that cardiomyocytes oxidize ketone bodies at the expense of glucose, 30, 31 presumably by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase 32 or possibly by sequestration of coenzyme A impairing oxidative glucose flux at the entry to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 33 The ex vivo and animal studies of cardiomyocytes have not previously been extended to a human setting. However, there is substantial indirect evidence from human studies to support the notion. Ferrannini et al investigated cardiac substrate metabolism across the heart in 16‐hour‐fasted humans 34 and reported that both fatty acids and ketone bodies constituted a significant proportion of cardiac fuel during basal conditions. The contribution from lipid fuels was almost completely abolished during hyperinsulinemia. Although the study indicates that the heart utilizes and oxidizes ketone bodies after fasting, it did not establish to which extent utilization of 3‐OHB, glucose, and FFA was affected by insulin, high levels of FFA, or intrinsic to the moderately high levels of 3‐OHB per se. By contrast, our data clearly show that high levels of 3‐OHB displace glucose utilization by the myocardium in the presence of well‐controlled hyperinsulinemia and suppressed FFA levels. It is of interest that the marked reduction in myocardial glucose uptake occurred in the presence of a 75% increase in myocardial blood flow. If anything, the increased myocardial blood flow would be expected to increase myocardial glucose uptake, which correlates with tissue perfusion in striated muscle. 35

During a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp, the heart derives most of its ATP from oxidation of glucose or lactate 36 and only a small proportion from lipids. This was also evident in this study, where glucose uptake during the control study day (in μmol/g heart tissue/min) was 30‐fold higher than fatty acid uptake as opposed to a ratio of roughly 1 observed in studies under normal fasting conditions (see eg, 37). It is therefore reasonable to assume that a halving of MGU in absolute terms during the ketone body infusion implies that a significant proportion of the heart's energy needs was met by ketone body oxidation, although some of the reduction in MGU observed can also be ascribed to the increased lactate levels. On the other hand, increased lactate levels could also be a consequence of either reduced entrance of glycolytic end products in the tricarboxylic acid cycle because of substrate competition from ketones, 22 or limited transfer of reducing equivalents through the malate–aspartate shuttle leading to reduced metabolism of glucose and lactate. 38, 39

### Effect of a sustained reduction in plasma free fatty acid concentration on intramuscular long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs and insulin action in type 2 diabetic patients [^111kppfZ]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

To investigate the effect of a sustained (7-day) decrease in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations on insulin action and intramyocellular long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCFA-CoAs), we studied the effect of acipimox, a potent inhibitor of lipolysis, in seven type 2 diabetic patients (age 53 ± 3 years, BMI 30.2 ± 2.0 kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose 8.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l, HbA 1c 7.5 ± 0.4%). Subjects received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 120-min euglycemic insulin (80 mU/m2 per min) clamp with 3-[3H]glucose/vastus lateralis muscle biopsies to quantitate rates of insulin-mediated whole-body glucose disposal (Rd) and intramyocellular LCFA-CoAs before and after acipimox (250 mg every 6 h for 7 days). Acipimox significantly reduced fasting plasma FFAs (from 563 ± 74 to 230 ± 33 micromol/l; P < 0.01) and mean plasma FFAs during the OGTT (from 409 ± 44 to 184 ± 22 micromol/l; P < 0.01). After acipimox, decreases were seen in fasting plasma insulin (from 78 ± 18 to 42 ± 6 pmol/l; P < 0.05), fasting plasma glucose (from 8.5 ± 0.8 to 7.0 ± 0.5 mmol/l; P < 0.02), and mean plasma glucose during the OGTT (from 14.5 ± 0.8 to 13.0 ± 0.8 mmol/l; P < 0.05). After acipimox, insulin-stimulated Rd increased from 3.3 ± 0.4 to 4.4 ± 0.4 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.03), whereas suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) was similar and virtually complete during both insulin clamp studies (0.16 ± 0.10 vs. 0.14 ± 0.10 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); P > 0.05). Basal EGP did not change after acipimox (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.9 ± 0.2 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Total muscle LCFA-CoA content decreased after acipimox treatment (from 7.26 ± 0.58 to 5.64 ± 0.79 nmol/g; P < 0.05). Decreases were also seen in muscle palmityl CoA (16:0; from 1.06 ± 0.10 to 0.75 ± 0.11 nmol/g; P < 0.05), palmitoleate CoA (16:1; from 0.48 ± 0.05 to 0.33 ± 0.05 nmol/g; P = 0.07), oleate CoA (18:1; from 2.60 ± 0.11 to 1.95 ± 0.31 nmol/g; P < 0.05), linoleate CoA (18:2; from 1.81 ± 0.26 to 1.38 ± 0.18 nmol/g; P = 0.13), and linolenate CoA (18:3; from 0.27 ± 0.03 to 0.19 ± 0.02 nmol/g; P < 0.03) levels after acipimox treatment. Muscle stearate CoA (18:0) did not decrease after acipimox treatment. The increase in R(d) correlated strongly with the decrease in muscle palmityl CoA (r = 0.75, P < 0.05), oleate CoA (r = 0.76, P < 0.05), and total muscle LCFA-CoA (r = 0.74, P < 0.05) levels. Plasma adiponectin did not change significantly after acipimox treatment (7.9 ± 1.8 vs. 7.5 ± 1.5 microg/ml). These data demonstrate that the reduction in intramuscular LCFA-CoA content is closely associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in muscle after a chronic reduction in plasma FFA concentrations in type 2 diabetic patients despite the lack of an effect on plasma adiponectin concentration.

### Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters regulate metabolism via allosteric control of AMPK β 1 isoforms [^113DXgsf]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) play important roles in cellular energy metabolism, acting as both an important energy source and signalling molecules 1. LCFA-CoA esters promote their own oxidation by acting as allosteric inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which reduces the production of malonyl-CoA and relieves inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase1, thereby promoting LCFA-CoA transport into the mitochondria for β-oxidation 2–6. Here we report a new level of regulation wherein LCFA-CoA esters per se allosterically activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) β1-containing isoforms to increase fatty acid oxidation through phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Activation of AMPK by LCFA-CoA esters requires the allosteric drug and metabolite site formed between the α-subunit kinase domain and the β-subunit. β1 subunit mutations that inhibit AMPK activation by the small-molecule activator A769662, which binds to the allosteric drug and metabolite site, also inhibit activation by LCFA-CoAs. Thus, LCFA-CoA metabolites act as direct endogenous AMPK β1-selective activators and promote LCFA oxidation.

Seven healthy men without glucose intolerance (controls subjects [CON]), based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and seven men with established type 2 diabetes aged between 18 and 60 years participated in this metabolic study (Table 1). None of the participants had a current medical condition known to affect lipid levels or insulin sensitivity (other than type 2 diabetes), and participants had no known cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetic subjects were well controlled (A1C < 7.5%) on diet alone and/or with only one oral hypoglycemic agent (sulfonylurea or metformin). Oral hypoglycemic and antihypertensive drugs, when taken, were stopped for 2 days before the study. Capillary blood glucose and blood pressure were monitored four times a day and daily, respectively, during this period. Statin therapy, when present, was stopped for 3 weeks before the study. None of the participants were taking thiazolidinediones, fibrates, or β-blockers.

### Short-term hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia increase myocardial lipid content in normal subjects [^117GkMp2]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Our study did not address the question of whether myocardial steatosis, per se, alters myocardial function. Based on current evidence and our results, we assume that increased MYCL highlights a state of disturbed myocardial substrate metabolism. Recent findings in Wistar rats showed that both a high-fat and a high-fat/high-carbohydrate (Western) diet lead to a similar gain in body weight; however, only the Western diet induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, which was associated with a decreased palmitoleoyl-CoA content and a decreased unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids ratio in the myocardium. The disturbances in MYCL/composition were traced back to altered hepatic de novo lipogenesis. This indicates that in addition to impaired myocardial lipid metabolism, quantitatively and qualitatively altered hepatic lipid synthesis might contribute to myocardial lipid storage and, consequently, dysfunction. In addition, we agree with these authors that lipotoxicity should be replaced by the term glucolipotoxicity when talking about the cardiometabolic complications in patients with obesity and diabetes.

Some limitations must be considered. The MR methods used in the current study did not allow us to discern the precise alterations in myocardial fuel physiology underlying the observed rise in MYCL. Because biopsies of the human myocardium are not feasible in a research setting, investigations on human myocardial metabolism are limited to noninvasive techniques. Advanced high-field MRS has the potential to facilitate the measurement of qualitative changes in MYCL by allowing the monitoring of the degree of saturation of myocardial lipids. However, to our knowledge, these methods have not yet been applied on the beating human myocardium. In addition, positron emission tomography has been used to measure myocardial fatty acid utilization, oxidation, and esterification using radioactively labeled fatty acids. Hence, future studies might combine MR imaging/MRS and positron emission tomography to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying our current observations.

In summary, insulin release in response to hyperglycemia induces a short-term increase in MYCL in healthy subjects. This effect was observed even in the presence of insulin-mediated suppression of plasma FFA concentrations. These findings support the hypothesis that postprandial and/or chronic hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes enhance myocardial steatosis and might thereby contribute to the development of heart failure.

### Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the primary defect in type 2 diabetes [^116dcHv8]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance begets insulin resistance

The normal β-cell response to insulin resistance, irrespective of the etiology of the insulin resistance, is to increase its secretion of insulin. However, a chronic physiologic increase in the plasma insulin concentration has a detrimental effect on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Del Prato et al. demonstrated that a 72 pmol/l (11 μU/ml) increase in the plasma insulin concentration in healthy NGT insulin-sensitive individuals for as little as 72–96 h reduced insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (insulin clamp technique) by 30–40%. The defect in insulin action was accounted for entirely by impaired nonoxidative glucose disposal (Fig. A9). On the other hand, chronic euglycemic hyperinsulinemia did not alter insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production. Koopmans et al. showed that chronic hyperinsulinemia (threefold increase above baseline) in conscious rats for 7 days resulted in a reduction in insulin-mediated total-body glucose uptake, glucose storage, and glycolysis by 39, 62, and 26%, respectively. Hepatic glucose production was normally suppressed after 7 days of hyperinsulinemia. Because the majority (> 80–90%) of glucose disposal during the euglycemic insulin clamp occurs in muscle, these results demonstrate that a physiologic elevation in the plasma insulin concentration will exacerbate the underlying muscle insulin resistance. Iozzo et al. performed a 240-min euglycemic insulin clamp study with muscle biopsies in healthy volunteers. Subjects then received a low-dose insulin infusion for 72 h (plasma insulin concentration 143 ± 25 pmol/l [21 ± 2 μU/ml]), followed by a repeat insulin clamp with muscle biopsies. After 72 h of sustained physiologic hyperinsulinemia, insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthase activity, total body glucose uptake, and nonoxidative glucose disposal (primarily reflects glycogen synthesis in muscle) were significantly reduced. Taken together, these findings indicate that hyperinsulinemia is not only a compensatory response to insulin resistance, but also a self-perpetuating cause of the defect in muscle insulin action.

### Reversing pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115eeBd1]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Progression of β-cell failure in T2D.

A When blood glucose concentrations rise after a meal, β-cells secrete insulin, which activates peripheral tissues to take up glucose and maintain glucose homeostasis. For example, this process acts by reducing hepatic glucose output and gluconeogenesis (liver), inducing glycogen synthesis (liver and muscle), and increasing glucose uptake (muscle and adipocytes). B, C Metabolic stresses, such as excessive calorie intake, obesity, and physical inactivity, promote the development of insulin resistance, a condition in which peripheral tissues become less responsive to insulin. In response, β-cells produce and secrete an abnormally large amount of insulin (hyperinsulinemia). Sustained metabolic stress exacerbates ER and oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which collectively contribute to β-cell failure and the loss of β-cell mass, leading to hyperglycemia.

To compensate for insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cells release more insulin, leading to hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 1). Paradoxically, hyperinsulinemia makes things worse by causing insulin receptor downregulation and activating a vicious cycle of gradually increasing compensatory insulin levels and decreased insulin signaling. In fact, hyperinsulinemia is a hallmark of insulin resistance. The inability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance results in hyperglycemia. The early stages of T2D are associated with hyperinsulinemia, but plasma insulin levels steadily drop as β-cell dysfunction progresses. This results in a relative lack of insulin and a reduction in β-cell mass in the advanced state of progression of the disease(Fig. 1).

### Malonyl CoA decarboxylase inhibition improves cardiac function post-myocardial infarction [^111Uxpzy]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Alterations in cardiac energy metabolism after a myocardial infarction contribute to the severity of heart failure (HF). Although fatty acid oxidation can be impaired in HF, it is unclear if stimulating fatty acid oxidation is a desirable approach to treat HF. Both immediate and chronic malonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase inhibition, which decreases fatty acid oxidation, improved cardiac function through enhancing cardiac efficiency in a post-myocardial infarction rat that underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. The beneficial effects of MCD inhibition were attributed to a decrease in proton production due to an improved coupling between glycolysis and glucose oxidation.

Metabolic inflexibility — metabolic flexibility is the ability of the organ to respond or adapt to changes in metabolic substrates during cycles of eating and fasting; an inability to adequately metabolize the adiposopathic increased circulatory free fatty acid influx may contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular stress, liver inflammation, apoptosis and fibrogenesis, and adiposopathy-mediated systemic insulin resistance may cause skeletal muscle to be "inflexible" in glucose metabolism with mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased mitochondrial oxidation of free fatty acids, re-routing fatty acids toward ceramide synthesis in skeletal muscle and the liver, worsening insulin signaling and insulin resistance and contributing to obesity-mediated prediabetes or T2DM.

### Metabolic consequences of physical inactivity [^11155gBn]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Physical inactivity is associated with alteration of normal physiologic processes leading to muscle atrophy, reduced exercise capacity, insulin resistance, and altered energy balance. Bed rest studies in human beings using stable isotopes of amino acids indicate that muscle unloading decreases the turnover rates of muscle and whole-body proteins, with a prevailing inhibition of protein synthesis. In the fasting state, muscle and whole-body nitrogen loss was not accelerated during bed rest. In experimental postprandial states, the amino acid-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis was impaired, whereas the ability of combined insulin and glucose infusion to decrease whole-body proteolysis was not affected by muscle inactivity. Thus, an impaired ability of protein/amino acid feeding to stimulate body protein synthesis is the major catabolic mechanism for the effect of bed rest on protein metabolism. This suggests that a protein intake level greater than normal could be required to achieve the same postprandial anabolic effect during muscle inactivity. Metabolic adaptation to muscle inactivity also involves development of resistance to the glucoregulatory action of insulin, decreased energy requirements, and increased insulin and leptin secretion. These alterations may lead to the development of the metabolic syndrome that is defined as the association of hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and abdominal obesity. This cluster of metabolic abnormalities is a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke. Evidence indicates that exercise training programs may counteract all of these abnormalities both in healthy sedentary subjects and in patients affected by a variety of chronic disease states.

### Skeletal muscle insulin resistance promotes increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in the elderly [^1144K9ib]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that age-associated muscle insulin resistance is linked with increased IMCL content, which is likely due to age-dependent decreases in mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation activity. In most groups of sedentary individuals, IMCL content is strongly correlated with muscle-specific insulin resistance; however, the IMCL content is most likely a marker of intramuscular content of specific lipid metabolites, such as diacylglycerols, which are likely the direct cause of muscle insulin resistance through activation of protein kinase Cθ, resulting in decreased insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate-1 tyrosine phosphorylation.

Both fasting and postprandial hepatic glycogen concentrations were similar between the young and elderly subjects. Although plasma insulin levels were increased in the elderly as compared with the young, the elderly had severely impaired muscle glycogen synthesis, whereas glycogen synthesis in the liver was similar to the young group. In both groups, hepatic glycogen concentrations reached ∼300 mmol/L in liver, which is similar to the hepatic glycogen concentrations we measured in our previous studies of young healthy volunteers after carbohydrate ingestion.

The similar net postprandial hepatic glycogen storage between the young and the elderly supports the hypothesis that the additional carbohydrate load, which was not stored as muscle glycogen, was diverted away from the muscle and into de novo hepatic lipid synthesis. This is further supported by the more than twofold higher DNL in the elderly, which was strongly correlated with postprandial plasma insulin levels. This association between plasma insulin concentrations and DNL is consistent with our previous studies in young, lean individuals with muscle-specific insulin resistance. Chronic hyperinsulinemia leads to upregulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and liver X receptors, transcription factors that promote DNL, and accordingly, the elderly subjects also had higher fasting plasma TG levels as well as higher postprandial VLDL concentrations. Chronic increases in hepatic DNL likely contribute to the increased hepatic lipid accumulation observed in the elderly in this study as well as previous studies and long-term development of NAFLD, as suggested by a study examining DNL from diet and nonesterified FAs by tracer distributions in liver biopsies from obese patients with NAFLD in which DNL accounted for ∼26% of hepatic TGs. The twofold increased hepatic DNL in the elderly is similar to the increased DNL previously observed in healthy, young, lean, insulin-resistant individuals and occurred despite an ∼20% reduction in caloric content in the meals compared with our previous study in young individuals due to limitations in what the elderly subjects were comfortable ingesting.

### A non-invasive method to assess hepatic acetyl-CoA in Vivo [^114M6vHr]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a critical metabolic signaling molecule that regulates gluconeogenesis, pyruvate oxidation, protein acetylation, and steroid and fatty acid biosynthesis; however, measurements of this metabolite using standard biochemical approaches are technically demanding, and there is currently no method to non-invasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA content in vivo. To this end, we developed and validated a method to non-invasively detect differences in hepatic acetyl-CoA content in vivo across a 5-fold range of physiological acetyl-CoA concentrations by assessing the turnover of [13 C 4]β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB). Here, we show a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.86, p < 0.0001) between hepatic acetyl-CoA content and β-OHB turnover in rats with varying degrees of fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. These studies demonstrate that β-OHB turnover can be used as a surrogate to non-invasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA content, thereby allowing researchers to further elucidate the role of this metabolite in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and other metabolic processes in vivo.

### Viewpoints on the way to a consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The liver [^1146jRin]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is part of the broad spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, which also includes steatosis. The distinction between fatty liver and steatohepatitis only can be made by examination of liver histology, which allows the assessment of inflammatory infiltrate, cellular degeneration, and necrosis and fibrosis, and cannot be made on the basis of clinical or laboratory parameters. Despite the weak correlation between liver function tests and the severity of liver disease, epidemiological studies have shown that transaminases, and, in particular, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), even if in the normal range, predict new-onset type 2 diabetes independent of classic risk factors, metabolic syndrome, and C-reactive protein. The authors postulated that elevated intrahepatic fat (IHF) content played a central role in liver damage and glucose intolerance. Fatty liver is the most common hepatic disorder characterized by triglyceride accumulation within hepatocytes. Although simple fatty liver is thought to be a benign condition, it is characterized by multiple metabolic abnormalities in organs and tissues that are responsive to insulin. Impaired insulin-mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose production, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, and decreased inhibition of lipolysis by insulin has been documented in patients with fatty liver disease. Whether the accumulation of fat in the liver is the primary event leading to hepatic and subsequently peripheral (muscle and adipose tissue) insulin resistance is not clear because of the lack of longitudinal data. In support of primacy of the liver, treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with a hypocaloric very-low-fat diet resulted in an 81% reduction in IHF content in association with reductions in both basal and insulin-suppressed hepatic glucose production and a decrease in FPG concentration. However, there was no significant improvement in insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal. Also, in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, the IHF content was closely correlated with the insulin dose and the sensitivity of endogenous (hepatic) glucose production to insulin and best explained the interindividual variation in insulin requirements. Moreover, when the relationship between peripheral glucose metabolism and fatty liver were explored in healthy nondiabetic humans, the correlation between the IHF content and peripheral insulin resistance was much stronger than the correlation with intramyocellular lipid content, visceral fat content, or subcutaneous fat content. Stefan et al. recently reported that in the model of the metabolically fit, but obese individuals, preserved insulin sensitivity was more strongly associated with lower IHF content than with other parameters of body adiposity, including intramyocellular lipid content, concluding that ectopic fat in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity. Similar conclusions were also reported in individuals with overt type 2 diabetes. In the same line of evidence, we observed that in obese adolescents with fatty liver, there was a greater severity of whole-body insulin resistance compared with that of BMI-matched insulin-resistant obese adolescents with normal IHF content.

### Normal postprandial nonesterified fatty acid uptake in muscles despite increased circulating fatty acids in type 2 diabetes [^115AyBL3]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

We could not find significant reduction of muscle oxidative metabolism in type 2 diabetes. This result contrasts with the results of others who found reduced skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation in prediabetic insulin-resistant individuals. The presence of impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in type 2 diabetes is controversial. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, whole-body postprandial NEFA oxidation is increased, not reduced, whether glucose level is acutely corrected or not with insulin clamp. It should be noted that the [11 C]acetate method we used is based on measurement of 11 CO 2 production from the [11 C]acetyl-CoA intracellular pool (e.g. it is a measure of the Krebs cycle). Mitochondrial uncoupling in vivo in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes could perhaps explain normal or high Krebs cycle carbon flux with reduced ATP production. Because our sample size was small, we cannot exclude that the lack of difference between type 2 diabetic subjects and CON in muscle oxidative metabolism in the current study could be due to a type 2 error.

The steady-state design of our postprandial study did not fully reproduce physiological meal intake and may lead to lower late postprandial overshoot of plasma NEFA level. This may have attenuated differences in skeletal muscle NEFA uptake between type 2 diabetes and CON in the current study. On the other hand, acute correction of postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is expected to increase fatty acid oxidation at the expense of glucose oxidation, leading to increased muscle fatty acid use in the latter. We used an identical postprandial protocol in a recent study without and with acute correction of hyperglycemia with insulin infusion and found nevertheless that type 2 diabetic subjects had higher whole-body postprandial plasma NEFA oxidation than CON in both conditions. Another limitation of our study is that 18 FTHA, a reliable tracer of net tissue NEFA uptake, cannot distinguish oxidative versus nonoxidative tissue NEFA metabolism. We previously found elevated whole-body NEFA and net fatty acid oxidation during the postprandial state in type 2 diabetes. It is therefore possible that increased postprandial plasma NEFA oxidation in type 2 diabetes is the result of increased uptake and oxidation in other lean organs such as the heart and the liver.

### Fatty acid incubation of myotubes from humans with type 2 diabetes leads to enhanced release of β-oxidation products because of impaired fatty acid oxidation: effects of tetradecylthioacetic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid [^112Rteaq]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Biopsies.

Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from eight obese type 2 diabetic patients (49.2 ± 1.8 years) and eight obese control subjects (50.3 ± 1.8 years) taken from musculus vastus lateralis in the fasted state by needle biopsy under local anesthesia. Only sedentary subjects were recruited. Diabetic individuals were treated either with diet alone or in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin, which was withdrawn 1 week before taking the biopsies. The patients had no diabetic complications apart from simple retinopathy. The control subjects had normal glucose tolerance and no family history of type 2 diabetes. The groups were matched with respect to age and BMI but differed by fasting plasma glucose concentrations (5.5 ± 0.2 vs. 10.4 ± 0.7 mmol/l, P < 0.001, t test), fasting serum insulin levels (50.5 ± 5.6 vs. 96.1 ± 12.5 pmol/l, P < 0.05), glucose disappearance rate during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (280.0 ± 34.8 vs. 121.1 ± 23.2 mg · min −1 · m −2, P < 0.001), and A1C (5.4 ± 0.1 vs. 7.6 ± 0.6%, P < 0.05). All subjects gave written informed consent, and the local ethics committee of Funen and Vejle County approved the study.

Cell culture and fatty acid incubation.

Myotubes were established from satellite cells. Human myoblasts from control and type 2 diabetic subjects were differentiated to myotubes at a physiological concentration of insulin (25 pmol/l) and glucose (5.5 mmol/l) for 4 days. Myotubes were then exposed to BSA (40 μmol/l), oleic acid (100 μmol/l), TTA (100 μmol/l), or EPA (100 μmol/l) for another 4 days. Stock solutions of fatty acid sodium salts (6 mmol/l) and BSA (2.4 mmol/l) were heated to 45°C and rapidly mixed (molar ratio of 2.5:1). Only optically clear solutions were used. There were no differences between the myotubes after preincubation with fatty acids as evaluated by microscopic inspection searching for floating cells or cells with lipid droplets. The myotubes had similar protein content independent of incubation medium.

### Prolonged fasting identifies skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction as consequence rather than cause of human insulin resistance [^111TMMaY]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, but it is debated whether this is a primary factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. To test the concept that mitochondrial dysfunction is secondary to the development of insulin resistance, we employed the unique model of prolonged fasting in humans. Prolonged fasting is a physiologic condition in which muscular insulin resistance develops in the presence of increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, increased fat oxidation and low glucose and insulin levels. It is therefore anticipated that skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is maintained to accommodate increased fat oxidation unless factors secondary to insulin resistance exert negative effects on mitochondrial function.

Research Design and Methods

While in a respiration chamber, twelve healthy males were subjected to a 60 h fast and a 60 h normal fed condition in a randomized crossover design. Afterward, insulin sensitivity was assessed using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and mitochondrial function was quantified ex vivo in permeabilized muscle fibers using high-resolution respirometry.

Results

Indeed, FFA levels were increased approximately ninefold after 60 h of fasting in healthy male subjects, leading to elevated intramuscular lipid levels and decreased muscular insulin sensitivity. Despite an increase in whole-body fat oxidation, we observed an overall reduction in both coupled state 3 respiration and maximally uncoupled respiration in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, which could not be explained by changes in mitochondrial density.

Conclusions

These findings confirm that the insulin-resistant state has secondary negative effects on mitochondrial function. Given the low insulin and glucose levels after prolonged fasting, hyperglycemia and insulin action per se can be excluded as underlying mechanisms, pointing toward elevated plasma FFA and/or intramuscular fat accumulation as possible causes for the observed reduction in mitochondrial capacity.

### Malonyl CoA decarboxylase inhibition improves cardiac function post-myocardial infarction [^112xVMmN]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

In this study, MCD inhibition of fatty acid oxidation was primarily observed when fatty acid oxidation rates were normalized for cardiac work, with absolute fatty acid oxidation rates being similar among the groups. This normalization of fatty acid oxidation rates was performed to account for the dramatic changes in cardiac work, which is a major determinant of cardiac mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. However, it must be recognized that the possibility exists that the absence of change in absolute metabolic fatty acid oxidation rates following chronic MCD inhibitor treatment could suggest that the underlying mechanisms may not be dependent on changes in metabolic pathways. A second limitation concerns the mechanisms underlying the effect of MCD inhibition on cardiac function. Emerging evidence has shown that downregulating malic enzyme 1 expression in failing hearts induces favorable shifts in not only improving coupling between glycolysis and glucose oxidation, but also improving redox state and contractile function. As MCD inhibition enhances the antioxidative capacity in MI hearts in conjunction with the improved uncoupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation, whether this is achieved by preserving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate through reducing malic enzyme 1 thereby mediating coupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation, needs further investigation. We are unable to discern whether the MCD inhibition-mediated functional benefits are a direct result of either restoration of cellular redox state due to a better coupling between glycolysis and glucose oxidation for preserving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and enhancing antioxidative capacity, or induction of the more efficient oxidation of glucose to reduce protons thereby altering calcium dynamics, or the consequence of multiple metabolic responses.

### Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the primary defect in type 2 diabetes [^113cKBfA]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The euglycemic insulin clamp technique is considered to be the gold standard for measuring insulin action in vivo. With this technique, whole-body insulin action is quantified as the rate of exogenous glucose infusion (plus any residual hepatic glucose production) required to maintain the plasma glucose concentration at euglycemic levels in response to a fixed increment in the plasma insulin concentration. Because 80–90% of the infused glucose is taken up by skeletal muscle under conditions of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, insulin sensitivity measured with the insulin clamp technique primarily reflects skeletal muscle. Another advantage of this technique is that it can be combined with indirect calorimetry to measure different substrate oxidation rates and with muscle biopsy to examine the biochemical/molecular etiology of the insulin resistance. Measurement of insulin sensitivity by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test reflects both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and correlates well with the insulin clamp technique.

Because insulin clamp studies are not feasible in large epidemiological studies, other surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity from glucose and insulin values in the fasting state or after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) have been developed. The homeostatic model assessment correlates reasonably well with the insulin clamp, but it primarily reflects hepatic insulin sensitivity, since the fasting plasma glucose is determined mainly by the rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP) and insulin is the primary regulator of HGP. The correlation between homeostatic model assessment and the insulin clamp also is less robust when analyzed in subgroups of glucose tolerance. During an OGTT, significant (∼30–40%) amounts of glucose are taken up by the splanchnic bed, and HGP is less completely suppressed than during the insulin clamp technique. As a result, the plasma glucose concentration during OGTT is affected by both hepatic and peripheral (primarily muscle) insulin resistance. Therefore, indexes of insulin resistance from the OGTT, e.g. the Matsuda index, reflect both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and correlate well (R value ∼0.70) with insulin sensitivity measured with the euglycemic insulin clamp.

### Skeletal muscle insulin resistance promotes increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in the elderly [^117W9XGL]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The groups were matched for sex, body weight, BMI, lean body mass, fat mass, nonsmoking status, and physical activity. The screening characteristics of the groups are shown in Table 1. The elderly subjects had higher fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol and TG concentrations, and systolic blood pressure, although the latter was only moderately elevated. The elderly subjects were insulin-resistant as compared with the young subjects as reflected by the mean ISI, which was 37% lower (P < 0.002) in the elderly subjects compared with the young control subjects (Table 1).

The study was conducted after 3 days of a controlled eucaloric diet matched between the groups for percent fat, protein, and carbohydrate content. In the morning on day 1, fasting plasma glucose concentrations were slightly lower than at the time of screening but tended to be higher in the elderly than the young subjects (elderly, 5.20 ± 0.15 vs. young, 4.88 ± 0.16 mmol/L; P = 0.16). Postprandial plasma glucose concentrations were higher in the elderly than in the young subjects (Fig. 1 A), and the AUC of plasma glucose concentrations over the course of the study tended to be higher in the older than the young subjects (elderly, 105.3 ± 3.0 vs. young: 94.2 ± 4.1 mmol/L/h; P = 0.058). Fasting plasma insulin concentrations also tended to be higher in the elderly subjects than the young subjects (69.5 ± 7.1 pmol/L vs. 49.5 ± 4.8 pmol/L; P = 0.08) and increased significantly more in the elderly subjects than the young subjects after each meal and remained higher for most of the postprandial period and the overnight period (Fig. 1 B). Fasting plasma C-peptide concentrations were similar between the groups (elderly, 1.50 ± 0.22 vs. young, 1.07 ± 0.22 pmol/L; P = 0.11), but were higher in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects after the last meal at 8(elderly, 5.52 ± 0.79 vs. young, 2.18 ± 0.54 pmol/L; P < 0.002) and at 9(elderly, 3.74 ± 0.74 young, 1.42 ± 0.35 pmol/L; P = 0.003; Fig. 1 C).

### In vivo actions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion [^112dKuwc]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For insulin to exert its metabolic effects, it must first bind to and activate insulin receptor by phosphorylating three key tyrosine molecules on β chain (Fig. 2). This causes insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 translocation to plasma membrane, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and Akt activation. This causes glucose transport into cell, activation of nitric oxide synthase with arterial vasodilation, and stimulation of multiple intracellular metabolic processes.

Figure 2
Insulin signal transduction in healthy nondiabetic (left panel) and T2DM (right panel) subjects. Thiazolidinediones improve insulin signaling through the PI-3 kinase pathway, while inhibiting insulin signaling through the MAP kinase pathway. Reprinted with permission from DeFronzo.

In humans, we demonstrated that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in muscle is severely impaired in lean T2DM, in obese normal glucose tolerant (NGT) individuals, and in insulin-resistant NGT offspring of two T2DM parents (Fig. 2); similar results have been reported by others. This insulin-signaling defect leads to reduced glucose transport, impaired nitric oxide release (explaining endothelial dysfunction), and multiple defects in intramyocellular glucose metabolism.

In contrast to the defect in IRS-1 activation, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which can be activated by Shc, is normally responsive to insulin (Fig. 2). Stimulation of MAP kinase activates multiple intracellular pathways involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation, and atherogenesis (,–).

The defect in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation impairs glucose transport, and resultant hyperglycemia stimulates fasting/postprandial insulin secretion. Because MAP kinase retains normal sensitivity to insulin, hyperinsulinemia causes excessive stimulation of this pathway and activation of multiple intracellular pathways involved in inflammation and atherogenesis. This provides a pathogenic link that, in part, can explain the strong association between IR and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in nondiabetic and T2DM individuals.

Thiazolidinediones are the only antidiabetes drugs that simultaneously augment insulin signaling through IRS-1 and inhibit MAP kinase pathway, providing a molecular mechanism to explain results from CHICAGO and Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation (PERISCOPE) studies, in which pioglitazone reduced progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary atherosclerosis in T2DM. Consistent with these anatomical studies, pioglitazone in PROactive decreased (P = 0.027) MACE end point (death, MI, stroke) by 16%.

FIG. 1.
Plasma concentrations in response to two carbohydrate-rich mixed meals ingested at 10and 1during a resting study. MRS occurred between 4and 8, during which time no plasma samples were drawn. ○, young subjects (n = 12); ●, elderly subjects (n = 12). A: Plasma concentrations of glucose. B: Plasma concentrations of insulin. C: Plasma concentrations of C-peptide. D: Plasma concentrations of TG. E: Plasma concentrations of chylomicron-free TG. n = 9 for the elderly subjects. F: Plasma concentrations of FAs. ✱ p < 0.05.

Fasting as well as postprandial total plasma TG concentrations tended to be higher in the elderly subjects than the young subjects, although this was not significant (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, chylomicron-free plasma TG concentrations, which represent mostly VLDL, were 1.5-fold higher in the elderly as compared with the young subjects both at baseline (0.73 ± 0.09 vs. 0.48 ± 0.06 mmol/L; P = 0.025) and throughout the postprandial period (Fig. 1 F). Fasting plasma nonesterified FA concentrations were ∼40% higher in the elderly subjects than the young subjects (0.72 ± 0.07 and 0.50 ± 0.06 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.01) and were completely suppressed in both groups after the last meal. During the overnight period, plasma FA increased similarly in both groups and was higher in the young at 3 and 4(Fig. 1 E).

Total cholesterol and HDL were both elevated in the elderly as compared to the young (Table 1), and LDL concentrations tended to be higher in the elderly than the young subjects, although this was not significant (Table 1).

Basal muscle glycogen concentrations tended to be lower in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects (72 ± 4 vs. 83 ± 4 mmol/L muscle; P = 0.06), and net postprandial muscle glycogen synthesis was 45% lower in the elderly subjects than in the young subjects (P = 0.007) (Fig. 2 A).

### A general introduction to the biochemistry of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation [^115ixoo9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Metabolites can also affect the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in metabolism such as enzymes. For example, free fatty acids are activating ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [PPARs (Krey et al; Forman et al; Murakami et al; Xu et al.)], a subclass of the nuclear hormone receptor family. Nuclear hormone receptors typically consist of a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain. The DNA-binding domain binds to specific so-called response elements in the promoter of target genes. Upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors (NRs) undergo a conformation change, which induces dissociation of co-repressors and the recruitment of transcriptional cofactors, resulting in transcription activation. This property makes NRs on the one hand interesting pharmaceutical targets and on the other hand potential mediators in the pathology of disorders in which potential ligands accumulate. Activation of PPARα and PPARβ by (dietary) fatty acids such as oleic acid makes tissues more dependent on FAO, by stimulating cellular fatty acid utilisation pathways including transport, esterification, and oxidation (Mandard et al.).

Effects on transcriptional regulation are often long-term adaptations. Several mechanisms exist for the short-term regulation of substrate use. The activity of specific enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), phosphofructokinase and CPT1, is controlled by metabolites (Hue and Taegtmeyer).

CPT1 catalyses one of the rate-limiting steps in FAO (Drynan et al.). CPT1 activity is regulated by its inhibitor: malonyl-CoA. The cellular energy status is one of the regulators of malonyl-CoA production. During energy shortage, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels fall and adenosine monophosphate levels (AMP) rise, resulting in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activated AMPK initiates a signalling cascade aimed to restore cellular energy levels. A principal event is the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA in malonyl-CoA. Thus, AMPK activation aims to increase energy production by FAO.

### Malonyl CoA decarboxylase inhibition improves cardiac function post-myocardial infarction [^114U4PHb]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of MCD inhibitors in vivo has to consider issues such as the potential for liver steatosis due to redirecting lipids towards TAG synthesis. However, we observed that hepatic TAG content was similar among the MI groups (data not shown), which may be due to a fact that malonyl CoA is more sensitive in inhibiting fatty acid oxidation in heart versus liver mitochondria (Figure 1E). In addition, aged MCD −/− mice, despite elevated hepatic TAG levels, displayed a significant increase in life span of ∼30% than the wild-type littermates.

Infarct size is a key determinant of the outcome of an acute MI. It was therefore important to rule out that any of the beneficial effects of MCD inhibition post-MI were occurring secondary to a reduction in infarct size. This possibility is unlikely because rats were subjected to a permanent MI and MCD inhibition was not initiated until 3 weeks post-MI, and the scar sizes were similar among the post-MI groups. This is of potential important clinical importance, considering many patients who suffer from chronic HF have permanent myocardial infarcts/scars that cannot be revascularized or repaired. Thus, the cardioprotective effects of MCD inhibition may not only enhance coronary revascularization therapy in patients with acute MI, but may also be useful as long-term therapy to prevent the transition to HF.

### Mild physiologic hyperglycemia induces hepatic insulin resistance in healthy normal glucose-tolerant participants [^114fnxpu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Chronic hyperglycemia worsens skeletal muscle insulin resistance and β-cell function. However, the effect of sustained physiologic hyperglycemia on hepatic insulin sensitivity is not clear.

Objective

To examine the effect of sustained physiologic hyperglycemia (similar to that observed in patients with type 2 diabetes) on endogenous (primarily reflecting hepatic) glucose production (EGP) in healthy individuals.

Design

Volunteers participated in a three-step hyperinsulinemic (10, 20, 40 mU/m2 per minute) euglycemic clamp before and after a 48-hour glucose infusion to increase plasma glucose concentration by ∼40 mg/dL above baseline. EGP was measured with 3-3H-glucose before and after chronic glucose infusion.

Participants

Sixteen persons with normal glucose tolerance [eight with and eight without a family history (FH) of diabetes] participated in the study.

Main Outcome Measure

EGP.

Results

Basal EGP increased following 48 hours of glucose infusion (from a mean ± SEM of 2.04 ± 0.08 to 3.06 ± 0.29 mg/kgffm⋅ min; P < 0.005). The hepatic insulin resistance index (basal EGP × fasting plasma insulin) markedly increased following glucose infusion (20.1 ± 1.8 to 51.7 ± 6.6; P < 0.005) in both FH+ and FH- subjects.

Conclusion

Sustained physiologic hyperglycemia for as little as 48 hours increased the rate of basal hepatic glucose production and induced hepatic insulin resistance in health persons with normal glucose tolerance, providing evidence for the role of glucotoxicity in the increase in hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetes.

### Compensatory hyperinsulinemia and the development of an atherogenic lipoprotein profile: the price paid to maintain glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals [^1115d9FR]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The ability of insulin to stimulate glucose disposal varies sixfold to eightfold among apparently healthy individuals. The only way that insulin-resistant persons can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes is by secreting the increased amount of insulin that is necessary to compensate for the resistance to insulin action. The greater the magnitude of muscle and adipose tissue insulin resistance, the more insulin must be secreted to maintain normal or near-normal glucose tolerance. Although compensatory hyperinsulinemia may prevent the development of fasting hyperglycemia in insulin-resistant individuals, the price paid is the untoward physiologic effects of increased circulating insulin concentrations on tissues that retain normal insulin sensitivity. This article focused on the interplay between insulin resistance at the level of the muscle and adipose tissue and normal hepatic insulin sensitivity; this leads to the atherogenic lipoprotein profile that is characteristic of insulin-resistant individuals. It would be inappropriate to minimize the importance of differential insulin sensitivity in the genesis of the changes in lipoprotein metabolism that increase CVD risk in insulin-resistant persons. It would be equally remiss not to emphasize that differential tissue insulin resistance also is necessary to explain why insulin-resistant/hyperinsulinemic individuals are more likely to develop the clinical syndromes (with the exception of type 2 diabetes mellitus) that are listed in Box 1.

### FTO is increased in muscle during type 2 diabetes, and its overexpression in myotubes alters insulin signaling, enhances lipogenesis and ROS production, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction [^111n3UuK]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

A new interesting finding is that FTO overexpression induced lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in myotubes. Alterations of these biological processes have clearly been associated with type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, expression of multiple components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were altered by FTO overexpression, including six complex I, two complex III, one complex IV, and three complex V. Whereas no genes of complex II were altered by FTO overexpression in our transcriptomic analysis, we found that FTO induced a significant reduction, at protein level, of the iron sulfur subunit of complex II, indicating that complex II was also controlled by FTO overexpression. We sought to determine whether these changes might be occurring via PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in muscle. Interestingly, FTO encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase, and methylation of the promoter of PGC1α was altered in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients. However, we found no modification of PGC1α mRNA levels after FTO overexpression in human myotubes. Nevertheless, PGC1α mRNA levels are barely detectable in myotubes; we cannot exclude that a subtle change of PGC1α expression occurred. Nevertheless, we observed, as previously reported, a significant reduction of PGC1α expression in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients compared with control subjects, indicating that PGC1α and FTO are regulated in an opposite manner in these patients. In a recent study, a positive correlation between FTO and PGC1α mRNA levels were observed in young and elderly twins. This correlation was obtained with nondiabetic subjects and thus cannot be compared with our study. All together, our data suggest that PGC1α is probably not involved in FTO-induced alterations of mitochondria genes under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, the FTO-induced modifications of mitochondria transcriptome is associated with a reduction of oxidative metabolism, as suggested by the decrease of complex I-mediated ATP synthesis. Coupled with the increase of lipid synthesis, these data suggest that FTO induces a shift from oxidation of lipid toward their accumulation in myotubes. These data are in accordance with a recent study showing a negative association between muscle FTO expression and lipid oxidation in a large cohort of young and old subjects. It was also recently demonstrated that mice with a dominant mutation in the mouse FTO gene (FTO I367F) showed increased fatty acid gene expression in skeletal muscle. Although this data could suggest enhanced lipid synthesis, this latter was not measured and no conclusion could be drawn regarding the relationship between FTO and lipid storage in muscle. In contrast, our data clearly indicated that increased expression of FTO in myotubes is associated with enhanced lipogenesis.

### Low muscle glycogen and elevated plasma free fatty acid modify but do not prevent exercise-induced PDH activation in human skeletal muscle [^116BDygJ]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Eight healthy normally physical active male subjects with an average age of 26.5 years (range 22–31), weight 80.6 kg (60.4–99.8), and stature of 184.6 cm (175–193) participated in the study. The average peak oxygen uptake of the subjects was 51.8 mL O 2 · min −1 · kg −1 (47.9–55).

The subjects were given both written and oral information about the experimental protocol and procedures and were informed about any discomfort that might be associated with the experiment before they gave their written consent. The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Ethics Committee, Denmark (H-C-2007-0085).

Experimental protocol.

Approximately 2 weeks before the first trial, peak oxygen uptake and Watt max of the subjects were determined by an incremental bicycle test. Furthermore, Watt max during two-legged knee extensor exercise was determined by an incremental test, with a starting resistance of 48–60 W and increasing the load by 12 W every 2 min. The maximal resistance that could be sustained for 2 min was set as Watt max.

Each subject completed two experimental trials, which consisted of identical exercise protocols, but differed in the dietary protocol.

The subjects were instructed to eat food rich in carbohydrates 5 days before a glycogen depletion protocol. Before reporting at the laboratory on the day of glycogen depletion, the subjects consumed a prepackaged standardized meal regulated to body weight and activity level, with 77% energy (%E) carbohydrate, 10E% protein, and 13%E fat.

### Normal postprandial nonesterified fatty acid uptake in muscles despite increased circulating fatty acids in type 2 diabetes [^114ntqVM]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Increased intramyocellular triglyceride (IMTG) level correlates with impaired insulin sensitivity in obese insulin-resistant subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes. Experimental elevation of plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) in humans using intravenous lipid infusion was associated with rapid deposition of IMTG associated with the development of insulin resistance within 4 h. Similarly, high-fat diet for 3 days in healthy volunteers induced IMTG accumulation associated with impaired insulin sensitivity. It has been demonstrated that subjects with type 2 diabetes have increased postprandial IMTG deposition, but the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon have not been elucidated. Impaired muscle fatty acid oxidation has been shown during fasting and during exercise in obese insulin-resistant subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes. However, impaired muscle NEFA oxidation was associated with impaired NEFA uptake in the later studies, and suppression of muscle fatty acid oxidation by insulin was reduced in insulin-resistant individuals. During similar intravenous fat load, NEFA levels were higher in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, a phenomenon that is significantly correlated with lipid-induced insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function in vivo. We demonstrated that this "impaired NEFA tolerance" during intravenous fat load is associated with increased whole-body palmitate oxidation in offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes. Recently, we showed that subjects with type 2 diabetes have increased postprandial NEFA appearance and whole-body oxidation rates without or with acute correction of hyperglycemia using intravenous insulin infusion to clamp glucose level.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether postprandial NEFA uptake in thigh skeletal muscles is increased in men with established but well-controlled type 2 diabetes compared with healthy men without a family history of type 2 diabetes. Our hypothesis was that increased postprandial NEFA appearance is associated with increased NEFA uptake in thigh skeletal muscle of men with type 2 diabetes. Our study design also allowed us, as a secondary objective, to determine postprandial leg subcutaneous adipose tissue NEFA uptake that may be a potential mechanism for increased postprandial plasma NEFA levels in type 2 diabetes.

### Rosiglitazone to reverse metabolic defects in diabetes… [^113RSpLC]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of insulin resistant individuals develop a disproportionate incidence of cardiovascular disease burden including hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and heart failure. The underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial but is primarily driven by insulin-resistance mediated regulatory events. These include augmented oxidative stress, upregulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic signaling pathways, detrimental effects of advanced glycosylation end-products and perturbations in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Evidence is emerging to support a role of perturbed mitochondrial respiratory regulation and subsequent endothelial dysfunction as early events in the insulin-resistance syndrome. These in turn, are proposed to result in the subsequent development of the cardiovascular clinical sequelae.

The hypothesis intrinsic to this proposal is that PPAR activation will improve mitochondrial respiratory and endothelial cell function in parallel with improved insulin sensitization in insulin-resistant and T2DM subjects. The primary objective of this study is to establish the effects of the PPAR gamma agonist on exercise-modulated cardiopulmonary-metabolic function in insulin resistant and T2DM subjects that are either naive to hypoglycemic therapy or are on current therapy with other established classes on anti-diabetic agents with or without associated cardiovascular disease. As secondary end points we will evaluate numerous biological assays of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, endothelial function and changes in parameters of insulin sensitivity.

These include: 1) skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, 2) skeletal muscle expression profiles of genes encoding mitochondrial biogenesis program and mitochondrial respiratory control, 3) brachial artery reactivity, 4) endothelial progenitor cell number and colony-forming capacity, 5) monocyte gene expression profiling to evaluate insulin and inflammatory-mediator regulatory events and 6) serological evaluation in change in insulin sensitivity and inflammation. or the diagnosis of T2DM with a HBA1c less than 9%, a fasting insulin level of greater than 6 UIU/ml and a fasting blood glucose level of greater than 125 mg/dl if not on anti-diabetic therapy.

This will be measured by achieving a peak respiratory exchange ratio greater than or equal to 1.

### Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiometabolic risk: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2023 [^111NWZsK]. Obesity Pillars (2023). High credibility.

Insulin and insulin receptor functions — diminished insulin activity can be due to an absolute or relative decrease in circulating insulin and/or impaired insulin signaling via reduced number of insulin receptors and/or impaired post-receptor insulin signaling; normoglycemia can be maintained in the early stages of insulin resistance by increased basal insulin (hyperinsulinemia), but over time insulin secretion may be insufficient, resulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin binds to the extracellular alpha subunit of the transmembrane insulin receptor and activates phosphorylation of cytoplasmic insulin receptor substrate (IRS), increasing intracellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and intracellular phosphoinositide − 3 kinase (PI3K) / AKT pathway signaling that leads to GLUT 4 vesicle transport to the cell membrane for glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with increased NO production and vasodilation, synthesis of glycogen, lipids, and proteins, and cell growth (proliferation & differentiation).

### Current challenges and future directions in the assessment of glucocorticoid status [^111rWqvh]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, studies have also demonstrated increased basal and stimulated glucagon levels in participants following GC administration, further contributing to hyperglycemia. However, the literature is not consistent, with other studies failing to demonstrate this. This may be explained by differences in the insulin sensitivity in the individuals studied. It has been suggested that additional alpha cell disturbances may be present in those with reduced insulin sensitivity.

AMPK is a key regulatory enzyme of appetite, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism and is believed to mediate some of the deleterious metabolic effects of excess GC. AMPK activity in visceral adipose tissue was inversely associated with 9:00cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol. The effects of AMPK inhibition have demonstrated impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and adipose, increased hepatic glucose output, reduced beta-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and increased lipogenesis and fat storage. Activation of AMPK has been shown to reverse GC-induced hepatic steatosis and effects on glucose metabolism. In nondiabetic patients established on GC for inflammatory disease, treatment with metformin (an activator of AMPK) for 12 weeks reduced truncal subcutaneous fat (−3835 mm 2), improved insulin resistance and glucose concentrations, and reduced inflammation and progression of carotid intima thickness, suggesting that concomitant use of metformin can mitigate the deleterious effects of GC excess.

In summary, there is evidence that, through a variety of mechanisms, GC deficiency may result in hypoglycemia, especially in children, whereas chronic GC excess can result in hyperinsulinemia and, in those at risk, hyperglycemia.

GC Effects on Lipid Profiles

The effects of GC on lipid dysregulation are multifactorial and involve both direct and indirect pathways. GC promotes lipolysis of mature adipocytes but stimulates lipogenesis on preadipocyte cells. Low to moderate concentrations of GC (1–10 µM) stimulate lipolysis of mouse adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells, but high doses of GC suppress lipolytic rate. Lipolysis is likely to be mediated via increased intracellular cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity, and this effect could be blunted by downregulation of cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, a major enzyme responsible for cAMP hydrolysis. GC-induced lipolysis may also in part be mediated via a direct upregulation of GR target such as angiopoietin-like 4, an adipokine that inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity that is involved in lipolysis. In vivo studies reported a 60% rise in fatty acid palmitate level when circulating cortisol concentrations increased from 245 ± 12 nmol/L to 888 ± 7 nmol/L during a 6-hour hydrocortisone infusion (2 μg/kg/min) in the presence of a pancreatic pituitary infusion clamp.

### Muscle-specific relation of acetylcarnitine and intramyocellular lipids to chronic hyperglycemia: a pilot 3-TH MRS study [^115YHMRh]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Results from our previous studies, as well as from other studies, are reported in mmol/kg ww units. However, as was suggested in a recent consensus paper by Krššák et al. (19), results of acetylcarnitine concentrations are given in mmol/L tissue volume units.

Results presented here demonstrate readily available measurements on a broadly accessible magnetic field strength of 3‐T. The main limitation of this study, aside from its preliminary status and relatively small number of volunteers included, was the partial overlap of lipids and acetylcarnitine resonances, especially in the spectra from the SOL from the volunteers with T2DM and IGT. A possible improvement, which was not available for this study, has been introduced recently (20). Those authors proposed a lipid signal suppression by the subtraction of transients following alternative nulling of short T 1 metabolites. Nevertheless, we believe that the spectral quality achieved by an automatic shimming procedure, followed by manual inspection and careful, manual final adjustment, was in our case sufficient to achieve reliable metabolite signal quantification for both acetylcarnitine and IMCL.

In the future, a chemical shift imaging sequence, with simultaneous acquisition of free induction decay and a long TE spin echo signal, as described by Just‐Kukurova et al. (21), could also help to cover the whole calf cross‐sectionally. This would also provide information about specific lipid resonances and water signals from different tissues in the calf, with high resolution, as well as minimal voxel bleeding and subcutaneous lipid contamination, in clinically acceptable measurement times.

Although we excluded active volunteers based on self‐reporting (regular exercise) and the whole of our study population can be considered sedentary, we should consider a questionnaire to more precisely determine physical activity for further studies.

Even though initial reports did not report on the relationships between IMCL amount and BMI or age (2), these correlations were found in subsequent studies using populations with large age differences between groups (22), studies that had large cohorts of lean to slightly overweight populations (4, 23), or studies with well‐selected specific study populations with previous gestational diabetes (3). Nevertheless, our pilot study with a limited number of volunteers selected to cover a broad range of glycemia including both genders and patients with T2DM could not embrace these specific issues, and therefore we could not find any two‐variable relationship between BMI or age and acetylcarnitine or IMCL in our population.

### Lipogenesis in arterial wall and vascular smooth muscular cells: regulation and abnormalities in insulin-resistance [^1123Szyh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Excessive accumulation of lipid substrates in non-adipose tissues has serious adverse effects on cell functions (lipotoxicity) and can contribute to the development of insulin-resistance. Indeed numerous studies have shown an inverse relationship between tissue lipid accumulation and sensitivity to insulin of glucose metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. In such studies tissue lipid accumulation is usually appreciated by measuring triglycerides (TG) content although recent studies clearly show that deleterious effects are not due to the accumulation of TG itself but to other lipid metabolites such as palmitate, diacylglycerols and ceramide. The arterial wall of obese Zucker rats is insulin-resistant although this resistance is limited to the PI3-kinase pathway. In addition, this pathway has also been found insulin-resistant in cultured vascular smooth muscular cells (VSMC) of diabetic patients. The mechanisms responsible for this resistance have not been clarified. It could result from excessive concentration of plasma cytokines such as TNFα, of raised levels of angiotensin II or local overexpression of components of the renin-angiotensin system. It could also result of excessive accumulation of lipid substrates. Actually, arterial wall accumulate TG with aging. In addition, foam cells of atheroma plaques accumulate not only cholesterol but also significant amounts of TG (8–10%of total lipid). These cellular TG modify the physical state of stored esterified cholesterol and this could affect the way it is hydrolyzed and effluxed. Therefore, accumulation of TG could also play a role in atheroma. TG synthesis, as well as cholesterol esterification, requires long chain fatty acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA can be provided by the uptake of circulating lipids (plasma non esterified fatty acids, NEFA, or TG-fatty acids of TG rich lipoproteins) but also by in situ synthesis, the pathway of de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Indeed, arterial wall, foam cells, macrophages and vascular smooth muscular cells (VSMC) incorporate labeled acetate into phospholipids and TG. More recently, Davies et al showed that human VSMC express lipogenic genes such as Srebp-1c, the transcription factor mediating the lipogenic action of insulin, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) and that these expressions, and the intracellular accumulation of TG, are increased by culture in an adipogenic differentiation medium (ADM). Moreover, TO901317, a LXR agonist, also stimulated the expression of Srebp-1c and FAS suggesting that the lipogenic action of LXR described in liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is also present in VSMC. Lastly Davies et al found that FAS and Srebp-1c are expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions and suggested that enhanced VSMC lipogenesis and lipid accumulation could be involved in the development of atheroma. This possibility should be kept in mind when developing nuclear receptor agonists for treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Pharmacological vasodilation improves insulin-stimulated muscle protein anabolism but not glucose utilization in older adults [^112eNEtD]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Interestingly, phenylalanine release from muscle protein breakdown, but not the leg rate of appearance, increased in the group undergoing pharmacological vasodilation, although to a lesser extent than protein synthesis. As a result, phenylalanine net balance across the leg switched from negative to positive, indicating net muscle protein accretion in the SNP group during hyperinsulinemia. This significant positive effect of vasodilation on net balance indicates that the increase in muscle protein breakdown was not due to a modeling artifact or washout effect induced by enhanced blood flow, because in those instances net balance would remain negative. Instead, the significant change in muscle protein breakdown appears to be due to acceleration in intracellular protein turnover, as demonstrated by the significant increase in phenylalanine intracellular recycling from breakdown to synthesis. An increase in intracellular amino acid recycling also occurs in younger subjects during isolated physiological hyperinsulinemia, as long as amino acid availability does not decrease. This may partially explain the conflicting results in the literature of the effects of insulin on protein synthesis and breakdown. For instance, in contrast to data from our laboratory and others (,–), hyperinsulinemia has been reported to have no effect on muscle protein synthesis but to inhibit muscle protein breakdown. We believe this discrepancy may be due to differences in amino acid availability. In studies reporting an insulin-induced increase in muscle protein synthesis, amino acid delivery increased due to either exogenous infusion or increased blood flow with no change in amino acid concentrations, as in the present study. Conversely, studies showing no increase in synthesis with decreased breakdown also reported decreased or unchanged amino acid availability, mainly due to significant reductions in blood amino acid concentrations induced by systemic hyperinsulinemia.

### Impaired insulin sensitivity is accompanied by disturbances in skeletal muscle fatty acid handling in subjects with impaired glucose metabolism [^115fsBrm]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle fatty acid (FA) handling at baseline and after a high-fat mixed meal in impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), IFG/IGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects.

Design

In this multi-center study, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function were assessed (n = 102), using a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp with additional arginine stimulation and a 75g oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting and postprandial skeletal muscle FA handling was examined in a substudy using the forearm balance technique (n = 35).

Subjects

A total of 102 subjects with IFG (n = 48), IGT (n = 12), IFG/IGT (n = 26) and NGT (n = 16).

Results

IFG, IGT and IFG/IGT subjects had lower insulin sensitivity with no differences between groups, and lower impaired β-cell function compared with NGT controls. The early postprandial increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) concentration was higher (iAUC(0-2h) IFG: 238.4 ± 26.5, IGT: 234.0 ± 41.0 and NGT: 82.6 ± 13.8μmoll(-1)min(-1), both P < 0.05) and early TAG extraction was increased (AUC(0-2h) IFG: 56.8 ± 9.0, IGT: 52.2 ± 12.0 and NGT: 3.8 ± 15.4nmol·100ml(-1)min(-1), P < 0.05 and P = 0.057, respectively) in both IFG and IGT subjects.

Conclusion

IFG, IGT and IFG/IGT subjects have lower insulin sensitivity and impaired β-cell function compared with age- and BMI-matched NGT controls. The increased postprandial TAG response and higher muscle TAG extraction in both IFG and IGT compared with NGT may lead to ectopic fat accumulation in the skeletal muscle, thereby contributing to insulin resistance.

### Intramyocellular lipid is associated with resistance to in vivo insulin actions on glucose uptake, antilipolysis, and early insulin signaling pathways in human skeletal muscle [^111iL5ET]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

To examine whether and how intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content contributes to interindividual variation in insulin action, we studied 20 healthy men with no family history of type 2 diabetes. IMCL was measured as the resonance of intramyocellular CH(2) protons in lipids/resonance of CH(3) protons of total creatine (IMCL/Cr(T)), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vastus lateralis muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured using a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (insulin infusion rate 40 mU/m(2). min) clamp. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and 30 min after initiation of the insulin infusion to assess insulin signaling. The subjects were divided into groups with high IMCL (HiIMCL; 9.5 ± 0.9 IMCL/Cr(T), n = 10) and low IMCL (LoIMCL; 3.0 ± 0.5 IMCL/Cr(T), n = 10), the cut point being median IMCL (6.1 IMCL/Cr(T)). The groups were comparable with respect to age (43 ± 3 vs. 40 ± 3 years, NS, HiIMCL versus LoIMCL), BMI (26 ± 1 vs. 26 ± 1 kg/m(2), NS), and maximal oxygen consumption (33 ± 2 vs. 36 ± 3 ml. kg(-1). min(-1), NS). Whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was lower in the HiIMCL group (3.0 ± 0.4 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) than the LoIMCL group (5.1 ± 0.5 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), P < 0.05). Serum free fatty acid concentrations were comparable basally, but during hyperinsulinemia, they were 35% higher in the HiIMCL group than the LoIMCL group (P < 0.01). Study of insulin signaling indicated that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) was blunted in HiIMCL compared with LoIMCL (57 vs. 142% above basal, P < 0.05), while protein expression of the IR was unaltered. IR substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation by insulin was also lower in the HiIMCL group than in the LoIMCL group (49 ± 23 vs. 84 ± 27% above basal, P < 0.05 between HiIMCL and LoIMCL). In conclusion, IMCL accumulation is associated with whole-body insulin resistance and with defective insulin signaling in skeletal muscle independent of body weight and physical fitness.

### Effect of physiological hyperinsulinemia on gluconeogenesis in nondiabetic subjects and in type 2 diabetic patients [^111Ty68p]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is enhanced in type 2 diabetes. In experimental animals, insulin at high doses decreases the incorporation of labeled GNG precursors into plasma glucose. Whether physiological hyperinsulinemia has any effect on total GNG in humans has not been determined. We combined the insulin clamp with the (2)H(2)O technique to measure total GNG in 33 subjects with type 2 diabetes (BMI 29.0 ± 0.6 kg/m(2), fasting plasma glucose 8.1 ± 0.3 mmol/l) and in 9 nondiabetic BMI-matched subjects after 16 h of fasting and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. A primed-constant infusion of 6,6-(2)H-glucose was used to monitor endogenous glucose output (EGO); insulin (40 mU. min(-1). m(-2)) was then infused while clamping plasma glucose for 2 h (at 5.8 ± 0.1 and 4.9 ± 0.2 mmol/l for diabetic and control subjects, respectively). In the fasting state, EGO averaged 15.2 ± 0.4 micromol. min(-1). kg(-1)(ffm) (62% from GNG) in diabetic subjects and 12.2 ± 0.7 micromol. min(-1). kg(-1)(ffm) (55% from GNG) in control subjects (P < 0.05 or less for both fluxes). Glycogenolysis (EGO - GNG) was similar in the two groups (P = NS). During the last 40 min of the clamp, both EGO and GNG were significantly (P < 0.01 or less, compared with fasting) inhibited (EGO 7.1 ± 0.9 and 3.6 ± 0.5 and GNG 7.9 ± 0.5 and 4.5 ± 1.0 respectively) but remained significantly (P < 0.05) higher in diabetic subjects, whereas glycogenolysis was suppressed completely and equally in both groups. During hyperinsulinemia, GNG micromol. min(-1). kg(-1)(ffm) in diabetic and control subjects, was reciprocally related to plasma glucose clearance. In conclusion, physiological hyperinsulinemia suppresses GNG by approximately 20%, while completely blocking glycogenolysis. Resistance of GNG (to insulin suppression) and resistance of glucose uptake (to insulin stimulation) are coupled phenomena. In type 2 diabetes, the excess GNG of the fasting state is carried over to the insulinized state, thereby contributing to glucose overproduction under both conditions.

### Small amounts of dietary medium-chain fatty acids protect against insulin resistance during caloric excess in humans [^116hZKBc]. Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have in rodents been shown to have protective effects on glucose homeostasis during high-fat overfeeding. In this study, we investigated whether dietary MCFAs protect against insulin resistance induced by a hypercaloric high-fat diet in humans. Healthy, lean men ingested a eucaloric control diet and a 3-day hypercaloric high-fat diet (increase of 75% in energy, 81–83% energy [E%] from fat) in randomized order. For one group (n = 8), the high-fat diet was enriched with saturated long-chain FAs (LCSFA-HFD), while the other group (n = 9) ingested a matched diet, but with ∼30 g (5E%) saturated MCFAs (MCSFA-HFD) in substitution for a corresponding fraction of the saturated long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with femoral arteriovenous balance and glucose tracer was applied after the control and hypercaloric diets. In LCSFA-HFD, whole-body insulin sensitivity and peripheral insulin-stimulated glucose disposal were reduced. These impairments were prevented in MCSFA-HFD, accompanied by increased basal fatty acid oxidation, maintained glucose metabolic flexibility, increased nonoxidative glucose disposal related to lower starting glycogen content, and increased glycogen synthase activity, together with increased muscle lactate production. In conclusion, substitution of a small amount of dietary LCFAs with MCFAs rescues insulin action in conditions of lipid-induced energy excess.

### Insulin human (Afrezza) [^115Y9AFg]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Insulin lowers blood glucose levels in adult patients with diabetes mellitus by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different patients or within the same patient. The average pharmacodynamic profile [i.e., glucose lowering effect measured by glucose infusion rate (GIR) over time in a euglycemic clamp study] after administration of a single AFREZZA dose of 4, 12, and 48 units in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 3(A), and key characteristics regarding the timing of the effects are described in Table 4:

Figure 3. Results After Administration of AFREZZA 4, 12, and 48 Units in Patients with T1DM (N = 30) A) Mean Insulin Effect (Baseline-Corrected Glucose Infusion Rate); and B) Pharmacokinetic (Baseline-Corrected Serum Insulin Concentration Profiles)

On average, the pharmacodynamics effect of AFREZZA, measured as area under the glucose infusion rate – time curve (AUC GIR) increased linearly with doses up to 48 units (106, 387, and 1581 mg/kg for 4, 12, and 48 units doses, respectively).

Intrapatient variability in AUC GIR and GIRmaxwas approximately 28% (95% CI 21–42%) and 27% (95% CI 20–40%), respectively.

### Atrial natriuretic peptide induces postprandial lipid oxidation in humans [^112zmZm2]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Increased lipolysis with ANP increased circulating FFA levels throughout the experiment. Pancreatic β-cells are affected by FFAs depending on the duration of exposure. Acutely, FFAs together with an increase in glucose concentrations induce an exaggerated insulin response. In accord with previous studies, insulin concentrations increased with ANP infusion in the early postprandial phase. Insulin regulates lipolysis by modulating cAMP concentrations through type 3B phosphodiesterase (PDE-3B).

ANP-induced lipolysis is mediated by cGMP formation. Previously, radioligand binding assays using [123 I]-labeled ANP as the ligand showed high-affinity binding sites on human adipocytes. ANP increased intracellular cGMP concentrations 187-fold, whereas cAMP concentrations remained unchanged. The increase in cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G, which phosphorylates and activates hormone-sensitive lipase. In noncellular systems, cGMP inhibits PDE-3B. However, pharmacological PDE-3B inhibition or PDE-3B stimulation through insulin did not affect ANP-induced lipolysis in isolated adipocytes. In our study, the ANP-mediated lipolysis was attenuated early in the postprandial phase. In subcutaneous adipose tissue, lipolysis decreased sharply after food ingestion and increased again late into the study. Lipolysis inhibition coincided with the peak in circulating insulin concentrations. This pattern might suggest a discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo actions of ANP on metabolism.

ANP induced lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue but not in skeletal muscle. The molecular mechanism for this difference is unknown. In skeletal muscle, only combined hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia suppress lipolytic activity. Lipoprotein lipase activity, which hydrolyzes lipoproteins to FFAs and glycerol mainly in the epithelium of capillary beds, is reduced by insulin in skeletal muscle. However, consistent with the present study, ANP did not increase glycerol concentrations in skeletal muscle under basal conditions. This finding argues against a specific insulin effect on the ANP-mediated metabolic effect in skeletal muscle. The vastus lateralis muscle consists of mixed muscle fibers. Skeletal muscles show different degrees of lipolytic response to adrenergic stimuli according to their fiber type composition. In contrast to adipose tissue, glycerol can be taken up and reused in muscle after triglyceride hydrolysis. Postprandially, the effect can account for up to 50% of the released glycerol. Finally, increased blood flow could possibly wash out interstitial glycerol concentrations. We did not observe a change in local skeletal muscle blood flow with ANP. However, the ethanol ratio is a qualitative rather than quantitative method of determining blood flow and therefore not sensitive toward minor changes in blood flow. We cannot rule out the possibility that we missed subtle changes in blood flow and lipolysis.

### Enhanced skeletal muscle lipid oxidative efficiency in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive nondiabetic, nonobese humans [^115oqxGz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is proposed to result from impaired skeletal muscle lipid oxidative capacity. However, there is no evidence indicating that muscle lipid oxidative capacity is impaired in healthy otherwise insulin-resistant individuals.

Objective

The objective of the study was to assess muscle lipid oxidative capacity in young, nonobese, glucose-tolerant, insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive individuals.

Design and Volunteers

In 13 insulin-sensitive [by Matsuda index (MI) (22.6 ± 0.6 [SE] kg/m(2)); 23 ± 1 years; MI 5.9 ± 0.1] and 13 insulin-resistant (23.2 ± 0.6 kg/m(2); 23 ± 3 years; MI 2.2 ± 0.1) volunteers, skeletal muscle biopsy, blood extraction before and after an oral glucose load, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were performed.

Main Outcome Measures

Skeletal muscle mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio, oxidative phosphorylation protein content, and citrate synthase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities were assessed. Muscle lipids and palmitate oxidation ((14)CO2 and (14)C-acid soluble metabolites production) at 4 [1-(14)C]palmitate concentrations (45–520 μM) were also measured.

Results

None of the muscle mitochondrial measures showed differences between groups, except for a higher complex V protein content in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive volunteers (3.5 ± 0.4 vs 2.2 ± 0.4; P = 0.05). Muscle ceramide content was significantly increased in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive individuals (P = 0.04). Total palmitate oxidation showed a similar concentration-dependent response in both groups (P = 0.69). However, lipid oxidative efficiency (CO2 to (14)C-acid soluble metabolites ratio) was enhanced in insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive individuals, particularly at the highest palmitate concentration (0.24 ± 0.04 vs 0.12 ± 0.02; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

We found no evidence of impaired muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity in young, nonobese, glucose-tolerant, otherwise insulin-resistant vs insulin-sensitive individuals. Enhanced muscle lipid oxidative efficiency in insulin resistance could be a potential mechanism to prevent further lipotoxicity.

### Multiorgan insulin sensitivity in lean and obese subjects [^114ev8B9]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

We studied a group of lean subjects to serve as a comparison group for our obese subjects. Although relative to the lean group the obese group demonstrated evidence of insulin-resistant liver and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism during the HECP, basal glucose concentration was not significantly different between the two groups. The normalization of basal glucose metabolism was presumably caused by a threefold greater plasma insulin concentration in the obese than lean subjects, which compensated for the defect in insulin action. Thus, even though our obese subjects had normal fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance test results, they had evidence of multiorgan insulin resistance when challenged by an insulin infusion. These results underscore the complexity of evaluating the metabolic health of obese people. Although approximately one third of obese people are considered to be "metabolically normal", it is likely that most of these individuals are "insulin resistant" with respect to glucose and fatty acid metabolism and therefore at increased risk for diabetes and coronary heart disease.

Our data demonstrate that physiological hyperinsulinemia causes a greater suppression of EGP than glycerol R a and palmitate R a (Fig. 2). This observation is consistent with the results from the only previous study of which we are aware that evaluated the effect of insulin on EGP and adipose tissue lipolytic activity (assessed by glycerol kinetics) simultaneously in the same subjects; however, even though hyperinsulinemia caused greater maximal suppression of EGP than glycerol R a, the half-maximal suppression of glycerol R a occurred at a lower plasma insulin concentration than that required for half-maximal suppression of EGP. Evaluation of hepatic insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose metabolism by using the HECP is complex, however, because of the dual blood supply to the liver and the effects of insulin on other organ systems that can affect glucose production. Normally, insulin is secreted from pancreatic β-cells into the portal vein and metabolized by the liver before entering the systemic circulation. During basal conditions, portal vein insulin concentration is ∼2.4-fold higher than systemic insulin concentration. Infusing insulin through a peripheral vein during the HECP decreases the gradient between portal and systemic insulin concentrations, so that the relationship between insulin delivered to the liver and insulin delivered to other organs changes with increasing insulin infusion. Furthermore, the extrahepatic effects of systemic insulin can decrease hepatic glucose production by suppressing adipose tissue lipolysis and circulating FFA, stimulating hypothalamic pathways, and inhibiting pancreatic glucagon secretion. In addition, systemic insulin decreases EGP by the kidney, which can account for ∼25% of EGP during basal conditions.

### Multiorgan insulin sensitivity in lean and obese subjects [^116gC6wV]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with a constellation of metabolic alterations that are risk factors for coronary heart disease, including diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is likely that insulin resistance in specific organ systems, namely adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, is involved in the pathogenesis of these metabolic abnormalities. The effect of insulin resistance on daily glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism in obese people who do not have diabetes is unclear, however, because it is possible that hyperinsulinemia associated with obesity can overcome the defect in insulin action and normalize metabolic function. In fact, data from large studies have demonstrated that basal plasma glucose and FFA concentrations in obese people are not different than those in lean subjects. Accordingly, it is possible that many obese people have multiorgan insulin resistance and are at increased risk for development of metabolic diseases even when basal glucose and FFA concentrations are normal.

The assessment of insulin action is complex because insulin has multiple metabolic functions that differ across organ systems and require different doses of insulin to achieve maximal effects. A multistage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure (HECP), conducted in conjunction with isotopically labeled tracer infusions to measure substrate kinetics, can be used to determine simultaneously insulin action in the liver (suppression of glucose R a into plasma), muscle (stimulation of glucose R d from plasma), and adipose tissue (suppression of adipose tissue triglyceride lipolysis; i.e.g.lycerol and palmitate R a into plasma).

The primary purpose of the current study was to further understand the potential insulin-related metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity by providing a comprehensive assessment of multiorgan insulin sensitivity across a physiological range of plasma insulin concentrations in lean and obese subjects through the use of a multistage HECP in conjunction with stable isotopically labeled glucose, palmitate, and glycerol tracer infusions. Only subjects who had normal fasting plasma glucose concentrations and who did not have impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes were included in this study to eliminate the potential confounding influences of basal hyperglycemia and diabetes therapy on the assessment of insulin action. Most obese people do not have impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, so our group represents the majority of the obese population. We hypothesized that hepatic glucose production and adipose tissue lipolytic rate are much more sensitive to insulin than is muscle glucose uptake. Basal hyperinsulinemia and physiological increases in plasma insulin concentration in obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance should therefore be able to overcome insulin resistance in the liver and adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle, resulting in normal rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and lipolysis but not glucose disposal.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^113UKJWh]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Adiposopathic processes and insulin resistance (Fig. 7) describe that if obesity-mediated adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue accumulation outgrow its vascular supply, then the insufficient delivery of oxygen may contribute to adipocyte and adipose tissue hypoxia and increased adipocyte death. Maladaptive mechanotransduction may promote obesity-associated dysfunction in adipose tissue, and overall, contributors to mitochondrial dysfunction include adipocyte and adipose tissue hypoxia, lipotoxicity, maladaptive mechanotransduction, hyperglycemia, and with specific regard to obesity, excess nutrient supply. Among the oxidative adverse consequences of adiposopathic mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction is a greater generation of reactive oxygen species, and increased tumor necrosis factor-mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production may activate JNK activation, increase serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, decrease insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and thus contribute to obesity-mediated insulin resistance. Systemically, adiposopathic proinflammatory factors, pathogenic hormones, and free fatty acids may be released into the circulation either directly from adipose tissue or via adipocyte extracellular vesicles, and the increase in pro-inflammatory factors with decreased secretion of adiponectin may promote insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Twelve healthy, lean, male volunteers who had no family history of diabetes or any other endocrine disorder participated in this study (Table 1). None of the subjects engaged in sports activities for more than 2 h per week. Body composition and maximal aerobic capacity were measured as described previously. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre and all subjects gave their written informed consent before participating in the study.

TABLE 1
Subject characteristics

Experimental design.

Subjects participated in two experimental trials: a 60 h fast and a 60 h normal fed condition, in a randomized crossover design with a 2-week washout period. In the fast condition, subjects were fasted for 60 h (calorie-free drinks only), whereas in the second condition, subjects were fed in energy balance (50–35–15% of energy as carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively). Before the start of each experimental period, a standardized evening meal was provided. Subject stayed in a respiration chamber during the entire 60 h to ensure compliance to the dietary regime and to allow the measurement of 24 h substrate oxidation and energy expenditure. In the respiration chamber, subjects followed an activity protocol as previously described. During the intervention, blood samples were taken after 12, 36, and 60 h after an overnight fast in case of the fed condition.

Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

After leaving the respiration chamber on the morning of the third day, a muscle biopsy was taken and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure was performed. Insulin-stimulated plasma glucose rate of disappearance (Rd), endogenous glucose production (EGP), and nonoxidative glucose disposal (mainly reflecting glycogen synthesis) were calculated as by Phielix et al. Substrate oxidation in the basal and the insulin-stimulated state was measured using indirect calorimetry (Omnical, Maastricht, the Netherlands) and calculated according to Frayn.

Muscle biopsy.

After taking the muscle biopsy, a portion of the muscle tissue was directly frozen in melting isopentane and stored at −80°C until assayed. Another portion (∼30 mg) was immediately placed in ice cold preservation medium.

### Normal postprandial nonesterified fatty acid uptake in muscles despite increased circulating fatty acids in type 2 diabetes [^111KCp33]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics and plasma metabolites and insulin levels.

Type 2 diabetic subjects were older and tended to have higher body fat than CON. Type 2 diabetic subjects also had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose levels and tended to have increased fasting plasma insulin, NEFA, and LDL cholesterol levels.

Plasma glucose was higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than in CON throughout the metabolic study (Fig. 2 A) (ANOVA P < 0.01) with significant group × time interaction due to the clamp procedure in the last 3 h that abolished difference between the two groups during the PET/CT acquisition period (ANOVA P = 0.45). Plasma insulin, NEFA, and TGs (Fig. 2 B, C, and D, respectively) were also significantly higher in type 2 diabetic subjects than in CON (all ANOVA P < 0.01) without significant group × time interaction.

Skeletal muscle blood flow and oxidative metabolic indexes.

QF (predominantly white fibers) and BF (predominantly red fibers) blood flow indexes (Fig. 3 A and B) tended to be lower in type 2 diabetic subjects than in CON (QF: 0.21 ± 0.07 vs. 0.32 ± 0.04 min, P = 0.17; BF: 0.22 ± 0.05 vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 min, P = 0.17). There was no significant difference in blood flow index between QF and BF in both groups of participants. Skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism indexes (Fig. 3 C and D) were similar in type 2 diabetic subjects and CON (QF: 0.27 ± 0.11 vs. 0.44 ± 0.24 min, P = 0.93; BF: 0.15 ± 0.09 vs. 0.20 ± 0.08 min, P = 0.66).

### Effect of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose metabolism in subjects with normal glucose tolerance [^1138X4SF]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance, but the inheritability of glucotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We examined the effect of 3 days of hyperglycemia on glucose disposal, enzyme activities, insulin signaling, and protein O -GlcNAcylation in skeletal muscle of individuals without (FH -) or with (FH +) family history of type 2 diabetes. Twenty-five subjects with normal glucose tolerance received a [3–3 H]glucose euglycemic insulin clamp, indirect calorimetry, and vastus-lateralis biopsies before and after 3 days of saline (n = 5) or glucose (n = 10 FH - and 10 FH +) infusion to raise plasma glucose by ∼45 mg/dL. At baseline, FH + had lower insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and total glucose disposal (TGD) but similar nonoxidative glucose disposal and basal endogenous glucose production (bEGP) compared with FH - After 3 days of glucose infusion, bEGP and glucose oxidation were markedly increased, whereas nonoxidative glucose disposal and TGD were lower versus baseline, with no differences between FH - and FH + subjects. Hyperglycemia doubled skeletal muscle glycogen content and impaired activation of glycogen synthase (GS), pyruvate dehydrogenase, and Akt, but protein O -GlcNAcylation was unchanged. Insulin resistance develops to a similar extent in FH - and FH + subjects after chronic hyperglycemia, without increased protein O -GlcNAcylation. Decreased nonoxidative glucose disposal due to impaired GS activation appears to be the primary deficit in skeletal muscle glucotoxicity.

Hyperglycemia-induced changes

In experimental models, hyperglycemia plays a central role in early development of atherosclerosis by enhancing monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, by activation of NF-κB, and by production of AGEs formed by sustained exposure of proteins and lipids to hyperglycemia. Glucose- and AGE-mediated inhibition of NO production by endothelial cells is associated with impaired endothelial function. High glucose concentrations can also stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and smooth muscle cell migration to the intima, where they participate in the formation of a fibrous cap.

Acute coronary syndrome is usually a consequence of a coronary plaque rupture. Thin fibrous cap, caused by decreased collagen production or degradation of collagen and matrix by proteinases, and inflammation, both often observed in type 2 diabetes, increase susceptibility to plaque rupture. Platelet activity and blood coagulability are increased in type 2 diabetes, resulting in enhanced thrombus formation. Advanced atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic patients have reduced number of vascular muscle cells and therefore these lesions are more vulnerable for rupture.

### Molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance that impact cardiovascular biology [^113boLzG]. Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is concomitant with type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Because insulin resistance is associated with cardiovascular disease, both scientists and physicians have taken great interest in this disorder. Insulin resistance is associated with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, but individual contributions of either of these two conditions remain incompletely understood and a subject of intense investigation. One possibility is that in an attempt to overcome the inhibition within the metabolic insulin-signaling pathway, hyperinsulinemia may continue to stimulate the mitogenic insulin-signaling pathway, thus exerting its detrimental influence. Here we discuss some of the effects of insulin resistance and mechanisms of potentially detrimental influence of hyperinsulinemia in the presence of metabolic insulin resistance.

Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

Each subject underwent two test days on which insulin sensitivity was measured during a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (40 mU ⋅ m −2 ⋅ min −1) clamp according to DeFronzo et al. with a primed infusion of [6,6]- 2 H 2 glucose (0.03 mg ⋅ kg −1 ⋅ min −1) to calculate rates of glucose appearance (R a), glucose disposal (R d), and hepatic glucose production (EGP). Test days with either the infusion of glycerol (1.32 mL/min as control condition) or a heparinized (0.2 U ⋅ kg −1 ⋅ min −1) infusion of triglycerides (1.35 mL/min; Intralipid, Baxter, Utrecht, the Netherlands) were randomly assigned. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were elevated to physiological levels seen during a high-fat diet or fasting plasma concentrations in insulin-resistant, nondiabetic, obese humans and patients with T2D. Two days before both test days, subjects refrained from participating in sport activities. On the day of the clamp, subjects reported to the laboratory at 7:30after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sample was drawn to measure glucose, insulin, and FFAs followed by the start of the primed [6,6]- 2 H 2 glucose infusion. Baseline blood samples were drawn, and indirect calorimetry measurements were performed to measure carbohydrate and lipid oxidation, and to calculate nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD). A muscle biopsy was taken from the m. vastus lateralis under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) according to the technique of Bergström et al. After the muscle biopsy, the infusion of insulin and 20% variable glucose was started (t = 0) combined with simultaneous infusion of 4% glycerol (1.32 mL/min) or 20% intralipid (1.35 mL/min). Indirect calorimetry measurements were repeated during the last 30 min of the clamp (t = 330). Blood glucose was maintained as euglycemic, ∼5.0 mmol/L. A second muscle biopsy was taken immediately after the clamp.

Calculations.

Calculations for non–steady state R a and R d during the clamp were performed as described by Steele. EGP was calculated as R a minus glucose infusion rate. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation were calculated as described by Frayn. In addition, NOGD was calculated as R d minus whole-body carbohydrate oxidation.

### Malonyl CoA decarboxylase inhibition improves cardiac function post-myocardial infarction [^115tL75w]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

It is generally assumed that the heart switches from fatty acid to glucose metabolism in the failing heart. If this was the case, it would not appear logical to inhibit fatty acid oxidation as an approach for improving cardiac energetics in the failing heart. It has been proposed by Kolowicz et al.that stimulating fatty acid oxidation may be beneficial in the failing heart. However, it is probably more accurate to suggest that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism decreases in the HF, with a switch in energy metabolism towards glycolysis in HF.

Glycolysis is a source of lactate and protons especially when glucose oxidation is impaired. The clearance of protons is rapid. However, this still decreases the cardiac efficiency because of the association with the influx of Na +, which can subsequently lead to accumulation of intracellular Ca 2+. As a result, a significant amount of cardiac ATP is shunted away from providing energy for contraction to re-establishing normal Na + and Ca 2+ ionic homeostasis. The assessment of proton production rates in the current study is a technical limitation, which is not a direct measurement but a calculation from the rates of glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Our previous studies have shown that the calculated proton production from glycolysis and glucose oxidation is inversely correlated to intracellular pH, measured by using 31 -P-NMR spectroscopy, and to cardiac efficiency in post-ischemic hearts, whereas cardiac efficiency is improved in post-ischemic hearts by altering both the source and fate of proton. Kolowicz et al.also observed an improved coupling of glucose metabolism with a decreased lactate production in mice with cardiac-specific deletion of acetyl CoA carboxylase 2. We further extended our understanding towards the mechanisms underlying MCD inhibition-mediated coupling of glucose metabolism and found an increased expression of LDH1 with a decreased expression of LDH5 in MI hearts post-MCD inhibition. An increase in M subunit of LDH is an indicator of increased glycolytic capacity. An increase in LDH5 and a decrease in LDH1 isoenzyme expression was seen in myocardium from patients with chronic HF, in which a shift of LDH pattern towards an increase in LDH1 paralleled by a decrease in LDH5 was observed after treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Therefore, we propose that the alteration of LDH isoenzymes in MI hearts post-MCD inhibition may increase to the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, thereby reducing glycolysis to improve the coupling of glucose metabolism. Thus, monitoring of cardiac LDH enzymatic adaptation may be of clinical interest.

### Hyperinsulinemia improves ischemic LV function in insulin resistant subjects [^114oK4dA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Metabolic environment

As expected, baseline metabolic profiles of the two groups were different, with the IR group having higher insulin and c-peptide concentrations. The FFA and glucose concentrations were also elevated in the IR group, but not significantly so, due in part to the sub-study being relatively underpowered to assess these. These differences are expected, as the groups were not randomly selected, but selected on the basis of each subject's insulin sensitivity, measured during the HEC. Elevated fasting glucose, insulin and FFA concentrations are all part of the phenotype seen in insulin resistance.

At the steady state phase of the clamp, before the start of the dobutamine stress, the differences in the metabolic measurements persisted. Despite the higher insulin concentration in the IR group, lipolysis inhibition was not as complete, with a persisting elevation of the FFA concentration compared to the IS group. As one of the main driving forces for myocardial FFA uptake and utilization is substrate availability, it would therefore be expected that the myocardium in the IR groups will be using more FFAs than in the IS group and that this might disadvantage the IR group.

### Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiometabolic risk: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2023 [^114AuszM]. Obesity Pillars (2023). High credibility.

Adipose tissue and insulin signaling — distribution of receptors, glucose transporters, and metabolic effects are described as follows: IRs are found in virtually all body tissues, including adipocytes, liver cells, muscle cells, pancreatic beta cells, kidney cells, and brain cells. In muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, activated insulin receptors recruit and translocate GLUT-4, increase glucose cellular uptake, and thus decrease circulating glucose levels. In adipose tissue, insulin increases glucose uptake in adipocytes with increased lipogenesis, decreased lipolysis, and increased fat mass; in muscle, insulin increases glucose uptake, increases glycogen synthesis, decreases glucose release, and increases lipogenesis. In contrast, glucose transport in liver, pancreatic beta cells, kidney, and brain is not directly dependent on insulin and occurs via insulin independent GLUT2 in liver, pancreatic beta cells, and kidney, and via insulin independent GLUT1 & GLUT 3 in the brain, while insulin still promotes glycogen synthesis and decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver. During basic conditions, the liver is the main organ for glucose regulation via endogenous glucose production by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and about 80% of glucose production is derived from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by the liver.

Insulin receptor–PI3K/AKT signaling — insulin secretion binds to body tissue insulin receptors (IR), and activation of IR tyrosine kinases phosphorylates IRS, which facilitates the PI3K/AKT intracellular pathway; among the effects of the PI3K/AKT pathway are translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) in muscle and adipose tissue to the cell surface, facilitating cellular glucose uptake and reduced circulating glucose blood levels.

### Medication-induced hyperglycemia: pediatric perspective [^11426FLD]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Mechanisms of hyperglycemia

Mechanisms involved in medication-induced hyperglycemia include β cell destruction, decreased insulin secretion and/or sensitivity, and excessive glucose influx (figure 1). The majority of drugs associated with hyperglycemia affect insulin production, secretion, or action, leading to an imbalance in insulin and glucose homeostasis.

Figure 1
Proposed mechanisms of medication-induced hyperglycemia.

β cell destruction

β cells can be destroyed by multiple mechanisms including direct cytotoxicity on pancreatic β cells, inflammation, and islet autoimmunity. Evidence on increased islet cell autoimmunity with certain medications has been emerging. Many pharmacotherapies, particularly newer anticancer medications, modulate immune checkpoint proteins, modify T cell regulatory function, and increase the risk of immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including diabetes mellitus.

Decreased insulin secretion

Hyperglycemia induces a series of intracellular signals that result in the release of insulin secretory granules that were previously synthesized, processed and stored. Medications that affect the body's ability to adequately synthesize and secrete insulin result in hyperglycemia.

Decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity

When insulin reaches target tissues, it binds to a cell membrane receptor that induces a conformational change and activation of intracellular signals. This results in inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, increased glucose transport to fat and muscle tissue, and stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Drugs that reduce the receptor number or affinity, interfere with insulin action, or inhibit postreceptor events can cause hyperglycemia by decreasing insulin sensitivity. In addition, some drugs decrease insulin sensitivity in target tissues through indirect mechanisms such as weight gain, leading to obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Excessive glucose influx

There are several physiologic processes that release glucose into the circulation (eg, hepatic glycogenolysis, hepatic gluconeogenesis) while others (eg, glycogen synthesis) remove glucose. Medications that enhance glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis may result in hyperglycemia. In addition, excessive glucose intake, particularly through a parenteral route, may overwhelm the pancreatic capacity of insulin production and cause hyperglycemia.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^114Uvn7U]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Insulin and insulin receptor functions — diminished insulin activity can be due to an absolute or relative decrease in circulating insulin and/or impaired insulin signaling via a reduced number of insulin receptors and/or impaired post-receptor insulin signaling. Normoglycemia can be maintained in the early stages of insulin resistance by increased basal insulin (hyperinsulinemia) as often occurs in patients with obesity. Insulin is released by pancreatic beta cells in response to a rise in blood glucose and binds to the extracellular alpha subunit of the transmembrane insulin receptor, facilitating the recruitment and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Activated IRS stimulates intracellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, which is responsible for most of insulin's intracellular actions. Insulin-dependent GLUT 4 is found in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, whereas insulin-independent GLUT2 is found in the liver. Increased PI3K/AKT signaling promotes increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity with increased nitric oxide production, increased tissue perfusion allowing enhanced glucose and free fatty acid uptake in adipocytes for storage, as well as synthesis of glycogen, lipids, and proteins and cell growth (proliferation and differentiation).

### Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic relevance [^1147Y7xK]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In support of these reports, infusions of insulin to healthy people for 2 to 4 days to produce even mild increases in peripheral insulin levels were shown to decrease insulin-mediated muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis by 20% to 40%. In a similar study in healthy adults, elevation of plasma insulin within the physiological postprandial range impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in brachial/common femoral arteries due to oxidative stress. Likewise, subjects with benign insulinoma chronically exposed to moderate or marked endogenous hyperinsulinemia were shown to develop generalized insulin resistance leading to an increase in EGP and muscle proteolysis, and a decrease in peripheral glucose disposal.

A study was designed to address this question, whether iatrogenic peripheral hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia is mainly responsible for reduced muscle insulin sensitivity in T1D by examining people without diabetes (euglycemia, normoinsulinemia), with glucokinase maturity–onset diabetes of the young (hyperglycemia, normoinsulinemia), and with overt T1D (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia). Using multiple regression analyses it was found that hyperinsulinemia was a more important predictor for the presence of insulin resistance than hyperglycemia in T1D.

The significance of insulin dose per day and hyperglycemia in coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality was investigated in nonobese T1D individuals followed for 18 years. Lower doses of insulin (50 units/day) predicted cardiovascular morbidity more closely than mortality; conversely, higher levels of HbA1c (8.9%) predicted cardiovascular mortality more closely than morbidity, even after adjustment for possible confounders (BMI, diabetes duration, smoking, lipids, hypertension, renal function). As discussed by the authors, although hyperinsulinemia may be a risk factor for atheromatosis, a reasonable daily amount of insulin used for treatment and properly adjusted to diurnal glucose variability can attenuate the severity and progression of vascular damage. Notably, in people with T1D and detectable C-peptide responses, insulin required for treatment is significantly less facilitating the improvement of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.

In summary, these reports underscore the significant contribution of iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia to induce insulin resistance in T1D leading to increased cardiovascular risk. A primary treatment target is therefore the increase in insulin sensitivity to keep insulin requirements and inappropriate hyperinsulinemia as low as possible.

### Diabetes accelerates smooth muscle accumulation in lesions of atherosclerosis: lack of direct growth-promoting effects of high glucose levels [^113CwB7c]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

In combination with other factors, hyperglycemia may cause the accelerated progression of atherosclerosis in people with diabetes. Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation contribute to formation of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on SMC proliferation and accumulation in vivo and in isolated arteries and SMCs by taking advantage of a new porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, in which diabetic animals are hyperglycemic without receiving exogenous insulin. We show that diabetic animals fed a cholesterol-rich diet, like humans, develop severe lesions of atherosclerosis characterized by SMC accumulation and proliferation, whereas lesions in nondiabetic animals contain fewer SMCs after 20 weeks. However, high glucose (25 mmol/l) does not directly stimulate the proliferation of SMCs in isolated arterial tissue from diabetic or nondiabetic animals, or of cultured SMCs from these animals or from humans. Furthermore, the mitogenic actions of platelet-derived growth factor, IGF-I, or serum are not enhanced by high glucose. High glucose increases SMC glucose metabolism through the citric acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway by 240 and 90%, respectively, but < 10% of consumed glucose is metabolized through these pathways. Instead, most of the consumed glucose is converted into lactate and secreted by the SMCs. Thus, diabetes markedly accelerates SMC proliferation and accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. The stimulatory effect of diabetes on SMCs is likely to be mediated by effects secondary to the hyperglycemic state.

### Some paradoxes and unresolved aspects of hepatic de novo lipogenesis [^117JY7UA]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 proposes some possible mechanisms by which this might be accomplished. The appearance and initial metabolism of glucose and/or fructose to sugar phosphates coupled with high insulin levels and circadian cues activate ChREBP and SREBP-1c that in turn switch on the transcription and translation of DNL pathway enzymes. Once DNL is functional, it will utilize any available source of acetyl-CoA, including microbially-generated acetate, for fatty acid synthesis and this activity will persist until nutrient levels are depleted and the pathway is deactivated. This paradigm explains why on the one hand hepatic fatty acids can be efficiently labeled from acetate tracers regardless of prandial state and dietary sugar composition, while on the other hand, very high intakes of glucose and fructose contribute a minority of carbons to the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool. Another mechanism that can account for the delay between sugar catabolism and DNL activation is that the sugars are initially metabolized to hepatic glycogen via direct and indirect pathways and subsequently become available for DNL during the initial stages of glycogenolysis. Such a mechanism is not only consistent with the observed efficient uptake of both dietary glucose and fructose into hepatic glycogen, but also with the prioritization of glycogenic over lipogenic metabolism of dietary sugar in the initial feeding phase. It is also interesting that DNL activity is promoted when carbohydrate flux into glycogen is attenuated from the top down, either through the physical constraints of glycogen accumulation or by defective glycogen synthase function. Finally, feeding/fasting regimes that are out of phase with normal circadian rhythms can also augment DNL activity. In humans undergoing a normal daily meal and sleep cycle, hepatic glycogen levels accumulate stepwise over breakfast, lunch and dinner peaking by bedtime and then falling steadily during sleep to a nadir before breakfast the following day. To the extent that high hepatic glycogen levels direct dietary carbohydrate flow away from glycogenesis and towards DNL, any intake during this early night period — for example a snack taken during a night-shift — is likely to augment DNL to a greater extent compared to an equivalent intake taken at breakfast.

### Chronic peripheral hyperinsulinemia in type 1 diabetic patients after successful combined pancreas-kidney transplantation does not affect ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver [^116mrWtx]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results show that systemic drainage of the transplanted pancreas in type 1 diabetic patients after PKT leads to elevated peripheral insulin concentrations at fasting without affecting intracellular lipid content of liver and soleus muscle. Furthermore, PKT subjects exhibit fasting EGP and whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity similar to those in healthy, nondiabetic, and age- and BMI-matched control subjects.

Previous studies in type 1 diabetic patients on subcutaneous (systemic) insulin replacement found alterations of IMCL and IHCL, which could have resulted from glucose toxicity given the chronic hyperglycemia and/or from peripheral hyperinsulinemia. Systemic venous drainage of PKT allows the investigation of the long-term effects of peripheral insulin delivery on intracellular lipid content; to the best of our knowledge, IHCL and IMCL have never been evaluated in type 1 diabetic patients after PKT. A study in poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients (A1C = 8.6%) found increased IMCL of the soleus muscle, which was directly correlated with A1C values, whereas a study in well-controlled type 1 diabetic patients (A1C = 6.3%) demonstrated unchanged IMCL at fasting and after sustained hyperinsulinemia. In line with that study, our PKT patients presenting with normal A1C values and unaltered insulin sensitivity also showed IMCL similar to that of healthy control subjects, suggesting beneficial effects of long-term glycemic control.

### Insulin human (Myxredlin) [^113vhQrS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including MYXREDLIN is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

MYXREDLIN is a short-acting insulin. The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals, within the same individual, and different doses. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, euglycemic glucose clamp study described below, the average onset of action, defined as start of intravenous glucose infusion during the clamp, was approximately 21 minutes after starting of the intravenous infusion administration. The glucose infusion rate gradually increased to a maximum response of 13.7 mg/kg/min after 5 hours of human insulin infusion.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, euglycemic glucose clamp study, fifty eight healthy male subjects between 19 and 50 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either MYXREDLIN or another human insulin at 1 milliUnit/kg/min for 6 hours (0.36 units/kg total dose). On average, insulin concentrations of about 300 pM were attained approximately from 1.5 hours to 6 hours after starting intravenous infusion of MYXREDLIN, followed by a return to the baseline level 1.5 hours after stopping intravenous infusion.

Metabolism and Elimination

The mean terminal half-life from concentration data after stopping the intravenous infusion was estimated to be 23.4 minutes in healthy volunteers.

Specific Population

The effects of gender, age, obesity, renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of insulin human injection have not been studied.

### The diabetic phenotype is conserved in myotubes established from diabetic subjects: evidence for primary defects in glucose transport and glycogen synthase activity [^114AdehG]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

The most well-described defect in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is reduced insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles. It is unclear whether this defect is primary or acquired secondary to dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia. We determined the glycogen synthase (GS) activity; the content of glucose-6-phosphate, glucose, and glycogen; and the glucose transport in satellite cell cultures established from diabetic and control subjects. Myotubes were precultured in increasing insulin concentrations for 4 days and subsequently stimulated acutely by insulin. The present study shows that the basal glucose uptake as well as insulin-stimulated GS activity is reduced in satellite cell cultures established from patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, increasing insulin concentrations could compensate for the reduced GS activity to a certain extent, whereas chronic supraphysiological insulin concentrations induced insulin resistance in GS and glucose transport activity. Our data suggest that insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes comprises at least two important defects under physiological insulin concentrations: a reduced glucose transport under basal conditions and a reduced GS activity under acute insulin stimulation, implicating a reduced glucose uptake in the fasting state and a diminished insulin-mediated storage of glucose as glycogen after a meal.

### Insulin glulisine (Apidra) [^114NyQZD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin glulisine. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein synthesis.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that APIDRA has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.

In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 20), the glucose-lowering profiles of APIDRA and regular human insulin were assessed at various times in relation to a standard meal at a dose of 0.15 units/kg (see Figure 1).

The maximum blood glucose excursion (ΔGLUmax; baseline subtracted glucose concentration) for APIDRA injected 2 minutes before a meal was 65 mg/dL compared to 64 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 30 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1A), and 84 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1B). The maximum blood glucose excursion for APIDRA injected 15 minutes after the start of a meal was 85 mg/dL compared to 84 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1C).

Figure 1: Serial mean blood glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single dose of APIDRA and regular human insulin. APIDRA given 2 minutes (APIDRA - pre) before the start of a meal compared to regular human insulin given 30 minutes (Regular - 30 min) before start of the meal (see Figure 1A) and compared to regular human insulin (Regular - pre) given 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1B). APIDRA given 15 minutes (APIDRA - post) after start of a meal compared to regular human insulin (Regular - pre) given 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1C). On the x-axis, zero (0) is the start of a 15-minute meal.

In a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study, 16 healthy male subjects received an intravenous infusion of APIDRA or regular human insulin with saline diluent at a rate of 0.8 milliunits/kg/min for two hours. Infusion of the same dose of APIDRA or regular human insulin produced equivalent glucose disposal at steady state.

### Sugar-sweetened beverages with moderate amounts of fructose, but not sucrose, induce fatty acid synthesis in healthy young men: a randomized crossover study [^1133w9hq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The impact of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) on lipid metabolism when consumed in moderate amounts by normal weight subjects is debated.

Objective

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different types of sugars in SSB on fatty acid metabolism (ie, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation) in healthy young men.

Design

Thirty-four normal-weight men were studied in a randomized crossover study. Four isocaloric 3-week interventions with SSB were performed in random order: medium fructose (MF; 40 g/d); high fructose (HF; 80 g/d), high sucrose (HS; 80 g/d), and high glucose (HG; 80g/d). Fasting total plasma fatty acid composition was measured after each intervention. Acylcarnitines were measured in the fasting state and after a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in nine subjects.

Results

The relative abundance of palmitate (16:0) and the molar fatty acid ratio of palmitate to linoleic acid (16:0 to18:2) as markers of fatty acid synthesis were increased after HF [relative abundance of palmitate: 22.97% ± 5.51% (percentage of total fatty acids by weight ± SD)] and MF (26.1% ± 1.7%) compared with HS (19.40% ± 2.91%, P < .001), HG (19.43% ± 3.12%, P < .001), or baseline (19.40% ± 2.79%, P < .001). After HS and HG, the relative abundance of palmitate was equal to baseline. Fasting palmitoylcarnitine was significantly increased after HF and HS (HF and HS vs. HG: P = 0.005), decreasing after inhibition of lipolysis by insulin in the clamp.

Conclusions

When consumed in moderate amounts, fructose but not sucrose or glucose in SSB increases fatty acid synthesis (palmitate), whereas fasting long-chain acylcarnitines are increased after both fructose and sucrose, indicating an impaired β-oxidation flux.

### Insulin resistance is associated with diminished endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in adipose tissue of healthy and diabetic subjects [^115Gavfv]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

We recently showed that insulin increased ER stress in human adipose tissue. The effect of insulin resistance on ER stress is not known. It could be decreased, unchanged, or increased, depending on whether insulin regulates ER stress via the metabolic/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or alternate signaling pathways. To address this question, we examined effects of lipid-induced insulin resistance on insulin stimulation of ER stress. mRNAs of several ER stress markers were determined in fat biopsies obtained before and after 8-h hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamping in 13 normal subjects and in 6 chronically insulin-resistant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In normal subjects, hyperglycemia-hyperinsulinemia increased after/before mRNA ratios of several ER stress markers (determined by ER stress pathway array and by individual RT-PCR). Lipid infusion was associated with inhibition of the PI3K insulin-signaling pathway and with a decrease of hyperinsulinemia-induced ER stress responses. In chronically insulin-resistant patients with T2DM, hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemia did not increase ER stress response marker mRNAs. In summary, insulin resistance, either produced by lipid infusions in normal subjects or chronically present in T2DM patients, was associated with decreased hyperinsulinemia-induced ER stress responses. This suggests, but does not prove, that these two phenomena were causally related.

### Genome-scale study reveals reduced metabolic adaptability in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^111eG9B2]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Our key findings corroborate several of the earlier findings. Specifically, the substrate concentrations as well as fluxes of amino acids, ketone bodies and pyruvate are consistent with earlier studies describing splanchnic fluxes in obesity and various liver diseases. Among them, ketogenesis, proteolysis and peripheral lipolysis were suppressed during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. This could be seen in the decreased arterial concentration levels of precursors of these pathways, such as multiple amino acids (including branched chain amino acids) and FFAs, as well as of markers such as α- and β-hydroxybutyric acids. Notably, α-hydroxybutyric acid has been considered as an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation.

A tracer study of NAFLD patients and controls suggest that NAFLD is associated with increased TCA cycle, GNG and lipolysis in the liver. Our study confirms that higher liver fat is associated with more active TCA cycle metabolism. However, we found in two independent approaches (flux- and gene expression-based analysis) that GNG from lactate is in fact decreased with high liver fat at the expense of increased glyceroneogenesis. Instead, patients with higher liver fat had higher rates of lipolysis and GNG from glycerol. These differences were not due to obesity itself as all patients were morbidly obese. Understandably, we were not able to obtain liver biopsies from lean healthy subjects as such would be unethical. The patients who participated in the catheterization study were all patients who had been referred to the hepatologist for a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. These patients were significantly less obese than the patients in the transcriptomics study. This is a limitation of the present study.

Together, our findings indicate that in NAFLD glycerol is being utilized as a preferential substrate for GNG instead of lactic acid. In support of this hypothesis, 3-glycerolphosphate, an intermediate of lipolysis, as well as multiple FFAs were positively correlated with liver fat in the basal state. Furthermore, GSMM analysis utilizing the metabolite flux data as constraints showed that reactions of glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, two of the key enzymes for glyceroneogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, are strongly associated with liver fat deposition. In support of our observation of the increased activity of glycerol kinase, its protein abundance was found to be significantly increased in animal models with fatty liver. Moreover, a deficiency of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase results in reduced body weight and liver triacylglycerol content and altered glycerolipid fatty acid composition, whereas overexpression of this enzyme results in hepatic steatosis.

### Relationship between insulin sensitivity and gene expression in human skeletal muscle [^111pvB5L]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Human participants and clinical measurements

Results from two separate clinical studies (studies A and B) are reported here.

Study A

To identify genes correlated to insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, we studied 39 non-diabetic men from Malmö, Sweden. Briefly, the Malmö Exercise Intervention cohort consists of 50 sedentary but otherwise healthy male subjects from southern Sweden. They all have European ancestry and 24 of them have a first-degree family member with T2D. Muscle biopsies were collected from 39 of the subjects. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 37.71 ± 4.38 years and 28.47 ± 2.96 kg/m 2, respectively, and the mean 1/the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 0.69 ± 0.25 (Supplementary Table S 1).

Study B

To replicate the findings from study A, we studied an additional 10 healthy young non-diabetic men without any family history of diabetes, from a previously described study. The mean age and BMI were 25.33 ± 0.99 years and 24.57 ± 1.86 kg/m 2, respectively, and the mean 1/HOMA-IR was 1.17 ± 0.36 (Supplementary Table S 2). Here, we included baseline gene expression profile data (i.e. only before bed rest) from part of a larger study on the influence of physical inactivity in healthy and prediabetic individuals.

None of the study participants were directed to avoid extreme physical exercise and alcohol intake for at least 2 days before the studies. The participants were asked to fast for 10–12 h before examination days. Fasting blood samples and anthropometric data were obtained from all participants. All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g) and glucose tolerance was classified in accordance with World Health Organization criteria. Homeostasis model assessment -insulin resistance (1/HOMA-IR = 22.5 / (fasting plasma insulin (μU/ml) x fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l))) was calculated for all participants in both studies and used as a surrogate measure of insulin sensitivity. The muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anesthesia in individuals participating in all studies using a modified Bergström needle.

We excluded data from two participants (one from each studies A and B) with extreme values of insulin sensitivity (more than 1.5 * interquartile range) for further analysis. Both studies were approved by local ethics committees and all participants gave their informed consent for participation.
