## Question

A 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presents to the hospital with a 2-day history of fever and a new widespread vesicular rash involving her trunk, face, and extremities. She is currently undergoing chemotherapy. On examination, she is febrile and has numerous vesicular and pustular lesions at various stages of healing, some of which are hemorrhagic. She denies any recent sick contacts or travel. The initial bacterial cultures from her skin lesions are negative. The dermatology team is consulted and is uncertain whether the rash represents disseminated herpes zoster, another viral exanthem, or a drug reaction.

According to current IDSA guidelines, what laboratory test should be considered to help establish the diagnosis of disseminated varicella zoster virus infection in this patient with unexplained skin lesions?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory test should be considered to help establish the diagnosis of disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection in a 62-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, fever, and a widespread vesicular rash, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and whether the clinical picture fits disseminated VZV. Then, I should verify what the IDSA guidelines specifically recommend for laboratory testing in immunocompromised hosts with unexplained skin lesions. Next, I will compare the diagnostic performance of available modalities, including lesion PCR, blood PCR, serology, and histopathology. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized testing strategy and note any caveats or exceptions that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and pretest probability. In an immunocompromised patient with CLL on chemotherapy, a generalized vesicular rash with fever and hemorrhagic lesions strongly suggests disseminated VZV, which carries a 10–20% risk of dissemination in high-risk immunocompromised hosts and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly, so I should not delay appropriate antivirals while awaiting results [^c323cc83] [^994085e8].

> Wait, let me verify the IDSA recommendation for laboratory testing in this exact context. The 2014 IDSA SSTI guideline explicitly recommends considering peripheral blood PCR for HSV and VZV to help establish the diagnosis of disseminated infection in patients with unexplained skin lesions, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, and this is reiterated in sections addressing febrile neutropenia and viral etiologies in neutropenic SSTIs [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89] [^7700b6b6] [^b2465f4f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality. I should compare diagnostic performance. Lesion PCR is the most sensitive and specific test for active VZV infection and can provide results within 24–48 hours, whereas blood PCR is less sensitive than lesion PCR but can detect viremia in disseminated disease and is particularly useful when lesions are atypical or when sampling lesions is not feasible; serology is not reliable for acute infection in immunocompromised hosts, and histopathology can support the diagnosis but is slower and less definitive than PCR [^92a1fa5d] [^c63c4bb0] [^78d0e4e8].

> I need to ensure I address the differential and avoid premature closure. In immunocompromised patients, HSV, enteroviruses, fungal infections, drug eruptions, and even leukemia cutis can mimic VZV; therefore, while empiric IV acyclovir should be started urgently, concurrent lesion PCR for VZV and HSV is prudent to secure a microbiologic diagnosis and guide ongoing therapy, especially if the course is atypical or response is suboptimal [^bfc83052] [^f5a670db] [^994085e8].

> Let me synthesize the testing strategy. Given the IDSA guidance and the patient's risk profile, I should prioritize obtaining peripheral blood PCR for VZV now to support the diagnosis of disseminated infection, and simultaneously obtain lesion PCR from a fresh vesicle or the base of an unroofed lesion for optimal sensitivity and speciation; if lesions are not accessible or PCR is unavailable, blood PCR alone can still be informative in disseminated disease, albeit with lower sensitivity than lesion testing [^b69dca91] [^92a1fa5d] [^c63c4bb0].

> But wait, what if serology is tempting because it is fast. I should double-check that. Serology has limited utility for acute VZV infection in immunocompromised hosts and is not recommended to establish active infection; thus, I should avoid relying on IgM or acute IgG for diagnosis and instead use PCR-based methods for timely, actionable results [^92a1fa5d] [^c63c4bb0].

> I should confirm specimen handling details to avoid false negatives. For lesion PCR, I need to unroof a vesicle, vigorously swab the base, place the swab in viral transport medium, and send it promptly; I should avoid calcium alginate swabs, wood shafts, or gel-containing transport swabs that can inhibit PCR, and if blood PCR is sent, I should ensure appropriate tubes and timely processing to preserve integrity [^92a1fa5d].

> Next, I should review immediate management implications so I do not delay therapy. In immunocompromised hosts with suspected disseminated VZV, high-dose IV acyclovir is the treatment of choice and should be started empirically while awaiting PCR results, given the risk of visceral dissemination and mortality; oral therapy is inadequate for severe or disseminated disease in this setting [^994085e8].

> Final answer: According to current IDSA guidance, I should obtain peripheral blood PCR for VZV to help establish disseminated infection in this immunocompromised patient with unexplained vesicular lesions, and I should augment this with lesion PCR from a fresh vesicle when feasible for maximal diagnostic yield and to distinguish VZV from HSV or other etiologies [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89] [^7700b6b6] [^92a1fa5d].

---

The most appropriate test to order is **VZV PCR from a lesion swab** (vesicular fluid or unroofed lesion base) [^92a1fa5d] because it is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing active VZV infection, including disseminated disease [^c63c4bb0] [^78d0e4e8]. If lesion PCR is unavailable or inconclusive, **VZV PCR from blood** is a reasonable alternative, especially in immunocompromised patients with suspected dissemination [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89]. Serology is not recommended for acute diagnosis in this setting due to poor sensitivity and specificity in immunocompromised hosts [^92a1fa5d] [^78d0e4e8].

---

## Recommended laboratory test

### VZV PCR from lesion swab

- **Specimen**: Vesicular fluid or unroofed lesion base swabbed vigorously and placed in viral transport medium [^92a1fa5d].
- **Rationale**: PCR is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting VZV DNA, providing results within 24–48 hours [^c63c4bb0] [^78d0e4e8].
- **Guideline support**: IDSA recommends PCR for HSV/VZV in immunocompromised patients with unexplained skin lesions [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89].

---

### Alternative laboratory test

If lesion PCR is unavailable or inconclusive, **VZV PCR from blood** is a reasonable alternative, particularly in immunocompromised patients with suspected dissemination [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89].

---

## Tests not recommended

Serology (IgM/IgG) is **not recommended** for acute diagnosis in immunocompromised patients due to poor sensitivity and specificity [^92a1fa5d] [^78d0e4e8]. Viral culture is also discouraged because of low sensitivity, slow turnaround, and limited availability [^1e4848dd].

---

## Clinical implications of test results

- **Positive PCR**: Confirms active VZV infection, supporting disseminated herpes zoster diagnosis and guiding antiviral therapy [^c63c4bb0].
- **Negative PCR**: Does not exclude VZV infection; repeat testing or alternative diagnostics may be needed if clinical suspicion remains high [^430a7d45].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| VZV PCR from lesion swab | First-line test | High sensitivity/specificity; rapid results [^c63c4bb0] [^78d0e4e8] |
| VZV PCR from blood | Alternative if lesion PCR unavailable | Useful in disseminated disease [^b69dca91] [^f42e1e89] |
| Serology (IgM/IgG) | Not recommended | Poor sensitivity/specificity in immunocompromised hosts [^92a1fa5d] [^78d0e4e8] |
| Viral culture | Not recommended | Low sensitivity; slow turnaround [^1e4848dd] |

---

The most appropriate test is **VZV PCR from a lesion swab**; if unavailable, use **VZV PCR from blood**. Serology and viral culture are not recommended for acute diagnosis in this setting [^92a1fa5d].

Diagnosis—Varicella and herpes zoster are typically distinctive in appearance and usually can be diagnosed clinically, and varicella also can be diagnosed retrospectively by documenting seroconversion (immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibody negative to positive). In immunocompromised persons, a history of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure, a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and VZV serologic testing to assess prior VZV infection may be helpful to distinguish disseminated herpes zoster from varicella. When lesions are atypical or difficult to distinguish from other etiologies (including herpes simplex virus [HSV]), swabs of vesicular fluid from a fresh lesion or tissue biopsies can be submitted for viral culture, direct fluorescent antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction assays; viral culture and direct fluorescent antigen testing are often useful for confirming varicella, polymerase chain reaction assays are useful for confirming varicella and herpes zoster from lesion swabs, and CSF VZV PCR can help confirm the diagnosis of central nervous system involvement.

Varicella‑zoster virus (VZV) in immunosuppressed patients—serostatus and risk of zoster or dissemination: VZV is one of the 2 most frequent herpesviruses to cause cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed patients, and between 65% and 70% of adult patients are seropositive for VZV. Herpes zoster occurs most frequently during the first year following chemotherapy treatment or following receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or a solid organ transplant (SOT). Depending on the intensity of treatment or type of transplant, 25%–45% develop dermatomal zoster, with a 10%–20% risk of developing dissemination without prompt and effective antiviral therapy.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^37e0c6aa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster—diagnosis and laboratory testing—notes that zoster diagnosis might not be possible in the absence of rash and that in its classical manifestation the signs and symptoms are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash has appeared; more frequently, zoster is confused with the rash of herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the accuracy of diagnosis is lower for children and younger adults. Tzanck smears detect multinucleated giant cells but do not distinguish between infections with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV; culture can take several days with false negative results, direct fluorescent antibody staining is rapid and is sensitive, and polymerase chain reaction can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively though not available in all settings, with modifications able to distinguish wild-type VZV from the Oka/Merck vaccine strain. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing chickenpox from disseminated zoster might not be possible by examination or serology, and history of VZV exposure, a dermatomal rash onset, and results of VZV antibody testing at or before rash onset might help guide the diagnosis.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diagnosis in HIV—Varicella and herpes zoster are typically distinctive in appearance and can usually be clinically diagnosed, and varicella can also be diagnosed retrospectively by documenting seroconversion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from antibody negative to positive. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing varicella from disseminated herpes zoster may be aided by a history of VZV exposure, a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and VZV serologic testing to assess prior infection. When lesions are atypical or difficult to distinguish, swabs of vesicular fluid from a fresh lesion or tissue biopsies can be submitted for viral culture, direct fluorescent antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and scabs may be adequate specimens for PCR testing. PCR of lesions is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of VZV infections, and histopathology and PCR of blood or fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or vitreous humor can aid with diagnosis of VZV infections of visceral organs including pneumonitis, encephalitis, and retinitis.

A 79-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presented with fever and a widespread vesicular rash on 19 November 2014. The patient had not been under immunosuppressive regime for 6months. He had received a shingles vaccine on 14th October and developed flu-like symptoms after 2weeks. Intravenous antimicrobial therapy including aciclovir was started. He remained stable with no evidence of systemic involvement. On day 5, he developed respiratory and renal failure that required transfer to intensive care unit. Vesicle fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma were positive for varicella zoster virus by PCR. Slight clinical improvement allowed extubation on day 16. He subsequently deteriorated and died on day 25. Multiorgan failure was considered the immediate cause of death whereas disseminated varicella zoster infection was stated in the medical certificate as the other condition leading to this outcome. Varicella zoster Oka vaccine strain was detected in vesicle fluid, using PCR.

### Atypical presentations of herpesvirus infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^f5a670db]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The characteristic presentation of herpesvirus infections is a vesicular rash. The initial lesions appear as erythematous papules that turn into grouped vesicles and pustules eventuating into crusts. In most cases, the features are so characteristic that a diagnosis can be made by history and physical examination without further diagnostic testing. However, patients who are immunosuppressed (including those with hematologic malignancies) often have atypical presentations of herpesvirus infections. These cases require a high index of suspicion and appropriate diagnostic testing for proper management. In this report, we describe two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed atypical presentations of herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections. Herpetic infections should always be in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous ulcerations with necrosis in patients who are immunocompromised. Because of the atypical appearance of the lesions, the diagnosis may be confused or mistaken for several other conditions.

### Fulminant disseminated varicella zoster virus infection without skin involvement [^5cdf99f5]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) infection is potentially very serious in bone marrow transplant recipients, and may manifest as a disseminated visceral infection. This condition is generally accompanied by a vesicular rash.

Objectives

We review here a case of fulminant fatal disseminated VZV infection, not accompanied by skin involvement, and the laboratory approaches currently available to diagnose this disease.

Study Design

Post mortem tissue samples were subjected to histopathological examination, and tested for herpesviruses by electron microscopy and PCR.

Results

Intranuclear inclusions were noted by histological examination in the lungs, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. Particles with a herpesvirus morphology were visualized in liver tissue. VZV DNA was detected in liver and bone marrow by PCR followed by sequencing of the amplicons. Viremia was documented by retrospective testing of the serum by PCR.

Conclusions

A disseminated VZV infection which proved rapidly fatal was demonstrated in a case without skin manifestations. This rare presentation of VZV infection is potentially underdiagnosed. Testing for VZV viremia by PCR can at the very least suggest the diagnosis although whether plasma-associated viremia is truly pathognomonic of visceral disseminated infection remains to be established.

### Vaccine-related varicella-zoster rash in a hospitalized immunocompetent patient [^14ee15a5]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

An immunocompetent health care worker with no known history of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) disease was exposed to a patient with herpes zoster and was immunized 2 days later. Twenty-seven days after receiving the varicella vaccine, while hospitalized, she developed a disseminated rash. This exposure and subsequent development of symptoms posed infection control challenges. A polymerase chain reaction analysis of her vesicular fluid was positive for vaccine-type VZV, and a blood specimen collected before vaccination demonstrated a positive VZV titer by the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen test. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of an immunocompetent seropositive person developing vaccine-type VZV after receiving the vaccine.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^92a1fa5d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) laboratory diagnosis emphasizes nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from lesion material and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); Evaluation for VZV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies is not recommended as a means to establish recent or acute infection; NAAT or culture is preferred. For dermal lesions, a culture transport swab should be vigorously rubbed on the base of the suspect skin lesion; the vesicle should be unroofed to expose the base, and the swab should then be placed in viral transport media and transported to the testing laboratory. Optimal handling from Table 57 includes Viral transport mediuma, RT, ≤24 h; Clot or SST tube, RT, ≤2 h; and Place in sterile container, RT, ≤24 h. When early serology is negative, negative results in suspected early VZV infection should be followed by testing a new serum specimen in 2–3 weeks. Culture may be slow, as it may take up to 14 days for cytopathic effect to be observed. VZV NAATs can be performed on CSF as an aid to the diagnosis of VZV central nervous system infection; CSF IgM can support meningoencephalitis but, if performed, should be completed alongside the evaluation of anti-VZV levels in serum and NAAT in CSF. A less sensitive method for diagnosis is detection of viral antigens by direct fluorescent antibody stain of lesion scrapings. Collection cautions include M4 or M5 media acceptable; do not use calcium alginate-tipped swab; swab with wood shaft, or transport swab containing gel due to inhibition of polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Genital lesions—pediatric and pregnancy considerations for VZV and mpox are noted as follows: In children presenting with genital lesions, providers should not assume HSV as the only etiology and should consider potential atypical presentations of herpes zoster virus (VZV) or even mpox depending on clinical and family history or exposure. FDA-cleared VZV NAATs are limited, but several reference laboratories offer these tests or LDT NAATs. Pregnant patients with a history of genital herpes should be assessed for active lesions at the time of delivery but screening with molecular assays is not appropriate.

### Molecular diagnosis of visceral herpes zoster [^adc6616c]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Patients with disseminated herpes zoster may present with severe abdominal pain that results from visceral involvement of varicella-zoster-virus infection. In the absence of cutaneous eruptions of herpes zoster, visceral herpes zoster is extremely difficult to diagnose. This diagnostic difficulty has the potential to cause devastating delays in treatment. We report a case series of four patients with visceral herpes zoster in whom large concentrations of DNA from varicella zoster virus were detectable in blood by PCR before signs of infection appeared on the skin, thus enabling early diagnosis and treatment.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) after antiretroviral therapy (ART)—immune reconstitution effects: Initiation of ART appears to be associated with an increased frequency of VZV reactivation, peaking at about 3 months after ART initiation, with observational studies showing the risk of herpes zoster to increase two- to four-fold between 4 and 16 weeks after initiating ART. The clinical presentation and natural history of herpes zoster in the setting of immune reconstitution is similar to that observed in other patients with HIV, and episodes in either setting should be managed in the same manner.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia—targeted diagnostics for suspected infection direct testing by syndrome. Consider obtaining nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens for viral testing and bacterial cultures in patients with respiratory tract infections, and consider obtaining chest imaging (chest radiograph or CT scan) in patients with lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, hypoxia). Consider obtaining abdominal ultrasound or CT scan in patients with significant abdominal pain. If meningitis or meningoencephalitis is suspected, perform an LP for opening pressure, cell count, glucose, protein, and other cultures (eg, bacterial aerobic, bacterial anaerobic, fungal, acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) or viral PCR test (eg, enterovirus, HSV) as clinically indicated, and initiate or modify antimicrobial therapies accordingly, ensuring use of agents that penetrate into the CSF. In patients with diarrhea who have received antibiotics in the previous 2 weeks, consider sending stool for Clostridium difficile. In patients with skin lesions, culture or biopsy lesions suspected of being infected and send for cytologic testing, Gram and fungal staining, and bacterial and fungal cultures; aspiration may be useful for Gram staining and bacterial aerobic culture. Vesicular lesions should be tested (eg, HSV, varicella zoster virus [VZV] PCR), institute proper isolation precautions and begin empiric therapy with acyclovir pending results.

Herpes zoster, caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, affects mainly the adult population, although it can occur in children. This happens when primary infection (varicella) has occurred at a very young age or in immunocompromised patients. Complications are rare in healthy individuals. They include VZV cutaneous dissemination, which affects 2%-10% of immunocompromised patients.We present a previously healthy child, with history of varicella during her first month of life, which presented at age 8 with a severe case of herpes zoster, complicated with cutaneous dissemination. Immunity study was unremarkable. Causes, management and follow-up are discussed.

Summary

The U.S. varicella vaccination program, implemented in 1995, led to a >97% decline in varicella incidence. Clinical diagnosis continues to be the primary means for diagnosing varicella, although the modified signs and symptoms of disease (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) occurring in persons who have received varicella vaccine pose diagnostic challenges. Laboratory confirmation of varicella is increasingly necessary to guide clinical and public health management, understand varicella epidemiology, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness. In June 2023, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists updated its varicella position statement to increase the specificity of confirmed varicella cases by including only cases with positive laboratory results or cases that have an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed varicella case or to a person with herpes zoster.

Anatomy CLL is a disorder of morphologically mature, but immunologically less mature lymphocytes. It is manifested by progressive accumulation of these cells in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic tissues. . Clinical Presentation The clinical course of this disease progresses from an indolent lymphocytosis without other evident disease to one of generalized lymphatic enlargement with concomitant pancytopenia. Complications of pancytopenia, including hemorrhage and infection, represent a major cause of death in these patients. Immunological aberrations, including Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and depressed immunoglobulin levels, may all complicate the management of CLL. . Diagnostic Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose CLL include the following: .

In this disorder, lymphocyte counts in the blood are usually greater than or equal to 5, 000/mm3 with a characteristic immunophenotype. As assays have become more sensitive for detecting monoclonal B-CLL–like cells in peripheral blood, researchers have detected a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in 3% of adults older than 40 years and in 6% of adults older than 60 years. CLL is diagnosed by an absolute increase in lymphocytosis and/or bone marrow infiltration coupled with the characteristic features of morphology and immunophenotype, which confirm the characteristic clonal population. In a database analysis, for up to 77 months before diagnosis, almost all patients with a CLL diagnosis had prediagnostic B-cell clones that were identified in peripheral blood. . About 1% of morphological CLL cases express T-cell markers and have clonal rearrangements of their T-cell receptor genes.

These patients have a higher frequency of skin lesions, more variable lymphocyte shape, and shorter median survival with minimal responses to chemotherapy and B-cell receptor inhibitors. . 15, 17] In two selected series of more than 900 patients monitored prospectively for a median of 5 to 7 years, overt CLL requiring chemotherapy occurred in 7% of patients. A screening study using the Mayo Clinic Biobank identified 1, 712 patients with MBL from 10, 139 screened samples. These patients often have neutropenia and a history of rheumatoid arthritis. The natural history is indolent, often marked by anemia and splenomegaly. This condition appears to fit into the clinical spectrum of Felty syndrome.

A characteristic genetic finding in almost 50% of the patients with T-cell LGL involves pathogenic variants in the STAT3gene. Symptomatic patients with cytopenias typically manifest CD8-positive T cells with alpha/beta surface receptors plus a STAT3variant, CD8-positive T cells with T gamma/delta surface receptors, or a mutated NK/T-cell phenotype. Conversely, asymptomatic patients have wild-type STAT3CD8-positive T cells, CD4-positive T cells, and wild-type NK cells. Therapy includes low doses of oral cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, cyclosporine, and treatment of the bacterial infections acquired during severe neutropenia. . Anemia and thrombocytopenia. These are important adverse prognostic variables, but only if due to extensive marrow involvement by CLL. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura do not confer a worse prognosis. **Age.

Ocular antimicrobial susceptibility testing—because systemic breakpoints are not applicable to ocular isolates, laboratories choosing to perform testing may report the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and range without interpretation, and no interpretation should be provided for bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Many drugs used to treat ocular infection, particularly topical agents, are not included on commercial susceptibility platforms, are not routinely tested in clinical labs, and lack interpretive breakpoints, while antiviral susceptibility testing is limited to specialized reference labs and may be helpful in refractory HSV, VZV, and CMV infections.

### Herpes zoster in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: effect of vaccination and treatment (...) [^097618b4]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract 7527 Background: Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia are susceptible to infections due to impaired humoral immunity as a complication of the disease, treatments received and age at diagnosis. Herpes zoster is a painful, vesicular rash from reactivation of varicella-zoster virus that is common in immunocompromised patients. While HZ vaccines can reduce both varicella-zoster reactivation and post-herpetic neuralgia, vaccination rates are low. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of vaccination on rates of HZ infection in patients with CLL. Methods: We identified patients diagnosed with CLL between September 1999 and October 2015 using Veterans Administration Central Cancer Registry. Pharmacy records were used to identify patients who received treatment for CLL and HZ. HZ events were defined as patients with International Classification of Diseases 9.

thRevision codes for HZ infection or prescriptions of acyclovir or valacyclovir at a dose of 1500 mg/day or higher or famciclovir at a dose of 1000 mg/day or higher without a diagnosis of Herpes simplex or Bell’s palsy, or an ICD-9 code and prescription above. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between vaccination as a time-varying exposure and developing HZ while controlling age at CLL diagnosis, co-morbidity score, and receipt of first and second line chemotherapy. The study was approved by the St. Louis VA Medical Center institutional review board. Results: A cohort of 7155 patients with CLL was identified using VACCR. 2640 patients and 1161 patients received first and second line chemotherapy respectively. Mean age at first chemotherapy was 69. 5 years. We detected 1115 cases of HZ using ICD-9 codes, prescriptions or both. 615 patients received HZ vaccinations.

Patients with HZ were younger, had similar co-morbidities, and were more likely to get treatment for CLL. Using a time-varying analysis, there was a trend for HZ vaccine to decrease the risk of developing HZ. When adjusting for age and co-morbidity, patients with CLL treated with first line chemotherapy had a higher risk of HZ compared to those never receiving therapy. Second line chemotherapy increased risk of HZ beyond first line treatment. Conclusions: HZ is prevalent in patients with CLL and affects younger patients who require chemotherapy. The risk of developing HZ increases in recipients of first and second line chemotherapy. In the time-varying analysis, there was a trend towards decreased infection in patients who received HZ vaccination.

Further studies in a more modern cohort that assess infection risk using a larger vaccinated group with the newer and more effective HZ vaccine are warranted.

Diagnosis of varicella and HZ in children with HIV—VZV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method and can provide an etiologic diagnosis within 24 to 48 hours; PCR can use lesion specimens (vesicular fluid or scabs), blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs; direct immunofluorescence has a 3-hour turnaround time but is significantly less sensitive, detecting <75% of infections; culture shows typical cytopathic effect only after 5 to 7 days; the shell vial method requires at least 48 hours and is less sensitive than PCR; PCR can remain positive on scabs late in illness and is critical for evaluating atypical HZ presentations, whereas serologic tests are of little value for diagnosing active infection in children with or without HIV.

### Disseminated herpes zoster with acute encephalitis in an immunocompetent elderly man [^56977cee]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis typically occurs in immunosuppressed populations such as in patients with HIV/AIDS, transplantation and autoimmune disease. However, it can also occur in healthy hosts. We present the case of an immunocompetent patient who presented with a clinical picture of VZV encephalitis with the sole precipitating factor of advanced age. We want to stress the importance of including VZV in the differential diagnosis for encephalitis in healthy elderly hosts. In patients with a clinical diagnosis of encephalitis, the presence of herpes zoster rash increases the likelihood of VZV encephalitis. However, the absence of a skin rash may not exclude the diagnosis. In general, there is an elevated risk of transient ischaemic attack and stroke associated with the diagnosis of herpes zoster infection. Early treatment is essential to prevent complications, including death.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^994085e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompromised hosts—Herpes zoster dermatomal pain often precedes the eruption by 24–72 hours; in otherwise healthy hosts, lesions continue to erupt for at least 4–6 days with the entire disease duration being approximately 2 weeks, whereas in immunocompromised hosts lesions may continue to develop over a longer period (7–14 days) and heal more slowly. High-dose IV acyclovir remains the treatment of choice for VZV infections in compromised hosts, and oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are beneficial but oral therapy should be reserved for mild cases with transient immune suppression or to complete therapy after a clinical response to IV acyclovir. Recipients of allogeneic blood and bone marrow transplants routinely take acyclovir (800 mg bid) or valacyclovir (500 mg bid) during the first year following transplant for prevention of VZV and HSV reactivation. For HSV, suppression of reactivation or continued treatment until ulcerated lesions have totally healed may decrease the incidence of acyclovir-resistant infections; acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates require a prolonged course of intravenous foscarnet, although continuous infusion of high-doses of acyclovir has been reported to be successful in HSCT patients, and surgery should be avoided unless a documented bacterial or fungal abscess is identified.

### Diagnostic and immunologic testing for varicella in the era of high-impact varicella vaccination: an evolving problem [^430a7d45]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of varicella in unvaccinated persons, with skin vesicles and scabs, has facilitated the use of rapid diagnostic methods for confirming disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are the diagnostic method of choice. The sharp decline in unmodified cases of varicella due to the US varicella vaccination program has led to fewer healthcare providers being familiar with varicella presentation and an increased reliance on laboratory diagnosis to confirm suspected cases. The mild, atypical presentation of the disease in vaccinated persons (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) has made it more challenging for providers to recognize and also to collect samples to detect the virus. Nonetheless, PCR is highly sensitive and specific in confirming modified disease if adequate samples are provided. While a positive PCR result is confirmatory, interpreting a negative result can prove to be more challenging in determining whether suspected varicella is falsely negative or attributable to other causes. Enhanced education of healthcare providers is critical for adequate specimen collection from modified varicella cases. In addition, more sensitive commercial serologic assays are needed in the United States for varicella immunity testing in the vaccine era.

The clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infections can be divided into primary infection with chickenpox and reactivated infection with dermatomal shingles, disseminated herpes zoster, zoster sine herpete and varicella-zoster virus encephalitis, meningitis and vasculopathy. We present a case of zoster sine herpete leading to meningitis with cranial and peripheral nerve palsies. A 17-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with intermittent fever, drowsiness, slowness and subsequent frontal headache and horizontal diplopia. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and PCR amplified varicella-zoster virus DNA. Laboratory and clinical findings were suggestive of meningoencephaloradiculoneuropathy, stemming from varicella-zoster virus and affecting cranial and peripheral nerves. Only 5% of patients with zoster develop cranial and peripheral nerve palsies. Diagnosis is imperative in order to initiate prompt antiviral therapy so as to minimize morbidity and the risk of death.

### Zoster vaccine-associated primary varicella infection in an immunocompetent host [^1ee13680]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old immunocompetent man developed a widespread pruritic and vesicular rash 2weeks after receiving the zoster vaccine (Zostavax). He had fever, bandaemia with normal total white blood cell count and mild transaminitis. PCR testing of serum and skin was positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV), while serum VZV IgG was negative. The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism by PCR and sequencing from the skin swab was consistent with the vaccine strain. The patient received 1week of intravenous acyclovir and was discharged after all lesions had crusted. He continues to do well on follow-up with no significant complications.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^65d75e39]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

• Varicella zoster virus reactivation causes serum antibody boosting.
• Antibody titres at 1, 3 and 6 months following zoster diagnosis reflect baseline varicella zoster virus load.
• Antibody titres could discriminate patients post shingles from healthy blood donors, 1–6 months after shingles. However, to achieve a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity is between 55 and 70%, whilst to achieve 80% specificity, the sensitivity is between 35 and 70%.

### Infectious complications with the use of biologic response modifiers in infants and children [^d255f464]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) with BRMs—immunity documentation is based on history and records rather than routine serology; vaccination is recommended when immunity is uncertain; suspected infections during therapy warrant stopping BRM and starting antivirals pending confirmation. All patients should be screened by history, immunization, and possibly laboratory serologic records to document immunity or age-appropriate varicella vaccination; routine testing for VZV is not recommended, and when there is doubt, vaccination is recommended. If VZV vaccine is needed, it should be given at least 4 weeks before initiation of BRM therapy. During BRM therapy, patients suspected of having VZV or HSV infection should stop taking the BRM; diagnosis should use clinical, serologic, and polymerase chain reaction tests from skin lesions, and acyclovir or valacyclovir should be started pending confirmation; prophylaxis with valacyclovir or acyclovir should be given consideration for patients with recurrent HSV being considered for BRM therapy.

### Varicella zoster virus presenting as lower extremity ulcers and an atypical myeloid infiltrate [^1e238257]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood studies showed relative leukocytosis (white blood cells 10.9 × 10 3 /μL, patient baseline 7 × 10 3 /μL to 8 × 10 3 /μL) with neutrophilia (absolute neutrophils 8300/mm 3). Bone marrow biopsy, flow cytometry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis results were negative. Subsequent skin biopsy of a purpuric papule demonstrated ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes forming an intraepidermal vesicle with adjacent basal vacuolar changes; immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction confirmed VZV and ruled out herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus (Fig 2). Previously observed findings of an atypical myeloid infiltrate were not present. Oral administration of valacyclovir (1 g 3 times daily) resulted in a marked cutaneous improvement after 4 weeks (Fig 1), with resolution of the peripheral neutrophilia; the therapy was continued for a full 6 weeks.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^335689af]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Rubella serologic diagnosis and timing—acute infection can be serologically confirmed by documenting seroconversion to IgM and/or IgG positivity or a 4-fold rise in anti-rubella IgG between acute and convalescent sera; only approximately 50% of patients are IgM positive at rash onset, so acute phase serum should be collected upon presentation and again 14–21 days (minimum of 7 days) later. Due to the rarity in the United States and the thus low pre-test probability of infection, serologic evaluation should only be performed in patients with appropriate exposures risks and a clinical presentation highly suggestive of acute rubella; in patients not meeting these criteria, positive rubella IgM results should be interpreted with caution as they may be falsely positive.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (...) [^3d7e23ce]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

The most common leukemia is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Every year, there are 15 000 new diagnoses and 5000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade. Objective Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL. Evidence Review PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000-2014 were found using the keywords chronic lymphocytic leukemia, upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies, randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, and phase 3 clinical trial.

Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria; treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles. Findings. The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are improved by the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment in all subsets of treated patients. Overall response rates between 75% and 90% and complete responses between 22% and 45% are expected in the current era, with more than 80% of treated patients alive at 3 years.

Overall, 5-year survival has increased to 66% from 60% in the past 10 years. Conclusions and Relevance Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard first-line option approach for CLL, the most common leukemia observed in adults. Treatment is initiated when the disease becomes symptomatic, and survival is high following treatment. Nabhan C, Rosen ST. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Clinical Review.

### Histological spectrum of cutaneous herpes infections [^79478778]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus are double-stranded DNA viruses that commonly infect humans, resulting in cutaneous manifestations. Diagnosis is generally made based on clinical findings; however, when the presentation is atypical, biopsy can aid in making a correct diagnosis. The classic histopathological findings of herpetic infection are well established (acantholysis, ballooning degeneration, intranuclear inclusions, multinucleation, necrosis, and formation of vesicles or ulcers). Herpes infection can also cause histopathological changes in many dermal structures. Furthermore, herpes can masquerade as a variety of hematologic malignancies or benign cutaneous conditions. The histopathological spectrum of herpes infections is reviewed and discussed.

### Presence of varicella zoster virus in zosteriform leukaemia cutis [^2c6197b0]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Leukaemia cutis is a relatively rare manifestation in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, characterized by a diverse morphology of skin lesions. We report two patients who developed zosteriform skin symptoms; however, the histological analysis revealed leukaemia infiltration as the cause of their symptoms. Contrary to previous reports, varicella zoster virus DNA was detectable in the lesions. These findings suggest that varicella zoster virus plays an active role in the development of zosteriform leukaemia cutis.

### A survival case of visceral disseminated varicella zoster virus infection in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus [^7c1a8461]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections including varicella, herpes zoster and visceral disseminated VZV infection are often experienced in immunocompromised patients. Among them, visceral disseminated VZV infection is the most serious complication with a high mortality rate in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for kidney transplant recipients or hematological diseases [,–]. Recently, Habuka et al. and Vassia et al. reported the fatal cases of visceral disseminated VZV infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, earlier diagnosis and medical intervention for this serious complication are required.

Herein, we report a case of visceral disseminated VZV infection, which developed 2 months after starting immunosuppressive therapy consisting of prednisolone (PSL) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for SLE. The patient’s condition rapidly became serious, but resolved by prompt diagnosis and treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diagnosis in children with HIV—test performance and specimen options are summarized. VZV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing a VZV infection and can provide an etiologic diagnosis within 24 to 48 hours; in addition to lesion specimens (vesicular fluid or scabs), PCR can be applied to blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs. Direct immunofluorescence for VZV antigen has only a 3-hour turnaround time but is significantly less sensitive, detecting <75% of infections, while culture shows typical cytopathic effect only after 5 to 7 days and the shell vial method requires at least 48 hours and is less sensitive than PCR. PCR results are positive if scabs are used late in illness, PCR is critical for evaluating atypical presentations of HZ, and serologic tests are of little value in diagnosing active VZV infection in children either with or without HIV.
