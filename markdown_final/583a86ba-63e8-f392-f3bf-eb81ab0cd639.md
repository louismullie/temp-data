## Question

What is the formal definition of a type two myocardial infarction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the formal definition of type 2 myocardial infarction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source and exact wording from the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria, including troponin dynamics and ischemic evidence. Next, I will examine the core pathophysiology and how it differs from type 1 MI. After that, I should review common precipitating mechanisms and the distinction from myocardial injury. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, controversies, and synthesize a concise, precise definition with citations.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source. The formal definition of type 2 myocardial infarction is codified in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (2018), which is the most current international consensus document endorsed by major cardiology societies, and I should anchor to that text to avoid drift from earlier versions or secondary interpretations [^c154b49e] [^b21745cb].

> I need to check the diagnostic criteria precisely. Type 2 MI requires a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, plus clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia manifested by at least one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, development of pathological Q waves, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology; importantly, there must be no evidence of acute coronary atherothrombosis, which distinguishes this from type 1 MI [^b21745cb] [^fa729904].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the exact phrasing. The core pathophysiology is myocardial ischemia due to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, occurring in the absence of acute coronary atherothrombosis; this is the canonical distinction from type 1 MI, which is driven by plaque rupture or erosion with thrombosis, and it is explicitly stated in the Fourth Universal Definition and contemporary reviews [^c154b49e] [^3ac43cf1].

> Next, I should review common precipitating mechanisms to make the definition clinically concrete. Examples include sustained tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy, severe bradyarrhythmias, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, severe anemia, hypotension or shock, coronary spasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, and coronary artery dissection; these can act via reduced supply, increased demand, or non-atherothrombotic coronary mechanisms, and the ischemic threshold varies with the magnitude of the stressor and underlying cardiac disease burden [^93e22231] [^a15e8c97].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction from myocardial injury, because misclassification is common. Myocardial injury is defined by elevated troponin with a dynamic pattern but without clinical evidence of ischemia; type 2 MI, by contrast, requires evidence of ischemia and a supply–demand mechanism, so troponin elevation alone is insufficient for a type 2 MI diagnosis and should be labeled as myocardial injury instead [^8ed0da2d] [^6b456d8c].

> I should double-check the clinical implications and controversies so the definition is framed in practice. Type 2 MI is common, especially in older adults and those with comorbidities, and is associated with high mortality largely due to noncardiovascular causes, yet cardiovascular event rates remain substantial; management focuses on correcting the precipitating imbalance and risk stratifying for underlying coronary disease, with no established benefit for routine antithrombotic therapy or revascularization in the absence of atherothrombosis, which underscores the need for individualized care and better evidence [^5eeda178] [^48a3f1d5] [^7431c6e8].

> Let me reconsider whether any earlier definitions contradict this. Earlier universal definitions introduced the concept of type 2 MI, but the Fourth Universal Definition refined and clarified the criteria and mechanisms; thus, the most authoritative and current statement remains the 2018 document, and I should prioritize that over prior iterations when stating the formal definition [^c154b49e] [^b21745cb].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis is precise. Formal definition: Type 2 myocardial infarction is myocardial infarction due to myocardial ischemia from a supply–demand imbalance, without acute coronary atherothrombosis, diagnosed by a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit plus clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia by symptoms, new ischemic ECG changes, pathological Q waves, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality consistent with an ischemic pattern; the ischemia results from mechanisms such as tachyarrhythmia, severe hypertension, bradyarrhythmia, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, severe anemia, hypotension or shock, coronary spasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, or coronary artery dissection, and the diagnosis should be distinguished from myocardial injury, which lacks ischemic features [^b21745cb] [^fa729904] [^93e22231] [^8ed0da2d].

---

Type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) is defined by the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction as **myocardial ischemia from a supply–demand imbalance** [^c154b49e] without acute coronary atherothrombosis, with a **rise/fall in cardiac troponin** [^b21745cb] and at least one ischemic feature (symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging evidence) [^fa729904]. It is a **clinical diagnosis** [^8a72f81a] that requires identifying and treating the precipitating cause (e.g. tachyarrhythmia, hypotension, anemia, hypoxia) [^7431c6e8] and is distinct from type 1 MI (plaque rupture with thrombosis) [^3ac43cf1] and from myocardial injury without ischemia [^8ed0da2d]. T2MI is common in older, comorbid patients [^ec882f74] and carries high short- and long-term mortality [^5eeda178], with management focused on correcting the underlying imbalance and risk stratification for coronary disease [^7431c6e8].

---

## Pathophysiology

T2MI arises from a **supply–demand mismatch** [^c154b49e] — reduced oxygen supply or increased myocardial demand — without acute coronary plaque rupture or thrombosis [^3ac43cf1]. Common mechanisms include:

- **Reduced supply**: hypotension/shock, severe anemia, hypoxemia, coronary spasm, microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, or dissection [^93e22231].
- **Increased demand**: tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, sepsis, thyrotoxicosis, or cocaine use [^a15e8c97].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The Fourth Universal Definition requires the following for T2MI:

| **Criterion** | **Requirement** |
|-|-|
| Cardiac troponin | Rise and/or fall with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit [^b21745cb] |
| Clinical evidence of ischemia | At least one of the following: <br/> - Symptoms of myocardial ischemia <br/> - New ischemic ECG changes <br/> - Development of pathological Q waves <br/> - Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality consistent with an ischemic etiology [^fa729904] |
| Absence of acute coronary atherothrombosis | No evidence of plaque rupture or thrombosis on angiography or autopsy [^a15e8c97] |

---

## Clinical presentation

T2MI typically presents in older adults with comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, renal dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension) [^ec882f74] and often during acute illness or physiologic stress (e.g. sepsis, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, surgery) [^a15e8c97]. Symptoms may be atypical or masked by the underlying condition, and ECG changes are often nonspecific [^fae759ff].

---

## Epidemiology

T2MI accounts for 2–20% of MIs depending on the population and diagnostic criteria [^ec882f74]; it is especially common in hospitalized patients and increases with age and comorbidity burden [^b2753eb3]. High-sensitivity troponin assays have increased detection, particularly in older adults and women [^b2753eb3].

---

## Prognosis

T2MI has high short- and long-term mortality, often exceeding that of type 1 MI, largely due to noncardiovascular causes (e.g. sepsis, respiratory failure) [^5eeda178]. Cardiovascular event rates remain substantial, with recurrent T2MI and heart failure admissions common [^00bae9a3].

---

## Management

Management centers on **correcting the supply–demand imbalance** [^7431c6e8]:

- **Treat precipitating factors**: control arrhythmias, correct hypotension, transfuse anemia, provide oxygen, manage sepsis, etc [^7431c6e8].
- **Risk stratification**: assess for underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) using clinical judgment, ECG, echocardiography, or coronary CT angiography [^7431c6e8].
- **Secondary prevention**: if CAD is present, consider aspirin, statins, and risk-factor modification; routine anticoagulation or revascularization is not indicated unless there is concurrent type 1 MI or persistent ischemia [^7431c6e8].

---

## Challenges and controversies

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Differentiating T2MI from type 1 MI or myocardial injury can be difficult, especially in critically ill patients [^8189bc07].
- **Lack of standardized criteria**: Variability in definitions and adjudication leads to inconsistent diagnosis and management [^b3c5f181].
- **Limited evidence**: No randomized trials have defined optimal management, and prognosis remains poor despite increased recognition [^28499ad4].

---

Type 2 myocardial infarction is a **supply–demand mismatch ischemia** [^c154b49e] without atherothrombosis, diagnosed by troponin dynamics plus ischemic evidence, and managed by treating the precipitant and risk-stratifying for CAD; it is common in older, comorbid patients and carries high mortality, highlighting the need for better diagnostic clarity and evidence-based therapies [^5eeda178].

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: the chimaera of cardiology? [^34279a18]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The term type 2 myocardial infarction first appeared as part of the universal definition of myocardial infarction. It was introduced to cover a group of patients who had elevation of cardiac troponin but did not meet the traditional criteria for acute myocardial infarction although they were considered to have an underlying ischaemic aetiology for the myocardial damage observed. Since first inception, the term type 2 myocardial infarction has always been vague. Although attempts have been made to produce a systematic definition of what constitutes a type 2 myocardial infarction, it has been more often characterised by what it is not rather than what it is. Clinical studies that have used type 2 myocardial infarction as a diagnostic criterion have produced disparate incidence figures. The range of associated clinical conditions differs from study to study. Additionally, there are no agreed or evidence-based treatment strategies for type 2 myocardial infarction. The authors believe that the term type 2 myocardial infarction is confusing and not evidence-based. They consider that there is good reason to stop using this term and consider instead the concept of secondary myocardial injury that relates to the underlying pathophysiology of the primary clinical condition.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^3ac43cf1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends a classification based on aetiology, in recognition that the underlying pathophysiology of myocardial infarction influences the approach to investigation and treatment. Type 1 myocardial infarction occurs due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis, whereas type 2 myocardial infarction occurs due to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or unmet need in myocardial oxygen demand, without atherothrombosis, usually in the context of another acute illness. In this state-of-the-art review, the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are considered, with general advice for clinical practice and a consideration of future research directions.

Although some may view differences between the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction and our proposed revision as little more than administrative details, we would argue that alignment of diagnosis with clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and diagnostic approach is an essential step to address current knowledge gaps. Moreover, accurate diagnosis has direct implications for quality reporting, because evidence-based standards exist only for MI attributable to atherothrombosis. Clinicians should be held accountable only for adhering to process and performance measures for those patients in whom the measures apply. Finally, and arguably most importantly, as we enter the precision medicine era, it is imperative that our diagnoses be as precise as possible.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^169d0a79]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The global task force is reviewing the universal definition of myocardial infarction and recognises the need to provide clearer diagnostic criteria and guidance. Based on the current guidelines, differentiating between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute myocardial injury is challenging as there remains overlap between these two clinical entities, and classification is therefore inconsistent in clinical practice. Similarly, in the absence of an accepted definition, it is difficult to perform standardised evaluations across different healthcare settings, or to conduct randomised trials to determine the effectiveness of investigative strategies or preventative treatments for these patients.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^4451631e]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The definition of acute myocardial infarction has evolved to accommodate increasingly sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis and imaging methods that allow greater understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of acute coronary syndrome. As such, the universal definition of myocardial infarction proposes that we classify patients with myocardial infarction based on aetiology. While this classification has been used in clinical trials to refine primary and secondary endpoints, it has not been widely adopted in clinical practice, and the frequency and implications of subtypes of acute myocardial infarction are uncertain.

We now recognise a spectrum of acute and chronic myocardial injury due to a variety of cardiac and non-cardiac causes in clinical practice. The most contentious diagnosis is that of type 2 myocardial infarction, which is defined as myocardial necrosis with evidence of ischaemia due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in the context of another acute illness. Differentiating between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and those patients with myocardial necrosis in the absence of ischaemia, in whom the recommended classification is myocardial injury, is challenging, as there is considerable overlap between these two clinical entities. Outcomes for both groups of patients are poor, and investigation and management are inconsistent in practice. It is likely that this is at least in part due to variability in interpretation of the guidelines.

Here, we summarise the available literature on the prevalence and outcomes of subtypes of myocardial injury and infarction, and aim to provide practical guidance for the clinician to aid the assessment and investigation of patients with undifferentiated myocardial injury.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction due to supply-demand mismatch [^be6057c7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The best-accepted definition of myocardial infarction (MI) is provided by statements from the Universal Definition of MI Global Task force. This article, now in its third iteration, defines MI as myocardial cell death due to prolonged myocardial ischemia. It further delineates an increasingly incident subclassification of MI known as type 2 MI (T2MI). T2MI identifies instances of myocardial necrosis in which an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand occurs for reasons other than atherosclerotic plaque disruption. While associated with considerable risk (comparable to that of type 1 MI, which has well-defined management strategies), the spectrum of potential etiologies for T2MI makes development of precise diagnostic criteria and therapeutic implications of the diagnosis challenging.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of type 2 myocardial infarction: review and commentary [^3a57951d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recently published updated guidelines for the clinical and research diagnosis of myocardial infarction under a variety of circumstances and in a variety of categories. A type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) is usually the result of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with thrombotic coronary arterial obstruction secondary to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or dissection, causing coronary arterial obstruction with resultant myocardial ischemia and necrosis. Patients with a type 2 MI do not have atherosclerotic plaque rupture. In this latter group of patients, myocardial necrosis occurs because of an increase in myocardial oxygen demand or a decrease in myocardial blood flow. Type 2 MI has been the subject of considerable clinical discussion and confusion. This review by knowledgeable members of the Task Force seeks to help clinicians resolve the confusion surrounding type 2 MI.

### Assessment and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury [^9ead8af7]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is defined pathologically as myocardial cell death attributable to prolonged myocardial ischemia (inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium). Each year, > 8 million Americans present to the hospital with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute MI. Approximately 700 000 are ultimately diagnosed with MI. Although coronary thrombus overlying a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque remains the hallmark and primary therapeutic target for MI, multiple other mechanisms are now known to contribute to MI and nonischemic causes of myocardial injury (Table 1, Figure 1); however, optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with myocardial injury attributable to these nonthrombotic mechanisms have yet to be defined.

Table 1.
Abbreviated Classification of Myocardial Injury (Definitions Derived From the Fourth Universal Definition of Acute Myocardial Infarction)

Figure 1.
Myocardial injury taxonomy.

Over the past decade, cardiac troponin (cTn) assays have become increasingly sensitive, identifying a rising number of patients with previously unrecognized myocardial injury. Although cTn is highly specific for myocardial injury, it does not differentiate between the etiologically diverse types of MI or non-MI causes of myocardial injury, which may necessitate different treatment strategies. The Fourth Universal Definition of MI (UDMI) recognizes 5 types of MI and acute and chronic nonischemic myocardial injury as distinct clinical entities (Table 1, Figure 1). However, the optimal approach to classify patients with acute myocardial injury into these etiological categories remains uncertain.

Clinically actionable diagnosis of acute MI subtypes and nonischemic myocardial injury is essential to foster optimal treatment and outcomes for these patients. Herein, we review evidence regarding the prevalence and outcome of patients classified according to the UDMI, and propose a practical approach to the assessment and management of patients presenting with myocardial injury, with a focus on type 2 MI and nonischemic myocardial injury.

### Supply / demand type 2 myocardial infarction: should we be paying more attention? [^dbd5fb48]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Supply/demand (type 2) myocardial infarction is a commonly encountered clinical challenge. It is anticipated that it will be detected more frequently once high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are approved for clinical use in the United States. We provide a perspective that is based on available data regarding the definition, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, management, and controversies regarding type 2 myocardial infarction. Understanding these basic concepts will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of these patients as well as ongoing research efforts.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^41b311ef]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

It is important to note that patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury receive fewer prescriptions for preventative therapies compared with those with type 1 myocardial infarction.– To date, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated secondary prevention in this population, and there are no formal recommendations for risk assessment or treatment. Given the current heterogeneity in application of the universal definition of myocardial infarction, the feasibility of delivering such a study with comparable observations across multiple healthcare settings is uncertain. Primary prevention guidelines recommend statin therapy where the predicted 10-year risk of adverse cardiovascular events is > 10%. In our study, for patients who survive their initial presentation with type 2 myocardial infarction and are not already known to have coronary artery disease, the rate of MACEs is > 10% at 1 year. Although this outcome may be partially attributable to age and the presence of comorbidities, a significant proportion may have unrecognized coronary artery disease and may benefit from further investigation or preventative therapies.

We believe that clinicians should adopt a pragmatic approach and risk stratify individual patients on the basis of their likelihood of coronary artery disease. There are no risk assessment tools validated for use in this setting, therefore clinicians must review the presenting symptoms, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, and any available imaging findings and apply clinical judgment. Where the probability of coronary disease is high, it may be reasonable to commence secondary prevention with aspirin and a statin in the absence of contraindications. If patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are found to have obstructive coronary artery disease, revascularization could plausibly reduce the risk of future cardiac events, but this strategy has not been evaluated. Where the probability of coronary disease is intermediate or low, further investigation (invasive or CT coronary angiography) should be considered to identify patients with underlying coronary artery disease, where the benefits of secondary prevention are well recognized. The optimal timing for investigation in this group of patients is also uncertain. Where the probability of type 1 myocardial infarction is high, invasive assessment should be considered on an urgent basis in line with standard practice. In those patients where myocardial injury or infarction is secondary to oxygen supply–demand imbalance, further assessment may need to be deferred until patients have recovered from their primary illness. Furthermore, a recognition that these patients are at increased risk of noncardiovascular events may lead to an improvement in outcomes, through better monitoring or intensification of treatment of the primary presenting condition.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^c48c7c83]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Type 2 MI encompasses a variety of underlying pathophysiology. The adoption of this classification in practice has been hampered by this heterogeneity, a lack of objective diagnostic criteria, and evidence from clinical trials to support further investigation and treatment. Whilst this diagnosis is predominantly based on clinical assessment, in some patients this is challenging, and invasive imaging is required. Patients with type 2 MI have poor outcomes, and many have important underlying cardiac disease. Whether further investigation and secondary prevention will benefit all patients with type 2 MI requires investigation in randomized clinical trials.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — updated concepts include type 1 myocardial infarction with emphasis on the causal relationship of plaque disruption with coronary atherothrombosis, type 2 myocardial infarction settings with oxygen demand and supply imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis, type 2 myocardial infarction relevance of presence or absence of coronary artery disease to prognosis and therapy, differentiation of myocardial injury from type 2 myocardial infarction, type 3 myocardial infarction as a useful category to differentiate from sudden cardiac death, types 4–5 myocardial infarction emphasizing distinction between procedure-related myocardial injury and procedure-related myocardial infarction, and cardiac troponin analytical issues for cardiac troponins.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^6ffe2bcc]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Myocardial injury is common in patients without acute coronary syndrome, and international guidelines recommend patients with myocardial infarction are classified by aetiology. The universal definition differentiates patients with myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) from those due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) secondary to other acute illnesses. Patients with myocardial necrosis, but no symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, are classified as acute or chronic myocardial injury. This classification has not been widely adopted in practice, because the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction encompass a wide range of presentations, and the implications of the diagnosis are uncertain. However, both myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction are common, occurring in more than one-third of all hospitalised patients. These patients have poor short-term and long-term outcomes with two-thirds dead in 5years. The classification of patients with myocardial infarction continues to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to recognise the importance of identifying coronary artery disease in type 2 myocardial infarction. Clinicians should consider whether coronary artery disease has contributed to myocardial injury, as selected patients are likely to benefit from further investigation and in these patients targeted secondary prevention has the potential to improve outcomes.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: JACC review topic of the week [^58b5a838]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) can occur from increased myocardial oxygen demand and/or reduced supply in the absence of acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption; a condition called type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI). As with any MI subtype, there must be clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia to make the diagnosis. This condition is increasingly diagnosed due to the increasing sensitivity of cardiac troponin assays and is associated with adverse short-term and long-term prognoses. Limited data exist defining optimal management strategies because T2MI is a heterogeneous entity with varying etiologies and triggers. Thus, these patients require individualized care. A major barrier is the absence of a uniform definition that can be operationalized with high reproducibility. This document provides a synthesis of the data about T2MI to assist clinicians' understanding of its pathobiology, when to deploy the diagnosis, and its associated treatments. It also clarifies prognosis, identifies gaps in knowledge, and provides recommendations for moving forward.

### A proposal for modest revision of the definition of type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction [^4fc88bdc]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI)classifies myocardial infarction (MI) into 5 subtypes, of which type 1 and type 2 MI are the most common and relevant to practicing clinicians. Type 1 MI is defined as MI caused by acute atherothrombotic mechanisms, with type 2 MI defined as MI resulting from myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch without acute atherothrombosis. The UDMI recognizes multiple potential causes of type 2 MI, including demand-side abnormalities such as tachyarrhythmia or severe hypertension, and supply-side issues such as severe anemia, hypoxemia, or hypotension. Type 2 MI may occur with or without obstructive coronary disease, with the threshold for type 2 MI lower in patients with fixed obstructive coronary artery disease.

Type 2 MI is common and is associated with substantial risk for cardiac (and noncardiac) death and major adverse cardiac events. Research to date has been limited largely to observational studies that have used varying definitions and adjudication criteria for type 2 MI, focusing on prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis, with almost no data on treatment. Recently, an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code was introduced for type 2 MI, and it is hoped that this will facilitate research using administrative data. However, we believe that the current definition for type 2 MI is too phenotypically heterogeneous to permit adequate study or reliable coding by hospital administrators.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^6b456d8c]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of myocardial injury and infarction

The Fourth Universal Definition defines an MI as an acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia defined as either symptoms, new changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) including pathological Q-waves, or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology. Cardiac troponin elevation alone is not specific for MI, irrespective of the absolute or relative change in concentration on serial measurement or the maximal concentration. Type 1 MI occurs due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion with intraluminal thrombosis, and type 2 MI occurs without atherothrombosis, where there is evidence of a reduction in myocardial oxygen supply or an unmet increase in myocardial oxygen demand. When an acute rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin is detected without evidence of ischaemia, the term acute non-ischaemic myocardial injury is applied.

### Identification of clinical phenotypes in type 2 myocardial infarction: insights into characteristics, prognosis, and management strategies [^fae759ff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) constitutes a significant portion of acute coronary syndromes, accounting for up to three‐quarters of all myocardial infarctions in the United States. As outlined in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, T2MI results from an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand, occurring in the absence of acute coronary plaque rupture or thrombosis. Although the pathophysiological framework of T2MI is well established, its diagnosis and management remain complex. While distinguishing T2MI from type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) is generally feasible when standard definitions are applied, it may still be challenging in the presence of atypical symptoms and absence of ischemic ECG changes. Furthermore, most research and clinical guidelines have focused on T1MI, often neglecting T2MI. As a result, clinical cardiologists frequently struggle with its management due to limited information on therapy and prognosis. Simply applying T1MI management strategies to T2MI is inadequate because of its distinct pathogenetic mechanisms and the lack of supporting evidence.

Importantly, T2MI is not a benign condition, as it is associated with poor outcomes. These outcomes are often comparable with, or worse than, those of T1MI, but they vary widely, making disease progression difficult to predict.,

Historically, research has primarily focused on the differences between T1MI and T2MI, with limited attention given to the clinical heterogeneity within T2MI itself. Recently, some researchers have proposed the use of clinical phenotypes to better understand the variability of T2MI.

Clinical experience suggests that patients with T2MI often exhibit distinct phenotypic patterns, which may vary according to age, cardiovascular risk factors, precipitating factors, and comorbidities. However, this remains an unverified hypothesis.

The aim of this study is to provide clinical evidence of phenotypic differentiation in a large, real‐world cohort of patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction with T2MI, identify key differences between these clinical phenotypes, and assess whether these phenotypes are associated with varying prognoses and distinct prognostic factors.

### Differentiating type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction… [^ddfb7cd4]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Most patients presenting with spontaneous myocardial infarction tend to have type 1 MI, characterized by coronary plaque rupture or erosion and superimposed thrombosis. But a substantial proportion have type 2 MI, characterized by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, precipitated by an extracardiac stressor, such as hypertension, tachycardia, or hypotension. Differentiating between type 1 and type 2 MI is clinically important because the therapeutic focus differs. For patients with type 1 MI, the focus is on aggressive antithrombotic therapy and consideration of urgent coronary angiography and revascularization. For patients with type 2 MI, the focus is on treating the extracardiac stressor precipitating the myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance. Sabatine MS.

Classification of myocardial injury and infarction

The introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays and lower diagnostic thresholds led to a major revision of the guidelines introducing a classification by aetiology to acknowledge that myocardial injury occurs in a wide range of clinical presentations (figure 1). The third universal definition of myocardial infarction provided an international consensus on the classification of myocardial injury and infarction. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia. These criteria require detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarker levels (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with at least one of the following: (1) symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, (2) new or presumed new significant ST-segment T-wave changes or new left bundle branch block, (3) development of pathological Q-waves on the electrocardiogram, (4) imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality or (5) identification of intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.

Figure 1
Classification proposed by the third universal definition of myocardial infarction.

The classification distinguishes between type 1 myocardial infarction due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque and type 2 myocardial infarction due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in the context of another acute illness. Myocardial infarctions presenting as sudden death (type 3), or after percutaneous coronary intervention (type 4) and coronary artery bypass grafting (type 5) are also defined. Acute myocardial injury is classified where troponin concentrations are elevated with evidence of dynamic change in the absence of overt myocardial ischaemia, whereas in chronic myocardial injury troponin concentrations remain unchanged on serial testing. This is an important distinction, as the underlying pathological mechanisms in acute and chronic myocardial injury are likely to differ.

This classification is contentious and was based on expert consensus rather than evidence from prospective clinical trials. While it has been adopted in research studies, implementation in clinical practice has been less consistent. The most contentious diagnosis is that of type 2 myocardial infarction; a concept based on clinical hypothesis and observation without prospective mechanistic evaluation. Patients classified with type 2 myocardial infarction are heterogeneous and have myocardial ischaemia secondary to a variety of acute medical or surgical conditions. Based on the current criteria, a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction could be applied to patients without coronary artery disease. At present, there is no guidance or consensus on the optimal cardiac investigation, management or treatment strategy for patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^8ed0da2d]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury — clinical distinction emphasizes that Type 2 MI and myocardial injury are frequently encountered in clinical practice and both are related to a poor outcome, and that acute MI requires a rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values. Acute myocardial injury may also manifest such a pattern but if the injury is related to structural heart disease, the cTn values may be stable and unchanging; Type 2 MI and nonischemic myocardial injury may coexist, and abnormal cTn values in the setting of acute and/or chronic heart failure are often better categorized as a myocardial injury condition.

### Assessment and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury [^206796e8]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Although coronary thrombus overlying a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque has long been considered the hallmark and the primary therapeutic target for acute myocardial infarction (MI), multiple other mechanisms are now known to cause or contribute to MI. It is further recognized that an MI is just one of many types of acute myocardial injury. The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction provides a taxonomy for acute myocardial injury, including 5 subtypes of MI and nonischemic myocardial injury. The diagnosis of MI is reserved for patients with myocardial ischemia as the cause of myocardial injury, whether attributable to acute atherothrombosis (type 1 MI) or supply/demand mismatch without acute atherothrombosis (type 2 MI). Myocardial injury in the absence of ischemia is categorized as acute or chronic nonischemic myocardial injury. However, optimal evaluation and treatment strategies for these etiologically distinct diagnoses have yet to be defined. Herein, we review the epidemiology, risk factor associations, and diagnostic tools that may assist in differentiating between nonischemic myocardial injury, type 1 MI, and type 2 MI. We identify limitations, review new research, and propose a framework for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients who have suspected MI or other causes of myocardial injury.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) — type 2 myocardial infarction mechanisms and clinical context: Type 2 myocardial infarction centers on "Oxygen supply and demand imbalance", occurring in contexts "Secondary to another illness or process" and as the "Main reason leading to clinical presentation (e.g., chest pain)". Mechanistic examples include "Fixed coronary atherosclerosis, Coronary spasm, Coronary microvascular dysfunction, Coronary embolism, Coronary artery dissection ± intramural hematoma, Sustained tachyarrhythmia, Severe hypertension ± Left ventricular hypertrophy, Severe bradyarrhythmia, Respiratory failure, Severe anemia, Hypotension/Shock", and figure depictions list "Atherosclerosis and oxygen supply/demand imbalance", "Vasospasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction", "Non-atherosclerotic coronary dissection", and "Oxygen supply/demand imbalance alone". The figure notes that "Ischemic thresholds vary substantially in relation to the magnitude of the stressor and the extent of underlying cardiac disease".

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^42e1bab3]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction were updated to accommodate the introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays and in recognition of the wide range of conditions associated with myocardial injury. The third universal definition of myocardial infarction recommends a classification that is based on etiology, where type 1 myocardial infarction is because of plaque rupture or erosion with atherothrombotic consequences and type 2 myocardial infarction because of myocardial oxygen supply–demand imbalance in the absence of atherothrombosis. Patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations who do not have overt myocardial ischemia are classified as having myocardial injury. Although these diagnostic categories are considered distinct in guidelines, implementation in clinical practice has been challenging because of similarities between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, with the implications of these diagnoses uncertain.

The Global Task Force is reviewing the classification of myocardial infarction and recognizes the need to provide greater clarity for clinicians in practice. Although patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury have higher crude rates of all-cause death compared with those with type 1 myocardial infarction, – differences do not always persist in adjusted analyses, and few studies report cause of death or risk of future cardiovascular events. If patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are at increased risk of cardiovascular events attributable to atherosclerotic disease, then targeted investigation and preventative therapies have the potential to modify outcomes.

In consecutive patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations measured using a sensitive assay, we previously observed that the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury was as common as type 1 myocardial infarction. Here we report outcomes for these patients and determine the clinical features associated with major adverse cardiovascular events, with the aim of improving risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^b2753eb3]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of a specific cardiac biomarker to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction and the increasing frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury poses challenges to clinicians in practice on a daily basis. As observed in this trial, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are responsible for almost half of all elevations in cardiac troponin concentration, and have been shown to be more frequent than type 1 myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients over the age of 75. Less than half of these patients are referred to cardiology, with the majority managed by general physicians, and a lack of evidence has led to inconsistency in investigation and treatment.

The classification of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury is based on expert consensus, and to date no prospective clinical trials have evaluated the utility of this classification. These conditions arise because of a wide range of pathologies including coronary or structural heart disease, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and many noncardiac conditions. The latest guidance, requiring evidence of myocardial ischemia and oxygen supply-demand imbalance, has reduced the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction. Our observations add to previous studies suggesting that any myocardial injury is prognostically important, irrespective of whether myocardial ischemia was present, but strategies to guide further investigation and treatment in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction require prospective evaluation.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^7431c6e8]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction — acute management and evaluation are described as follows: It appears advisable in the acute setting to treat the underlying ischemic imbalance of oxygen supply and demand, and treatment may include volume adjustment, blood pressure management, administration of blood products, heart-rate control, and respiratory support. Depending on the clinical situation, coronary evaluations may be indicated to assess the likelihood of CAD; if it is present, the MI Guidelines may be applied in accordance with the ECG findings of STEMI or NSTEMI, whereas if CAD is absent, the benefits of cardiovascular risk-reduction strategies with type 2 MI remain uncertain.

### Myocardial infarction: expert consensus group provides… [^0f423c28]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
- The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia.
- Type 1 MI is a result of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis, whereas type 2 MI is caused by ischemia from an imbalance of oxygen supply and myocardial demand. From the AFP Editors. An expert consensus group of the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation has provided an updated universal definition of myocardial infarction.

The goals of this new definition were to introduce new concepts, such as distinguishing MI from myocardial injury, as well as to update other concepts, such as emphasizing the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement. The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia; fluctuation in cardiac troponin levels, at least one of which should be greater than the 99th percentile; and at least one of the following: myocardial ischemia symptoms, new ischemic changes or pathologic Q waves identified on ECG, imaging results suggesting loss of myocardium or wall motion abnormalities that are ischemic in nature, or coronary thrombus identified on angiography. There are five MI subtypes, which are differentiated based on clinical findings, prognosis, and treatment strategies. Type 1 MI is typically caused by rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque and thrombosis.

ECG changes can be classified as ST elevation or a non–ST elevation MI to further guide treatment. Type 2 MI does not involve any plaque rupture; instead, ischemia is caused by an imbalance of oxygen supply and myocardial demand. Type 3 MI is diagnosed when symptoms are suggestive of ischemia with ECG changes or ventricular fibrillation, but death occurs before biomarkers are elevated or obtained, or MI is detected on autopsy. Types 4 and 5 are related to coronary intervention procedures and surgery, respectively. Published source: J Am Coll Cardiol. October 30, 2018; 72: 2231–2264.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) — type 3 myocardial infarction criteria and epidemiology: Type 3 MI is defined for "Patients who suffer cardiac death, with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia accompanied by presumed new ischemic ECG changes or ventricular fibrillation, but die before blood samples for biomarkers can be obtained, or before increases in cardiac biomarkers can be identified, or MI is detected by autopsy examination". If autopsy reveals recent MI with thrombus in the infarct-related artery, "the type 3 MI should be reclassified to a type 1 MI". Reported occurrence includes "an annual incidence below 10/100 000 person-years and a frequency of 3% to 4% among all types of MI".

### A new clinical classification of acute myocardial infarction [^b24eab13]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The existence of a universal definition of myocardial infarction-which involves classification into multiple subtypes-has promoted the use of standard diagnostic criteria across the world. However, this classification has not been applied consistently in practice and is perceived by some as too complicated. Where there is diagnostic uncertainty, patients have worse outcomes. This uncertainty has also impacted on the validity of the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in clinical trials. To address these issues and to encourage clinicians to recognize that different mechanisms of myocardial infarction have differing treatment implications, we propose an alternative clinical classification for consideration; one that recognizes that myocardial infarction can arise spontaneously, secondary to another condition, or as a complication of a cardiac procedure. This classification is aligned with clinical practice and proposes more objective and specific diagnostic criteria that, if agreed by international consensus, could reduce diagnostic uncertainty in practice and research.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^c6faf020]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several strengths and limitations of our study. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial, enrolling consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome across 10 hospitals irrespective of age, sex, time of presentation and severity of illness. As such, we believe our results are generalizable and reflective of real-world clinical practice. Using all available clinical information, we reviewed and classified all patients according to the latest recommendations from the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction to ensure our findings are relevant to current practice. Where there was consensus amongst the adjudication panel that there was insufficient clinical information to make a definitive diagnosis, because of missing admission or discharge letters, we did not attempt to adjudicate the diagnosis (1245/10 360, 12%). We had access to all other information including past medical history, clinical investigations, management and outcomes, and provide data for all primary and secondary outcomes in this group within the data supplement. Our trial population was restricted to patients who had cardiac troponin measured for suspected acute coronary syndrome, and we acknowledge that the prevalence of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury may differ in consecutive patients where cardiac troponin was measured for any reason. Whilst we implemented the recommendations of the Third Universal Definition in our trial, as the Fourth Universal Definition provides no additional guidance on the investigation or treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, we think it is unlikely that outcomes would differ had this guideline been in place at the start of the trial. Whilst there was substantial overall agreement between adjudicators for the classification of myocardial injury and infarction, we recognize that agreement was only moderate for the classification of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury. In addition, we acknowledge that investigations and treatments were undertaken at the discretion of the treating clinician there is a risk of diagnostic misclassification. A formal comparison of the adjudicated diagnosis and ICD-10 coded clinical diagnosis is planned. Serial cardiac troponin measurements were only undertaken in 77% (6983/9115) of patients, which has particular relevance to the distinction between acute and chronic myocardial injury. Consequently, we considered both diagnoses as a single entity when comparing outcomes by study phase to avoid selection bias.

In conclusion, implementation of the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction identified patients at high risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular events, but was not associated with consistent increases in treatment or improved outcomes. Effective strategies for the investigation and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are required if we are to improve outcomes.

### Sex differences in investigations and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction [^bcac3245]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) have a poor prognosis, and this condition is a heterogeneous entity with multiple aetiologies and triggers. Insights into the patient groups who are at highest risk and the clinical features that influence outcomes are required to develop evidence-based treatments that reduce mortality.

It has been observed that the majority of patients diagnosed with type 1 MI are men. Intriguingly, recent studies have suggested that the proportion of patients with type 2 MI who are women is higher. Similarly, the investigation and treatment of type 1 MI differs in men and women, with women less likely to receive evidence-based therapies. Whether the clinical characteristics and investigations differ in men and women with type 2 MI, and how these impact on outcomes is not known.

Here, we compare the clinical characteristics, investigations and outcomes of consecutive patients with type 1 and type 2 MI stratified by sex. Our aim was to define the predictors of death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with a diagnosis of type 2 MI, and to determine whether these differ in men and women.

### Impact of clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with elevated cardiac troponin [^2ad44fa2]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the currently defined type 2 MI often is not recognised as MI in clinical practice. In both adjudicated type 2 MI and myocardial injury, a clinical diagnosis of MI at discharge was associated with increased cardiology care, including a greater use of coronary angiography and secondary preventive therapies. However, no prognostic effect of receiving a clinical diagnosis of MI could be observed for either of these conditions. This questions the clinical relevance of the term MI outside type 1 MI and highlights the need for further studies in both these heterogeneous conditions.

### A proposal for modest revision of the definition of type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction [^dcbe9b37]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

We propose consideration of a modest redefinition of type 1 and type 2 MI (Figure), with type 1 MI defined by acute coronary obstruction or reduction in coronary blood flow rather than by atherothrombosis. This would move SCAD, coronary embolism, and coronary vasomotor abnormalities (including epicardial vasospasm and microvascular dysfunction) into the type 1 MI category. We further propose subclassifying type 1 MI based on the underlying pathophysiology, with type 1A MI being the typical atherothrombosis category and the other etiologies having separate subclassifications (Figure). Type 2 MI would be defined as MI attributable to acute supply/demand mismatch without acute coronary obstruction. We propose further subclassifying type 2 MI into those with or without obstructive coronary artery disease (Figure), because the subsequent management approaches differ substantially based on the presence of severe coronary artery disease. As an important corollary, modification of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to improve specificity would be an important step forward for research and quality improvement in patients with MI caused by factors other than atherothrombosis.

Figure.
Proposed revision to Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI). The proposal redefines type 1 and type 2 MI based on the presence or absence of acute coronary obstruction, with subclassifications based on underlying pathophysiology. This differs from the current UDMI by categorizing spontaneous coronary dissection, coronary embolism, and vasospasm as type 1 MI, and subclassifying type 2 MI based on the presence or absence of fixed obstructive coronary disease. CAD indicates coronary artery disease; and MI, myocardial infarction.

We believe that this redefinition would better align with modern approaches to diagnosis and management of the spectrum of patients with MI. It would facilitate research into specific diagnostic subcategories and identification of optimal treatment approaches. This designation would also eliminate the need for a separate classification scheme for myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary disease. Each of the categories of myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary disease would fit within the new MI definition construct. Also, the creation of subcategories (type 1A, 1B, etc) would allow room for additional MI phenotypes, as new information on pathophysiology becomes available, without altering the fundamental structure of the classification.

### Uncovering sex differences in type 2 myocardial infarction: is coronary anatomy enough? [^a43037c0]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by myocardial injury that occurs in the setting of an imbalance in myocardial blood supply and demand, in the absence of plaque disruption or atherothrombosis. Since the universal definition of MI first introduced subtypes in 2007, it has become apparent that type 2 MI is underappreciated, more common than type 1 MI, and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. When compared to individuals with type 1 MI, those with type 2 MI tend to be older, are more likely to be female, and have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Yet unlike type 1 MI, for which pathophysiology is known and effective treatments are available, coronary mechanisms of type 2 MI have not been systematically elucidated. In a prior study of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in patients with type 2 MI vs type 1 MI, those with type 2 MI had smaller total, noncalcified, and low-attenuation plaque burdens than those with type 1 MI. However, among patients with type 2 MI, sex-specific differences in clinical presentation and mechanism of MI have not been defined. Unfortunately, due to the deficiencies in our understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 MI, few targeted therapies have been tested. Instead, supportive care addressing the provoking conditions of type 2 MI and management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors have remained the mainstay of treatment for type 2 MI.

A myocardial infarction occurs when blood supply to a part of the myocardium is interrupted, either by lack of blood flow, obstruction by a clot, or rupture of a plaque in a coronary artery. Many individuals have coronary artery disease and do not know it until they have a heart attack or die suddenly as a result of myocardial infarction.

Chest pain, often crushing, severe, and left-sided Arm, jaw, or neck pain Fainting or light-headedness Nausea Fatigue Upper abdominal pain Loss of consciousness Cardiac arrest Men are more likely to experience chest pain during a myocardial infarction.

Women often have more subtle symptoms, including fatigue and nausea. Treatment Call emergency medical services immediately. Treating a myocardial infarction quickly is important to limit heart muscle damage and prevent complications. Oxygen, aspirin, and pain relief with morphine are usually used in the immediate evaluation period. An electrocardiogram is part of early assessment, as are blood tests looking for heart muscle damage. Other tests may be prescribed, such as an echocardiogram, chest x-ray. and coronary angiography. During coronary angiography, the cardiologist may be able to treat the diseased blood vessel using percutaneous coronary interventions, such as a balloon or a stent.

### New horizons in type 2 myocardial infarction: pathogenesis, assessment and management of an emerging geriatric disease [^47e4be36]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) is characterised by a functional imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand in the absence of a thrombotic process, leading to myocardial necrosis. This type of MI was relatively unknown among clinicians until the third universal definition of MI was published in 2017, differentiating Type 2 from Type 1 MI, which follows an acute atherothrombotic event. The pathogenesis, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Type 2 MI are described in the present review. Type 2 MI is a condition that is strongly linked to age because of vascular ageing concerning both epicardic vessels and microcirculation, age-related atherosclerosis and stress maladaptation. This condition predominantly affects multimorbid individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease. However, the conditions that lead to the functional imbalance between oxygen supply and demand are frequently extra-cardiac (e.g. pneumonia or anaemia). The great heterogeneity of the underlying etiological factors requires a comprehensive approach that is tailored to each case. In the absence of evidence for the benefit of invasive reperfusion strategies, the treatment of Type 2 MI remains to date essentially based on the restoration of the balance between oxygen supply and demand. For older co-morbid patients with Type 2 MI, geriatricians and cardiologists need to work together to optimise etiological investigations, treatment and prevention of predisposing conditions and precipitating factors.

### Application of the universal definition of myocardial infarction in clinical practice in scotland and Sweden [^41f8260d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) is endorsed by the World Health Organization and encourages the use of standard criteria for the diagnosis of MI worldwide. In 2007, a classification into subtypes was introduced that recognized there are different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of MI. Type 1 MI due to coronary atherothrombosis is well established in practice, and clear guidance is available for management and treatment of this condition. In contrast, type 2 MI due to oxygen supply-demand imbalance may be triggered by multiple conditions, and the implications of this diagnosis in practice are less certain.,

Outcomes for patients with type 2 MI are variable and are often worse than for patients with type 1 MI. Patients with type 2 MI often are older and have more comorbidities, but differences in outcome may also reflect uncertainty in practice and variation in the management of patients with type 2 MI. It is currently unclear whether the diagnostic criteria proposed by the UDMI are consistently applied in clinical practice.

In consecutive patients with possible MI presenting to secondary or tertiary care hospitals across 2 different countries, we evaluated the proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of MI recorded in the hospital records who had type 1 and type 2 MI as adjudicated by an independent panel according to the UDMI. We compared the characteristics and outcomes in patients with and without a clinical diagnosis MI.

Key Points

Question

How is the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), which differentiates type 1 (atherothrombosis) from type 2 (oxygen supply-demand imbalance) MI, applied in clinical practice?

Findings

In this cohort study of 50 356 patients, few patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for type 2 MI received a clinical diagnosis of MI in practice, and type 1 MI was underdiagnosed in women and older people.

Meaning

These findings suggest that uncertainty remains regarding the diagnostic criteria or value of the universal definition of MI.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^fa729904]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Universal definitions of acute myocardial infarction (types 1, 2, and 3) — The term acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile URL and at least 1 of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia; new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; development of pathological Q waves; imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology; or identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for types 2 or 3 MIs). Postmortem demonstration of acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI, evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute atherothrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI, and cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI.

### Coronary artery and cardiac disease in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: a prospective cohort study [^259dd5c7]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

In 2007, the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction introduced a classification of myocardial infarction according to pathogenesis. Type 1 myocardial infarction is defined as a myocardial infarction that occurs as a result of thrombosis associated with atherosclerotic plaque. In this setting, there are established evidence-based strategies for investigation and treatment that improve outcomes. In contrast, type 2 myocardial infarction results from an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or demand without atherothrombosis. It encompasses a diverse and heterogeneous group of patients who present with disturbed physiology in the context of an acute illness such as tachycardia, hypoxemia, or hypotension or in those with a coronary mechanism other than atherothrombosis such as coronary embolism or coronary artery dissection. The definition of type 2 myocardial infarction is based on expert consensus, without prospective evidence to support the benefits of such a diagnosis for the management or treatment of these patients. It is now recognized that half of all cardiac troponin elevations are attributable to either type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, especially in the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays. However, for such a prevalent condition, our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms remains limited. Fewer than one-third of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are managed by cardiologists, and just 10% to 20% undergo investigations to identify the presence of underlying coronary artery or cardiac disease. –

Through a prospective cohort study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of coronary artery and cardiac disease in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction with systematic coronary and cardiac imaging to better understand the pathogenesis of this condition and to identify potential treatment opportunities.

Introduction

Established strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture have led to improvements in both short- and long-term survival. However, it is recognized that MI can occur without atherothrombosis, in acute conditions that result in an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or an unmet increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Multiple causes of supply–demand imbalance exist and to date, no approaches to investigation or treatments have been shown to improve outcomes. Here, we explore the underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI, their relationship with future risk, and explore potential strategies for investigation and treatment that could plausibly improve clinical outcomes for a group of patients who are often not given priority.

Widespread adoption of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays has led to increased recognition of myocardial injury and type 2 MI in practice. Type 2 MI is more common in older females and in those with co-morbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, previous coronary revascularization, and previous heart failure. Estimates of the prevalence of type 2 MI vary widely depending on the setting (emergency department, hospitalized patients, or the coronary care unit), the method of identification (consented or consecutive), and differences in the approach to defining the diagnosis (adjudication or hospital coding). In a cohort of consecutive patients presenting to an emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome in Scotland, the prevalence of type 2 MI was 12.3%. Whereas in patients admitted to hospital, the prevalence of type 2 MI varies from 2% to 37%. Type 2 MI is as prevalent as type 1 MI in those over the age of 75 years. Importantly, even in registry-based studies with standard data collection procedures, significant variation in prevalence has been observed from.2% to 13.0% in the SWEDEHEART registry. The variation in prevalence observed between studies may be compounded by differences in application of the diagnostic criteria during adjudication, which enables the diagnosis to be made using symptoms of myocardial ischaemia alone. This can be subjective in patients unwell with another cardiac condition.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^997b74a6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Significance

- Lowering the diagnostic threshold for troponin preferentially increases the number of patients identified with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.
- Patients reclassified as having type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury remained in the hospital for longer and were more likely to undergo cardiac investigations but, in contrast to type 1 myocardial infarction, were discharged without additional cardiac therapies and clinical outcomes remained poor and unchanged.

The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction proposes a classification for patients with myocardial infarction based on cause to accommodate more sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis. The classification differentiates between type 1 myocardial infarction, due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque, and type 2 myocardial infarction, due to an imbalance of myocardial blood supply and demand that may arise in many acute medical and surgical conditions. The expert consensus further defines evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia as myocardial injury. Although this classification has been used in recent clinical trials to refine clinical outcomes, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are difficult to distinguish or diagnose definitively, and the frequency in clinical practice and implications of these diagnoses are uncertain.

After improvements in assay performance, a sensitive troponin assay was introduced into our institution. The validation and subsequent implementation of this assay provided an opportunity to assess the impact of lowering the diagnostic threshold on the incidence, management, and clinical outcome of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

### Type 1, type 2 myocardial infarction and non-ischemic myocardial injury-opinion from the front lines [^f54a787a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Differentiating patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) and acute non-ischemic myocardial injury continues to be a problem for many clinicians. Type 1 MI is the most easily defined. It involves the rise and fall of blood troponin measurements (only falling values if the patient arrives late) with an appropriate clinical observation consistent with myocardial ischemia. Diagnosis and therapy of type 1 MI are well understood and usually present no problem to the physician. The clinical scenarios leading to type 2 MI and non-ischemic myocardial injury are, however, often fraught with greater degrees of uncertainty. In addition, therapy for these latter 2 entities is poorly defined. This review will present 3 patient scenarios that should help clinicians understand the difference between these 3 entities as well as possible therapeutic interventions.

Myocardial infarction type 3 — definition states that the detection of cardiac biomarkers in the blood is fundamental for establishing the diagnosis of MI, but some patients may die before blood can be obtained or before biomarker values have risen; such patients are designated as having a type 3 MI when suspicion for an acute myocardial ischemic event is high, even when cardiac biomarker evidence of MI is lacking.

### Effect of definition on incidence and prognosis of type 2 myocardial infarction [^b3c5f181]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainties regarding the most appropriate definition and treatment of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) due to supply-demand mismatch have contributed to inconsistent adoption in clinical practice.

Objectives

This study sought a better understanding of the effect of the definition of T2MI on its incidence, treatment, and event-related mortality, thereby addressing an important unmet clinical need.

Methods

The final diagnosis was adjudicated in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction by 2 independent cardiologists by 2 methods: 1 method required the presence of coronary artery disease, a common interpretation of the 2007 universal definition (T2MI 2007); and 1 method did not require coronary artery disease, the 2012 universal definition (T2MI 2012).

Results

Overall, 4,015 consecutive patients were adjudicated. The incidence of T2MI based on the T2MI 2007 definition was 2.8% (n = 112). The application of the more liberal T2MI 2012 definition resulted in an increase of T2MI incidence of 6% (n = 240), a relative increase of 114% (128 reclassified patients, defined as T2MI 2012reclassified). Among T2MI 2007, 6.3% of patients received coronary revascularization, 22% dual-antiplatelet therapy, and 71% high-dose statin therapy versus 0.8%, 1.6%, and 31% among T2MI 2012reclassified patients, respectively (all p < 0.01). Cardiovascular mortality at 90 days was 0% among T2MI 2012reclassified, which was similar to patients with noncardiac causes of chest discomfort (0.2%), and lower than T2MI 2007 (3.6%) and type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) (4.8%) (T2MI 2012reclassified vs. T2MI 2007 and T1MI: p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

T2MI 2012reclassified has a substantially lower event-related mortality rate compared with T2MI 2007 and T1MI. (Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndromes Evaluation [APACE] Study; NCT00470587).

### The intersection of type 2 myocardial infarction and heart failure [^00bae9a3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Describing the varying presentation patterns and pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction (MI), in 2007 the Universal Definition of MI introduced 5 distinct subtypes of MI. Type 2 MI (T2MI) is defined as myocardial injury resulting from a mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply‐demand and occurring in the absence of acute atherothrombosis.

As recognition of T2MI has increased, emerging data have demonstrated that this form of MI is common and may even be more prevalent than type 1 MI. Moreover, as hospitals transition to high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, the incidence of T2MI is anticipated to further increase. Patients with T2MI have a concerning prognosis; the 5‐year mortality rate is approximately 60%. Although most patients die from non‐cardiovascular causes following T2MI, it is increasingly recognized that patients with T2MI are also at high‐risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. Almost one‐third of patients with T2MI will experience a recurrent MI or die from a cardiovascular event within 5 years. In this setting, efforts to improve risk stratification and identify therapeutic strategies for patients with T2MI are essential.

The relationship between T2MI and heart failure (HF) is underexplored. The 2 conditions are closely intertwined: HF can be both a precipitant of T2MI but also be an adverse outcome of the infarction. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with HF, identification of at‐risk patients is critical to facilitate primary and secondary preventive interventions. In the setting of this pressing need, we examined the risk of HF events following T2MI.

### Classification of myocardial infarction: frequency and features of type 2 myocardial infarction [^7b0c182b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The classification of myocardial infarction into 5 types was introduced in 2007 as an important component of the universal definition. In contrast to the plaque rupture-related type 1 myocardial infarction, type 2 myocardial infarction is considered to be caused by an imbalance between demand and supply of oxygen in the myocardium. However, no specific criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction have been established.

Methods

We prospectively studied unselected hospital patients who had cardiac troponin I measured on clinical indication. The diagnosis and classification of myocardial infarction were established, and the frequency and features of type 2 myocardial infarction were investigated by use of novel developed criteria.

Results

From January 2010 to January 2011, a total of 7230 consecutive patients who had cardiac troponin I measured were evaluated, and 4499 patients qualified for inclusion. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction was established in 553 patients, of whom 386 (72%) had a type 1 myocardial infarction and 144 (26%) had a type 2 myocardial infarction. Patients in the group with type 2 myocardial infarction were older and more likely to be female, and had more comorbidities. The proportion of patients without significant coronary artery disease was higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (45%) than in those with type 1 myocardial infarction (12%) (P < .001). Tachyarrhythmias, anemia, and respiratory failure were the most prevalent mechanisms causing type 2 myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

In a cohort of patients with myocardial infarction who were admitted consecutively through 1 year, the category of type 2 myocardial infarction comprised one fourth when diagnosed by the use of newly developed criteria. Approximately half of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction had no significant coronary artery disease.

2.2 MI subtypes

In the past 20 years, the accuracy of detecting MI has improved, and more detailed examination of underlying pathophysiology has been possible due to advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined ECG criteria, and availability of high‐sensitivity Cardiac troponin assays. 5, 10 On the basis of this improved diagnosis of MI, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Foundation (ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF) Task Force for the Redefinition of MI subdivided MI into five main categories according to etiology, with their most recent criteria for each MI type published in 2018 (Figure 1). 5 Types 1 and 2 are spontaneous etiologies of MI, while type 3 is by definition fatal and type 4 and type 5 are procedure‐related. 5 This review will focus on type 1 and type 2 MI.

Figure 1
Classification of myocardial infarction based on the fourth universal definition. 5 CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD, coronary artery disease; ECG, electrocardiogram; MI, myocardial infarction; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention

Criteria for both type 1 and type 2 MI are a rise and/or fall in Cardiac troponin with ≥ 1 value higher than the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following: symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, development of pathological Q waves, and imaging evidence consistent with ischemic etiology. 5 Type 1 MI is characterized by atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (CAD) with an occlusive or non‐occlusive coronary thrombus, identified by angiography or autopsy. 5 Type 2 MI differs from type 1 MI in that acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption is absent and there is evidence of an oxygen supply‐demand imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis, either alone or in combination with atherosclerosis, vasospasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction, or nonatherosclerotic coronary dissection. 5

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^8a72f81a]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Individual and public implications of the myocardial infarction definition — Revision of the definition of MI has a number of implications for individuals, health professionals, and society at large. A tentative or final diagnosis guides advice about diagnostic testing, lifestyle changes, treatment, and prognosis, and the aggregate of patients with a particular diagnosis underpins healthcare planning and policy/resource allocation. One goal of good clinical practice is a definitive and specific diagnosis supported by current scientific knowledge, and the approach to the definition of myocardial injury and MI in this document meets this goal. In general, the conceptual meaning of myocardial infarction has not changed, although new sensitive methods have been developed; thus, the diagnosis of an acute MI is a clinical diagnosis based on patient symptoms, ECG changes, highly sensitive biochemical markers, and information from imaging techniques. The universal definition may have consequences for psychological status, insurance, professional career, and driving/pilot licenses, and it bears societal implications for diagnosis-related coding, reimbursement, public health statistics, sick leave, and disability attestation. To meet these challenges, physicians must be adequately informed of the diagnostic criteria.

### Impact of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) on hospital-level MI outcomes: implications for quality and public reporting [^b4fbf9eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In 2007, the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation task force released an expert consensus document redefining myocardial infarction (MI) into 5 types. 1 Given the increased sensitivity of biomarker assays, the Third Universal Definition of MI was published in 2012. 2 Type 1 MI was referred to as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, or erosion leading to intraluminal thrombus formation and obstructed coronary blood flow. Type 2 MI was defined as MI not caused by plaque rupture but secondary to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply related to an underlying cause. Type 3 MI is defined as cardiac death due to MI, and types 4 and 5 are MI associated with revascularization procedures.

Type 2 MI is common and has been associated with worse prognosis. 3, 4, 5, 6 Although there has been widespread acceptance of the concept of type 2 MI, the current International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system does not recognize type 2 MI as a separate entity; therefore, its impact on hospital‐level MI outcomes has not been studied because these patients continue to be categorized under the general umbrella of non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Compounding this is the fact that guidelines‐based post‐ACS treatment is expected to be followed in all patients with a diagnosis of MI. Although aspirin, statins, and beta blockers may have a role in the management of some patients with type 2 MI, using guideline‐based ACS therapy in every case of type 2 MI may be inappropriate. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess differences in patient characteristics, treatment, mortality, and hospital readmissions between type 2 and type 1 MI patients and to evaluate their potential impact on hospital‐level MI metrics and implications for quality and public reporting.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^5dde03ca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Universal Definition makes a distinction between type 2 myocardial infarction and causes of elevations in plasma troponin resulting in myocardial injury, such as renal failure, heart failure, sepsis, and myopericarditis, and defines myocardial infarction, regardless of pathobiology, as evidence of myocardial necrosis in the presence of clinical symptoms and signs of myocardial ischemia. However, it is clinically challenging to distinguish between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury because there remains considerable overlap between these 2 clinical entities. The consensus document does not provide specific criteria on how to differentiate between these entities in clinical practice, and our analysis represents one of the first attempts to do so in consecutive hospitalized patients. Thus, our frequency data may differ from those of others who may have applied a different criteria to define type 1 myocardial infarction and may or may not have had a category for myocardial injury. Accordingly, the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction in our study of 20% (429/2165) was lower than in the only previous reports in which the frequency was 30% (64/701 patients)and 26% (144/553 patients)in unselected hospitalized patients with elevated troponin concentrations. Our analysis is novel in that we distinguish between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, and differences in classification may explain the lower rates of type 2 myocardial infarction in our cohort. Perhaps it is not surprising that type 2 myocardial infarction has been reported to be less frequent (2%-5%) in highly selected populations with myocardial infarction from randomized controlled trials or registries of patients admitted to cardiac units. Our patients were widely distributed across medical and surgical specialties, and it is likely that selection bias has underestimated the true prevalence of type 2 myocardial infarction in these studies.

### Machines running for phenotyping of Myocardial injury: the end to anConundrum? [^b52308fb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Myocardial injury is defined as at least 1 elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) level above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, further subclassified as either acute or chronic injury. Despite this seemingly slender definition, the conditions potentially underlying such injury to myocardial cells are heterogeneous. In case of additional evidence for myocardial ischemia, criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) are fulfilled. Even MI incorporates several subtypes including type 1 MI (classical plaque disruption) or type 2 MI (oxygen supply demand mismatch). Accurate delineation of these subtypes and identification of the underlying etiology is by far not a simple academic formality — there are pivotal differences in treatment strategies, ranging from evidence-based coronary revascularization in type 1 MI to primarily targeting the trigger for supply demand mismatch in type 2 MI in a more holistic approach. However, this is all far from black and white — imaging studies showed that unrecognized and untreated coronary disease is present in many patients with type 2 MI.

Introduction

The development of increasingly more sensitive biomarkers for detecting myocardial injury and necrosis over the last decades has required several updates and revisions of the definition of myocardial infarction (MI). The universal definition of MI, published in 2007 and revised in 2012, has introduced five clinical subtypes of MI depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanism leading to the ischaemic necrosis. All MI subtypes have in common that the myocardial necrosis is caused by myocardial ischaemia. However, while type 1 MI is caused by a local thromboembolic formation in the coronary artery due to plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring or dissection, in type 2 MI other conditions than coronary artery disease (CAD) contributes to an ischaemic imbalance in cardiac oxygen supply and demand. Apart from the ischaemic necrosis in MI, myocardial injury and necrosis may occur in other settings where inflammation, toxicity, trauma or mechanical stress is causing or contributing to the injury. While in some conditions, such as in myocarditis or trauma, the myocardial injury is non-ischaemic, in other conditions (such as heart failure or sepsis) the myocardial injury may be of a multifactorial nature where the significance of a possible ischaemic component is difficult to decide. Distinguishing type 2 MI from type 1 MI and especially from multifactorial myocardial injuries constitutes a clinical challenge. The interpretation of this classification differs considerably between different studies indicating that the clinical criteria for this classification are not well defined. Therefore, the aims of this study were (1) to evaluate how often physicians agree in distinguishing type 1 MI, type 2 MI and multifactorial myocardial injury, when adhering strictly to the classification presented by the third universal definition of MI and (2) to elucidate which clinical variables that affect agreement or disagreement between reviewers in this classification.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^a15e8c97]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial infarction type 2 — ischemic myocardial injury due to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand has been classified as type 2 MI, and acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption is not a feature. In patients with stable known or presumed coronary artery disease, an acute gastrointestinal bleed with a precipitous drop in hemoglobin or a sustained tachyarrhythmia with clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia may result in myocardial injury and a type 2 MI. Most studies show a higher frequency of type 2 MI in women, and short- and long-term mortality rates are generally higher than for type 1 MI patients in most but not all studies due to an increased prevalence of comorbid conditions. Coronary atherosclerosis is a common finding in type 2 MI patients selected for coronary angiography, and in general these patients have a worse prognosis than those without coronary artery disease. The frequency of ST-segment elevation in type 2 MI varies from 3% to 24%. For diagnosis, all clinical information, context, and mechanisms should be considered; the oxygen supply/demand imbalance may be related to reduced myocardial perfusion due to fixed coronary atherosclerosis without plaque rupture, coronary artery spasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, coronary artery dissection with or without intramural hematoma, or other mechanisms that reduce oxygen supply such as severe bradyarrhythmia, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, severe anemia, and hypotension/shock; or to increased myocardial oxygen demand due to sustained tachyarrhythmia or severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy.

3.4.5 Managing type 1 vs type 2 NSTEMI

Type 2 NSTEMI is often classified under a general NSTEMI diagnosis or misclassified as type 1, despite its presentation and underlying pathophysiology being different from those of type 1 NSTEMI. 26 It is essential that NSTEMI be classified as type 1 or type 2, based on clinical presentation, Cardiac troponin, ECG, and imaging findings, so that it can be managed appropriately. 5 Type 2 MI has heterogeneous underlying causes, often atypical features, a lack of a clear precipitating cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance in some patients (eg, absence of discernible CAD), and does not usually involve atherothrombotic plaque disruption. 5 As a result, current NSTEMI guidelines may be challenging — or in some cases inappropriate — to apply in patients who are experiencing a type 2 NSTEMI, and no formal guidelines for type 2 NSTEMI are available. 21 Studies have found that compared with patients with type 1 NSTEMI, patients with type 2 NSTEMI were less likely to undergo catheterization and revascularization procedures or receive recommended secondary prevention medications at discharge, and they had higher mortality rates. 20, 26 There is therefore a need for evidence‐based diagnosis and management guidelines for NSTEMI that acknowledge the complexities of type 2 MI. 16, 20, 21, 22, 28 Consequently, a phenotype‐based approach to type 2 MI diagnosis and management across different clinical settings has been proposed (Figure 3). 50 This approach considers both the context and multiple possible underlying mechanisms of type 2 MI and recommends treatment of the cause of the oxygen supply‐demand imbalance for each patient. 50

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^ea2db859]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Generally, all studies on type 2 MI claim to base on the classification in the third universal definition of MI, but there are still vast differences in how the type 2 MI concept is interpreted, especially in relation to myocardial injury. While in some studies, all patients without type 1 MI but with elevated cTn are called type 2 MI, in other studies only myocardial injury caused by the mechanisms that may lead to cardiac oxygen supply/demand mismatch presented in third universal definition of MI are classified as type 2 MI. Some studies even uses specific cut-off values for these mechanisms (eg, tachyarrhythmia > 120 beats per minute) to further sharpen the type 2 MI diagnose. A condition causing much ambiguity is sepsis. In many studies, sepsis is reported as one of the most common causes of type 2 MI. However, according to the third universal definition of MI, the myocardial injury seen in sepsis is not solely related to myocardial ischaemia but rather of a multifactorial nature and should not routinely be classified as type 2 MI. On the other hand, septic shock is postulated as a triggering mechanism of type 2 MI; however, in clinical practice, differentiation between those two conditions may be difficult. Heart failure is another condition causing trouble in this classification. In this study, 78 patients out of 1326 patients had incorrectly received MI diagnose based on elevated cTn levels secondary to heart failure. Elevated cTn in acute heart failure should always raise the suspicion of a type 1 MI, and also indicate an increased wall stress causing either secondary ischaemia or apoptosis and, experimentally demonstrated, also proteolysis of the cardiac contractile apparatus. Cardiac troponins are poor diagnostic markers for an ischaemic versus non-ischaemic aetiology in heart failure. In absence of clinical evidence of ischaemia, the myocardial injury should be regarded as multifactorial. Since both chest discomfort may occur and abnormal ECG findings frequently occur in patients with acute heart failure, assessing the nature of a myocardial injury in this condition constitutes a great clinical challenge.

### Mortality rate in type 2 myocardial infarction: observations from an unselected hospital cohort [^fd2d2b6d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The classification of myocardial infarction into 5 types was introduced in 2007. The prognostic impact of this universal definition, with particular focus on type 2 myocardial infarction, has not been studied prospectively in unselected hospital patients.

Methods

During a 1-year period, all hospitalized patients having cardiac troponin I measured were considered. The diagnosis of a myocardial infarction was according to the universal definition, and specified criteria were used in the classification of type 2 myocardial infarction. Follow-up was at least 1 year, with mortality as the end point.

Results

A total of 3762 consecutive patients were studied, of whom 488 (13%) had a myocardial infarction. In 119 patients a type 2 myocardial infarction was diagnosed. After a median of 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.6–2.5 years), 150 patients had died, with a mortality rate of 49% (58/119) in those with type 2 myocardial infarction and 26% (92/360) in those with type 1 myocardial infarction (P < .0001). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis the following variables were independently associated with mortality: current or prior smoker, high age, prior myocardial infarction, type 2 myocardial infarction, hypercholesterolemia, high p-creatinine, and diabetes mellitus. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for type 2 myocardial infarction was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.3–3.0). With shock as the only exception, mortality was independent of the triggering conditions leading to type 2 myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

Mortality in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction is high, reaching approximately 50% after 2 years. Further descriptive and survival studies are needed to improve the scientific evidence on which treatment of type 2 myocardial infarction is based.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^3f3384eb]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Immediate

In patients who have a clear trigger for type 2 MI and who are thought to be at low risk of underlying cardiovascular disease, no treatment may be required other than correcting the underlying reason for supply–demand imbalance to reduce the risk of recurrent myocardial ischaemia. This may include temporarily withholding medication that could exacerbate supply–demand imbalance, such as anti-hypertensive therapy, and attempting to restore normal physiology through intra-venous fluid resuscitation, oxygen supplementation, or blood transfusion to limit further ischaemia.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^f0f7a190]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Despite these problems in clinical decision-making and patient management, this case illustrates the advantages to having the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI available. In discussing the Universal Definition for MI, the joint commission discussed the importance of also defining the extent or severity of the MI. Based on the relatively small rise in troponin and non-specific abnormalities on ECG, the amount of cardiac damage in this patient was felt to be small, and additional imaging studies to confirm that assessment were deferred. But the term TYPE 2 MI is still applicable, even though we may qualify the diagnosis using appropriate modifiers (such as possible or probable) with the recognition that the diagnosis may be confirmed, excluded, or further refined, depending on further studies.

The Diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI is advantageous not only for documentation purposes, but can also assist in quality review programs. Criteria for optimal care of acute MI often include measures such as time from onset of symptoms to first medical contact, time to first ECG, time from initial diagnosis to cardiac consultation, or time from diagnosis to lytic therapy, arrival in the catheterization lab, or reperfusion. Such measures are meaningless in patients such as the one presented here, and using an alternate diagnosis will prevent misclassification of the event.

Research requirements

For clinical trials to be successful in type 2 MI, the design will need to be pragmatic, with minimal exclusion criteria, and involve multiple centres. Given this heterogeneous patient population, it is unlikely a single intervention will be effective and complex interventions may be needed. Although the risk of future cardiovascular events including recurrent type 2 MI is high, it should be acknowledged that the potential for adverse unintended consequences of treatment such as bleeding may be greater, particularly in those who are older with multi-morbidity. Furthermore, the competing risk of non-cardiovascular events may limit any potential treatment benefit. Strategies to determine which patients stand to benefit from investigation and treatment require exploration (Table 2).

Table 2
Targets for research in type 2 myocardial infarction

Given disease heterogeneity, patient co-morbidity, and frailty, the feasibility of recruiting and randomizing patients with type 2 MI is uncertain. The TARGET-Type 2 feasibility trial (NCT:05419583) will randomize patients with type 2 MI 1:1 to usual care, or risk stratification and investigation for coronary artery disease or left ventricular impairment. Where identified, treatment will be recommended on an individual patient basis. Demonstrating that screening, recruitment, and randomization of these patients are feasible is the first step towards the design and delivery of multi-centre trials powered for clinical outcomes.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^70ac1613]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The frequency and clinical implications of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury in clinical practice are uncertain. We have systematically evaluated all patients with elevated plasma troponin concentrations admitted to a regional cardiac center during the validation and implementation of a sensitive troponin assay and have made a number of important and novel observations. First, type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury is as common as type 1 myocardial infarction in clinical practice irrespective of the threshold for diagnosis. The incidence of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury increases with age and is more common than type 1 myocardial infarction in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Second, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have worse clinical outcomes than patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, with 1 in 3 patients dead at 1 year. Third, lowering the diagnostic threshold preferentially increases the number of patients identified with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury. Indeed, for every additional patient reclassified with type 1 myocardial infarction, we identified 3 patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury. Finally, patients reclassified as type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury remained in the hospital longer and underwent more cardiac investigations but, in contrast to type 1 myocardial infarction, were discharged without additional cardiac therapies and clinical outcomes remained poor and unchanged.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^c2999a54]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Classification

All diagnoses were classified as per the 3rd universal definition of myocardial infarction. Patients were classified as having a type 1 myocardial infarction when myocardial necrosis occurred in the context of a presentation with suspected acute coronary syndrome with symptoms of myocardial ischemia or evidence of myocardial ischemia on the electrocardiogram. Patients with symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia that were thought to be because of increased oxygen demand (eg, tachyarrhythmia or hypertrophy) or decreased supply (eg, hypotension, hypoxia, or anemia) and myocardial necrosis in the context of an alternative clinical diagnosis were classified as having a type 2 myocardial infarction. Myocardial injury was defined as evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of any symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia. For this analysis, we excluded patients classified as having type 3, type 4a, type 4b, or type 5 myocardial infarction. Each case was reviewed and classified independently by 2 cardiologists, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus through in-depth review of source data. Further information on the adjudication process is provided in.

Clinical Outcomes

Clinical outcomes were identified using local and national population registries. We determined death using TrakCare (InterSystems) and the National Register of Scotland, with future hospitalization for myocardial infarction or heart failure identified using an extract from the Scottish Morbidity Record. We defined death from a cardiovascular cause where 1 of the following International Classification of Diseases-10 codes was listed as the primary cause of death: I20–25, I34–37, I42–43, I46, I48–51, and I60–69. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; defined as cardiovascular death or subsequent myocardial infarction), nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization with heart failure, and noncardiovascular death. We obtained follow-up for all patients until the primary outcome or date of censoring (November 16, 2015).

Ethical Considerations

The parent study protocol evaluated the implementation of a sensitive cardiac troponin assay and was deemed to fall under the remit of audit and service evaluation by the National Health Service Lothian Regional Ethics Committee, and therefore formal ethical approval was not required. For this study, we received approval from the Caldicott guardian to obtain long-term follow-up through local and national registries.

### Targeting investigation and treatment in Type 2 myocardial infarction: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^78dcbc1b]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

TARGET-Type 2 was a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial which aimed to assess recruitment and randomization of patients with type 2 MI into a complex intervention targeting underlying coronary heart disease and left ventricular impairment. Through a qualitative study, we aimed to evaluate the acceptability of our intervention to patients and clinicians, to optimize our trial intervention, and to identify any barriers to recruitment. We report several findings which will be of benefit to the design of future clinical trials in patients with type 2 MI.

Firstly, we have demonstrated it is possible to prospectively identify consecutive patients with type 2 MI through screening of routine electronic health care records. Secondly, despite increasing age and comorbidity, patients with type 2 MI were willing and able to be consented and randomized in a clinical trial. Thirdly, we were able to deliver a complex intervention of recommendations for further investigation and treatment with high adherence at 90 days and no signal of harm. Finally, through a targeted qualitative intervention, we have gained important insight into the acceptability and possible limitations of our proposed intervention which will allow us to refine our study design for a main phase trial.

Although the nomenclature of type 2 MI originates in the 2007 Universal Definition, to date, no dedicated clinical trials have been successfully undertaken, demonstrating the challenges in recruitment in this heterogeneous, multimorbid population. One single-center randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effect of rivaroxaban or placebo on a composite outcome of MI, stroke, or death at 2 years. The trial did not complete due to a lack of trial infrastructure and insufficient resources to deliver the intervention. A second single-center randomized controlled trial planned to determine if coronary revascularization could reduce infarct size in patients with type 2 MI but was withdrawn prior to starting recruitment. The ACT-2 (Appropriateness of Coronary investigation in myocardial injury and Type 2 myocardial infarction;) randomized controlled trial aims to enroll patients with secondary myocardial injury or infarction and randomize them to coronary angiography and secondary prevention vs standard care. The ACT-2 trial is powered to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in all-cause death at 2 years. It mandates strict inclusion criteria for myocardial oxygen supply or demand imbalance and began enrollment in 2019 but has yet to complete (personal communication). In this context, we anticipated there would be challenges in the delivery of a randomized controlled trial in this population and elected to undertake a feasibility trial to optimize our approach.

### A review of causes and systemic approach to cardiac troponin elevation [^a39c8855]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The first American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology task force published recommendations for a universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) in 2000 based on the measurement of troponin (Tn). Although this rapid and highly sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of Tn elevation in absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. In 2007, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation task force proposed a new definition for acute MI based on detection of Tn and associated clinical evidence. The goal of this article is to review the universal definition of acute MI and to differentiate type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and non-acute coronary syndrome Tn elevations. The prognosis and a clinical approach to this differential diagnosis will be developed.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^70ec34c1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

There are some patients with type 2 MI in whom further investigation is very unlikely to influence treatment or outcomes, due to advanced age, significant frailty, or co-morbidity with life-limiting illness. Similarly, there are some patients in whom the pre-test probability of identifying underlying cardiac disease is sufficiently low to avoid testing altogether. This threshold for further investigation varies on an individual patient basis, and careful assessment of the clinical presentation, aetiology, and magnitude of supply–demand imbalance is required. This assessment should include identification of cardiovascular risk factors, clinical examination for evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, or valvular heart disease and risk assessment for coronary artery disease.

Table 2
Studies reporting incidence of myocardial infarction classified according to the universal definition

Differences in the reported incidence may in part be explained by the inconsistent approach to distinguishing type 2 myocardial infarction from acute and chronic myocardial injury across studies. It is perhaps unsurprising that the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction is less frequent in selected populations with acute coronary syndrome.

A previous study at our centre evaluated all patients with elevated plasma cardiac troponin concentrations irrespective of presenting complaint (n = 2165), admitted during the validation and implementation of a contemporary sensitive cardiac troponin I assay. The frequency of type 1 myocardial infarction, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury was 54%, 20% and 24%, respectively. We demonstrated type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury were as common as type 1 myocardial infarction in clinical practice, and indeed more common than type 1 myocardial infarction in patients ≥ 75 years of age (figure 2). Lowering the diagnostic threshold with a more sensitive cardiac troponin assay reduced recurrent myocardial infarction or death in patients redefined as having type 1 myocardial infarction, but more than doubled the number of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury. Despite undergoing additional cardiac investigations, this did not result in changes in treatment, and there was no improvement in clinical outcomes.

Whether adoption of high-sensitivity troponin assays and the 99th centile for diagnosis of myocardial infarction translates into improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome is being evaluated in a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial across Scotland (High-STEACS, NCT: 01852123). If increased sensitivity does not impinge on specificity for the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, then these assays will improve patient outcomes through better targeting of therapies for coronary artery disease. However, if increased sensitivity leads to poor specificity, then patients may be misdiagnosed and given inappropriate cardiac medications with potentially detrimental outcomes. This trial will establish whether the introduction of high-sensitivity assays into routine clinical practice is detrimental or beneficial to patient management and outcomes; a fundamental and critical assessment for the modern definition of acute myocardial infarction.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^500f10e4]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Using the universal definition of myocardial infarction in the healthcare system — Diagnosis requires integrating clinical findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns, laboratory data, imaging observations, and occasional pathology over the event's time course. Healthcare systems increasingly use electronic medical records, which are useful but create challenges in locating key data; future epidemiological use is likely to require verification of acute MI accuracy rather than accepting coded diagnoses. To enable a computable phenotype of MI, further categorized as types 1–5 MI, a consistent approach is important given evolving assays, and the information provided should include the assay used, the 99th percentile of the URL, and the full sequence of biomarker values to discern a rise and fall.

Discussion

In a randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the effect of implementing a hs-cTnI assay and the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction on clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Whilst the majority of patients had a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, the introduction of high-sensitivity troponin testing led to a disproportionate increase in the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury or infarction were at increased risk of future myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, with those with type 1 myocardial infarction at highest risk. Despite modest increases in coronary revascularization and preventative therapies in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, there was no reduction in future cardiovascular events. In patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, cardiovascular event rates and future risk was similar to patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, despite a marked increase in noncardiovascular death. Here, we observed no change in cardiovascular investigations or treatments, and outcomes were similarly unchanged.

The observed excess in mortality in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury is consistent with previous observational studies. Patients with acute myocardial injury were at highest risk of noncardiovascular death, with more than a third occurring within 30 days because of pneumonia, an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or sepsis. In a model attempting to account for this competing risk of noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury had lower rates of cardiovascular events than those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite this, 1 in 6 had a myocardial infarction or died from a cardiovascular cause at 1 year; an event rate over 3-fold higher than observed in those without evidence of myocardial injury.

Whilst hs-cTn clearly provides important prognostic information, implementation of testing into practice did not improve outcomes. This may be because in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, there is little consensus on how to investigate or treat either group. Even in those with type 1 myocardial infarction, where we have clear guidelines for investigation and treatment, we observed only modest increases in coronary angiography, antiplatelet, or other preventative therapies. This may reflect clinician uncertainty in whether small increases in cardiac troponin are important, and if the benefits of invasive management outweigh the risks in this group. Indeed, our evidence base for the management of myocardial infarction largely predates the introduction of the Universal Definition, when the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction was almost 10-fold higher than the threshold implemented in this trial.

Myocardial infarction — Two myocardial infarction definitions are recommended by the workgroup: the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction as a general definition for events of interest, and the definition from the 2017 consensus statement on catheter ablation for myocardial infarction as a complication of surgical or catheter ablation. The Third Universal Definition divides myocardial infarction into five types; Type II is generally felt to be due to supply and demand ischemia and may occur in patients with AF with a rapid ventricular response, so registries may need to specify type I or type II or exclude type II events.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^6653fd39]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a cohort of consecutive hospitalized patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations, we classified the diagnosis of myocardial infarction according to the universal definition and report outcomes after 5 years follow-up. We make several observations that have implications for clinical practice. First, greater than two thirds of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury do not survive to 5 years after index diagnosis. This mortality rate was twice that of patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, with differences primarily because of an excess in noncardiovascular deaths. Second, MACEs occurred in one third of patients, and rates were similar irrespective of diagnostic classification. In those patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, the presence of coronary heart disease was 1 of the strongest predictors of a MACE. Those patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury with known coronary artery disease were less likely to receive secondary prevention therapies compared with those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in the context of an acute illness who have underlying coronary heart disease may provide an opportunity for clinicians to improve the targeting of preventative therapies and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Several studies demonstrate that the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction is common in clinical practice. It is responsible for between 2% and 37% of all elevations in cardiac troponin in unselected hospitalized patients and between 5% to 71% in unselected patients attending the emergency department. – Myocardial injury has been reported in ≤ 70% of unselected patients, but because the frequency of diagnosis is not reported by the majority of studies, failure to classify patients according to the criteria set out in the universal definition may inflate the incidence of type 2 myocardial infarction. Both type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury increase the risk of all-cause death at ≤ 3 years. We now provide outcome data at 5 years demonstrating that two thirds of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury are dead with twice the event rate of patients with type 1 myocardial infarction.

1 INTRODUCTION

Myocardial necrosis due to myocardial ischemia is designated as myocardial infarction (MI). Recognizing the heterogeneity inherent to this entity, in 2007 and 2012, the ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF Task Force for the Universal Definition of MI released expert consensus documents redefining MI into five types. 1 This classification system was recently further refined with the Fourth Universal Definition of MI. 2 Type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) refers to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, or erosion leading to intraluminal thrombus formation and obstructed coronary blood flow. Type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) was defined as myocardial ischemia, not due to plaque rupture but secondary to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and/or supply due to an underlying cause. 2 In defining presence of MI, a critical characteristic is presence of myocardial ischemia; this may be manifested by symptoms, changes on electrocardiography, or evidence for loss of myocardial function. Patients with evidence of elevated troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and 10% coefficient of variation without overt myocardial ischemia are classified as having myocardial injury. 2 This injury may be acute or chronic, depending on the pattern of cTn elevation and in appropriate clinical contexts.

### Assessment of oxygen supply-demand imbalance and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the high-STEACS cluster randomized clinical trial [^48a3f1d5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The definition of myocardial infarction has evolved because of improved sensitivity of cardiac biomarkers. The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction classifies type 1 myocardial infarction as being due to thrombotic occlusion after atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion and type 2 myocardial infarction as being due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in the context of acute systemic or cardiac illnesses or an underlying coronary mechanism other than plaque rupture.

It is recognized that type 2 myocardial infarction is common, and that it is associated with a substantial risk of adverse clinical outcomes, with as few as 30% of patients alive at 5 years. Despite this fact, effective strategies for the investigation and management of type 2 myocardial infarction have not been defined. Type 2 myocardial infarction is a heterogenous condition encompassing multiple factors associated with reduced myocardial oxygen supply (coronary embolism, dissection or vasospasm, hypotension, hypoxemia, and anemia) and increased myocardial oxygen demand (hypertension and tachyarrhythmia). These etiologic factors may confer different risks of adverse clinical outcomes and require distinct treatment strategies. In this secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial, we report the frequency of these factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction, and we compare their characteristics and outcomes with those of patients with type 1 myocardial infarction.

Clinical outcomes and competing risks

In patients with type 2 MI, outcomes are generally poor. There is a high early event rate at 30 days, which may relate to the primary illness rather than the secondary insult. However, this excess risk persists beyond the index event, and at 5 years, only around one-third of patients are alive. It is often stated that the excess in all-cause mortality observed after type 2 MI is attributable to age and co-morbidity, and not related to cardiovascular disease. However, in a multi-centre randomized controlled trial enrolling 48 282 consecutive unselected patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in whom the diagnosis was classified according to the Universal Definition, cause-specific mortality was explored. At 1 year, deaths from a non-cardiovascular cause occurred in 12% of patients with type 2 MI and 5% of patients with type 1 MI, the latter of which was comparable to those without myocardial injury. Despite an excess in non-cardiovascular events in those with type 2 MI, the absolute rates of MI or death from a cardiovascular cause were comparable, affecting 17% and 14% of patients with type 1 and type 2 MI, respectively. Even after adjustment, the risk of cardiovascular events in type 2 MI was elevated with a cause-specific hazard ratio (HR) of 3.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.94–4.15] compared to patients without myocardial injury. Similar observations have been made during follow-up of 63 479 patients from the SWEDEHEART cohort. Patients with type 2 MI were at higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.22–1.34) at 2.8 years compared to those with type 1 MI. A further cohort study of patients with type 1 and type 2 MI recruited within Olmsted County, MN, identified 1345 and 1022 patients with type 1 and type 2 MI. At 5 years, there were 31% and 59% deaths from any cause, of which 18% and 21% were due to cardiovascular disease, in type 1 or type 2 MI, respectively.

### Performance of the GRACE 2.0 score in patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction [^d1518ad4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary heart disease is responsible for around 2 million deaths across Europe every year. To improve prognostication and promote consistency in the investigation and management of patients with acute coronary syndrome, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score was developed. The score applies clinical variables, the electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers to estimate risk of future all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. The use of the GRACE 2.0 score in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome has a class Ia recommendation for guiding prognosis and IIa recommendation for guiding management across all international guidelines.

Since the introduction of the GRACE score, there have been significant changes in the way we diagnose myocardial infarction, driven by major improvements in the sensitivity of cardiac troponin. The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays and a sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold for myocardial injury and infarction. These assays have the ability to quantify myocardial injury at a threshold 10-fold lower than was in use at the time of the original GRACE study. This increase in diagnostic sensitivity has led to an understanding that myocardial infarction can occur in a number of different clinical settings.

The Fourth Universal Definition recognizes myocardial infarction may occur due to atheromatous plaque rupture and thrombosis (type 1 myocardial infarction), or secondary to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply or demand without coronary atherothrombosis (type 2 myocardial infarction). Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are older and more often have comorbidities and are at higher risk of adverse outcomes with as few as 30% of patients alive at 5 years. Despite a significant increase in risk of non-cardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction appear to have a similar risk of future cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. To date, there are no validated prognostic tools to estimate all-cause mortality or future cardiovascular events in this population. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the GRACE 2.0 score for the prediction of all-cause death in patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^789dd317]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The concept of competing risk of non-cardiovascular events is fundamental to our interpretation of future cardiovascular event rates in this population. As fewer patients with type 2 MI are alive due to the competing risk of non-cardiovascular death, fewer have the potential to experience a cardiovascular event, and one would therefore anticipate a much lower incidence in longitudinal follow-up if the underlying risks were comparable. As the observed cardiovascular event rates are similar, it is likely future cardiovascular risk is at least as high in type 2 as in type 1 MI.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^28499ad4]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays has led to increased recognition of myocardial injury in acute illnesses other than acute coronary syndrome. The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and classification of patients with myocardial injury based on pathogenesis, but the clinical implications of implementing this guideline are not well understood.

Methods

In a stepped-wedge cluster randomized, controlled trial, we implemented a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay and the recommendations of the Universal Definition in 48282 consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. In a prespecified secondary analysis, we compared the primary outcome of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death and secondary outcome of noncardiovascular death at 1 year across diagnostic categories.

Results

Implementation increased the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction by 11% (510/4471), type 2 myocardial infarction by 22% (205/916), and acute and chronic myocardial injury by 36% (443/1233) and 43% (389/898), respectively. Compared with those without myocardial injury, the rate of the primary outcome was highest in those with type 1 myocardial infarction (cause-specific hazard ratio [HR] 5.64 [95% CI, 5.12–6.22]), but was similar across diagnostic categories, whereas noncardiovascular deaths were highest in those with acute myocardial injury (cause specific HR 2.65 [95% CI, 2.33–3.01]). Despite modest increases in antiplatelet therapy and coronary revascularization after implementation in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, the primary outcome was unchanged (cause specific HR 1.00 [95% CI, 0.82–1.21]). Increased recognition of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury did not lead to changes in investigation, treatment or outcomes.

Conclusions

Implementation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction identified patients at high-risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular events but was not associated with consistent increases in treatment or improved outcomes. Trials of secondary prevention are urgently required to determine whether this risk is modifiable in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction.

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^5da9e736]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to investigate in detail how physicians agree adhering to the MI and myocardial injury classification presented in third universal definition of MI. Even for specially trained physicians strictly adhering to this classification, it is challenging especially to distinguish type 2 MI and multifactorial myocardial injury where reviewers reached lower grade of agreement than when distinguishing type 1 MI. This is also the first study to investigate which clinical variables or investigations influence the grade of agreement, giving suggestions to where the guidelines should be improved.

While differences in group characteristics between type 1 and type 2 MI are well documented, less is known about how patients with type 2 MI and multifactorial myocardial injury differ from each other. In line with some previous studies, patients with type 2 MI and multifactorial myocardial injury in this study were similar regarding age, sex and comorbidities, and patients with type 2 MI had higher peak cTn levels. A higher incidence of chest pain in the type 2 MI group compared with the myocardial injury group was also observed. A high heart rate and a low haemoglobin level also predisposed to type 2 MI diagnose, where tachyarrhythmia and anaemia were the most common provoking mechanisms.

### Assessment and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury [^c942cecd]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

When acute myocardial injury occurs in the context of another acute illness or surgical procedure, type 2 MI and nonischemic myocardial injury are more likely than type 1 MI, although it should be recognized that plaque rupture events can be triggered by acute infectious illness or precipitated by perioperative stressors. To distinguish between MI and acute nonischemic myocardial injury, the first step involves establishing whether there is evidence of myocardial ischemia. The presence or absence of ischemic symptoms can aid in determining ischemia but is not definitive and can be particularly difficult among individuals who are sedated, obtunded, or in the perioperative state. In these cases, ECG surveillance and echocardiography may provide supportive evidence. It is also important to determine if there has been significant myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch (eg, sustained tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, severe anemia, coronary spasm), an essential feature in the diagnosis of type 2 MI. In the absence of clear evidence of ischemia and supply/demand mismatch, we favor assigning the diagnosis of acute nonischemic myocardial injury. The result of this approach is that the diagnoses of type 1 and type 2 MI will be relatively clean with higher specificity for the underlying pathophysiological process. The category of nonischemic myocardial injury will be more diverse, but we anticipate that research will lead to deeper phenotyping to subclassify these individuals more effectively, based on a greater understanding of pathophysiology (see Future Directions). It is important to note that, as additional data become available over the patient's clinical course, the working diagnosis that best explains the etiology of myocardial injury may also change, and practitioners should continually reevaluate the diagnostic category and treatment approach as new patient data arise.

### Impact of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) on hospital-level MI outcomes: implications for quality and public reporting [^d6cd38a1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about the optimal management of type 2 MI, emphasizing the importance of better delineating type 2 MI from type 1 MI, as the optimal management of the 2 groups is likely different. In addition, if they are not appropriately differentiated, MI metrics at different institutions may be skewed and could lead to inaccurate assessment of quality and performance measures by MI quality review programs, based on patient populations for which the metrics were not designed, and inappropriate penalties for healthcare providers. Moreover, in most research on NSTEMI, including randomized trials and observational studies, NSTEMI patients are grouped as 1 cohort and type 2 MI is not isolated from the population. This approach is likely to have a major impact on the way the end points are assessed because outcomes can be skewed against the group with a higher type 2 MI percentage in the NSTEMI cohort. This issue needs to be further investigated.

Data from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry found higher crude mortality in patients with type 2 MI, compared with type 1 MI, that attenuated after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and treatment. 3 In contrast, we used the Third Universal Definition to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 MI and to provide additional morbidity data by comparing their influence on rehospitalizations. Gaggin et al used the Third Universal Definition to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 MI; however, they limited their study to those undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography. 4 We used ICD‐9 codes to define NSTEMI patients, regardless of whether they underwent angiography, and thus were able to evaluate the effect of type 2 MI on hospital‐level MI metrics. Smilowitz et al attempted to distinguish type 2 MI using the Third Universal Definition; however, their study was limited to a comparison between type 2 MI and myocardial injury. 5 In a recently published study, Neumann et al enrolled 1548 patients (188 with type 1 MI and 99 with type 2 MI) who presented with suspected MI and used the Third Universal Definition to distinguish type 1 from type 2 MI. 6 In contrast to our study, the investigators found no mortality difference between type 1 and type 2 MI, likely because their analysis was limited to patients with suspected MI. In addition, fewer type 1 and type 2 MI patients were included in the study. 6

### Diagnosis and prognosis of type 2 myocardial infarction using objective evidence of acute myocardial ischemia: a validation study [^10889120]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Differentiating type 2 myocardial infarction from myocardial injury can be difficult. In addition, the presence of objective evidence of myocardial ischemia may facilitate identification of high-risk type 2 myocardial infarction patients.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study of adult emergency department patients undergoing high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) measurement. Patients with ≥ 1 hs-cTnT > 99th percentile were adjudicated following the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Patients were categorized as "subjective type 2 myocardial infarction" when ischemic symptoms were the lone criteria supporting type 2 myocardial infarction, or "objective type 2 myocardial infarction" when there was ≥ 1 objective clinical feature (electrocardiography, imaging, angiography) of acute myocardial ischemia. The primary outcome was mortality.

Results

A total of 857 patients were included, among which 55 (6.4%) were classified as subjective type 2 myocardial infarction, 36 (4.2%) as objective type 2 myocardial infarction, and 702 (82%) as myocardial injury. Those with objective type 2 myocardial infarction had a higher risk of mortality during the index presentation (17% vs 1.7%, P < .0001; hazard ratio 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.7–33.4) and at 2-year follow-up (47% vs 31%, P = 0.04; hazard ratio 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.14) than those with myocardial injury. Objective type 2 myocardial infarction had a higher mortality than subjective type 2 myocardial infarction at index presentation (17% vs 2.0%, P = 0.01) and at 1 (25% vs 9.1%, P = 0.04) and 3 months (31% vs 13%, P = 0.04) follow-up. There were no mortality differences between subjective type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

Conclusion

In patients diagnosed with type 2 myocardial infarction, those with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia have significantly worse outcomes compared with those with myocardial injury and subjective type 2 myocardial infarction. A more rigorous type 2 myocardial infarction definition that emphasizes these criteria may facilitate diagnosis and risk-stratification.

### Identification of clinical phenotypes in type 2 myocardial infarction: insights into characteristics, prognosis, and management strategies [^41ded028]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and Adjudication

Diagnosis of T2MI was independently assessed by 2 clinical cardiologists (D.B. and M. A.) in all patients on the basis of all clinical and instrumental data collected during the hospitalization. In case of disagreement, a third experienced cardiologist (C.P.) was consulted to reach a consensus. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia, where myocardial injury occurred due to an imbalance between oxygen supply and without evidence of acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption, were diagnosed with T2MI. Patients with elevated cTn levels but without signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia were classified as having nonischemic myocardial injury.

For all patients with a definitive diagnosis of T2MI, precipitating factors for the supply–demand mismatch were identified and treated: sepsis, severe anemia or relevant recent bleeding, tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, respiratory failure, hypertension, hypotension/shock, recent noncardiac surgery, acute kidney injury, and nonatherosclerotic coronary artery lesions such as vasospasm, embolism, myocardial bridging, or dissection. While some authors have proposed classifying patients with myocardial infarction due to reduced coronary blood flow from nonatherothrombotic causes separately, others support their inclusion within T2MI according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. In line with this latter view, and given our study objectives, such cases were included in the present analysis. For patients in whom ≥ 2 causes of T2MI were present, these were categorized as multiple contributing factors. Detailed criteria for each causative factor can be found in the Supplemental Material (Supplemental Methods).

### The new definition of myocardial infarction… [^ea1bfc84]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Clinical events at 6-month follow-up. Background The clinical implications of the recently revised criteria for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes are unknown. Methods. Patients with positive cardiac enzymes and symptoms suggestive of coronary ischemia were divided into 2 groups: group A, with elevated peak creatine kinase–MB fraction and/or new electrocardiographic changes suggestive of AMI regardless of troponin status, and group B, with normal peak creatine kinase–MB fraction but elevated troponin I level.

ACUTE MYOCARDIAL infarction is a clinical and pathological entity that has been independently defined in the past by various organizations by means of a combination of clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic criteria. 1–5 Until recently, diagnosis of AMI was based on the revised World Health Organization criteria that require 2 of the following 3 conditions for diagnosis: ischemic symptoms, ECG changes consistent with ischemia, and elevated enzyme levels, usually creatine kinase–MB.
6. Although the use of troponins to diagnose AMI has been previously proposed, 7–10 in September 2000, a joint committee of the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology published a new definition of AMI that for the first time officially included troponins. 11 According to these criteria, elevated levels of enzymes with either symptoms or ECG changes suggestive of ischemia constitute an AMI.

The inclusion of troponins was based on a large body of evidence showing that an elevated troponin level correlates with pathologically proved myocardial necrosis12 and carries poor prognosis in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. 13–21. Patients with elevated cardiac enzyme levels were stratified into 2 groups. Group A consisted of patients who would have been diagnosed as having AMI by the old criteria. These patients had an elevated peak CK-MB level and/or new ECG changes or symptoms suggestive of AMI regardless of troponin status.

### Assessment and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury [^36d9bff4]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Consensus in classification will facilitate effective research and design of therapeutic studies for these common entities across different medical facilities. In the absence of evidence for type 1 MI, we propose the default position of acute nonischemic myocardial injury for patients presenting with evidence of elevated cTn with a dynamic pattern and acute decompensated heart failure, sepsis, or postoperative state from a noncardiac procedure, and to reserve the designation of type 2 MI for those patients with acute myocardial injury and clear evidence of ischemia or notable extracardiac supply/demand mismatch (eg, significant tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hypoxemia, or anemia) or acute nonatherothrombotic coronary obstruction (eg, dissection, embolization).

Treatment

Therapeutic strategies are well established for type 1 MI; however, no compelling data exist for treatment of other myocardial injury categories. Thus, recommendations for the treatment of non–type 1 MI categories are based on the underlying diagnosis resulting in type 2 MI or nonischemic myocardial injury. Patients who have a clear rise or fall in cTn on serial testing and evidence of modest myocardial oxygen supply/demand imbalance require careful consideration of the pretest probability of type 1 MI, risks of diagnostic tests to guide the initial investigation, and risks of giving or withholding type 1 MI treatment (Figures 4 and 5). If the likelihood of type 1 MI is high (typical symptoms, dynamic ECG changes, or very high cTn concentration), and the risks of treatment are low, then antithrombotic therapies and invasive coronary imaging are prudent (Figure 5). If a culprit coronary lesion is identified, angiographic features or additional data from adjuvant intravascular imaging may identify coronary thrombosis, establishing the diagnosis of type 1 MI, or nonthrombotic coronary pathology (dissection, embolism, spasm), establishing the diagnosis of type 2 MI. If no culprit coronary lesion is identified, the presence of a clear extracardiac supply/demand mismatch would provide support for a diagnosis of type 2 MI, whereas the absence of such pathology should prompt a reevaluation for the presence of ischemia, and if ischemia is not confirmed, consideration of acute nonischemic myocardial injury (Figure 4). However, the imperfect sensitivity of invasive angiography for identifying a culprit thrombus should be taken into account.

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Type 1 and type 2 MI have different etiologies. Type 1 is characterized primarily by CAD with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion that leads to formation of an occlusive or partially occlusive thrombus, whereas the key feature of a type 2 MI is an oxygen supply‐demand imbalance, which can occur with or without an atherosclerotic component. 5 Both type 1 and type 2 MI can present as NSTEMI or STEMI, although NSTEMI is more common for both types. 16, 17, 18 Most NSTEMI pathophysiologically are consistent with type 1 MI, but the relative proportions of type 1 NSTEMI and type 2 NSTEMI vary between clinical settings. 16, 18, 19, 20, 27, 29

Prognosis, in terms of short‐ and longer‐term mortality risks following NSTEMI, has improved in recent years, with fewer deaths after 30 days and more of the deaths that do occur being attributed to non‐CV causes. 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the risk of in‐hospital and post‐discharge mortality following NSTEMI is higher in patients with type 2 NSTEMI than in those with type 1 NSTEMI. 20, 26 This is not surprising and can be explained by the sicker and older age demographic of patients with type 2 NSTEMI compared with those with type 1 NSTEMI. 20, 33, 34

### Using ticagrelor to prevent recurrent type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarctions: boon or bane? [^d0a7dc08]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This is not a criticism of the present analysis, but the concept of type 2 MIs has engendered much confusion since the publication of the original universal definition. 5 When a coauthor of the present report 4 writes in an authoritative textbook that, 7 "Estimates of the proportion of MIs that are type 2 vary widely from 3.5% to 72%, depending on the setting and approaches to diagnostic categorization", he identifies a challenge in diagnostic coding and a crisis in cardiac care.

The introduction of high‐sensitivity troponin assays has doubled the incidence of type 2 MIs, 8 which partly reflects a common practice of equating troponin elevation with the diagnosis of MI. Although myocardial injury or necrosis can lead to troponin elevation, the diagnosis of MI requires the presence of myocardial necrosis. A strict distinction between injury and necrosis is important because injury may be reversible, whereas necrosis is not. The conflation of injury and necrosis is a solecism, which arises from a breach in understanding of pathophysiological principles, leading to much confusion. The primacy of using troponin elevation for the diagnosis of MI in a heterogeneous group of conditions is analogous to stating that fever is pathognomonic for infection. Type 2 MIs are caused by too many different conditions to be clinically meaningful when lumped together. It will be important for future iterations of the universal definition to discuss whether type 2 MI is a useful clinical category that defines a coherent syndrome caused by a single pathogenetic mechanism, amenable to a uniform treatment, associated with a well‐defined prognosis or preventable by using a single therapeutic class of medications, such as platelet P2Y12 inhibitors.

Compared wtih type 2 MIs, type 4b MIs (stent thrombosis) have a more comprehensible pathogenesis, but the authors of the present analysis found that type 4b MIs (stent thrombosis) were not significantly reduced by ticagrelor (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52–1.18; P = 0.25), and events associated with sudden death (type 3), percutaneous coronary intervention (type 4a), or coronary artery bypass graft procedures (type 5) occurred with an incidence that was too low to draw conclusions. 4 Although ticagrelor produced an apparent ≈17% reduction in MI across the entire spectrum, only the reduction in type 1 MIs met the accepted definition of statistical significance, which is a reminder that translating statistical findings into everyday English can be difficult. 9

### Type 2 myocardial infarction in clinical practice [^c3dbfa27]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to assess differences in incidence, clinical features, current treatment strategies and outcome in patients with type 2 vs. type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Methods and Results

All 20138 hospitalisations in Sweden with a diagnosis of AMI registered during 2011 in the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies were classified into types 1–5 in accordance with the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) from 2007. Type 1 AMI was present in 88.5% of the cases while 7.1% were classified as type 2 AMI. Higher age, female sex, comorbidities, impaired renal function, anaemia and smaller extent of myocardial necrosis characterised patients with type 2 AMI. While normal coronary arteries were more frequently seen (42.4% vs. 7.4%), an invasive treatment was less common, and antiplatelet medications were less prescribed in patients with type 2 AMI compared with type 1 AMI. The group with type 2 AMI had significantly higher crude 1-year mortality compared with the group with type 1 AMI (24.7% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001). However, after adjustment, the HR for 1-year mortality in patients with type 2 AMI was 1.03 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.23).

Conclusions

In this real-life study, 7.1% of myocardial infarctions were classified as type 2 AMI. These patients were older, predominantly women and had more comorbidities. Invasive treatment strategies and cardioprotective medications were less used. Patients with type 2 AMI had higher crude mortality compared with type 1 patients with MI. However, after adjustment, the 1-year mortality was similar.

### Impact of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) on hospital-level MI outcomes: implications for quality and public reporting [^61e3b8eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding system does not recognize type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) as a separate entity; therefore, patients with type 2 MI continue to be categorized under the general umbrella of non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We aim to evaluate the impact of type 2 MI on hospital-level NSTEMI metrics and discuss the implications for quality and public reporting.

Methods and Results

We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 1318 patients discharged with a diagnosis of NSTEMI between July 2013 and October 2014. The Third Universal Definition was used to define type 1 and type 2 MI. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze risk of mortality and readmission. Overall, 1039 patients met NSTEMI criteria per the Third Universal Definition; of those, 264 (25.4%) had type 2 MI. Patients with type 2 MI were older, were more likely to have chronic kidney disease, and had lower peak troponin levels. Compared with type 1 MI patients, those with type 2 MI had higher inpatient mortality (17.4% versus 4.7%, P < 0.0001) and were more likely to die from noncardiovascular causes (71.7% versus 25.0%, P < 0.0001). Despite weighting for patient characteristics and discharge medications, patients with type 2 MI had higher mortality at both 30 days (risk ratio: 3.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.67–7.88) and 1 year (risk ratio: 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–2.73) after discharge. Type 2 MI was also associated with a lower 30-day cardiovascular-related readmission (risk ratio: 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–2.06).

Conclusions

NSTEMI metrics are significantly affected by type 2 MI patients. Type 2 MI patients have distinct etiologies, are managed differently, and have higher mortality compared with patients with type 1 MI. Moving forward, it may be appropriate to exclude type 2 MI data from NSTEMI quality metrics.

### Targeting investigation and treatment in Type 2 myocardial infarction: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^941d3e98]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) occurs when there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply or unmet need in myocardial oxygen demand, without evidence of atherothrombosis. These events often happen in the context of physiological stress from another acute illness. Patients with type 2 MI have significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with type 1 MI. As few as 30% of patients are alive at 5 years after diagnosis, and risk factors for both type 1 and type 2 MI are similar, with age, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, abnormal renal function, and known coronary disease independent predictors of both. Patients with type 2 MI have a six-fold increased rate of recurrent type 2 events compared to those without, suggesting a missed opportunity to address the underlying pathology.

While there are clear treatment strategies in type 1 MI which are proven to improve clinical outcomes, there are no completed randomized controlled trials to guide practice in type 2 MI. We previously hypothesized that patients with type 2 MI have a high prevalence of unrecognized coronary artery disease or left ventricular impairment (DEMAND-MI [Determining the Mechanism of Myocardial Injury and Role of Coronary Disease in Type 2 Myocardial Infarction],), and these are in part responsible for poor clinical outcomes. We found two-thirds of patients with type 2 MI had coronary artery disease and one-third had evidence of left ventricular impairment. These findings have since been validated in DEFINE-MI (Defining the Prevalence and Characteristics of Coronary Artery Disease Among Patients with Type 2 Myocardial Infarction using CT-FFR), where computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography identified coronary artery disease in 92% of patients, which was obstructive in 42% and previously unrecognized and untreated in almost all.

We hypothesize that risk assessment and targeted investigation to guide secondary prevention for coronary artery disease and/or left ventricular impairment in patients with type 2 MI will reduce future MI, heart failure hospitalization, or cardiovascular death. We intend to test this approach in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial. However, previous efforts to randomize patients with type 2 MI have been unsuccessful as the diagnosis is challenging and often made retrospectively in patients who are acutely unwell. We therefore first aimed to demonstrate in a pilot feasibility trial that patients with type 2 MI can be prospectively identified, recruited, and randomized in different health care settings to identify facilitators and barriers to recruitment and ensure acceptability of our intervention to patients and clinicians.

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^8189bc07]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) differentiates MI due to oxygen supply/demand mismatch (type 2) from MI due to plaque rupture (type 1) as well as from myocardial injuries of non-ischaemic or multifactorial nature. The purpose of this study was to investigate how often physicians agree in this classification and what factors lead to agreement or disagreement.

Methods

A total of 1328 patients diagnosed with MI at eight different Swedish hospitals 2011 were included. All patients were retrospectively reclassified into different MI or myocardial injury subtypes by two independent specially trained physicians, strictly adhering to the third universal definition of MI.

Results

Overall, there was a moderate interobserver agreement with a kappa coefficient (κ) of 0.55 in this classification. There was substantial agreement when distinguishing type 1 MI (κ: 0.61), compared with moderate agreement when distinguishing type 2 MI (κ: 0.54). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, ST elevation MI (P < 0.001), performed coronary angiography (P < 0.001) and larger changes in troponin levels (P = 0.023) independently made the physicians agree significantly more often, while they disagreed more often with symptoms of dyspnoea (P < 0.001), higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.001) and higher C reactive protein levels on admission (P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Distinguishing MI types is challenging also for trained adjudicators. Although strictly adhering to the third universal definition of MI, differentiation between type 1 MI, type 2 MI and myocardial injury only gave a moderate rate of interobserver agreement. More precise and clinically applicable criteria for the current classification, particularly for type 2 MI diagnosis, are urgently needed.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^a88fdf2a]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease

In most patients, the diagnosis of type 2 MI is made based on clinical assessment alone and confirmatory diagnostic testing is not undertaken. However, there are undoubtedly patients in whom it is not possible to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 MI without coronary imaging. Whilst the Universal Definition does not mandate coronary imaging, even in patients with type 1 MI, if there is clinical ambiguity as to whether atherothrombosis has occurred, invasive coronary angiography should be performed. This may identify plaque rupture, erosion, atherothrombosis, embolism, vasospasm, dissection, stable coronary artery disease, or if unclear, may provide the opportunity for further evaluation with optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

In the DEMAND-MI (DEtermining the Mechanism of myocardial injury AND role of coronary disease in type 2 Myocardial Infarction) prospective observational cohort study, consecutive patients with myocardial injury were screened to identify those with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 MI according to the Universal Definition. Patients had invasive angiography with intravascular plaque imaging where available, or computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or echocardiography. In 1 in 20 patients, coronary imaging demonstrated the clinical diagnosis of type 2 MI was incorrect, with angiography identifying evidence of plaque rupture or thrombosis (type 1 or 4b MI). In others, cardiac imaging identified a clear alternative pathology including Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, with immediate implications for further management. Similar findings have been observed in a retrospective case review of patients with type 2 MI. Of 27% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 MI who underwent invasive coronary angiography, evidence of plaque rupture was demonstrated in one in three. This is likely to be an overestimate of the true rates of misclassification as unlike in the DEMAND-MI study, patients were selected for coronary angiography on the basis of clinical assessment, and it is likely the pre-test probability of coronary disease was higher.

### Application of the universal definition of myocardial infarction in clinical practice in scotland and Sweden [^6a6ee342]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Whether the diagnostic classifications proposed by the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) to identify type 1 MI due to atherothrombosis and type 2 MI due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance have been applied consistently in clinical practice is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the application of the universal definition of MI in consecutive patients with possible MI across 2 health care systems.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data from 2 prospective cohorts enrolling consecutive patients with possible MI in Scotland (2013–2016) and Sweden (2011–2014) to assess accuracy of clinical diagnosis of MI recorded in hospital records for patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 MI. Data were analyzed from August 2022 to February 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of MI recorded in the hospital records who had type 1 or type 2 MI, adjudicated by an independent panel according to the universal definition. Characteristics and risk of subsequent MI or cardiovascular death at 1 year were compared.

Results

A total of 50 356 patients were assessed. The cohort from Scotland included 28 783 (15 562 men [54%]; mean [SD] age, 60 [17] years), and the cohort from Sweden included 21 573 (11 110 men [51%]; mean [SD] age, 56 [17] years) patients. In Scotland, a clinical diagnosis of MI was recorded in 2506 of 3187 patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 MI (79%) and 122 of 716 patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 2 MI (17%). Similar findings were observed in Sweden, with 970 of 1111 patients with adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 MI (87%) and 57 of 251 patients with adjudicated diagnosis of type 2 MI (23%) receiving a clinical diagnosis of MI. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 MI without a clinical diagnosis were more likely to be women (eg, 336 women [49%] vs 909 women [36%] in Scotland; P < .001) and older (mean [SD] age, 71 [14] v 67 [14] years in Scotland, P < .001) and, when adjusting for competing risk from noncardiovascular death, were at similar or increased risk of subsequent MI or cardiovascular death compared with patients with a clinical diagnosis of MI (eg, 29% vs 18% in Scotland; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, the universal definition of MI was not consistently applied in clinical practice, with a minority of patients with type 2 MI identified, and type 1 MI underrecognized in women and older persons, suggesting uncertainty remains regarding the diagnostic criteria or value of the classification.

### Application of the universal definition of myocardial infarction in clinical practice in scotland and Sweden [^e8d569b6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our findings raise another more fundamental question about the value of a diagnosis of type 2 MI in practice. The classification of any disease should inform the patient of their prognosis and guide the approach to treatment. Currently we lack evidence-based recommendations for management and treatment of patients with type 2 MI. While there is little doubt that patients with type 2 MI are at risk of major cardiovascular events, until there are well-defined management and treatment implications for patients with this condition, it is likely that clinicians will prioritize management of the primary presenting condition and be less likely to recognize type 2 MI in practice.

In Scotland, patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for type 1 MI but not classified as having MI in practice were more likely to be women or to be older. However, these observed differences were not independent of differences in other clinical features, suggesting that the presence of comorbidity or magnitude of troponin increase is more likely to influence clinical diagnosis than age and sex per se. Our observations are consistent with previous work demonstrating sex- and age-associated differences in diagnosis of MI, and underline the need to increase awareness to prevent inequalities in care.

Misclassified patients with type 1 and type 2 MI underwent fewer investigations and were less likely to receive preventative therapies. The risk of future MI or cardiovascular death was higher or as high in patients with type 1 MI who did not receive a diagnosis of MI in practice. While we observed that patients with type 1 MI who were not diagnosed with MI in practice in Scotland remained at higher risk after adjustment for risk factors, we did not observe this in Sweden. This may be a consequence of the reliability of the primary outcome measure between 2 cohorts. All subsequent events where patients reattended with evidence of myocardial injury were adjudicated in Scotland, while we relied on ICD-10 coding to identify events in Sweden. Variation could also be due to differences in the troponin assay, diagnostic pathway, application of sex-specific criteria or the use of cardiac investigations. In contrast, we observed that patients with type 2 MI who did not receive a clinical diagnosis of MI were at lower risk of future events than those recognized in practice in both countries. It appears that clinicians are more likely to use the term MI in the setting of myocardial oxygen supply demand mismatch if they recognize the patient to be at particularly high risk of future cardiovascular events.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^3359cc84]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

Methods

We identified consecutive patients (n = 2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥ 0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.

Results

The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).

Conclusions

Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.

### Risk factors for type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction [^c3b21d58]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Whilst the risk factors for type 1 myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis are established, our understanding of the factors that predispose to type 2 myocardial infarction during acute illness is still emerging. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the risk factors for type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

We conducted a secondary analysis of a multi-centre randomized trial population of 48 282 consecutive patients attending hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction during the index presentation and all subsequent reattendances was adjudicated according to the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of future type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction during a 1-year follow-up period. Within 1 year, 1331 patients had a subsequent myocardial infarction, with 924 and 407 adjudicated as type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, respectively. Risk factors for type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction were similar, with age, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, abnormal renal function, and known coronary disease predictors for both (P < 0.05 for all). Whilst women accounted for a greater proportion of patients with type 2 as compared to type 1 myocardial infarction, after adjustment for other risk factors, sex was not a predictor of type 2 myocardial events [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–1.01]. The strongest predictor of type 2 myocardial infarction was a prior history of type 2 events (aHR 6.18, 95% CI 4.70–8.12).

Conclusions

Risk factors for coronary disease that are associated with type 1 myocardial infarction are also important predictors of type 2 events during acute illness. Treatment of these risk factors may reduce future risk of both type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction.
