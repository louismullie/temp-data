## Question

Rate of chronic use metformin patients with dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the rate of dementia among chronic metformin users with type 2 diabetes and how to interpret that rate in context of the evidence base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "chronic metformin use" is defined across studies. Then, I should extract incidence rates or hazard ratios from high-quality cohorts and meta-analyses. Next, I will reconcile conflicting findings and consider age, duration, and comparator effects. After that, I should translate relative effects into absolute risk estimates. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful bottom line and note key limitations and modifiers, including B12 considerations and competing risks like mortality [^114cBRJN] [^116khZHp].

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "chronic metformin use" in the literature; most large observational studies define it as continuous use for at least 2 to 5 years, with several analyses showing stronger associations with longer durations, often beyond 5 years, and some dose–intensity metrics using defined daily doses to capture cumulative exposure, which I should keep in mind when comparing across cohorts [^111cutHd] [^114aV4SW] [^113wHyjd].

> Now, I should extract concrete incidence data where available; in a large US veteran cohort of adults aged 60 and older with type 2 diabetes, all-cause dementia incidence was 8.2 per 1,000 person-years overall, with metformin monotherapy users at 7.7 per 1,000 person-years versus sulfonylurea users at 17.7 per 1,000 person-years, suggesting a markedly lower crude rate with metformin, though I need to remember this is unadjusted and could reflect confounding by patient characteristics and treatment selection [^115iogMj] [^113wHyjd].

> Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness signals; multiple new-user, active-comparator cohorts show metformin is associated with lower dementia risk than sulfonylureas, with adjusted hazard ratios around 0.80 to 0.89 in US and UK datasets, and a Nature Communications target-trial emulation across US and UK EHRs reported consistent reductions in dementia hazard for metformin versus sulfonylureas, reinforcing a protective association beyond glycemic changes alone [^111CcwwJ] [^117R34dn] [^116khZHp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also review meta-analytic estimates and their heterogeneity, because pooling across dissimilar designs can obscure true effects, and indeed a 2025 meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies found a modest reduction in all-cause dementia with metformin versus nonusers (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65–0.91) but with very high heterogeneity (I² = 98.9%), while another 2025 meta-analysis pooling 31 studies reported no significant difference overall (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79–1.13), highlighting how design, comparator, and adjustment choices drive results [^1127jrfY] [^113P752b].

> I need to check for null or conflicting findings in specific populations; a 2024 Canadian cohort of adults aged 66 and older with new diabetes found no association between early metformin initiation and incident dementia versus delayed or no pharmacotherapy (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96–1.15), and several studies suggest attenuation of benefit in adults aged 75–80 and older, which could reflect competing mortality, diagnostic detection differences, or diminished neurobiologic impact in advanced age [^114JaXur] [^112ySwPg] [^117R34dn].

> Let me consider duration and dose; longer-term metformin use appears to confer greater risk reduction, with UK CPRD analyses showing stronger protective associations beyond 5 years and a Taiwanese elderly cohort demonstrating a clear dose–response by cumulative defined daily dose, where the highest quartile of exposure had an adjusted HR around 0.15 versus never users, although I should confirm that such dramatic estimates may reflect residual confounding or healthy-user effects despite adjustment attempts [^111cutHd] [^114aV4SW].

> Next, I should review cessation data as a negative-exposure control; terminating metformin for reasons unrelated to kidney dysfunction was associated with a 21% higher dementia incidence versus continued use in a large Kaiser Permanente cohort, and mediation analyses suggested this was not explained by HbA1c or insulin changes, supporting a direct or disease-modifying effect rather than purely glycemic mediation, which strengthens causal inference though it remains observational [^115pfZ34] [^112iaZfg].

> I will now examine absolute risk translation; if the background dementia incidence in older adults with diabetes is roughly 8–15 per 1,000 person-years depending on age and health status, then a relative risk reduction of about 10–20% with metformin translates to an absolute risk reduction of roughly 0.8–3 per 1,000 person-years, meaning that for every 1,000 metformin-treated patients followed for a year, approximately 1–3 fewer dementia cases would be expected compared with some comparators, acknowledging heterogeneity and confidence intervals that often include the null [^115iogMj] [^1127jrfY] [^113P752b].

> But wait, what if vitamin B12 deficiency is the driver of harm in some subgroups; observational and mechanistic data suggest metformin-associated B12 deficiency can impair cognition, and adjusting for B12 attenuates some negative associations, so I should recommend periodic B12 monitoring and supplementation when low, especially in older adults on long-term therapy, to mitigate a potential harm signal that could offset neuroprotection [^114cBRJN] [^115rFjax].

> Let me synthesize; across large, well-conducted observational studies and target-trial emulations, chronic metformin use in type 2 diabetes is associated with a modest reduction in incident dementia on the order of 10–20% relative risk reduction versus sulfonylureas or mixed comparators, with crude incidence rates around 7–8 per 1,000 person-years in metformin users versus 13–18 per 1,000 person-years in sulfonylurea users, and benefits appear stronger with longer duration and in younger older adults, while some cohorts of the very old show null associations and high heterogeneity limits precision of pooled estimates [^113wHyjd] [^116tG8vv] [^1127jrfY] [^111cutHd].

> Clinically, I should confirm that metformin remains first-line for type 2 diabetes in patients at risk of dementia, ensure B12 surveillance, and consider that de-prescribing metformin for non-renal reasons may increase dementia risk, while recognizing that definitive causal inference awaits large, long-duration randomized trials currently underway; in the meantime, shared decision-making should incorporate these likely modest but biologically plausible benefits alongside individualized risk profiles and tolerability [^115pfZ34] [^116dJpJw] [^116mMRzc].

---

Metformin is associated with a **10–30% reduction in dementia risk** in patients with type 2 diabetes, with pooled hazard ratios of 0.76–0.90 across meta-analyses and large cohort studies [^1127jrfY] [^116tG8vv] [^1158Q6pj]. The effect is most consistent with **long-term use (> 5 years)** [^1158Q6pj] and in younger patients (< 75 years) [^117R34dn], whereas results are null or attenuated in older adults or those with advanced comorbidity [^117R34dn]. The benefit appears independent of glycemic control and may reflect direct neuroprotective effects [^116khZHp]; however, observational designs limit causal inference, and ongoing RCTs are needed to confirm prevention effects [^116dJpJw].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

Multiple large observational studies and meta-analyses have examined the association between metformin and dementia risk in T2D, with **generally consistent findings** of a modest reduction in incident dementia [^1127jrfY].

| **Study design** | **Sample size** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis (2018) | 14 studies | - HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.60–0.97) for dementia with metformin vs. non-use [^115swXYw] |
| UK cohort (2024) | 211,396 | - HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.79–0.94) vs. other oral agents [^116tG8vv] |
| US veteran cohort (2022) | 559,106 | - HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.73–0.88) vs. sulfonylureas [^111CcwwJ] |
| Meta-analysis (2025) | 20 cohorts | - HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.65–0.91) vs. non-use; heterogeneous [^1127jrfY] |

---

Collectively, these data suggest a **10–30% relative risk reduction** in dementia with metformin use in T2D, with the most consistent signal in younger patients and with longer-term therapy [^111cutHd].

---

## Duration and dose-response relationship

Longer metformin use is associated with greater risk reduction, with **stronger effects beyond 5 years** and possible dose-response when examining cumulative exposure [^114aV4SW]. In a large UK cohort, patients on metformin > 5 years had a **lower dementia risk** than nonusers (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84–0.92) [^1158Q6pj]. Dose–response patterns have also been observed, with higher cumulative exposure linked to greater risk reduction, though definitions vary across studies [^114aV4SW].

---

## Age-specific effects

Age modifies the association: younger patients with **T2D** (generally < 75 years) show a clearer benefit, whereas older adults or those with advanced comorbidity show attenuated or null effects [^117R34dn]. In a US veteran study, **metformin** reduced **dementia risk** in patients < 75 years (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–0.99) but not in those ≥ 75 years (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87–1.05) [^117R34dn]. Similarly, a UK cohort found benefit in patients < 80 years (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68–0.85) but not ≥ 80 years (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87–1.05) [^116tG8vv].

---

## Mechanisms of neuroprotection

Metformin's cognitive benefits likely reflect **mechanisms beyond glycemic control**, including:

- **AMPK activation**: May reduce amyloid-beta and tau pathology, and enhance autophagy [^111cutHd].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Reduces neuroinflammation, a key driver of neurodegeneration [^116nxF5f].
- **Improved insulin sensitivity**: May mitigate brain insulin resistance linked to Alzheimer's disease [^111cutHd].
- **Caloric restriction mimicry**: Potential anti-aging and neuroprotective effects via metabolic reprogramming [^115rFjax].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Despite consistent observational signals, **causal inference is limited** by:

- **Confounding by indication**: Sicker patients may be prescribed alternatives (e.g. insulin), biasing comparisons [^111TGmCd].
- **Immortal time bias**: Early periods of exposure misclassification can distort risk estimates [^114JaXur].
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Metformin-associated B12 deficiency may increase dementia risk and confound associations if unmeasured [^114cBRJN].
- **Heterogeneity**: Differences in populations, exposure definitions, and outcomes complicate meta-analytic synthesis [^115swXYw].

---

## Ongoing and future research

Randomized trials are underway to test metformin for dementia prevention in **non-diabetic populations**, including the MAP and TAME programs [^116dJpJw] [^1158m7XX]. These trials will clarify causality and define the **role of metformin in dementia prevention outside T2D** [^116dJpJw].

---

Metformin is associated with a **modest reduction in dementia risk** in patients with T2D, with the most consistent benefit in younger patients and with longer-term use. The effect appears independent of glycemic control, suggesting direct neuroprotective mechanisms, but observational designs limit causal inference. Ongoing RCTs will determine whether metformin can be repurposed for dementia prevention more broadly [^1127jrfY] [^116tG8vv] [^1158Q6pj] [^112iaZfg] [^116khZHp] [^1158m7XX].

INTRODUCTION

The global prevalence of dementia was 35.6 million people in 2010, affecting 5–7% of people aged 60 years or over. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which represents 50–75% of cases. Due to the aging population, the increasing prevalence of dementia is not expected to decline without a major breakthrough in prevention. Another disease with a troublingly high prevalence is diabetes, which affects 5–9% of the overall population, and over a quarter of those aged ≥ 65 years. Diabetes is associated with the onset of dementia and AD; a meta-analysis of 28 longitudinal studies demonstrated that people with diabetes had a 73% increased risk of developing dementia and a 56% increased risk of developing AD compared to the general population.

The mechanism behind the association between diabetes and dementia is likely to be multifactorial with evidence supporting the involvement of chronic low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular effects, increased cerebral amyloid- β peptides, hyperinsulinemia, brain insulin resistance, and the formation of advanced glycation end-products. An influential factor is elevated blood glucose, which occurs as a direct consequence of diabetes and has been shown to cause impaired episodic memory even in people who do not have diabetes.

Metformin, a biguanide and first-line antihyperglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, is an insulin sensitizer that reduces blood glucose by increasing glucose uptake into muscles while reducing liver gluconeogenesis through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The contemporary popularity of metformin as a therapy for diabetes stems from the UK prospective diabetes study (UKPDS), a multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a median follow up of over 10 years carried out in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. It showed that intensive blood glucose control with metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes-related endpoints and all-cause mortality.

However, older people have been observed to be less likely than younger people to be receiving metformin. This difference in prescribing patterns may be detrimental as metformin-use has been associated with reduced rates of dementia and improved cognitive function. The clearest mechanism for metformin to act on the development of dementia in patients with diabetes is by preventing hyperinsulinemia which contributes to the formation of amyloid- β plaques in the brain and the onset of AD. However, the glucose lowering effects of metformin also reduce the formation of advanced glycation end-products as well as inflammation and oxidative stress. These processes are exacerbated by uncontrolled diabetes and have been linked to the development of dementia.

Interestingly, the effect of metformin on inflammation occurs independent of diabetes status. Moreover, effects of metformin mimic caloric restriction through activating AMPK. Both caloric restriction and metformin have been found to slow the aging process in animals, and caloric restriction can improve memory in older people. Metformin could therefore be able to prevent or delay the development of dementia beyond its effect on diabetes control. Metformin's potential as a geroprotective agent is supported by a recent systematic review which found that metformin reduced mortality and diseases of aging (cardiovascular disease and cancer) independently of its effect on diabetes control and in comparison to patients who did not have diabetes.

Conversely, some evidence suggests that metformin could damage cognitive health. A cell culture model found that it increased the formation of amyloid- β, while one observational study found that its use was associated with an increased rate of AD and another found metformin lowered cognitive function. The latter study suggested that this effect could be due to vitamin B 12 deficiency, potentiated by metformin, which causes cognitive impairment.

The unresolved question as to whether treatment with metformin safeguards or harms cognitive health in older people impedes clinical practice in this area. Therefore, this systematic review aims to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on the effect of metformin on the risk, progression and severity of AD and any other forms of dementia, as well as its effect on measures of cognitive ability or impairment.

METHODS

This systematic review was carried according to an a priori registered protocol.

Inclusion criteria

Eligibility criteria for study inclusion were as follows: Population: Any study on human participants was eligible for inclusion. Although the majority of studies were on older people with diabetes, that was not a criterion for inclusion. Exposure: Studies in which participants received metformin at any dose for any duration were included. Comparator: Any study that included a control group in which participants were not being treated with metformin was eligible for inclusion. This included people not receiving any therapy as well as those receiving other treatments for diabetes. Outcomes: Studies that investigated risk (or incidence), severity or progression of dementia (including subtypes of dementia such as AD or vascular dementia) as well as cognitive impairment or performance (whether investigated as a continuous measure or dichotomized using threshold values) were eligible for inclusion. Types of studies: Any controlled experimental studies or observational study designs (including cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies) were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.

Search strategy

PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo were searched for published literature while the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and OpenThesis were searched for "unpublished" data. No date restrictions were applied, however only English language articles were eligible for inclusion. Searching was carried out in May 2017 (Supplementary Material 1). Title and abstract screening was followed by the retrieval of potentially relevant full-texts which were compared to the inclusion criteria to identify eligible studies. The reference lists of included papers were reviewed for additional studies.

Assessment of methodological quality and data extraction

Critical appraisal was carried in duplicate by independent reviewers using the standardized Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal checklists for experimental, cohort, case control, and cross-sectional studies with consensus reached through discussion between reviewers. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met > 50% of quality criteria. Data was extracted using a template that included fields for study methodology, study design, inclusion criteria, data source, country, exposure, comparator, sample size/events, follow up, outcome(s), outcome data, and statistical adjustments. Attempts to contact corresponding authors by email where additional data was needed were unsuccessful: in these cases, findings have been summarized narratively.

### Incident dementia risk among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin versus alternative oral glucose-lowering therapy: an observational cohort study using UK primary healthcare records [^111dmJTZ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

4.2 million individuals are living in the UK with type 2 diabetes mellitus (hereafter referred to as 'diabetes') and prevalence is increasing due to underlying trends in physical inactivity, obesity and population aging. Diabetes is an established dementia risk factor through mechanisms including insulin resistance, chronic neuroinflammation and microvascular dysfunction. Globally, dementia already costs US$1 trillion annually and the number of individuals living with dementia in the UK is expected to increase from 850 000 individuals to 1.2 million by 2040. Low and middle-income countries are reporting rapid increases in dementia incidence consistent with their demographic transition, but high-income countries such as the UK already have a high burden of dementia and multimorbidity in line with their older population structures. There is an urgent need for dementia prevention strategies, and considering risk factor modification of diabetes is highly relevant to all socioeconomic settings.

Individuals with diabetes are 1.5–2 times more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive disorder including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Dementia risk appears to increase with duration of diabetes and poor glycemic control, but there is inconsistent evidence on whether this is modifiable by glucose-lowering therapy (GLT) such as metformin. Metformin, a biguanide in widespread global use, has been recommended as first-line treatment for diabetes by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) since 2002. Prior to this, alternative GLTs such as sulfonylureas were frequently used as first-line treatment. Traditionally, metformin's principal mechanisms were understood to be suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity via AMPK activation. However, it also exhibits pleiotropic effects including modifying the gut microbiome, immune function and inflammatory mechanisms, which could plausibly modify the pathogenesis of dementia in diabetes.

The association between metformin therapy and incident dementia in patients with diabetes is contested: two recent meta-analyses found evidence that metformin therapy was associated with lower incident dementia risk, but a third reported a pooled null effect. Many of the included studies were prone to bias due to the use of cross-sectional designs and lack of active comparators. Subsequent to these meta-analyses, Newby et al estimated a 20% lower incident dementia risk associated with metformin use using an active comparator new user design in US health records. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between metformin therapy and incident all-cause dementia and MCI using primary care records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

### Heterogeneous treatment effects of metformin on risk of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal observational study [^112EMAgQ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study supports a significant association between metformin use and a reduced risk of dementia in individuals with T2D. Our findings suggest that important factors, such as neuropsychiatric disorders, antidepressant use, and NSAIDs can assist in making personalized decisions regarding the use of metformin in people with T2D, particularly for those at high risk of dementia. To further validate these findings, future research should investigate a more extensive and diverse population.

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^114CaSUa]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

Metformin has been suggested as a therapeutic agent for dementia, but the relevant evidence has been partial and inconsistent.

METHODS:

We established a national cohort of 210,237 type 2 diabetes patients in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Risks of incident dementia were compared between metformin initiators and those who were not prescribed any anti-diabetes medication during follow-up.

RESULTS:

Compared with metformin initiators (n = 114,628), patients who received no anti-diabetes medication (n = 95,609) had lower HbA1c and better cardiovascular health at baseline. Both Cox regression and propensity score weighting analysis showed metformin initiators had lower risk of dementia compared to those non-users (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.88 [95% confidence interval: 0.84–0.92] and 0.90 [0.84–0.96]). Patients on long-term metformin treatment had an even lower risk of dementia.

DISCUSSION:

Metformin may act beyond its glycemic effect and reduce dementia risk to an even lower level than that of patients with milder diabetes and better health profiles.

### Association of metformin use with risk of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127jrfY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

There is ongoing debate concerning the association of metformin with the risk of dementia in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of metformin therapy on dementia in patients with T2DM.

Materials and Methods

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov website were searched until 9 April 2024. Cohort studies investigating the effects of metformin therapy compared with other antidiabetic drugs or no therapy in T2DM were included. The hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using the random effects model.

Results

Twenty cohort studies (24 individual comparisons) involving 3463100 participants were identified. A meta-analysis revealed that people with T2DM who take metformin are linked to a lower incidence of all-cause dementia compared to non-user (n = 17, HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.65–0.91, p = 0.002, I² = 98.9%) and sulfonylureas (n = 5, HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.90, p < 0.001, I² = 9.7%), but not to thiazolidinedione (n = 2, HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.08–3.41, p = 0.503, I² = 92.7%). Additionally, metformin showed favourable effects in non-specified T2DM (n = 19, HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64–0.89), but not in newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 5, HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.81–1.27).

Conclusion

Metformin might correlate with a lower dementia incidence in people with T2DM. However, it is crucial to interpret these results with caution considering the high heterogeneity.

### Metformin cessation and dementia incidence [^115pfZ34]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of metformin users, terminating metformin treatment was associated with increased dementia incidence, corroborating prior observational research that initiating metformin was associated with reduced risk of dementia. This finding has important implications for the clinical management of diabetes.

### Long-term metformin use for Alzheimer's disease prevention? [^116mMRzc]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1

In Alzheimer's & Dementia, Zheng and colleagues published results from a UK‐based cohort study of 210,237 participants, suggesting that metformin use reduced dementia risk beyond the level observed in patients with milder diabetes and better health profiles.

We build on the authors' observation that longer metformin treatment duration was associated with greater dementia risk reduction, along with evidence from epidemiology, the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and metformin's availability, to propose that long‐term metformin at 500 mg/day in high‐risk individuals could serve as a preventive strategy to reduce the risk or delay the onset of AD and related dementias.

This approach is conceptually analogous to the well‐established use of statins in cardiovascular medicine, where long‐term administration in at‐risk populations has been shown to reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events. We propose that long‐term metformin use could be investigated as a repurposed drug for AD prevention.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has shown a strong metabolic and inflammatory association with dementia. The study by Zheng et al.is among a growing number of epidemiological studies reporting a protective effect of metformin on dementia risk, consistently indicating that longer metformin treatment duration is associated with greater risk reduction. Beyond epidemiological evidence, mechanistic insights also support the notion that metformin may exert neuroprotective effects through multiple pathways. These include not only its metabolic effectsbut also its role in attenuating general mechanisms of cellular aging, slowing brain aging, and modulating key AD‐related pathologies, including amyloid and tau. Furthermore, metformin at 500 mg/day is the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug worldwide, is recognized as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization as of 2023, and is available off‐patent at low cost in most countries.

### Heterogeneous treatment effects of metformin on risk of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal observational study [^114PxJ5Y]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Little is known about the heterogeneous treatment effects of metformin on dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

Participants (≥ 50 years) with T2D and normal cognition at baseline were identified from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database (2005–2021). We applied a doubly robust learning approach to estimate risk differences (RD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dementia risk between metformin use and no use in the overall population and subgroups identified through a decision tree model.

Results

Among 1393 participants, 104 developed dementia over a 4-year median follow-up. Metformin was significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia in the overall population (RD, -3.2%; 95% CI, -6.2% to -0.2%). We identified four subgroups with varied risks for dementia, defined by neuropsychiatric disorders, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antidepressant use.

Discussion

Metformin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of dementia in individuals with T2D, with significant variability among subgroups.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11747Pq6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

Where possible, odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using the inverse variance method with a random effects model from RevMan (Review Manager, [Computer program]. Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Maximally adjusted data were included in all analyses. Longitudinal data was converted to hazard ratios (HRs) using the methods described by Tierney et al. For one study that reported OR and showed that their incidence ratio was constant, OR was substituted for HR which could not otherwise be calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ 2 and I 2 tests. Analysis of publication bias was planned, but too few studies (< 10) were found per outcome. Sensitivity analyses have been performed based on control groups utilized, diagnostic criteria and to identify sources of heterogeneity.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112sHeKP]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background:

Metformin, a first line antihyperglycemic medication, is an AMPK activator and has been hypothesized to act as a geroprotective agent. Studies on its association with various classifications of age-related cognitive decline have shown mixed results with positive and negative findings.

Objective:

To synthesize the best available evidence on the association of metformin-use with risk, progression, and severity of dementia.

Method:

Eligible research investigated the effect of metformin on dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or any measure of cognitive impairment compared to any control group who were not receiving metformin. The initial search resulted in 862 citations from which 14 studies (seven cohort, four cross-sectional, two RCTs, and one case control) were included.

Results:

Meta-analysis of three studies showed that cognitive impairment was significantly less prevalent in diabetic metformin (Odds ratio = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78), while six studies showed that dementia incidence was also significantly reduced (Hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.88). Mini-Mental State Examination scores were not significantly affected by metformin-use, although both RCTs showed that metformin had a neuroprotective effect compared to placebo. Some studies found negative or neutral effects for metformin use by people with diabetes; the potential mechanism of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency is discussed.

Conclusions:

Metformin should continue to be used as a first line therapy for diabetes in patients at risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The use of metformin by individuals without diabetes for the prevention of dementia is not supported by the available evidence.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114twGRb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Meta-analysis of the incidence of dementia or Alzheimer's disease in patients with diabetes receiving metformin compared to other patients with diabetes.

Several studies reported additional longitudinal data that could not be included in the meta-analyses. Wang et al. used advanced modeling to subdivide their cohort into patients with different levels of risk for developing age related diseases including a high cancer risk class, high cardiovascular disease risk class, high frailty risk class, and a healthy class (who had low risk of developing any of these age-related diseases). The effect of metformin on dementia incidence was observed in the high frailty risk class and the healthy class (which was included in the meta-analysis due to being largest and most generalizable), but was not significant in the other two groups. Cheng et al. also compared the results of patients treated with thiazolidinedione to patients treated with metformin and found an even larger effect than was observed in comparison to sulphonylurea (which was included in the meta-analysis due to having the larger sample size and being a more common therapy). Ng et al. reported analyses where they subdivided their cohort into patients who had received metformin for 6 years or less before baseline and those who had received it for more than 6 years and found that the effect of metformin on dementia incidence was only seen in the patients with long-term use. Similarly, Hsu et al. divided their cohort into patients who had had diabetes for > 7 years, 4–7 years, and ≤ 3 years. Exclusive metformin users had a significant reduction in dementia incidence in the long-term cohort (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91, p < 0.05); however, the effect was non-significant in the second cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.08) and much reduced in those with shortest use (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.36). Finally, the case-control study investigated the risk of AD (excluding other dementias) in patients who had received 1–9, 10–29, 30–59, and ≥ 60 prescriptions for metformin compared to patients with diabetes who had not been treated with metformin. Unadjusted analyses showed significant reductions in the risk of AD for patients who received 1–9 (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94) or 30–59 (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.84) prescriptions (and non-significant effects for 10–29 and ≥ 60 prescriptions which had ORs equal to 0.93 and 1.06, respectively) while adjusted analyses showed significant increases in risk of AD for 10–29 (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.09) and ≥ 60 prescriptions (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.60) with non-significant effects for 1–9 and 30–59 prescriptions (OR = 1.08 and 0.99, respectively).

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rbPim]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin, a first line antihyperglycemic medication, is an AMPK activator and has been hypothesized to act as a geroprotective agent. Studies on its association with various classifications of age-related cognitive decline have shown mixed results with positive and negative findings.

Objective

To synthesize the best available evidence on the association of metformin-use with risk, progression, and severity of dementia.

Method

Eligible research investigated the effect of metformin on dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or any measure of cognitive impairment compared to any control group who were not receiving metformin. The initial search resulted in 862 citations from which 14 studies (seven cohort, four cross-sectional, two RCTs, and one case control) were included.

Results

Meta-analysis of three studies showed that cognitive impairment was significantly less prevalent in diabetic metformin (Odds ratio = 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78), while six studies showed that dementia incidence was also significantly reduced (Hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.88). Mini-Mental State Examination scores were not significantly affected by metformin-use, although both RCTs showed that metformin had a neuroprotective effect compared to placebo. Some studies found negative or neutral effects for metformin use by people with diabetes; the potential mechanism of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency is discussed.

Conclusions

Metformin should continue to be used as a first line therapy for diabetes in patients at risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The use of metformin by individuals without diabetes for the prevention of dementia is not supported by the available evidence.

### Comparative effect of metformin versus sulfonylureas with dementia and Parkinson's disease risk in US patients over 50 with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113wHyjd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Characteristics of baseline population

From the study population, the mean age (± SD) was 66.4 ± 8.2 years (metformin users mean age 65.7 ± 7.83 and sulfonylureas mean age 71.0 ± 8.71), 48% male, 83% Caucasian with a mean HbA1c of 6.79% ± 0.76%. In the sample population, 3207 patients developed any dementia (2256 among metformin and 951 sulfonylurea users) and 760 patients developed PD (625 among metformin and 135 sulfonylurea users). All-cause dementia rates were 7.77 and 17.73 per 1000 person-years in metformin and sulfonylurea users, respectively. PD rates were 2.13 and 2.45 per 1000 person-years in metformin and sulfonylurea users, respectively. Metformin users were younger, have better renal function, fewer comorbidities, and take different associated medications (NSAIDs, diuretics and glucocorticoids) compared with sulfonylurea users (table 1). For BMI, 26% of observations were missing (24% for metformin users and 33% for sulfonylurea users) and for eGFR 0.1% of observations were missing (0.08% for metformin users and 0.38% for sulfonylurea users).

After IPTW, all variables were balanced between the two groups for the main analysis (SMD < 0.1) (figure 2). For subanalyses (age, race, renal function, and HbA1c), all variables were balanced apart from the race subanalysis where the variable 'HbA1c < 7%' was unbalanced for the race group 'unknown/other' (online supplemental figures S1–S11).

### Dementia diagnosis is associated with changes in antidiabetic drug prescription: an open-cohort study of ∼ 130, 000 Swedish subjects over 14 years [^115N5aKL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The inverse relationship in dispensation rates suggests a link between the increase in insulin and decrease in metformin and sulfonylurea, independently of dementia or renal status. Importantly, we also observed 26% lower likelihood of sulfonylurea dispensation as add-on therapy to metformin. Lu and colleagues reported corroborating lower utilization of both sulfonylurea and metformin in US dementia patients; however, the authors excluded patients with end-stage renal disease. Chronic renal failure is one of the main contraindications for metformin use, but the minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate for metformin therapy has been revised to at least 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. However, the end of follow-up in our study was in 2018, therefore we could not have caught this revision and it is likely that metformin dispensation has since increased. Interestingly, metformin has previously been associated with cognitive benefit, and was superior in this regard to sulfonylurea and insulin in the recent studies.

Decreasing dispensations of sulfonylureas and lower probability of add-on to metformin likely reflect sulfonylureas' higher propensity towards hypoglycemia, and shorter-acting agents are preferred in the elderly. Overall, sulfonylurea add-on therapy might constitute too big of a risk, and deintensification should be considered especially in advanced ages.

The peak of TZD use occurred in the earliest years of observation (years 2005–2007) which reflects the time period when the findings on TZD's unfavorable cardiovascular profile became known. Afterwards, the prescription rates declined similarly in both dementia and dementia-free cohorts and very few new dispensations occurred. Despite long clinical experience with TZD, their risk-benefit ratio seems too high for broader use in elderly patients with dementia.

Importantly, patients with dementia had significantly lower overall dispensation rates of DPP-4i and GLP-1a as well as lower likelihood of being prescribed these medications after dementia diagnosis in all naïve subjects as well as in metformin users. Moreover, the slower initiation of incretin therapy in dementia patients compared to dementia-free controls was observed even in the matched analyses. We believe this finding testifies to a more conservative management of diabetes in Swedish dementia patients, a form of national approach to diabetes care when cognitive dysfunction is present.

### Metformin cessation and dementia incidence [^114JxsEu]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study found that terminating metformin treatment was associated with increased dementia incidence in a diverse cohort of older adults. Most of this association was not accounted for by increases in HbA 1c levels or insulin use 1 or 5 years after cessation of treatment with metformin.

This work has several important implications. First, findings corroborate the largely consistent evidence from other observational studies showing an association between metformin use and lower dementia incidence. A major advantage of our design was that it may have reduced potential for confounding by indication or cohort effects present in initiation designs given that all individuals in our analyses were metformin users. In addition, the very large sample size and long follow-up provided fairly precise estimates. Previously meta-analyzed resultsindicated that people with diabetes who receive metformin had 0.76 times the hazard of Alzheimer disease compared with people with diabetes not receiving metformin (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97). This meta-analyzed result included control groups of patients with diabetes receiving sulphonylurea therapy or no drug therapy or any patients with diabetes not receiving metformin. A prior study, found an HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.52–1.28) comparing metformin with sulphonylurea therapy. Thus, our result of 0.83 times the hazard of dementia with routine use compared with early termination (reciprocal of the fully adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76–0.90) is consistent with the literature on metformin treatment and dementia incidence.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115swXYw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
Meta-analysis of the likelihood of having cognitive impairment in patients with diabetes receiving metformin compared to other patients with diabetes.

Six cohort studies investigated the effect of metformin on the longitudinal incidence of dementia compared to patients with diabetes not taking metformin. There was methodological heterogeneity due to the differences in the control groups utilized which included patients with diabetes receiving sulphonylurea, no drug therapy, or any patients with diabetes not receiving metformin (Table 1). Periods of follow-up also differed; however, the use of incidence ratios should limit the impact of this source of variation. All studies had the clinical diagnosis of dementia or AD as their outcome except Ng et al. who utilized MMSE score. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that patients with diabetes taking metformin had decreased risk of developing dementia or AD compared to other patients with diabetes (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; p = 0.03, Fig. 3). When meta-analysis was restricted to studies which had adjusted their results for the effect of metformin diabetes management, metformin-use still resulted in a significant reduction in incidence of dementia (HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.91; p = 0.02).

### Incident dementia risk among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin versus alternative oral glucose-lowering therapy: an observational cohort study using UK primary healthcare records [^112ySwPg]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Nevertheless, a recent Mendelian randomisation study, which by design eliminates reverse causation and most confounding, showed that genetically proxied metformin use was associated with a small reduction in Alzheimer's disease risk. In that study, mitochondrial function and the NDUFA2 gene were proposed as dementia protection mechanisms. Metformin has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects irrespective of diabetes status and it reduces accumulation of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in in vitro models.

We found that metformin exposure was only associated with lower incident dementia risk for individuals under 80 years old. This is consistent with three previous US retrospective cohort studies and may be because older individuals accumulate multiple other risk factors for dementia, meaning that any potential benefit of metformin becomes increasingly negligible with age. Similarly, work on the predictive modeling of dementia risk factors has found that models with proven efficacy in younger groups are inaccurate in advanced old age. We observed that dementia rates increased in successive calendar periods (even when conditioning on age). This is consistent with sustained improvements in the routine ascertainment of dementia since 1990 in the UK, but there is still evidence of a dementia diagnosis gap.

3.1 Additional analyses

We performed additional analyses to discern the impact of metformin monotherapy and metformin combination therapy on the risk of dementia (Table S2 in supporting information). Metformin monotherapy was significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of dementia compared to no use (RD, −3.9%; 95% CI, −7.3% to −0.7%), while metformin combination therapy was marginally associated with a decreased risk (RD, −3.1%; 95% CI, −6.5% to 0.4%). However, we observed no significant difference between metformin monotherapy and metformin combination therapy regarding the risk of dementia (RD, −0.1%; 95% CI, −1.9% to 1.6%), further reinforcing the evidence for metformin's potential in reducing the risk of dementia. In the sensitivity analyses, the estimated RDs in the overall cohort were consistent with the primary analysis, with an RD of −3.5% (95% CI, −6.6% to −0.3%) and −2.9% (95% CI, −5.8% to −0.03%) for those aged ≥ 60 years and using a valid doubly robust estimation method, respectively.

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^1158Q6pj]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin has been suggested as a therapeutic agent for dementia, but the relevant evidence has been partial and inconsistent.

Methods

We established a national cohort of 210,237 type 2 diabetes patients in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Risks of incident dementia were compared between metformin initiators and those who were not prescribed any anti-diabetes medication during follow-up.

Results

Compared with metformin initiators (n = 114,628), patients who received no anti-diabetes medication (n = 95,609) had lower HbA1c and better cardiovascular health at baseline. Both Cox regression and propensity score weighting analysis showed metformin initiators had lower risk of dementia compared to those non-users (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.88 [95% confidence interval: 0.84–0.92] and 0.90 [0.84–0.96]). Patients on long-term metformin treatment had an even lower risk of dementia.

Discussion

Metformin may act beyond its glycemic effect and reduce dementia risk to an even lower level than that of patients with milder diabetes and better health profiles.

Highlights

Metformin initiators had a significantly lower risk of dementia compared with patients not receiving anti-diabetes medication. Compared with metformin initiators, diabetes patients not receiving pharmacological treatment had better glycemic profiles at baseline and during follow-up. Patients on long-term metformin treatment had an even lower risk of subsequent dementia incidence. Metformin may act beyond its effect on hyperglycemia and has the potential of being repurposed for dementia prevention.

### Heterogeneous treatment effects of metformin on risk of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal observational study [^1133oCKr]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD‐related dementias (ADRD) are characterized by a decline in cognitive functionand affect ≈ 55 million individuals worldwide. In the United States, ≈ 6.5 million older adults had a diagnosis of dementia in 2020, and the number is predicted to increase to 14 million by 2060. Dementia was the sixth leading cause of death among adult Americans, with estimated annual costs of $305 billion in 2020. However, no effective interventions have been found to improve function in a clinically meaningful way; thus, finding such therapeutic strategies is important and urgently needed.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a well‐known risk factor for dementia. Several hypothesized mechanisms by which diabetes increases dementia risk include brain insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular changes, and impaired amyloid metabolism. Thus, glucose‐lowering drugs (GLDs) might be potential treatments for dementia. Metformin is the most commonly used GLD as the first‐line treatment for T2D. Numerous population studies have evaluated the association between metformin and the risk of dementia, yet they produce conflicting results. While some studies found a lower risk of dementia associated with metformin, not all studies supported this finding. A recent meta‐analysis of 14 population‐based cohort studies showed that metformin was significantly associated with a reduced risk of all‐cause dementia, but with statistically significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.001), indicating that certain individuals or subgroups may experience varying treatment effects from metformin. Although some studies have conducted subgroup analyses, such conventional "one‐variable‐at‐a‐time" subgroup analysis is susceptible to erroneous inferences and has limited ability to address intricate interactions among multiple patient characteristics that are believed to influence a patient's response to the treatment.

### Metformin cessation and dementia incidence [^115Cv41J]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes occurs among an increasing fraction of people aged older than 65 years in the US, and diabetes is associated with increased dementia risk. Approved in 1995 in the US, metformin (dimethylbiguanide) has been the preferred first-line agent for type 2 diabetes since 2006. Metformin treatment reduces incidence of diabetes complications and diabetes-related and all-cause mortality. Metformin may also reduce dementia risk by improved glucose control or by mechanisms unrelated to diabetes, including activation of adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase, which may mimic starvation, or by inhibition of aromatase, which may be associated with lower blood pressure.

Previous randomized clinical trials found that metformin treatment improved cognition and lowered dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, but this may reflect cognitive benefits of glucose lowering independent of the agent used. In contrast, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes (ACCORD-MIND) randomized clinical trial, found no evidence of cognitive benefit for an intensive glucose-control strategy (glycated hemoglobin A 1c [HbA 1c] target level: < 6.0%), which increased exposure to antidiabetes drugs, including metformin, compared with an HbA 1c target level of 7.0% to 7.9%. Prior observational studies found that initiating metformin treatment was associated with a benefit in dementia risk, including a benefit compared with other antidiabetes drugs. However, confounding by diabetes severity and duration may bias associations. Additionally, increasing metformin use, and decreasing age-specific dementia incidence in the UScomplicate observational comparisons between metformin and other agents. Furthermore, some prior studies compared prevalent users with nonusers, which can lead to immortal person-time and confounding biases.

Limitations

This study also has several limitations. First, dementia diagnosis was obtained based on medical records, and recording of such diagnoses likely follows onset of pathology. Second, this was a complete case analysis; thus, the main analysis and mediation samples differed in size, although estimates for total effect sizes were consistent in both analyses. Third, we did not evaluate numerous and relevant potential axes of heterogeneity, such as race, ethnicity, or duration of metformin use. Our reported associations are means over the distributions of the history of metformin use and thus would not be appropriate for clinicians for specific patient recommendations. Fourth, as stated previously, data on the precise reason for termination of metformin were not available. Metformin initiation is contraindicated in severe liver disease and heart failure. However, because metformin is beneficial for people with diabetes with congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, or reduced kidney function (eGFR, 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2), we did not consider these reasons for termination in routine users. It is possible that our characterization of early metformin terminators may have misclassified some individuals. However, in a sensitivity analysis that examined only individuals who terminated use within the first 2 years of therapy, we had comparable results. In this analysis, we would be assuming that very early termination was less likely to be due to kidney dysfunction. Fifth, due to data limitations, we could not address every potential source of bias, such as deprescribing to improve quality of life in individuals with frailty, and we did not consider time-updated mediator outcome confounding. However, these are different confounding biases than would be present in studies of treatment initiation that indicate a comparable benefit of metformin. If censoring due to reaching age 90 years, death, or KPNC membership gap and another risk factor associated with dementia both affect treatment and outcome status, effect estimates could be biased. Early terminators were more likely to die during follow-up, so expected bias would likely be to reduce the estimated effect size in the association of early termination with dementia risk. Relatedly, to ensure privacy, all data related to time were provided with age as the time scale as opposed to calendar time. However, it is possible that calendar time was associated with non-kidney-disease–related metformin cessation. Sixth, the applicability of these results relies on the assumption that individuals experiencing significant gastrointestinal or other adverse effects were not also more likely to experience diabetes progression for other reasons. Factors such as high dietary carbohydrate consumption could be associated with adverse effect prevalence and diabetes progression. However, confounders of metformin discontinuation due to adverse effects were likely different than those for metformin initiation, and our estimates for terminating metformin were similar to estimates of initiating metformin.

INTRODUCTION

The clinical co-occurrence of diabetes mellitus (diabetes) and dementia is becoming increasingly more common as the care for chronic disorders improves and life-expectancy rises. It is currently estimated that approximately every 6th patient diagnosed with dementia is also living with diabetes.

Relationship between dementia and diabetes is complex, as diabetes contributes to cognitive decline and good neurocognitive performance is an essential prerequisite for successful self-management of diabetes. However, it is not clear how diabetes management should be adapted when dementia is present. Avoiding hypoglycemia is one of the main therapeutic goals, as cognitive impairment increases hypoglycemia risk and severe hypoglycemia predisposes patients to worse cognitive performance, in a vicious circle. On the other hand, increases in HbA1c levels are significantly associated with worse cognitive functioning; however, evidence points against stringent adherence to glycemic targets as it does not seem to provide cognitive benefit in advanced ages. As a consequence, regime simplification, individualization, and relaxed glycemic targets dominate in the current guidelines for diabetes management in the cognitively impaired older patients.

Importantly, the current spectrum of pharmacological treatments of diabetes (type 2 diabetes specifically) does allow for significant adaptations based on the needs of individual patients. Metformin is still the primary option for most, with advanced kidney disease and liver failure posing the main prescription caveats. In addition, metformin's neurocognitive effects have not yet been determined.

Among sulfonylureas, shorter-acting drugs should be preferred due to higher propensity to hypoglycemia, and possibly worse cognitive outcomes in comparison to metformin. Thiazolidinedione (TZD) prescription should be closely monitored due to known risk of congestive heart failure and fractures.

Within incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) provide the easier regimen, as injections of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1a) require unimpaired visuo-motor coordination. The CARMELINA trial failed to show cognitive improvements in DPP-4i users; however, GLP-1a animal models promise modulation of both amyloid and tau pathologies and possibly dual Alzheimer's-diabetes treatment. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) exhibit multiple benefits additional to glycemic control; on the other hand, volume depletion might be a clinical concern in the older patients.

### Metformin cessation and dementia incidence [^112n3cmV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Individuals may terminate metformin for several reasons. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are more common with metformin than with other antidiabetes agents, leading to lower adherenceand replacement with other antidiabetes agents in one-fifth of early users. Metformin may also be terminated because it is associated with increased mortality in people with kidney dysfunction, a common type 2 diabetes complication. Current recommendations are to discontinue metformin when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreases to less than 30 or 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 of height, depending on benefits and risks of continued use. Examining metformin cessation may mitigate confounding by disease severity and cohort effects associated with studies of metformin initiation.

We evaluated the association between termination of metformin treatment for reasons unrelated to kidney dysfunction and dementia incidence using an emulated trial design. We compared individuals in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system who terminated metformin without abnormal kidney function markers with individuals who continued metformin therapy or stopped after abnormal kidney function. We investigated whether metformin was associated with reduced risk of dementia and whether this association was mediated predominantly by mechanisms other than improved glucose control or insulin use.

Research design and methods

Study design and setting

A new user active comparator study was carried out to determine the comparative effect of metformin versus sulfonylurea users on dementia risk over a 5-year follow-up based on an intention-to-treat approach. A new user study design includes new users of treatments or diagnosis and excludes prevalent users which can bias results due to baseline covariates being influenced by treatment or disease. The active comparator design refers to a study that compares the effect of the drug of interest with another active drug used in clinical practice. We used OPTUM EHR data set containing data from primary care and secondary care facilities from over 100 million patients across the US general population. We had access to patient data from 1 January 2006 to 1 December 2018 for patients aged 40 years or older. Patient data were mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model v5.3.1.

Participants

We included patients who were 50 years or older with a diagnosis of diabetes and at least 1 year of observational data between 2006 and 2018. Included patients were required to have at least 1 year of observation in the database prior to first prescription of metformin or sulfonylureas (baseline) and be free of any diagnosis of dementia, MCI, or PD prior to their first prescription. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome were excluded due to off-label use of metformin. Since renal function can drive choice of antidiabetic prescription, included patients were required to have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measure (or related clinical diagnosis) and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement 1 year before metformin or sulfonylurea initiation. Those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) levels 4 and 5 as well as HbA1c level > 9% were excluded as this is not indicative of metformin new users. Only patients who remained on monotherapy of either metformin or sulfonylureas for 2 years following first prescription were included in this study. Follow-up began after this 2-year period and lasted until the end of the 5 years, death, or dementia/PD diagnosis, whichever occurred first. During follow-up, participants could take additional diabetes medications, but those who switched between metformin and sulfonylureas were excluded.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1171wKQy]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

A sensitivity analysis found that when data was adjusted for the level of diabetes control achieved the effect of metformin on dementia incidence remained significant. This analytic strategy has been used in the past to investigate whether geroprotective effects of metformin therapy may be due to reasons other than its effect on glycemic control and therefore potentially applicable to the non-diabetic population. However, in the meta-analysis where the incidence of dementia in patients with diabetes taking metformin was compared to individuals who did not have diabetes the result was a non-significant increase (Fig. 4). This finding does not rule out the possibility that metformin had a positive effect, but that it was masked by the detrimental influence of diabetes. One of the RCTs, Luchsinger et al. included non-diabetic older people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and found that over a year metformin produced a significant improvement in one measure of cognitive performance (Selective Reminding Task). However, there was no significant difference in several others. Additionally, the study cohort all had BMIs ≥ 25, greatly increasing the likelihood that the effect produced by metformin was due to its effects on insulin resistance. Overall, the findings of this review provide only very weak support for the hypothesis that metformin could preserve cognitive health in people who do not have diabetes.

The other RCT, Guo et al. also investigated the effect of metformin on measures of cognitive performance but in patients with diabetes (and depression) compared to patients who were not using any diabetes medication. It found that metformin-use significantly improved all measures of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised. This finding that cognitive performance improved should be given greater weight than the meta-analysis of unadjusted observational data that found no significant effect of metformin on MMSE. Interestingly, its follow up period was just 24 weeks, whereas the two studies that examined length of metformin-use found that its neuroprotective effects appeared to emerge with longer-term use (8 and 6 years). Luchsinger et al. performed regression analyses which showed that the effects of metformin were greatest in younger patients. These findings suggest that metformin therapy is likely to be most effective when its use is begun early, although it can still be of benefit if begun after the onset of cognitive decline. This makes it most likely that metformin's main form of action is to reduce damage over time rather than acting directly on the brain as a nootropic. This could be confirmed in future research by comparing the cognitive function of older people taking metformin to those who had withdrawn for a short period.

4 | DISCUSSION

This study is one of the largest cohort studies to investigate the association between metformin usage and risk of incident dementia in T2D patients. We applied both conventional Cox regression and propensity score methodologies to address confounding bias, and also used four different models to deal with missing values in covariates. Our results consistently indicated that initial and long-term treatment with metformin was robustly associated with lower risk of dementia compared with no anti-diabetes medication, among T2D patients.

Our results are in line with a previous cohort study in 25,393 T2D patients showing that, compared to patients with no pharmaceutical treatment during follow-up, those treated with metformin monotherapy and combination therapy of metformin and sulfonylureas had lower risks of dementia incidence (HR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.58–0.98] and 0.65 [95% CI: 0.56–0.74], respectively). In contrast, two cohort studies comparing metformin initiators with non-metformin initiatorsor metformin users with non-metformin usersdid not find any significant differences in dementia risk between groups, possibly due to the heterogeneous definitions of exposure and reference groups and/or insufficient sample size or length of follow-up.

### Metformin-based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapy and risk of dementia in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^1121uTHx]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

The prevalence of dementia increases significantly with age. According to the World Alzheimer Report 2023, > 55 million people globally were living with dementia in 2019, and this number is projected to rise to 139 million by 2050. 1 In Taiwan, by 2018, > 14% of the population was aged > 65 years, with ≈ 7.86% of this group having dementia. 2 The number of individuals with dementia in Taiwan is expected to exceed 800,000 by 2051.

Dementia encompasses a range of neurodegenerative and non‐neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form, mainly characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration. Other causes of dementia include cerebrovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, drug toxicity, liver and kidney dysfunction, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. Notably, compared to the general population, patients with DM have a 1.5 to 2.5 times higher risk of developing dementia.

Dementia is closely linked to the regulation of blood sugar levels. Patients with DM often experience difficulties in controlling blood sugar, resulting in episodes of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or fluctuating blood sugar levels. These conditions can potentially damage brain nerve cells, contributing to the development of dementia.,

The 2022 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) Treatment Guidelines issued by the Diabetes Association of the Republic of China stratifies patients based on baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, with a 7.5% treatment threshold. For newly diagnosed patients with T2DM and HbA1c levels < 7.5%, metformin (MET) monotherapy is recommended as the first‐line treatment. If adequate glycemic control is achieved, MET should be continued. Conversely, if glycemic control remains suboptimal, the addition of other oral antihyperglycemic agents should be considered. For patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and baseline HbA1c levels ≥ 7.5%, MET‐based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapy is recommended

### Metformin as a potential prevention strategy for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias [^116dJpJw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is a safe and effective medication for type 2 diabetes (T2D) that has been proposed to decrease the risk of aging related disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease related disorders(ADRD).

Objective

This review seeks to summarize findings from studies examining the association of metformin with AD/ADRD related outcomes.

Methods

This is a narrative review of human studies, including observational studies and clinical trials, examining the association of metformin with cognitive and brain outcomes. We used PubMed as the main database for our literature search with a focus on English language human studies including observational studies and clinical trials. We prioritized studies published from 2013 until February 15, 2024.

Results

Observational human studies are conflicting, but those with better study designs suggest that metformin use in persons with T2D is associated with a lower risk of dementia. However, these observational studies are limited by the use of administrative data to ascertain metformin use and/or cognitive outcomes. There are few clinical trials in persons without T2D that have small sample sizes and short durations but suggest that metformin could prevent AD/ADRD. There are ongoing studies including large clinical trials with long duration that are testing the effect of metformin on AD/ADRD outcomes in persons without T2D at risk for dementia.

Conclusions

Clinical trial results are needed to establish the effect of metformin on the risk of AD and ADRD.

2.2 Data collection

The patients were categorized into four groups according to the drug use guidelines as follows: MET–SU, MET–DPP4i, MET–TZD, and MET–glinides. Each study group consisted of patients prescribed both MET (ATC code A10BA02)and another medication at the time of initial DM diagnosis, with treatment records confirming prescriptions of these medications at least three times within a 90 day period. Specifically, the groups included MET and one of the other anti‐diabetics such as SU (ATC code A10BB), DPP4 inhibitors (ATC code A10BH), TZD (ATC code A10BG), and glinides (ATC code A10BX02).

2.3 Dependent variables

2.3.1 Dementia incidence

Dementia incidence in this study is defined using specific diagnostic codes: for ICD‐9‐CM, dementia is identified by codes 290, 294, and 331. For ICD‐10‐CM, dementia is identified by codes F03.90, F05, F01.50, and F01.51. Additionally, patients must have had more than three outpatient visits or more than one hospitalization record related to dementia within 1 year to meet the criteria. Given the potential influence of DM medication use, a long‐term observation period is necessary to establish causation. Therefore, patients who developed dementia within 4 years after their DM diagnosis were excluded from the study.

2.3.2 Risk factors

This study considers several factors such as age; sex; hypertension;, hyperlipidemia; stroke; ischemic heart disease, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure; arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular disease, including transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage; kidney disease; retinal detachment; Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); and the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), direct thrombin inhibitors, warfarin, and β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐CoA (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors.,

Comorbidity is defined as having at least one inpatient or two outpatient diagnoses at least 4 years before the initial dementia diagnosis. The CCI assigns weighted scores to different chronic diseases based on severity (1, 2, 3, or 6 points). The total score predicts the 10 year mortality risk and reflects the burden of multiple comorbidities, which may increase dementia risk.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cBRJN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review found that the available evidence provides some support for metformin having a protective effect against dementia in people who are taking it for the management of diabetes. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies showed significantly reduced prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia amongst users of metformin compared to other patients with diabetes. One study, Moore et al. which could not be included in the meta-analysis, contradicted this result with a significant finding of worse cognitive performance in metformin users which was mitigated by adjustment for vitamin B 12 levels. Interestingly, this study was carried out in Australia where average vitamin B 12 concentrations have been reported at lower levels than the United States, Japan, and Singapore where the studies included in the meta-analysis — which homogenously provided evidence of a protective effect — were carried out. Vitamin B 12 deficiency can be induced by metformin and has been linked to cognitive impairment. This suggests that metformin may exert a dual effect on cognitive health; counteracting the neurodegenerative effects of diabetes, but harming patients who are vulnerable to vitamin B 12 deficiency. Evidence for this hypothesis is largely circumstantial, however, and requires direct investigation.

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^111cutHd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study also explored continued prescription during follow-up and the effect of long-term metformin usage. Results implied that longer treatment of metformin (e.g. over five years) in diabetic patients had a stronger effect on reducing dementia risk. This observation reinforces the case of repurposing this low-cost, generic medicine for the prevention of dementia. Although we did not detect substantial difference between the associations of metformin monotherapy versus combination therapy with dementia risk, several previous studies suggested that the combination of anti-diabetes medications might be superior to monotherapy in terms of reducing neuropathological burden, or the risk of dementia incidence, which warrants further research. In addition, our observation of a stronger metformin effect in T2D patients aged < 70 years was in line with the two afore-mentioned cohort studies in the US veterans, where the metformin-dementia association was only detected in patients aged < 75 years but not in those aged ≥ 75 years. This could be due to the presence of additional factors related to brain ageing, further complicating the multi-factorial aetiological puzzle of dementia in the older old population, in which metformin's effect may not be sufficient to alter the trajectory or delay disease onset.

Several potential mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of metformin on dementia risk, including its role on diabetic/vascular pathwaysand/or independent neuroprotective mechanisms. On the one hand, metformin could reduce dementia risk via improved glycemic control and fewer vascular complications in T2D patients, given that long-term glycaemia, HbA1c variability and diabetic complications have been linked to dementia risk. On the other hand, metformin can rapidly cross the blood-brain-barrier and may have direct intra-cerebral neuroprotective effects including, and going beyond, combatting brain insulin resistance and its effect on brain ageing and AD pathology. Experimental studies have suggested that metformin could also reduce the burden of phosphorylated tau and β -amyloid, – and a potential preventative effect has been shown on brain cell dysfunction and death, through activation of longevity-promoting signaling molecules (e.g. AMPK). In fact, metformin has been reported to have wide pleiotropic anti-ageing effects through modulation of inflammation, oxidation, autophagy, and DNA repair, – and a meta-analysis of observational studies showed that metformin reduces all-cause mortality, independent of its effect on diabetic control.

### Changes in the use of diabetes drugs among community-dwelling people with Alzheimer's disease [^114xFkps]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report changes in the use of diabetes drugs in persons with and without AD. Diabetes drug use decreased one year after diagnosis in persons with AD compared to those without AD. This finding is in accordance with a previous United States study on changes on drug utilization among people with diabetes following AD diagnosis. The decrease in diabetes drug use may be partly attributable to unintentional weight loss and a corresponding reduction in the need for diabetes drugs after AD diagnosis. The decrease might also reflect recognition that tight glycemic control in vulnerable older people can lead to hypoglycemia, increased risk of falls and related fractures, micro- and macrovascular complications or even death. In addition, weight loss is related to frailty which has been demonstrated to increase the risk of hypoglycemia in persons with dementia Severe hypoglycemia is more common in people with diabetes and dementia compared to those without dementia. Therefore, optimizing diabetes treatment regimens according to each individual's glycemic goals is encouraged in persons with cognitive impairment. This approach is consistent with a focus on maintaining quality of life through avoiding hypoglycemia. Our results are in contrast to a recent Australian study that reported clinicians appeared to prescribe more conservatively for people with diabetes who were older and frailer, but not for people with dementia.

In our study, metformin was the most frequently used diabetes drug at the index date among people with and without AD. Metformin has a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio although should be used with caution in renal impairment due to the risk of lactic acidosis. However, with appropriate dose adjustment metformin has been shown to be largely safe and effective in people with chronic kidney disease. This is in line with guidelines recommending metformin as the first-line agent for type 2 diabetes. This likely explains the frequent use of metformin in both cohorts. While these findings were consistent with international findings, older age has also been associated with higher odds of initiating non-metformin treatment.

Sulfonylureas have been associated with an increased risk of severe and long-lasting hypoglycemia, which may outweigh their benefits among older people. Furthermore, their beneficial effects may decrease after 2 years of use. Introduction of newer and safer diabetes drugs is likely to explain the decreased use of sulfonylureas over time in both cohorts. The shift away from sulfonylureas may also reflect an international transition toward newer diabetes treatments such as SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11326cvd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Further research should include additional clinical trials with sufficient follow-up and sample sizes for meaningful event numbers to accumulate; the study by Luchsinger et al. had 12 months follow up and 80 participants, but only reported one dementia diagnosis in the control group. Further clinical investigation of whether metformin can safeguard the cognitive health of people who do not have diabetes is warranted, but at this stage it should probably be restricted to those with the dementia risk factors of overweight, insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome. Future observational studies should make use of propensity score matching, or at the least match for age and health status, to improve the validity of data by reducing baseline variability and, wherever possible, examine the interaction of metformin-use, vitamin B 12 levels, and cognitive decline. Wang et al. found that older people at risk of frailty experienced the greatest benefit from metformin-use, while other subgroups saw no significant improvement. Further investigation of which patient characteristics increase the likelihood of metformin exerting a neuroprotective effect could enable personalized medicine.

The main limitation of this systematic review is that it draws primarily from observational studies, which were heterogeneous in design and had baseline differences within their sometimes small cohorts. However, the findings of the meta-analyses of observational data are reinforced by experimental research. A previous systematic review on the effect of insulin sensitizers on dementia did not include these RCTs or the most recent observational studies, and its meta-analysis on metformin did not reach significance. Additionally, some studies restricted inclusion to people with type 2 diabetes while others also included type 1 diabetes. Finally, there was no data available on the influence of metformin dose.

Conclusions

This review suggests that metformin prevents or delays the development of dementia in patients with diabetes. Conflicting findings could be explained by low levels of vitamin B 12 in the community being exacerbated by metformin-use. This supports vitamin B 12 supplementation in patients taking metformin, particularly older adults. Evidence does not yet support the use of metformin by individuals without diabetes for prevention of dementia despite its apparent action as a general geroprotective agent.

### Causal inference in medical records and complementary systems pharmacology for metformin drug repurposing towards dementia [^111zKwgU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

One advantage of target trial observational studies is much longer follow-up periods after drug initiation than is feasible in RCTs. This increased length of follow-up is of special importance, since many dementia risk factors likely operate over a long period of time, and since dementia onset progression is an infrequent outcome. After balancing key baseline demographic variables in the metformin and sulfonylurea cohorts by IPTW, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis with a 1-year run-in period in two patient populations drawn from vastly diverse settings. One cohort was from a healthcare system anchored in two large tertiary care hospitals in the US and another from a nation-wide primary care network in the UK. Despite differences in medical practice, data collection, timing and length of follow-up, patterns of missingness, and known and unknown sources of bias, we found consistent evidence of metformin's benefit for overall survival and for dementia onset, relative to sulfonylureas. While prior studies only estimated a cause-specific hazard ratio for the impact of treatment on risk of dementia, in the CIFs from our competing risks framework we were able to account for the treatment effect on both outcomes jointly. Relative to sulfonylurea initiators, metformin initiators had a reduced hazard of dementia onset in both cohorts. Our results corroborate the benefits of metformin on dementia risk in type 2 diabetics reported in previous observational studies. Moreover, our competing risks analysis demonstrates how the risk of dementia depends on the baseline mortality rate of the population, a potential explanation of the neutral, or deleteriouseffect of metformin on dementia onset seen in other observational studies (Extended Data Table 14). To our knowledge, this work offers a unique approach to comprehensively address competing death in a study of metformin and dementia, with a rigorous causal framework harmonized across two EHR databases.

Positive Effects of Metformin on Cognition

Metformin treatment has been linked to a significantly lower risk of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases and with improvement in 3 cognitive domains, memory, semantic memory, and executive function, mostly in subjects with T2D (Table 1).

Table 1.
Human studies focused on metformin and cognition

One of the most populated studies evaluated Australian individuals aged 70–90 years over the course of 6 years (n = 103 767 with T2D and metformin). Ninety-one cases of dementia during the 6-year study were reported, of which 73 were subjects without T2D (8.2% of that group), 8 were T2D without metformin (14.5% of that group), and 4 were T2D with metformin (6% of that group). In T2D subjects without metformin, the rate of decline was accelerated specifically in executive function (P = .006). Hence, an 81% reduction in incident dementia risk was reported in T2D subjects with metformin treatment (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04–0.85; p = 0.030).

Consistently, an observational study included 559 106 US veterans over 60 years of age with a diagnosis of T2D. The incidence rate of dementia was lower in the group of patients treated with metformin (6.2 cases per 1000 person-years) than the groups treated with sulfonylureas and thiazolidinedione (13.4 cases per 1000 person-years). Combination therapy with metformin and thiazolidinedione reduced the risk of all-cause dementia. After 2 years of treatment, the combination of metformin and sulfonylureas became protective against all causes of dementia (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.95).

Likewise, an unmatched cohort (n = 147 729 subjects who used metformin) and a matched cohort (n = 15 676 subjects who used metformin and n = 15 676 subjects who never took metformin) were investigated in Taiwan. This study informed a lower risk of dementia in patients taking metformin in both the unmatched cohort (HR 0.550, 95% CI 0.508–0.596, P < .0001) and the matched cohort (HR 0.707, 95% CI 0.632–0.791, P < .0001).

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^1145hwtN]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, dementia cases could be underreported or underdiagnosed in CPRD. Although we maximized the number of dementia cases by using the linkage data from HES and ONS databases and dementia-specific drug records, the remaining misclassification in outcome events may have led to bias. However, assuming that the remaining misclassification was independent of the exposure variable, our estimates of HRs would have likely been biased toward the null hypothesis. In addition, two CPRD-based studies on dementia by the same group of authors validated a small subset of extracted dementia cases (n = 100 and 150) by writing to their GP for detailed medical history; they found that the rates of confirmation by GPs (i.e. positive predictive value of CPRD-based diagnosis) were 83%and 100%. Another large-scale validation study found that 88% of dementia cases identified in CPRD had corroborating evidence for their dementia diagnosis in relevant clinical records. Second, our non-user comparison group, based on CPRD T2D clinical codelist, may have included prediabetes individuals together with T2D patients with mild disease. Nevertheless, this reinforces our key finding of a beneficial effect of metformin in reducing the dementia risk in T2D patients to an even lower level than in those with milder or prodromal disease. Moreover, the possibility of residual confounding bias cannot be ruled out due to, for instance, the paucity of data regarding educational attainment and physical activity. The presence of missing data is a common limitation of large-scale EHR analyses. We employed multiple statistical methodologies to mitigate this risk, all showing consistent results. Finally, causality cannot be established in an observational study. Results of the above and other future well-designed large-scale RCTs are required to confirm the role of metformin in dementia prevention or treatment, in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

In conclusion, this population-based cohort study provides strong epidemiological evidence of a beneficial role of metformin on dementia risk in T2D patients, going beyond its glycemic effect. Our results add credence to the potential generalizability and repurposing of metformin for primary and secondary dementia prevention.

### Metformin in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus: dose-dependent dementia risk reduction [^114aV4SW]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the controversial association between metformin use and diabetes-associated dementia in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and evaluate the potential protective effects of metformin, as well as its intensity of use and dose-dependency, against dementia in this population. The study used a time-dependent Cox hazards model to evaluate the effect of metformin use on the incidence of dementia. The case group included elderly patients with T2DM (≥ 60 years old) who received metformin, while the control group consisted of elderly patients with T2DM who did not receive metformin during the follow-up period. Our analysis revealed a significant reduction in the risk of dementia among elderly individuals using metformin, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.33 to 0.36). Notably, metformin users with a daily intensity of 1 defined daily dose (DDD) or higher had a lower risk of dementia, with an adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.46 (0.22 to 0.6), compared to those with a daily intensity of < 1 DDD. Additionally, the analysis of cumulative DDDs of metformin showed a dose-response relationship, with progressively lower adjusted hazard ratio across quartiles (0.15, 0.21, 0.28, and 0.53 for quartiles 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively), compared to never metformin users (P for trend < 0.0001). Metformin use in elderly patients with T2DM is significantly associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of dementia. Notably, the protective effect of metformin demonstrates a dose-dependent relationship, with higher daily and cumulative dosages of metformin showing a greater risk reduction.

### Cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents and dementia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Qq6Bs]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, there are inherent challenges in performing and interpreting a meta-analysis with heterogenous interventions, and definitions of the outcomes of dementia. The study reported meta-analytic estimates by drug classes. There were no randomized clinical trials identified evaluating metformin compared with controls that reported dementia outcomes. Second, dementia outcomes were not ascertained as an outcome of interest; rather, they were reported as adverse events. Bias due to outcome misclassification may have arisen due to incomplete ascertainment of dementia diagnoses. However, as investigators and participants were blinded to treatment allocation, this should not affect the validity of relative comparisons, as both groups of the included randomized clinical trials were likely to have been equally affected by outcome misclassification and underreporting. Third, the low event rates, which are likely related to the average age of the study population, limited duration of follow-up and method of ascertainment (as adverse events rather than systematically sought), reducing power to detect differences in treatment effect. This is a substantial limitation of this study, and further research evaluating the efficacy of glucose-lowering therapies to reduce risk of dementia outcomes in suitably designed trials (ie, with long duration of follow-up and population, including adults in middle-late life) is required. It is important to note that event rates for less common dementia subtypes, such as Lewy body dementia, were very low and therefore should be considered exploratory. Fourth, the duration of follow-up of included studies was relatively short (mean follow-up, 31.4 months). Fifth, the study did not report estimates within subgroups of trial populations (eg, by sex), as only summary-level data were available. Sixth, further research, including randomized clinical trials specifically evaluating the effect of glucose-lowering therapy on incident dementia and cognitive outcomes, is needed. While this study reported on the relative association of glucose-lowering therapy, due to underreporting, the absolute effect is likely larger. It is imperative that these trials are of sufficient follow-up duration to ascertain cognitive outcomes.

### Glucose-lowering medications and post-dementia survival in patients with diabetes and dementia [^111zJXUL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large cohort of patients with diabetes, insulin use was associated with higher mortality, in both dementia and dementia-free subjects. Sulfonylurea users with dementia experienced higher mortality and GLP-1a and SGLT-2i use was protective among patients with dementia. Lastly, we observed a reduced mortality associated with metformin and DPP-4i use in dementia-free, while a similar reduction was not observed in patients with dementia.

Compared to non-users, the exposure to metformin was associated with 25% lower mortality in the as-treated dementia-free group, while the direction of the association was similar, the mortality was not significantly lower in the metformin-treated dementia subjects. The findings from dementia-free concur with the mortality reductions observed in the meta-analysis by Campbell and colleagues'; however, the relative lack of effect in dementia patients should be explained. One of the possible explanations may be in the differences in co-treatment with other GLDs in dementia and dementia-free, as dementia patients using metformin were frequently co-treated with insulin (70%) compared to dementia-free (52%) in the as-treated models. This argument is strengthened by the intention-to-treat analysis, where metformin's protective effect was stronger, albeit borderline insignificant, and the discrepancy between co-treatment with insulin was less pronounced (19% dementia versus 17% dementia-free). While we did not assess whether insulin mediated some mortality risk among metformin users, the notion seems plausible, especially as insulin use was associated with higher mortality risk in both cohorts. On the other hand, some animal studies suggest that in APOE ɛ 4 carriers with manifest dementia, metformin may even contribute to further neurodegeneration, which could counteract the pro-survival properties observed in the dementia-free cohort. Further research is necessary to confirm such hypothesis, as we did not have access to genetic data.

### Effect of diabetes medications on the risk of developing dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116eEr6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA)

Of the four studies (N = 338,557) that included GLP-1 RA as a treatment, two were case-control studies, one was an RCT, and one included both a case-control study and pooled three double-blind RCTs. Norgaard et al. pooled findings from three RCTs, and found that GLP-RA significantly reduced the rate of dementia compared with second line diabetes treatments (RR = 0.47[0.25, 0.86]). For these trials, the first-line medication, which was metformin, was not included as a comparator. Cukierman-Yaffe et al.evaluated risk of cognitive decline as an outcome in a RCT. GLP-1 RA users was associated with significantly less cognitive decline than treatment as usual, where participants could take up to two non-GLP-1 RA diabetes medications (RR = 0.86[0.79, 0.95]).

We meta-analyzed the three case-control studies of GLP-1 RA users versus those on other second-line diabetes medication and found a reduced dementia risk (RR = 0.73[0.54, 0.99], I² = 96%) (Figure 2).

### Evaluating GLP-1 receptor agonists versus metformin as first-line therapy for reducing dementia risk in type 2 diabetes [^114AkCo5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study represents the first and largest direct comparison of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in mitigating dementia risk among patients with T2DM. Historically, metformin has been the cornerstone of first-line therapy for T2DM due to its well-established efficacy in glycemic control and its potential neuroprotective effects. However, whether initiating GLP-1 RAs as first-line therapy could offer superior benefits in reducing diabetes-related dementia risk has remained unaddressed. The findings demonstrated that GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced the incidence of overall dementia compared with metformin (2.4% vs 4.8%; AHR, 0.90; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), with pronounced benefits observed in AD and other dementia subtypes. Notably, GLP-1 RAs also provided substantial reductions in all-cause mortality. These findings address a key knowledge gap by directly comparing the neuroprotective efficacy of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in dementia prevention. Given the increasing global burden of diabetes-related cognitive decline and the lack of head-to-head comparisons between GLP-1 RAs and metformin, our findings provide actionable insights for clinical decision-making and may inform future guidelines. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to optimize both metabolic and neuroprotective outcomes in high-risk T2DM populations. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted to confirm these findings and evaluate the long-term cognitive benefits of GLP-1 RAs.

### Metformin-based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapy and risk of dementia in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^113cABKh]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Cumulative incidence of dementia per 10,000 person‐years by four metformin‐based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapies. CI, confidence interval; DPP4i, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor; IR, incidence rate; MET, metformin; PY, 10,000 person‐years; RR, relative risk; SU, sulfonylurea; TZD, thiazolidinedione.

Moreover, this study performed collinearity testing among the four oral antihyperglycemic combination groups, age, sex, CCI, risk factors, and non‐diabetic medications. Variables with a variance inflation factor of > 3, including ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, cerebral ischemia, and retinopathy, were excluded prior to subsequent analyses.

The Cox proportional hazards model and the competing risk model demonstrated that the MET–TZD and MET–DPP4i groups had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia than the MET–SU group. Although the MET–glinide group showed a higher risk of developing dementia than the MET–SU group, the difference was not significant (Figure 3). Several additional risk factors for dementia were identified. Male patients had a lower risk compared to female patients (Table S1). Moreover, patients aged > 65 years had a > 2‐fold increased risk of developing the disease compared to those aged < 65 years. The CCI used a score of 3 as the cut‐off point and found that the risk of developing dementia in the group with a score > 1‐fold increased risk was higher than the control group. Heart failure, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and chronic kidney disease all showed higher risk ratios compared to the control group. Regarding the use of other types of drugs, patients who used CCB drugs had a higher risk of developing dementia than the control group. Conversely, those who used antiplatelet drugs, direct thrombin inhibitors, and HMG‐CoA inhibitors had a lower risk of developing dementia than the control group.

### Metformin cessation and dementia incidence [^112iaZfg]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Prior studies suggested that metformin may be associated with reduced dementia incidence, but associations may be confounded by disease severity and prescribing trends. Cessation of metformin therapy in people with diabetes typically occurs due to signs of kidney dysfunction but sometimes is due to less serious adverse effects associated with metformin.

Objective

To investigate the association of terminating metformin treatment for reasons unrelated to kidney dysfunction with dementia incidence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care delivery system, among a cohort of metformin users born prior to 1955 without history of diagnosed kidney disease at metformin initiation. Dementia follow-up began with the implementation of electronic health records in 1996 and continued to 2020. Data were analyzed from November 2021 through September 2023.

Exposures

A total of 12 220 early terminators, individuals who stopped metformin with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were compared with routine metformin users, who had not yet terminated metformin treatment or had terminated (with or without restarting) after their first abnormal eGFR measurement. Early terminators were matched with routine users of the same age and gender who had diabetes for the same duration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcome of interest was all-cause incident dementia. Follow-up for early terminators and their matched routine users was started at age of termination for the early terminator. Survival models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities at the time of metformin termination (or matched age). Mediation models with HbA1c level and insulin usage 1 and 5 years after termination tested whether changes in blood glucose or insulin usage explained associations between early termination of metformin and dementia incidence.

Results

The final analytic sample consisted of 12 220 early terminators (5640 women [46.2%]; mean [SD] age at start of first metformin prescription, 59.4 [9.0] years) and 29 126 routine users (13 582 women [46.6%]; mean [SD] age at start of first metformin prescription, 61.1 [8.9] years). Early terminators had 1.21 times the hazard of dementia diagnosis compared with routine users (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.30). In mediation analysis, contributions to this association by changes in HbA1c level or insulin use ranged from no contribution (0.00 years; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.02 years) for insulin use at 5 years after termination to 0.07 years (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.13 years) for HbA1c level at 1 year after termination, suggesting that the association was largely independent of changes in HbA1c level and insulin usage.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, terminating metformin treatment was associated with increased dementia incidence. This finding may have important implications for clinical treatment of adults with diabetes and provides additional evidence that metformin is associated with reduced dementia risk.

### Relationships between memory decline and the use of metformin or DPP4 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes with normal cognition or Alzheimer's disease, and the role APOE carrier status [^113vurGy]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This study offers observational evidence suggesting that certain oral hypoglycemic drug classes may be preferred in people with T2DM who are at risk for or with diagnosed AD. Metformin use was associated with better memory performance over time in cognitively normal people, while in people with AD dementia, DPP4 inhibitor use was associated with slower rates of memory decline, and thiazolidinedione use was associated with a faster rate of decline. APOE ε4 carrier status may predict greater benefit of DPP4 inhibitors in cognitively normal individuals, and less benefit of metformin in people with AD. The results have implications for personalized prevention and treatment of AD among people with T2DM, and for planning trials in AD with comorbid T2DM.

Study designs

Only four studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Most of the included studies were observational (11 studies), three of these prospective, seven retrospective, and one cross-sectional. Data on outcomes was extracted for the end of the follow-up period of each included study.

Participants

In ten studies at least 80% of participants were aged 65 years or older. In these studies, the lowest mean age was 69.3 years and the highest 80.5 years. The remaining five studies provided subgroup analyses of older people (≥ 65 or ≥ 71 or > 80 years). Length of follow-up varied from none (cross-sectional study) to 11 years.

Representation of males ranged from 24.1% to 97%. Eight studies reported ethnicity with most participants being white/Caucasian (up to 81%). Participants from four different continents were involved in the studies including America (n = 8), Europe (n = 7), Asia (n = 3) and Australia (n = 2). Comorbidities were reported in 11 studies, and congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and hypothyroidism were the most commonly reported. Functional status was reported in one study. No studies reported on the frailty level of the participants. Cognitive status was reported in four studies. The percentage of participants with dementia was low in most studies ranging from 2.8% to 67%. Participant characteristics are summarised in Additional file 3: Table S1.

Covariates in models

Adjustment for relevant covariates is important in observational studies to reduce confounder bias. The use of covariates indicates that a study's authors have considered this issue, although by no means implies that bias has been eliminated. Many of the studies used long lists of covariates, therefore Additional file 3: Table S2 is given for online publication.

Cognitive performance

The two RCTs both compared the performance of patients treated with metformin to those who received a placebo. Guo et al. showed that in patients with diabetes who also had depression who were not receiving insulin or any other antihyperglycemic medication, metformin over 24 weeks significantly improved cognitive performance on all items of the Wechsler Memory Scale-revised (Verbal memory index = 22.19 p < 0.001, Visual memory index = 10.53 p < 0.01, General memory index = 4.27 p < 0.05, Attention and concentration p < 0.01, Delayed memory index = 19.84 p < 0.001). Interestingly improved performance correlated with improved depression which in turn correlated with improved HbA1c. The second RCT investigated the effect of 12 months of metformin therapy in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25, but no diagnosed diabetes. Change from baseline in Selective Reminding Task significantly favored the metformin treated patients (Unit change in test: Metformin = 9.5 ± 6.1; Placebo = 5.4 ± 6.1, p = 0.05); however, changes in the other primary outcome, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive were non-significant (Metformin = –0.5 ± 4.1; Placebo = –1.4 ± 4.1, p = 0.34). Secondary measures included the Clinical Global Impression of Change for mild cognitive impairment, logical memory II delayed paragraph recall subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised, MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, and digit span backwards; however, no significant effects were observed.

Three observational studies reported on average performance on the MMSE for patients with diabetes receiving metformin compared to other patients with diabetes; however, no significant effect was found (WMD = –0.68, 95% CI –2.37 to 1.02; p = 0.43, Fig. 5). Results were not adjusted for differences in patient characteristics. One additional cohort study, Herath et al. reported that metformin users showed significantly better performance at baseline with the digit span backwards test compared to other patients with diabetes; however, there was no change associated with metformin-use at 4 years follow up. Other measures included MMSE, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Immediate recall, Spot-the-Word task, Trail Making Test A and B, Purdue Pegboard Test, Selective Reminding Test, and Choice Reaction Time, but no differences were found.

### Risk of dementia in patients with diabetes using sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i): a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^111KFS8a]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have also explored the relationship between other antidiabetic agents, such as metformin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and the dementia risk. A meta-analysis published in 2018 that pooled data from 14 studies showed that the use of metformin was associated with less cognitive impairment in patients with diabetes. This meta-analysis also showed that the incidence of dementia was significantly reduced among patients with diabetes who used metformin when compared to control group. Meanwhile, regarding GLP-1 receptor agonist, a previous meta-analysis revealed that the use of GLP-1 receptor agonist can significantly improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This beneficial effect from GLP-1 receptor agonist on cognitive function was further confirmed by another recent meta-analysis study that showed a lower risk of all-cause dementia with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonist. All of this information has provided us with evidence that antidiabetic agents may have a role in altering the development of dementia in patients with diabetes.

### GLP-1RA comparative effectiveness against dementia onset relative to other antidiabetic medications in a large, multi-site cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes [^116zCuz2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Other diabetes medications, such as sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have also shown some protection in observational studies against cognitive decline in patients with diabetes, compared to no SGLT2i use, and compared to DPP4i use. Randomized trials show mixed results. Likewise, DPP4i have been shown to slow some measures of cognitive decline in trial datain observational studies compared to no treatmentor to SU. Consistent with these findings, in other observational analyses, SU have null effects or comparatively harmful effects on cognitive outcomes compared to other medications (DPP4i, metformin, insulin). Notably, these studies did not use causal inference methodology to adjust for time‐varying confounding affected by prior treatment.

There are, to date, no head‐to‐head randomized trials assessing the comparative effectiveness of different diabetes treatments on dementia onset. While evidence is urgently needed, randomized trials with rare outcomes requiring longer term follow‐up would imply recruitment of an unrealistically large number of subjects, require tens of millions of dollars, and take ≥ 10 years to complete — by which time results may be irrelevant as diabetes treatment guidelines evolve. Due to these challenges, randomized trials have either enrolled dementia patients and studied disease progression, or studied markers of cognitive decline rather than dementia onset. These studies therefore do not easily generalize to the broader diabetes population, or to dementia onset or diagnosis.

Observational studies that leverage electronic medical records or claims may circumvent these shortcomings by allowing access to expansive datasets with sufficient power to look at less‐common exposures (e.g. newer medications) and longer term and rare outcomes (e.g. dementia). Such studies can suffer from confounding bias and can be particularly challenging in longitudinal settings, in which time‐dependent confounders (e.g. mild cognitive impairment) can be affected by prior exposure and thus be on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. In such cases, standard analytic methods such as matching or outcome regressions are inadequate to adjust for biases from these time‐varying confounders. Modern causal inference methods based on the G‐computation formula address these shortcomings by allowing researchers to adjust estimates for time‐dependent confounders affected by prior exposure. To our knowledge, only one analysis has applied such an estimator to this question; however, that analysis suffered some data limitations, including a limited covariate set and a homogeneous study population.

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^1158m7XX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

The potential of metformin being repurposed for dementia has been supported by two small-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in non-diabetic patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A Phase 2 RCT (n = 80) showed efficacy in improving memory performance (although not global cognitive function) after 1-year treatment versus placebo among amnestic MCI patients (p < 0.05). Another crossover designed RCT (n = 20) showed that 8-week metformin treatment had beneficial effects on executive functions, compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The ongoing multi-center Phase II/III RCT "Metformin in Alzheimer's Dementia Prevention" (MAP,) is testing long-acting metformin versus placebo for 24 months in patients with amnestic MCI, with memory performance as the primary outcome. The "Targeting Aging with Metformin" (TAME) RCT will test whether metformin modulates a variety of ageing-related diseases (including dementia) and mortality beyond its impact on diabetes among ∼3000 subjects. Given the long preclinical stages of accumulating neuropathology in ADRD, there is increasing interest in conducting dementia prevention trials in at-risk cognitively unimpaired individuals. The newly launched phase IIb MET-FINGER trial will examine the effect of a combination of personalized multi-domain lifestyle intervention and metformin treatment on change of cognition in an APOE - ε 4 enriched sample of at-risk population.

### Incident dementia risk among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin versus alternative oral glucose-lowering therapy: an observational cohort study using UK primary healthcare records [^116tG8vv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

4.2million individuals in the UK have type 2 diabetes, a known risk factor for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Diabetes treatment may modify this association, but existing evidence is conflicting. We therefore aimed to assess the association between metformin therapy and risk of incident all-cause dementia or MCI compared with other oral glucose-lowering therapies (GLTs).

Research Design and Methods

We conducted an observational cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink among UK adults diagnosed with diabetes at ≥ 40 years between 1990 and 2019. We used an active comparator new user design to compare risks of dementia and MCI among individuals initially prescribed metformin versus an alternative oral GLT using Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical confounders. We assessed for interaction by age and sex. Sensitivity analyses included an as-treated analysis to mitigate potential exposure misclassification.

Results

We included 211396 individuals (median age 63 years; 42.8% female), of whom 179333 (84.8%) initiated on metformin therapy. Over median follow-up of 5.4 years, metformin use was associated with a lower risk of dementia (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.94)) and MCI (aHR 0.92 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99)). Metformin users aged under 80 years had a lower dementia risk (aHR 0.77 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.85)), which was not observed for those aged ≥ 80 years (aHR 0.95 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.05)). There was no interaction with sex. The as-treated analysis showed a reduced effect size compared with the main analysis (aHR 0.90 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.98)).

Conclusions

Metformin use was associated with lower risks of incident dementia and MCI compared with alternative GLT among UK adults with diabetes. While our findings are consistent with a neuroprotective effect of metformin against dementia, further research is needed to reduce risks of confounding by indication and assess causality.

### Protective effect of metformin against dementia in patients with obesity: results from a global federated health network analysis [^1126veBB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Metformin, a first-line medication for Type 2 diabetes (T2D), has been suggested to reduce dementia risk. We investigated whether metformin use was associated with lower long-term incidence of dementia and all-cause mortality in obese patients.

Materials and Methods

We analysed electronic health record data from the TriNetX network. Patients were categorised into four body mass index (BMI) groups (25–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9 and over 40). In each group, those prescribed metformin were compared with matched controls who were not prescribed metformin, using propensity score matching. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate dementia incidence and all-cause mortality over a 10-year follow-up.

Results

The matched cohorts included 132920 (BMI 25–29.9), 142723 (30–34.9), 94402 (35–39.9) and 82732 (over 40) patients per group. After 10years of follow-up, metformin users exhibited significantly lower risks of both dementia and all-cause mortality compared to controls. Specifically, the hazard ratios for dementia across each BMI group were 0.875 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.848–0.904), 0.917 (0.885–0.951), 0.878 (0.834–0.924) and 0.891 (0.834–0.953), respectively. For all-cause mortality, the corresponding hazard ratios were 0.719 (0.701–0.737), 0.727 (0.708–0.746), 0.717 (0.694–0.741) and 0.743 (0.717–0.771).

Conclusions

In this large, multi-centre cohort study, metformin use was associated with reduced risks of dementia and all-cause mortality in obese patients. The protective effect was observed across all BMI groups, with variations noted by population. These findings support the potential of metformin in lowering dementia risk in patients with obesity. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.

### Evaluating GLP-1 receptor agonists versus metformin as first-line therapy for reducing dementia risk in type 2 diabetes [^115P4Cqy]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

No direct comparisons have evaluated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) versus metformin as first-line antidiabetic therapy for preventing dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in reducing dementia risk.

Research Design and Methods

This retrospective cohort study used data from a global health research network between 2004 and 2024. Patients with T2DM initiating GLP-1 RAs or metformin as first-line monotherapy were included. Propensity score matching was employed to balance baseline characteristics. Dementia incidence was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, with sensitivity analyses to confirm robustness.

Results

Among 87,229 matched patients per cohort, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a significantly lower risk of overall dementia (adjusted HR (AHR) 0.90; 95%CI 0.85 to 0.95), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (AHR 0.88; 95%CI 0.83 to 0.94), and non-vascular dementias (non-VaDs) (AHR 0.75; 95%CI 0.70 to 0.81) compared with metformin. No significant difference was observed for VaD. Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefit across age and sex, with the strongest effect among older adults and females.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs were more effective than metformin in reducing the risk of dementia-especially AD and non-vascular types-highlighting their potential as a preferred first-line treatment in T2DM. Further randomized trials are warranted to validate these findings.

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^114QfaGt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 | Study population and exposure assessment

To establish the cohort of metformin initiators, we included T2D patients initially treated with metformin between 2001 and 2018 and aged over 50 years at the first metformin prescription date. Presence of T2D was based on relevant CPRD Medcodes (excluding Medcodes for Type 1 diabetes) and prescriptions (British National Formulary codes) (Table S1). In this study, metformin initiators were defined as T2D patients, whose initial anti-diabetes drug treatment was metformin monotherapy for 12 months. Eligible patients should have at least 1-year registration in CPRD practices prior to the first prescription of metformin, to ensure that they are new users and allow time for baseline information to be recorded; have at least two metformin prescriptions and no other anti-diabetics prescription during the initial 12-month treatment period; and have no dementia record before the metformin treatment.

For the non-user cohort, we included T2D patients aged over 50 years at any point during their CPRD registration period who had no anti-diabetes drug prescription records, throughout the entire CPRD observation period. According to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for T2D management, these patients were most likely to have been successfully managed through diet and lifestyle intervention, not requiring anti-diabetes medication. Patients entered the cohort at age 50, the date of diabetes diagnosis or January 1, 2001, whichever was the latest. In addition, eligible participants were required to have been registered in CPRD for at least 1 year prior to cohort entry and have no dementia record before cohort entry.

A total of 114,628 metformin initiators and 95,609 T2D patients with no anti-diabetes drug treatment during their CPRD registration were included in the analyses.

### Metformin adherence reduces the risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a population-based cohort study [^1179TBVX]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metformin is widely used as the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus and has numerous benefits apart from lowering blood glucose. However, metformin-retained regimen is challenged by newly launching, powerful glucose-lowering antiglycemic agents. This population-based cohort study examined the association between metformin adherence and the risk of dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

Diabetic patients with metformin-included combination antiglycemic therapy were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database and categorized into metformin-adherent and -nonadherent groups according to the medical record of the first year prescription. Patients contraindicated with metformin, severe diabetic complications, and poor drug compliance were excluded. The study outcome was the diagnosis of dementia or PD.

Results

A total of 31 384 matched pairs were included after using propensity score matching and both groups were followed up for an average of 5 years. Metformin adherence was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia (adjusted hazard risk ratio = 0.72, P < .001) but not PD (adjusted hazard risk ratio = 0.97, P = .825). Subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of dementia was significantly reduced in metformin-adherent patients, both male and female, aged > 65 or ≤ 65 years, and with or without concurrent insulin treatment. This effect was not influenced by concurrent insulin treatment, which may eliminate the bias caused by the severity of diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

Despite the launching of numerous new oral antiglycemic agents, metformin may provide further benefit on lowering risk of dementia beyond conventional glycemic control according to the real-world evidence.

### Dementia diagnosis is associated with changes in antidiabetic drug prescription: an open-cohort study of ∼ 130, 000 Swedish subjects over 14 years [^111TGmCd]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the antidiabetic drug prescription patterns in practically all major dementia types during more than a decade of observation. In this large national registry-based cohort, we determined that long-term pharmacological treatment of diabetes differs in patients with dementia in comparison to dementia-free subjects. The drug dispensation pattern we observed indicates a more conservative diabetes management with more extensive insulin utilization and lower probability of receiving DPP-4i, GLP-1a or SGLT-2i when diagnosed with dementia.

The whole cohort experienced frequent insulin dispensation; however, patients with dementia had significantly higher rate of insulin usage and this was apparent even in the yearly-stratified analyses. Older patients with type 2 diabetes receive insulin more frequently, and it is likely this trend is extended to patients with dementia. However, the necessity of insulin treatment could function as a proxy for more cardiovascular burden and generally less successful management of hyperglycemia, subsequently leading to higher risk of dementia (reverse causality). On the other hand, the explanation could lie in simplifying the prescription regimen; Swedish clinicians might be replacing combination treatment (reflected in the declining proportions of metformin and sulfonylureas) with one potent antidiabetic drug. Interestingly, two US studies found a decrease in number of diabetes medications after dementia diagnosis, while Weiner and colleagues reported higher use of insulin in patients with poorer health and longer diabetes duration.

However, this is unlikely to explain the 21% and 19% higher likelihood of new insulin prescription in naïve subjects and metformin users, respectively. Conceptually, insulin-associated weight gain could be the driving factor, as modest overweight might be protective in this frail patient group. Additionally, if needed, the Swedish patients with dementia and diabetes are provided with nursing assistance regarding insulin injections, therefore the possibility of inappropriate care due to cognitive decline should be decreased. On the other hand, this arrangement puts considerable strain on health care, with unclear frequency of unrecognized hypoglycemia due to decreased sensibility of the patient to its initial symptoms.

With such a large proportion of Swedish dementia patients being treated with insulin, we believe periodical continuous glucose monitoring are important especially in patients with advanced dementia or living alone, as cognitive decline increases the probability of hypoglycemia and vice versa.

### Metformin use and risk of delirium in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^111UEHbS]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Delirium is a precursor and risk factor for dementia, emphasizing the urgency of effective prevention and management strategies in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Identifying long-term, safe, and effective medications to prevent diabetes-related delirium is crucial because of its significant impact on this population. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of metformin against delirium in older adults with T2D, using a competing risk analysis of death to provide a more accurate assessment.

Research Design and Methods

Metformin users were compared with a cohort of nonusers. Multivariable Cox regression and Fine and Gray methods were used to assess the risk of delirium and mortality.

Results

Our study included 66,568 metformin users and 66,568 nonusers, matched by propensity score. The use of metformin was associated with a significantly lower risk of delirium, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 0.77 to 0.81. A dose-response relationship was observed, indicating that higher cumulative and daily doses of metformin were associated with greater reductions in delirium risk.

Conclusions

Metformin use is associated with a reduced risk of delirium in older adults with T2D, with higher doses offering greater protection.

Search results

Of the 505 potentially relevant studies identified using our search criteria, 23 comparisons out of 19 studies comprising a total of 285 966 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were involved in the meta-analysis. A total of 13 population-based cohorts, 3 cross-sectional studies and 3 case–control studies from 19 reports (4 of themprovided more than one independent cohort for different disease types or age groups) explored the risk of cognitive disorder, including cognitive dysfunction, dementia or AD among users of metformin, with one of the studies published only in conference abstract form. There are three population-based cohort studies exploring the association of PD and metformin exposure. Among them, the control group in one study included the patients with DM treated with glitazone, while in the other two studies, the control groups were just patients with DM without metformin treatment.

### Association between use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and the risk of incident dementia: a population-based cohort study [^112ujr2P]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes among adults was approximately 10.5% in 2021 and is projected to rise to 12.2% by 2045. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral arterial disease) complications. Cognitive decline is increasingly recognized as a complication associated with type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of developing dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, which are also increasing due to the aging population.

The pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction attributable to type 2 diabetes is still not completely understood. Some potential factors are age, glycemic control, duration of diabetes, obesity, associated vascular or other comorbidities. Previous evidence indicated that better glycemic control and use of antidiabetic medication are associated with a decreased risk of cognitive dysfunction. These findings have generated interest in the potential role of antidiabetic agents in reducing the risk of cognitive dysfunction among patients with type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have been conducted with first-line therapy such as metformin, but the findings were inconsistent. Some studies showed that metformin use was associated with a reduced risk of dementiain contrast to other studies that found metformin to be associated with an increased risk of dementia. In one meta-analysis of three studies, there was no association between metformin use and the risk of incident dementia compared with people with diabetes who were using non-metformin antidiabetic treatments (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06). These variations in findings are likely due to differences in study population, methodology and comparator group. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are the newest class of antidiabetic agents recommended as second-line or third-line treatment after metformin in the management of type 2 diabetes and shown to have cardiovascular and renal benefits. Preclinical studies showed that SGLT-2is prevent ischemia-related cerebral damage, and confer anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, preventing neuronal loss and enhancing neurogenesis. Several observational studies showed evidence of beneficial effects of SGLT-2i on cognitive function; however, these studies were limited by sample size, follow-up time, inclusion of people with a previous history of cognitive dysfunction and using a wide range of comparators.

### GLP-1RA comparative effectiveness against dementia onset relative to other antidiabetic medications in a large, multi-site cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes [^1174ArQq]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Diabetes is a key risk factor for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. A substantial and growing body of evidence suggests that some antidiabetic therapies may have a protective effect against cognitive decline in patients with diabetes. There is active research particularly regarding the neuroprotective effects of the drug class glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA). Mechanisms of action include increasing insulin sensitivity, inducing weight reduction through increased feelings of satiety, as well as reducing neuroinflammation, among others. A secondary analysis of randomized, placebo‐controlled trial data of patients with diabetes showed a significant reduction in cognitive decline among those in the GLP‐1RA treatment arm compared to a placebo control arm over 24 months. Several observational studies have shown reduced dementia risk in GLP‐1RA users, either compared to placebo or for every unit increase in GLP‐1RA dosage. These studies notably did not assess comparative effectiveness relative to other medications. Two target trial emulationstudies comparing GLP‐1RA use to active comparators (sulfonylureas [SU], dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors [DPP4i], metformin), adjusting for only baseline confounding, found similar protective effects of GLP‐1RAs.

### Effect of diabetes medications on the risk of developing dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eLBU4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, but we do not know whether specific diabetes medications ameliorate this risk. Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze such medication's effect on the risk of developing dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitive decline. Methods: We searched three databases until 21 November 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort, and case-control studies assessing association between antidiabetic medication and future dementia, MCI, or cognitive decline. We meta-analyzed studies separately for individual drug classes and their comparators (no medication, placebo, or another drug). We appraised study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale. Results: 42 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) versus placebo reduced dementia risk by 53% in three RCTs (n = 15,820, RR = 0.47[0.25, 0.86]) and 27% in three case-control studies (n = 312,856, RR = 0.73[0.54, 0.99], I² = 96%). Repaglinide was superior to glibenclamide by 0.8 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination scale in another RCT. Meta-analysis of seven longitudinal studies showed glitazones (n = 1,081,519, RR = 0.78[0.76, 0.81], I² = 0%) were associated with reduced dementia risk. Metformin (n = 999,349, RR = 0.94[0.79, 1.13], I² = 98.4%), sulfonylureas (RR = 0.98[0.78, 1.22], I² = 83.3%), dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors (DPP-1V) (n = 192,802, RR = 0.86[0.65, 1.15], I² = 92.9%) and insulin (n = 571,274, RR = 1.09[0.95, 1.25], I² = 94.8%) were not. Most studies were observational and limited by confounding by indication. Conclusions: In people with diabetes, RCTs consistently showed GLP-RAs reduce future dementia risk. Glitazones consistently showed protective effects, without heterogeneity, suggesting potential generalizability of these results. Metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, and DPP-1V studies had inconsistent findings. If information is available future studies should consider dosage, severity, and duration.

### Metformin use associated with reduced risk of dementia in patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nVz4L]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The initial search returned 862 citations which was reduced to 746 following the removal of duplicates. Twenty-three studies were identified after review of the titles and abstracts. Full-texts were retrieved and a further six studies were excluded for not including the relevant population, exposure, comparator, or outcome. A further three studies were excluded on the basis of scoring ≤ 50% on critical appraisal, leaving 14 included studies (Fig. 1). Most included papers were observational study designs, the majority being cohort studies, as well as four cross-sectional and one case-control study. Additionally, two RCTs were identified and included. Studies were carried out in Taiwan, USA, Australia, Germany, Singapore, UK, China, and Japan. Three of the studies carried out in Taiwan drew their data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, but either investigated different outcomes or utilized separate cohorts. Sample sizes varied from 114,199 to 27 and follow up varied from 24 weeks to 9 years (Table 1). Additional details on the covariates which were adjusted for in statistical analyses are included in Supplementary Table 1. Critical appraisal of the included studies showed that studies were rigorous in most areas (Supplementary Table 2). Exceptions were that the cohort studies had potentially impactful differences between groups at baseline and did not provide sufficient detail on loss-to-follow-up, neither of the RCTs reported whether assessors were blind, and most of the cross-sectional studies did not describe how metformin exposure was assessed.

### Causal inference in medical records and complementary systems pharmacology for metformin drug repurposing towards dementia [^116khZHp]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Metformin, a diabetes drug with anti-aging cellular responses, has complex actions that may alter dementia onset. Mixed results are emerging from prior observational studies. To address this complexity, we deploy a causal inference approach accounting for the competing risk of death in emulated clinical trials using two distinct electronic health record systems. In intention-to-treat analyses, metformin use associates with lower hazard of all-cause mortality and lower cause-specific hazard of dementia onset, after accounting for prolonged survival, relative to sulfonylureas. In parallel systems pharmacology studies, the expression of two AD-related proteins, APOE and SPP1, was suppressed by pharmacologic concentrations of metformin in differentiated human neural cells, relative to a sulfonylurea. Together, our findings suggest that metformin might reduce the risk of dementia in diabetes patients through mechanisms beyond glycemic control, and that SPP1 is a candidate biomarker for metformin's action in the brain.

### Metformin-based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapy and risk of dementia in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^115bdLaq]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to individuals with HbA1c < 7.5%, those with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% are at a higher risk of developing dementia later in life. Hsu et al. reported that the combination oral hypoglycemic therapy may reduce the risk of dementia. However, the selection of appropriate antidiabetic agents is critical, as inappropriate regimens may lead to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or glycemic variability — factors that have been associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Notably, certain medications, such as sulfonylureas (SUs), are associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Although their combination with MET is effective in lowering blood glucose levels, concerns persist regarding their potential long‐term effects on cognitive decline and dementia risk. To date, previous studies have not conclusively demonstrated that specific combinations of oral antihyperglycemic agents can reduce the incidence of dementia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether different MET‐based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapies are associated with a reduced risk of dementia in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.

### Association between metformin and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical observational studies [^112Gt9kC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the widely used drugs for the management of type 2 diabetes mellites (T2DM), metformin is increasingly believed to delay cognitive deterioration and therapeutically for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients especially those with T2DM. However, studies of the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in AD patients have reported contradictory results.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin and the risk of developing AD.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify clinical observational studies on the relationship between AD risk and metformin use published before December 20, 2021. Two investigators independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effect models.

Results

After screening a total of 1,670 records, we included 10 studies involving 229,110 participants. The meta-analysis showed no significant association between AD incidence and metformin exposure (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88–1.56, p = 0.291). However, subgroup analysis showed that among Asians, the risk of AD was significantly higher among metformin users than those who did not (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24–2.37, p = 0.001).

Conclusion

The available evidence does not support the idea that metformin reduces risk of AD, and it may, in fact, increase the risk in Asians. Further well-designed randomized controlled trials are required to understand the role played by metformin and other antidiabetic drugs in the prevention of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

### The effect of metformin on cognitive function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169imMn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Most people are familiar with metformin as a diabetic treatment option. Different positive benefits have been found for it, in addition to its anti-diabetes properties. Cognitive function enhancement is the most recent characteristic that has been studied. This study aimed to look at the evidence on the effects of metformin on cognitive performance. Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched systematically. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant documents, the findings were screened. The documents that remained were scanned and data were extracted. Nineteen studies were qualified for meta-analysis after evaluating 3827 identified records. There was no significant relationship between metformin therapy and cognitive performance in none of the studies including cross-sectionals, cohorts, and clinical trials (p > 0.05). Results show that metformin has no significant effect on improving cognitive function or protecting against any dementia including vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive impairment as well.

### Relationships between memory decline and the use of metformin or DPP4 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes with normal cognition or Alzheimer's disease, and the role APOE carrier status [^114g5Kyt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Few studies have examined memory decline among patients with type 2 diabetes using different oral hypoglycemic drugs.

Methods

Participants with normal cognition (NC) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia using a hypoglycemic medication (2005 to 2019) were identified from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Delayed memory was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised–Logical Memory test. Associations between oral drug classes and memory over time were examined using mixed‐effects models with inverse probability treatment weights.

Results

In NC (n = 1192), metformin use was associated with better memory performance over time, whereas in AD (n = 807), dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP4) inhibitor use was associated with a slower rate of memory decline. Interaction effects suggested greater benefit associated with DPP4 inhibitor use among APOE ε4 carriers.

Discussion

Associations between different oral hypoglycemic drugs and memory change were not consistent between cognitively normal elderly and those with AD dementia. APOE ε4 genotype modified some relationships.

### Use of oral diabetes medications and the risk of incident dementia in US veterans aged ≥ 60 years with type 2 diabetes [^115iogMj]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Studies have reported that antidiabetic medications (ADMs) were associated with lower risk of dementia, but current findings are inconsistent. This study compared the risk of dementia onset in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with sulfonylurea (SU) or thiazolidinedione (TZD) to patients with T2D treated with metformin (MET).

Research Design and Methods

This is a prospective observational study within a T2D population using electronic medical records from all sites of the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. Patients with T2D who initiated ADM from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, were aged ≥ 60 years at the initiation, and were dementia-free were identified. A SU monotherapy group, a TZD monotherapy group, and a control group (MET monotherapy) were assembled based on prescription records. Participants were required to take the assigned treatment for at least 1year. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia, and the two secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, or ICD, 10th Revision, codes. The risks of developing outcomes were compared using propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

Among 559106 eligible veterans (mean age 65.7 (SD 8.7) years), the all-cause dementia rate was 8.2 cases per 1000 person-years (95%CI 6.0 to 13.7). After at least 1year of treatment, TZD monotherapy was associated with a 22% lower risk of all-cause dementia onset (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.75 to 0.81), compared with MET monotherapy, and 11% lower for MET and TZD dual therapy (HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.86 to 0.93), whereas the risk was 12% higher for SU monotherapy (HR 1.12 95%CI 1.09 to 1.15).

Conclusions

Among patients with T2D, TZD use was associated with a lower risk of dementia, and SU use was associated with a higher risk compared with MET use. Supplementing SU with either MET or TZD may partially offset its prodementia effects. These findings may help inform medication selection for elderly patients with T2D at high risk of dementia.

### Effect of diabetes medications on the risk of developing dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113P752b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin

Thirty-one studies, including 3,284,828 participants, assessed the impact of metformin (Tables 2 and 3 ;). When we included the seven studies comparing risk of all-cause dementia in metformin users versus those taking other diabetes medication(s), there was no difference (RR = 0.94[0.79, 1.13], I² = 98.4%) in case-control and cohort studies (Figure 6). Results were similar when we compared metformin users with those on no diabetes medication (RR = 0.84[0.68,1.03], I² = 95.0%) (Figure 7). We conducted multiple sensitivity analyses, and there was no overall difference. Emulated trials and cohort studies did not indicate metformin had a protective effect, but case controls studies found a small effect (RR = 0.92[0.85, 0.99], I² = 67.7%) (1). We meta-analyzed 15 studies, 10 cohort studies, and five case-control studies, either taking no medication or other medication group with the outcome of dementia or Alzheimer's disease and found that the overall risk was 0.95 (95% CI = 0.84 to 1.08 with wide confidence intervals) of which two cohort studies were emulated trials (RR = 0.95[0.84, 1.08], I² = 97.8%).

### Incident dementia risk among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin versus alternative oral glucose-lowering therapy: an observational cohort study using UK primary healthcare records [^113L6PbJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

The substantial missingness for certain covariates, for example, ethnicity is problematic, because it is likely missing not at random, making techniques like multiple imputation unsuitable and results in a smaller population for the complete case analysis, potentially introducing selection bias. Also, missingness for covariates detailing baseline comorbidities could not be assessed as ascertainment relies solely on the presence of relevant Read codes. However, we hypothesize that individuals with diabetes are likely have more frequent GP consultations which would mitigate potential differential information bias. It is also reassuring that the fully adjusted models and minimally adjusted models gave similar estimates for both outcomes. Although the complete case analysis approach reduced the precision of estimates, it does not appear to have introduced bias. We also replicated our main findings in a HES-linked subgroup with improved record completeness.

### Glucose-lowering medications and post-dementia survival in patients with diabetes and dementia [^113nP4As]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The study's main strength lies in the large cohort of dementia and dementia-free subjects, long follow-up (up to 12 years after index date) and high coverage across the main data sources. SveDem's incident-case coverage was estimated at 36% in 2015, which is likely underestimated due to Sweden's decreasing dementia incidence. In addition, the new user design and time-updated exposure of all main GLD groups in combination with the accurate time-updated data on the major confounders greatly increases the study validity. Specifically, as patients' life experience evolves with time, the time-varying nature of drug exposure more closely reflects the clinical practice than the intention-to-treat approach. Indeed, we have evaluated both as-treated and intention-to-treat exposure approaches, showing the same direction, albeit not consistently significant results. Moreover, we have addressed the baseline and time-dependent confounding (using PS matching and inverse-probability weighting) to ensure a degree of comparability between dementia and dementia-free, and within the exposed and unexposed groups. Importantly, PS matching to sample dementia – dementia-free pairs has been supplemented by exact matching on the index year, to minimize the effect of evolving diabetes guidelines, and the inverse-probability weighting reflects the unique experience the subjects had in the cohort based on baseline and time-updated characteristics.

On the other hand, due to the absence of clinical reasoning behind the prescriptions (confounding by indication) and the study's observational design we cannot conclude causal relationships. Importantly, dementia and dementia-free were analyzed in parallel and not directly compared, as we had more prognostic variables in the dementia cohort, which could not have been adjusted for in dementia-free. However, some degree of comparability can be claimed, as the subjects were strictly matched on dementia status. The duration of diabetes could have been underestimated (no primary care data); however, due to identical data extraction in all subjects, we have no reason to believe this error was differential in dementia versus dementia-free or users and non-users. Importantly, the Drug Register data were available only from 2005, therefore some metformin, insulin, and sulfonylurea dispensations may have been missed. Conversely, the earliest dementia/index date was recorded in 2007, therefore we had minimum 2 years of prior dispensation data for all subjects. Unfortunately, none of the registers contained data on glycemia or other metabolic measures, and residual confounding was still present.

### No association between metformin initiation and incident dementia in older adults newly diagnosed with diabetes [^114JaXur]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has been suggested to reduce dementia risk; however, most epidemiologic studies have been limited by immortal time bias or confounding due to disease severity.

Objectives

To investigate the association of metformin initiation with incident dementia using strategies that mitigate these important sources of bias.

Methods

Residents of Ontario, Canada ≥ 66 years newly diagnosed with diabetes from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017 entered this retrospective population-based cohort. To consider the indication for metformin monotherapy initiation, people with hemoglobin A1c of 6.5%-8.0% and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were selected. Using the landmark method to address immortal time bias, exposure was grouped into "metformin monotherapy initiation within 180 days after new diabetes diagnosis" or "no glucose-lowering medications within 180 days". To address disease latency, 1-year lag time was applied to the end of the 180-day landmark period. Incident dementia was defined using a validated algorithm for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from propensity-score weighted Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

Over mean follow-up of 6.77 years from cohort entry, metformin initiation within 180 days after new diabetes diagnosis (N = 12,331; 978 events; 65,762 person-years) showed no association with dementia risk (aHR [95% CI] = 1.05 [0.96–1.15]), compared to delayed or no glucose-lowering medication initiation (N = 22,369; 1768 events; 117,415 person-years).

Conclusion

Early metformin initiation was not associated with incident dementia in older adults newly diagnosed with diabetes. The utility of metformin to prevent dementia was not supported.

### Comparative effect of metformin versus sulfonylureas with dementia and Parkinson's disease risk in US patients over 50 with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111CcwwJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD). Drug treatments for diabetes, such as metformin, could be used as novel treatments for these neurological conditions. Using electronic health records from the United States (OPTUM EHR) we aimed to assess the association of metformin with all-cause dementia, dementia subtypes and PD compared with sulfonylureas.

Research Design and Methods

A new user comparator study design was conducted in patients ≥ 50 years old with diabetes who were new users of metformin or sulfonylureas between 2006 and 2018. Primary outcomes were all-cause dementia and PD. Secondary outcomes were Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate the HRs. Subanalyses included stratification by age, race, renal function, and glycemic control.

Results

We identified 96140 and 16451 new users of metformin and sulfonylureas, respectively. Mean age was 66.4 ± 8.2 years (48% male, 83% Caucasian). Over the 5-year follow-up, 3207 patients developed all-cause dementia (2256 (2.3%) metformin, 951 (5.8%) sulfonylurea users) and 760 patients developed PD (625 (0.7%) metformin, 135 (0.8%) sulfonylurea users). After IPTW, HRs for all-cause dementia and PD were 0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28). HRs for AD, VD and MCI were 0.81 (0.70–0.94), 0.79 (0.63–1.00) and 0.91 (0.79–1.04). Stronger associations were observed in patients who were younger (< 75 years old), Caucasian, and with moderate renal function.

Conclusions

Metformin users compared with sulfonylurea users were associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD and VD but not with PD or MCI. Age and renal function modified risk reduction. Our findings support the hypothesis that metformin provides more neuroprotection for dementia than sulfonylureas but not for PD, but further work is required to assess causality.

Target trial emulation in the EHR from the US RPDR and UK CPRD

We emulated the target trial in cohorts from the US RPDR and UK CPRD EHR databases (Table 1) with a 1-year run-in period. Our target trial outcomes were time to first diagnosis of dementia or death in type 2 diabetics over age 50, starting on metformin- or sulfonylurea-monotherapy, and followed for at least 1 year. Of note, the 1-year run-in period was selected to ensure sufficient drug exposure before measuring outcomes. While the duration of a clinical trial is usually fixed, the duration of follow-up in the emulated trial is often much longer (US RPDR median: 5.0 years (max 12 years); UK CPRD median: 6.0 years (max 16 years)).

The US RPDR cohort, which was drawn from patients receiving primary care at an academic health care system, included 13,191 patients who started on metformin- (11,229; 85%) or sulfonylurea- monotherapy (1962; 15%) (Fig. 1a). Patients who had a diagnosis of dementia, or died within the first year of follow-up, were excluded from the study population to emulate the standard exclusion criterion in clinical trials of patients with baseline cognitive impairment or a high morbidity index. In addition, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD; see Extended Data Table 1 for definitions) at treatment initiation — a contraindication for metformin, but not for sulfonylureas — were excluded from the cohort. Metformin initiators were younger than their sulfonylurea counterparts (Table 2). Among the metformin initiators, there were more hypertensives and fewer missing values for baseline body mass index (BMI) than among the sulfonylurea initiators (Table 2). The baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels and other baseline characteristics, however, were comparable between the two groups (Table 2).

### Glucose-lowering medications and post-dementia survival in patients with diabetes and dementia [^112kdMW9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) is unknown among patients with dementia.

Objective

To analyze all-cause mortality among users of six GLDs in dementia and dementia-free subjects, respectively.

Methods

This was a longitudinal open-cohort registry-based study using data from the Swedish Dementia Registry, Total Population Register, and four supplemental registers providing data on dementia status, drug usage, confounders, and mortality. The cohort comprised 132,402 subjects with diabetes at baseline, of which 11,401 (8.6%) had dementia and 121,001 (91.4%) were dementia-free. Subsequently, comparable dementia - dementia-free pairs were sampled. Then, as-treated and intention-to-treat exposures to metformin, insulin, sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues (GLP-1a), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) were analyzed in the parallel dementia and dementia-free cohorts. Confounding was addressed using inverse-probability weighting and propensity-score matching, and flexible parametric survival models were used to produce hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association between GLDs and all-cause mortality.

Results

In the as-treated models, increased mortality was observed among insulin users with dementia (HR 1.34 [95%CI 1.24–1.45]) as well as in dementia-free subjects (1.54 [1.10–1.55]). Conversely, sulfonylurea was associated with higher mortality only in dementia subjects (1.19 [1.01–1.42]). GLP-1a (0.44 [0.25–0.78]) and SGLT-2i users with dementia (0.43 [0.23–0.80]) experienced lower mortality compared to non-users.

Conclusion

Insulin and sulfonylurea carried higher mortality risk among dementia patients, while GLP-1a and SGLT-2i were associated with lower risk. GLD-associated mortality varied between dementia and comparable dementia-free subjects. Further studies are needed to optimize GLD use in dementia patients.

### Early glycemic control and subsequent risk of incident dementia among new metformin users [^115bQbEu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People with diabetes have elevated dementia risk. Optimal glycemic treatment targets for dementia risk reduction among individuals initiating metformin monotherapy are unknown.

Methods

We used Danish health registry data to identify metformin monotherapy initiators aged 50+ in Northern Denmark during 2000–2018. We examined the relation between early glycemic control, HbA1c reduction magnitude, and their combination with incident dementia using standard hazard models and propensity-score based restricted and weighted models, which better address confounding and mimic a clinical trial. We explored effects by age, calendar year of metformin initiation, and presence of cardiovascular disease.

Results

Among 46,332 metformin initiators (median age 65 years), 83% achieved an HbA1c level < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) within one year after metformin initiation and 1,432 (3.2%) developed dementia over a median 5.6 years of follow-up. Both standard and propensity-score restricted/weighted analyses suggested elevated dementia risk at achieved HbA1c levels > 7% (> 53 mmol/mol), but little difference in dementia risk among those achieving tight (HbA1c of 6.5% to < 7%/48 to < 53 mmol/mol) or very tight glycemic control (HbA1c of 6% to < 6.5%/42 to < 48 mmol/mol or < 6%/ < 42 mmol/mol). While p-values for interaction were non-significant, point estimates suggested benefits of early glycemic control on dementia risk were limited to persons without established cardiovascular disease and take years to manifest.

Conclusion

Our findings support established recommendations for early glycemic control (i.e. HbA1c < 7%/ < 53 mmol/mol) in type 2 diabetes for dementia risk reduction, with little evidence of benefit for pursuing lower targets (i.e. < 6.5%/ < 48 mmol/mol, < 6%/ < 42mmol/mol).

### Dementia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: comparing metformin with no pharmacological treatment [^113XKLxM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, results from two cohort studies of US veterans with T2D showed that new users of metformin had lower risk of dementia than new users of sulfonylureas (another first-line anti-diabetes drug) among those aged < 75 years. However, it was not possible to determine whether the difference could be attributed to a beneficial neuroprotective effect of metformin or a potential neurotoxicity of sulfonylureas, a common limitation in comparative effectiveness studies. A recent US/UK collaborative study, including our group, found that metformin initiators had lower all-cause mortality and lower dementia risk than sulfonylureas initiators in both the UK CPRD and the US RPDR databases (HR = 0.86 [95% CI: 0.77–0.96] and 0.81 [95% CI: 0.69–0.94] for dementia, respectively). Parallel in vitro system pharmacology analysis also showed reduced brain expression of AD-related proteins (apolipoprotein E [APOE] and SPP1) by pharmacologic concentrations of metformin, indicative of an independent biological effect of metformin on dementia risk. In the current study, our analysis comparing metformin initiators with a "clean control group", defined as T2D patients not requiring anti-diabetes medication, who had lower mean HbA1c level both prior to baseline and throughout the follow-up period than the metformin group, provides further evidence of a neuroprotective effect of metformin, going beyond the glycemic control. Patients in this control group were also less likely to be current smokers or have obesity, hypertension, or cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Given that hyperglycemia, smoking, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are established risk factors for dementia, their higher prevalence in the metformin group would be expected to affect results by obscuring a possible beneficial effect of metformin. Therefore, the observed lower dementia risk in the metformin group adds credence to a true pharmacological effect of metformin on reducing dementia incidence. The fact that the metformin-treated group continued to show higher HbA1c levels than the control group despite treatment further suggests that metformin may act beyond its effect on hyperglycemia and "reverse" the elevated dementia risk due to diabetes and other risk factors in this group of treated patients.

Among a total of 20 comparisons out of 17 observational studies focusing on cognitive impairment (including cognitive dysfunction, dementia and AD), 5 cohorts from Taiwan used the same database of the National Health Insurance (NHI), but the findings were conflicting. Hsu et al reported in 2011 that, compared with T2DM without any medication, metformin alone decreased the risk of dementia by 24% (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98). The second study in 2014 by Cheng et al found that metformin treatment alone in T2DM failed in reducing dementia compared with sulfonylureas (SUs) (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.28). Another study of the same year initiated by Huang et al also failed to confirm the benefits of metformin in AD incidence as both the monotherapy (HR 0.69 (0.28–1.71) or the combination therapy (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.26). However, it is unsettling that the cohort study published in 2017 by Kuan et al observed that the metformin exposure increased all-cause dementia by 66% (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.04), including both AD (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.79) and vascular dementia (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.22). However, the latest study in 2019 by Tseng found the incidence of dementia in metformin users decreased by 29% (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) compared with metformin never users in newly diagnosed diabetes. Results of cohort studies from other countries or regions were mostly neutral, but there were also improvements 19 22 or exacerbationson cognitive decline with metformin. Among them, a cohort study of US veterans found metformin, compared with SU, had a neutral effect in patients with DM older than 75 years and a protective effect on individuals between 65 and 75 years. By contrast, a population-based study in UK demonstrated that HR of incident dementia with metformin users increased by 42% (95% CI 1.02% to 1.98%, p = 0.038), and incident AD also had an increasing trend but failed to reach the statistical significance (HR 1.6 (0.87–2.93), p = 0.131). There were three cross-sectional studies: the first study of Japan concluded a protective effect of metformin in cognitive dysfunction (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99). The second study from the United States found that patients with diabetes with metformin intake were less likely to have cognitive decline effects (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.0; p = 0.05). The latest one from Northern Ireland showed a trend toward higher cognitive dysfunction in hyperglycemia with metformin treatment (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.74). In all three case–control studies published so far, two studies from UKand Australia, respectively, had concluded that cognitive performance became worse (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.68, and OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.75) in the metformin intake group; the latter one also found the association was weakened after adjusting for vitamin B 12 levels (OR 1.75, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.78). Another German case–control study yielded a neutral result (with vs without metformin OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04).

### Relationships between memory decline and the use of metformin or DPP4 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes with normal cognition or Alzheimer's disease, and the role APOE carrier status [^111pfWGt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Few studies have examined memory decline among patients with type 2 diabetes using different oral hypoglycemic drugs.

Methods

Participants with normal cognition (NC) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia using a hypoglycemic medication (2005 to 2019) were identified from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Delayed memory was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised-Logical Memory test. Associations between oral drug classes and memory over time were examined using mixed-effects models with inverse probability treatment weights.

Results

In NC (n = 1192), metformin use was associated with better memory performance over time, whereas in AD (n = 807), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor use was associated with a slower rate of memory decline. Interaction effects suggested greater benefit associated with DPP4 inhibitor use among APOE ε4 carriers.

Discussion

Associations between different oral hypoglycemic drugs and memory change were not consistent between cognitively normal elderly and those with AD dementia. APOE ε4 genotype modified some relationships.

### Long-term metformin usage and cognitive function among older adults with diabetes [^111WGdGt]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence strongly supports the important role of insulin resistance in cognitive decline and dementia and suggests that insulin sensitizers may protect against cognitive decline in diabetic and pre-diabetic individuals. Inconclusive results have been reported in clinical trials of rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer that also increases cardiovascular mortality risks. No study has yet reported a protective cognitive effect of metformin, an insulin-sensitizing biguanide widely used in diabetic patients. We studied 365 older persons aged 55 and over in the population-based Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study with diabetes who were followed up over 4 years. The odds ratios (OR) of association of metformin use (n = 204) versus non-use (n = 161) with cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Exam ≤ 23), and by duration: up to 6 years (n = 114) and more than 6 years (n = 90) were evaluated in cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariate analyses. Controlling for age, education, diabetes duration, fasting blood glucose, vascular and non-vascular risk factors, metformin use showed a significant inverse association with cognitive impairment in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.25–0.95). Metformin use showed significant linear trends of association across duration of use in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (p = 0.018 and p = 0.002, respectively), with use for more than 6 years significantly associated with lowest risk of cognitive impairment in both cross-sectional analysis (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.11–0.80) and in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.12–0.60). No significant interactive effects of metformin use with APOE-ε4, depression, or fasting glucose level were observed. Among individuals with diabetes, long-term treatment with metformin may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Further studies should establish the role of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and the protective role of metformin in the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

### Metformin-based oral antihyperglycemic combination therapy and risk of dementia in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^111bLnR9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the other medications, CCBs have been associated with a higher risk of dementia compared to patients not using these drugs, consistent with the Wu et al. However, the relationship between CCBs and dementia remains unclear and requires further clinical study. Conversely, antiplatelet drugs and HMG‐CoA inhibitors, which primarily treat vascular diseases, are associated with a lower risk of dementia. Because dementia often arises from brain vascular diseases or blockages, maintaining good vascular health with these medications may reduce the risk of dementia.

In our sensitivity analyses comprising the different follow‐up exclusion periods, the MET–TZD group showed no significant difference in HRs compared to the control group. Conversely, the MET–DPP4i group consistently exhibited a significantly lower risk of dementia across all exclusion periods, with HRs suggesting a protective effect. The MET–glinides group demonstrated HRs slightly > 1.0, although none reached significance under any exclusion condition. However, the stringent inclusion criteria used in this study may have led to the exclusion of a substantial number of patients during data processing, potentially resulting in a slight overestimation of effect sizes and introducing selection bias.

This study has several inherent limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the use of administrative claims data from the NHIRD precludes access to important non‐clinical variables, including medication adherence, glycemic control indicators (e.g. HbA1c), lifestyle behaviors, and environmental exposures. The absence of these covariates may have led to residual confounding and potentially attenuated the observed associations between antihyperglycemic regimens and dementia risk. Second, due to the retrospective cohort design, the study can only establish associations, not causality. Third, T2DM was identified solely based on ICD‐9‐CM diagnostic codes. Although prior validation studies using the NHIRD have demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a positive predictive value of 92%, the absence of biochemical confirmation such as fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c raises the possibility of misclassification bias. Furthermore, dementia subtypes could not be distinguished in this claims‐based dataset, limiting our ability to assess subtype‐specific effects.

### Causal inference in medical records and complementary systems pharmacology for metformin drug repurposing towards dementia [^1147ekh7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, while we addressed many sources of confounding, there were likely others that were unavailable or inadequately measured. In particular, the level of education was systematically unavailable in either dataset, of concern since it is known to affect both the exposure and outcomes of interest in this study. In addition, relevant lifestyle factors, like diet and physical activityand a genetic risk factor, ApoE genotypes, were unavailable. Furthermore, the strong effect of age, the changes in prescribing patterns of sulfonylureas and metformin over the observation period, gene-environment interactions, and the complex differences observed in age at baseline, length of follow-up, and calendar time across the two treatments raises the possibility of residual confounding. Beyond this, in EHR, data missingness is very often informative and can lead to biases in study results –. Second, the absence of linkage to claims data in the US RPDR cohort prevented us from verifying that patients were truly treatment initiators, or from verifying the length of exposure by confirming that prescriptions were filled and refilled at the expected rate. Third, since this study was an intention-to-treat analysis, it did not include potential add-on drugs incorporated later in the patient's clinical course or consider antidiabetic treatment switches. Thus, transition from monotherapy to a dual (or more) hypoglycemic regimen could be a possible source of confounding for both dementia and death outcomes. Fourth, this study might suffer from measurement errors in the primary outcome of interest. Dementia is under-diagnosed and under-recorded, both in the USand UK. Patients and their families may fail to mention symptoms to their primary care physicians and physicians might not routinely screen for cognitive health. Even when such symptoms are recognized and described directly or indirectly in physicians' notes, the relevant diagnostic code or prescription used here as a proxy for the disease might not be present ever — or may not appear until late in the course. In other cases, dementia might be overcoded. Hence, in the future, we aim to deploy text mining and natural language processing techniques on clinical notes, radiologic image analysis, and other clinical data to better identify subjects with dementia and more precisely determine the timing of disease onset. Fifth, while our study was conducted in two different populations, both are primarily white and have access to health care. While the UK CPRD population is fairly representative of the UK population, the US RPDR population is limited to a single region, less diverse, and more advantaged than the US population as a whole. Sixth, in our mechanistic studies, we approximated chronic exposure to metformin and glyburide through relatively short durations, in cultured human neural cells that did not include all the cell types in the brain, including microglia. The candidate pharmacodynamic biomarkers for metformin's actions in the brain (SPP1 and APOE) will need to be validated in the CSF of patients taking metformin or a sulfonylurea.

### Comparative effect of metformin versus sulfonylureas with dementia and Parkinson's disease risk in US patients over 50 with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117D7HK1]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind and uses a variety of statistical methods to reduce bias and validate the robustness of the results. This study supports and extends the current literature regarding the potential neuroprotective benefits of metformin. The clinical applicability of this study showing potential neuroprotection of metformin is highlighted by recent clinical trials underway investigating metformin for the prevention of cognitive impairment and dementia. Furthermore, a recent genetic study also highlights causal effects between metformin and dementia. This work highlights the need for careful consideration of age, race, and renal function in selection of participants for clinical trials to address benefits and safety concerns for the repurposing of metformin. Further research is required to understand the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of metformin which may lead to novel drug development opportunities.

### Heterogeneous treatment effects of metformin on risk of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: a longitudinal observational study [^116nxF5f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this longitudinal observational study using the NACC database, we found that metformin users were significantly associated with a decreased risk of dementia in a population with T2D compared to non‐users. There was no significant difference between metformin monotherapy and metformin combination therapy regarding the risk of dementia. Additionally, we identified the three most influential factors (neuropsychiatric disorders, antidepressants, and NSAIDs), that contributed to the HTEs. Participants were classified into four HTE subgroups with the maximum differences in dementia risk attributable to metformin. The metformin‐using subgroup with no neuropsychiatric disorders and no NSAIDs (subgroup 1) had a lower risk of dementia, while those with neuropsychiatric disorders and no antidepressant use (subgroup 3) had a higher risk associated with metformin.

Our findings were in line with previous studies indicating that metformin conferred a protective effect against dementia in people with T2D. For instance, one national cohort study involving 210,237 showed that new users of metformin had a reduced risk of dementia compared to non‐users, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84 −0.92). Another retrospective cohort study involving 28,640 older veterans with T2D showed that metformin initiators had a lower risk of dementia than new users of sulfonylureas over an average follow‐up of 5 years (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79 −0.99). While the exact mechanisms of action underlying the decreased risk of dementia associated with metformin are yet to be fully understood, several potential mechanisms have been proposed. First, metformin has been shown to inhibit advanced glycation end products, which contribute to degenerative processes by accelerating the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) in various regions of the brain. Second, metformin exerts inhibition of tau phosphorylation and Aβ by activating the adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Third, metformin may improve memory function by decreasing neuronal insulin resistance and neuroinflammation.

### Metformin vs sulfonylurea use and risk of dementia in US veterans aged ≥ 65 years with diabetes [^117R34dn]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether metformin is associated with a lower incidence of dementia than sulfonylureas.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of US veterans ≥ 65 years of age with type 2 diabetes who were new users of metformin or a sulfonylurea and had no dementia. Follow-up began after 2 years of therapy. To account for confounding by indication, we developed a propensity score (PS) and used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methods. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of incident dementia.

Results

We identified 17,200 new users of metformin and 11,440 new users of sulfonylureas. Mean age was 73.5 years and mean HbA1c was 6.8%. Over an average follow-up of 5 years, 4,906 cases of dementia were diagnosed. Due to effect modification by age, all analyses were conducted using a piecewise model for age. Crude hazard ratio [HR] for any dementia in metformin vs sulfonylurea users was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–0.73) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.72–0.83) for those < 75 years of age and ≥ 75 years of age, respectively. After PS IPTW adjustment, results remained significant in veterans < 75 years of age (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.79–0.99), but not for those ≥ 75 years of age (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.87–1.05). A lower risk of dementia was also seen in the subset of younger veterans who had HbA1C values ≥ 7% (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63–0.91), had good renal function (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.76–0.97), and were white (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.99).

Conclusions

After accounting for confounding by indication, metformin was associated with a lower risk of subsequent dementia than sulfonylurea use in veterans < 75 years of age. Further work is needed to identify which patients may benefit from metformin for the prevention of dementia.

### Risk of dementia after initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in adults aged 40–69 years with type 2 diabetes: population based cohort study [^111DfNGm]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

A recent prospective cohort study found that use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for more than three years improved cognitive function scores compared with non-use. Although this finding suggests that longer treatment might generate more benefits, the study was subject to confounding by indication and immortal time bias owing to the comparison between users (eg, prevalent users) and non-users of SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our study comparing new users of two competing drugs, SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors, further supports favourable results for early initiation of the drug and prolonged treatment.

We observed attenuated results with lag time applied in intention-to-treat analyses and with longer grace periods. Since incidence rates of genital infections continually decreased among users of SGLT-2 inhibitors in these analyses, loss of treatment effect associated with misclassification of drug use played a role in driving the results towards null. Initiators of SGLT-2 inhibitors, however, were more frequently censored by treatment change than initiators of DPP-4 inhibitors. Because patients with risk factors for treatment change (non-adherence, inefficacy, or adverse events) can be more prone to develop dementia than patients without these risk factors, informative censoring may have overestimated the results in our as treated analysis. Nevertheless, the overall results between as treated and intention-to-treat analyses were similar (table 2), suggesting non-substantial informative censoring.

In subgroup analyses, we observed highly consistent results, but did not find an interaction between treatment and individual characteristics of the study population. Unlike the expectation that SGLT-2 inhibitors might be associated with greater benefits against the risk of vascular dementia than Alzheimer's disease, the magnitude of association was accompanied by widely overlapping 95% CIs between the two types of dementia for all analyses. Thus, it is not surprising to observe no interaction between treatment and baseline cardiovascular risk. A recent meta-analysis also reported that the pooled beneficial association between dementia and use of SGLT-2 inhibitors versus other antiglycaemic treatments was not affected by cardiovascular diseases. These findings suggest that the underlying mechanisms are not limited to cardiorenal pathways, possibly involving direct neuroprotective pathways observed in preclinical studies. According to previous studies on metformin monotherapy versus no treatment, metformin was not associated with incident dementia. Based on these findings, concurrent use of metformin is unlikely to interact with SGLT-2 inhibitors in modifying the risk of dementia.

### Association between metformin and neurodegenerative diseases of observational studies: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113H3hi8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Aging becomes a global growing issue, accompanied by an increase in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) related to aging. ND is an umbrella term for various types of central nervous system (CNS) degenerative disorders, including dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, these disorders caused by progressive degeneration or/and death of neurons are currently without a disease-specific cure and lead to a heavy social and financial burden. The clinical trials of the new drugs for NDs are currently at a stagnant stage with a frustrating failure to success ratio of 100:1. Dementia is the most common degenerative disease of the nervous system, with an estimate of 40–50 million people affected worldwide. It is characterized by a progressive decline of cognitive function. As the second most common type of NDs, the global number of people living with PD more than doubled from 2.5 million in 1990 to 6.1 million in 2016, which is characterized with movement impairment. However, the increase was not solely due to aging because the age-standardised prevalence rates were also increased. More and more studies have shown that both dementia and PD are related to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, which has been regarded as the most modifiable risk factor. Growing evidence suggests that the mesolimbic dopamine system is finely tuned by insulin action in the brain. Dopamine might mediate the central and peripheral insulin sensitivities, which indicate the relationship between NDs and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, some kinds of diabetes drugs have been reported to have important impacts on the pathogenesis of these two major kinds of NDs.

As a top-tier drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the role of metformin in dementia and PD is highly inconsistent, both in animal models and in clinical studies. At present, randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies on metformin in the clinical study of the degenerative nervous system were very few, which may be limited for the nature of NDs, which takes a long time to develop. It is insufficient to evaluate the risk changes of NDs in such a relatively short term. To better understand this issue, we performed a systemic review with meta-analysis of available clinical observational studies that investigate the effect of metformin on ND development.

### Causal inference in medical records and complementary systems pharmacology for metformin drug repurposing towards dementia [^112BkPdn]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Our harmonized Drug Repurposing in Alzheimerʼs Disease (DRIAD)-EHR approach — with analyses conducted in two very different patient populations and carefully adjusted for baseline differences in age and other risk factors — demonstrates a robust reduction in the hazard of death in patients treated with metformin compared to those treated with sulfonylureas, consistent with previous reports. In both cohorts, we note that the survival curves between the two treatment groups separate ~3 years after treatment initiation, and that this separation persists for a long time (12 years observed in US RPDR and 16 in UK CPRD).

Metformin reduced the hazard of dementia onset in the US and UK cohorts compared to sulfonylureas, but the risk differences between the drugs over time were clinically negligible

Death is a competing event that precludes the development of dementia, but the use of a competing risks analysis in previous studies, has been limited: death has been considered as a competing event for dementia only in a proportional hazards model where the hazard ratio is the measure of treatment effect. Here, we emulated a target trial of metformin vs. sulfonylureas in cognitively asymptomatic type 2 diabetics, estimating both the time-invariant hazard ratio and the time-dependent cumulative incidence function (CIF) for dementia, using a causal competing risks framework. We defined the average treatment effect (ATE) as the difference between risk functions corresponding to two potential outcomes (for definitions, see "Methods").

### Risk of dementia among patients with diabetes in a primary care management program… [^111esfFA]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with T2D, the findings strengthened evidence of an association of glycemic control with dementia incidence, and revealed that a multidisciplinary primary care diabetes management program was associated with beneficial outcomes for T2D patients against dementia and its major subtypes. A moderate glycemic control target of HbA1C between 6. 5% and
7. 5% was associated with lower dementia incidence. During follow-up, 1938 patients in the RAMP-DM group and 2728 patients in the usual care group received a diagnosis of dementia. The incidence rate of dementia was 9. 31 per 1000 person-years for the RAMP-DM and
14. 02 per 1000 person-years for the usual care group. The RRR was 29. 0% for all-cause dementia,
18. 0% for AD, 39. 1% VD, and
31. 0% for other or unspecified dementia. The study outcome showed that patients in RAMP-DM had a 28% lower risk for all-cause dementia incidence. Compared with literature from a previous meta-analysis4, 5, 30–32 that showed the risk ratio between T2D and dementia ranged from 1. 33 to
1. 62, patients in RAMP-DM had a substantially lower risk for dementia but they were still at slightly higher risk than those without T2D. For diabetic complications, studies have found that nephropathy, 33 diabetic retinopathy, 34, 35 and cardiovascular complications36–38 are associated with a higher risk of dementia. In interventional studies, a systematic review39 reported that the use of metformin is associated with lower risks for cognitive impairment and dementia, whereas the risk of dementia or cognitive impairment for patients with T2D in multifactorial interventions has not been reported in existing studies. 16, 19–21.

### Glycemic control over multiple decades and dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes… [^114w1Jc7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Participants with more than 50% of HbA1c measurements at 9% to less than 10% or 10% or more had greater risk of dementia compared with those who had 50% or less of measurements in those categories. Conclusions and Relevance In this study dementia risk was greatest among adults with cumulative HbA1c concentrations of 9% or more. These results support currently recommended relaxed glycemic targets for older people with type 2 diabetes. Finally, across all HbA1c categories, we compared dementia hazard in those with 75% or more of measurements within the same glycemic category with hazard in those with less stable HbA1c measurements. The age-adjusted incidence of dementia by HbA1c category is presented in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.

The lowest incidence of dementia was seen in individuals with 75% or more of HbA1c measurements in the category of 6% to less than 7%. The greatest incidence of dementia was in those with 75% or more of HbA1c measurements in the range of 10% or greater. The greatest hazard of dementia was observed in those with majority HbA1c measurements of 10% or more compared with those with less than 50% of measurements in that range. Point estimates were similar in models further adjusting for baseline dysglycemic events, microvascular and macrovascular disease, and number of HbA1c measurements. Compared with the category of less than 6%, the hazard of dementia in the 9% to less than 10% and 10% or greater groups was 1. 44 and
1. 68, respectively.

### Cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents and dementia risk… [^115ocDFv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Results Twenty-six randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion, of which 23 trials reported the incidence of dementia or cognitive impairment, including 12 trials evaluating SGLT2is, 10 trials evaluating GLP-1RAs, and 1 trial evaluating pioglitazone. randomized clinical trials reporting a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, and metformin and pioglitazone are recommended as second-line treatments. 6, 7 Observational evidence suggests that certain glucose-lowering drug classes, such as SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs, may have a neuroprotective effect. 8, 9 However, to date, the association of cardioprotective classes of glucose-lowering therapies with risk of dementia has been inconsistent, prompting the need for an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. 10, 11.

Twenty-three trials reported dementia or cognitive impairment on follow-up, 12 trials evaluated SGLT2is, 10 trials evaluated GLP-1RAs, and 1 trial evaluated pioglitazone. 25–39, 41–45 Dementia or cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 93 participants in the intervention group and 119 participants in the control group on follow-up. In this meta-analysis, a larger risk reduction in dementia was associated with randomization to receive GLP-1RAs than SGLT2i classes. This may be partly explained by differences in populations enrolled, with a higher all-cause dementia event rate noted among the control group of GLP-1RA trials compared with SGLT2i trials, with a resultant increase in statistical power to detect associations. The incidence of all-cause dementia and vascular dementia among adults with diabetes in prospective cohort studies was estimated to be 14. 2 to
16. 8 per 1000 patient-years and 1. 8 to
3.

2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively, more than double the rate reported in this study. 60, 61 Therefore, the absolute risk reduction reported is most likely an underestimate, and the real-world absolute risk reduction of cardioprotective glucose-lowering therapy is likely to be greater by approximately 0. 5% to
0. 6%.

### Occurrence and progression of dementia in a community population aged 75 years and older… [^117JnkoQ]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

At baseline, 225 cases of dementia were detected, giving an overall prevalence of 12. 4%. Compared with those not taking antihypertensive medication, subjects taking diuretics had a higher score on the MMSE and a lower prevalence of dementia. Logistic regression analysis showed that subjects taking diuretics had an odds ratio of 0. 4 for dementia, after adjustment for age, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Among the 1301 subjects, 584 took at least 1 type of antihypertensive drug at baseline. Subjects taking antihypertensive medication had an adjusted RR of 0. 7 for dementia. There was no difference in the MMSE scores between those taking diuretics and those not taking antihypertensive medication. Subjects taking diuretics had a significantly reduced incidence of dementia.

The reduced risk of dementia was more pronounced among those receiving diuretic monotherapy. In the subpopulation with a baseline MMSE score of greater than 23, subjects taking diuretics had an adjusted RR of 0. 7 for dementia, and subjects receiving diuretic monotherapy had an adjusted RR of 0.
6. In addition, the inclusion of baseline MMSE scores in the models produced similar results regarding the use of diuretics. There was no difference in the baseline MMSE score between those taking and those not taking diuretics. Subjects not taking diuretics had a decline of 17% every year from the baseline score, which was 2 times more than the decline of those taking diuretics. By using a multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, the use of diuretics was found to be inversely related to the rate of cognitive decline.
