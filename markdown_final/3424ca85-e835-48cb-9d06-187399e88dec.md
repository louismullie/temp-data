## Question

Do you anticoagulate nephrotic syndrome patients? What situation do you anticoagulate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and in what situations to anticoagulate patients with nephrotic syndrome, including thresholds, agents, special populations, and how to monitor and stop therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and baseline thrombotic risk in nephrotic syndrome. Then, I should verify which clinical features modify risk, especially serum albumin, histology, and proteinuria. Next, I will review guideline-based thresholds for prophylaxis versus treatment, and reconcile adult versus pediatric recommendations. After that, I need to check the choice of anticoagulant, including DOACs, and dosing in CKD. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like pregnancy, central venous lines, and perioperative management, and outline monitoring and stopping rules with attention to bleeding risk and anticoagulation-related nephropathy.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology driving thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome, because that frames risk and agent selection. Urinary losses of anticoagulants such as antithrombin III and protein S, combined with hepatic overproduction of fibrinogen and coagulation factors V and VIII, create a hypercoagulable state; platelet activation and impaired fibrinolysis further increase risk, and the risk is highest early in the disease course, particularly within the first 3–6 months [^1153q4U2] [^115eftH5] [^116MdxTo] [^111295fm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who to anticoagulate. I need to check which clinical features independently raise thrombotic risk. Severe hypoalbuminemia is the strongest predictor, with risk rising as albumin falls below 3.0 g/dL and escalating below 2.5 g/dL. Membranous nephropathy carries higher VTE risk than other primary glomerulopathies. Heavy proteinuria, especially above 10 g/day, further augments risk. Additional factors such as obesity, sepsis, AKI, lupus, and intravenous corticosteroids add risk, while arterial events track with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and eGFR rather than albumin alone [^115zekMt] [^115KPDH2] [^116UYHhk] [^111XN7QW].

> Next, I should review adult prophylaxis thresholds and reconcile guideline nuances. KDIGO 2021 recommends considering prophylactic anticoagulation in membranous nephropathy with nephrotic syndrome when serum albumin is less than 20 g/L by bromocresol purple or less than 25 g/L by bromcresol green, with a parallel assessment of bleeding risk; KDOQI commentary aligns with this and emphasizes that factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors have significant albumin binding and are not recommended for prophylaxis in NS at this time, favoring warfarin or LMWH when anticoagulation is indicated [^115KPDH2] [^112GYEDG] [^115DREJx] [^112fM98g]. Wait, let me verify the practical thresholds used outside trials; many centers operationalize prophylaxis when albumin is below 20–25 g/L, particularly in MN, and some extend consideration to other NS etiologies at very low albumin with additional risk factors, acknowledging the evidence base is largely observational and decision-analytic [^11175oeQ] [^115VkEi7].

> I will now examine pediatric guidance, because it differs materially from adult practice. Routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended in children with steroid-sensitive NS. Instead, consider prophylaxis during relapses when additional risk factors are present, and in congenital nephrotic syndrome or when central venous lines are necessary, where prophylactic anticoagulation is advised for the duration of the line and in states of increased thrombotic risk such as acute illness, dehydration, or thrombocytosis. Hematology input is reasonable when familial thrombophilia is suspected [^117Dzf9A] [^1134Kj5L] [^113Msyvx] [^116xPxhZ] [^114Q4oMQ].

> Let me think about treatment of established thrombosis, because that is a different question than prophylaxis. For confirmed VTE, including renal vein thrombosis, full-dose anticoagulation with LMWH or warfarin is standard, with duration individualized to the presence of provoking factors and disease activity; DOACs have emerging but limited evidence in NS and are not first-line for prophylaxis, though case series suggest feasibility with careful selection and monitoring [^115DREJx] [^112fM98g] [^112iToy3] [^115KDFKq].

> I should confirm agent selection and dosing in CKD, since many NS patients have reduced eGFR. LMWH and warfarin remain preferred for prophylaxis and treatment in NS. If LMWH is used in advanced CKD, dose reduction and anti-Xa monitoring are commonly practiced, and for warfarin, INR-based monitoring is standard. DOACs require caution due to albumin binding and urinary loss, with apixaban favored over rivaroxaban if a DOAC is chosen off-label, and dose adjustments based on renal function and body weight are essential. Perioperative interruption should follow kidney function–adjusted DOAC intervals, typically 1–2 days for standard risk and longer if eGFR is below 50 mL/min [^115DREJx] [^111uyRM7] [^111eH6hZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy? I need to ensure teratogenic agents are avoided. Coumadin is contraindicated in pregnancy, and LMWH is the anticoagulant of choice when indicated; in women with nephrotic syndrome who are pregnant or postpartum, coordinate with MFM to individualize thromboprophylaxis given the additive thrombophilia of pregnancy and NS [^112XfxuU] [^116UqLe2].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that modify risk and management. Central venous lines in NS markedly increase thrombosis risk. If a line is necessary, provide prophylactic anticoagulation for the duration of the line and consider antithrombin III supplementation in select high-risk settings, recognizing that evidence for ATIII in NS is limited and decisions should be individualized. Perioperative interruption of anticoagulation should balance thrombotic and bleeding risks with kidney function–based holding intervals for DOACs [^116xPxhZ] [^115PF8Ph] [^112diCYb] [^111eH6hZ].

> I need to ensure I address bleeding risk and a potential pitfall unique to NS. Anticoagulation-related nephropathy is a recognized complication of supratherapeutic anticoagulation in proteinuric kidneys and can present with abrupt AKI and macroscopic hematuria; maintaining therapeutic rather than supratherapeutic intensity and avoiding unnecessary combination with antiplatelet agents reduces risk, and vigilance for hematuria with rising creatinine should prompt evaluation for ARN [^111y2Jiv] [^116rYsPv].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and stopping rules, because duration is often unclear. Many events cluster early, so prophylaxis, when used, is typically continued until albumin recovers above approximately 2.5–3.0 g/dL and for at least several months after remission, with periodic reassessment of thrombotic and bleeding risk; in children, discontinue prophylaxis when albumin normalizes and additional risk factors resolve, and in adults, align with guideline risk–benefit reassessment at follow-up visits [^11175oeQ] [^111aPzGQ] [^117Dzf9A].

> Let me reconsider the role of aspirin, because I initially thought it might substitute for anticoagulation in high VTE risk. Wait, that overstates its benefit. KDIGO suggests aspirin for arterial event risk when albumin is modestly low, but it does not replace anticoagulation for VTE prevention in high-risk NS; thus, aspirin may be layered for arterial risk in selected patients with low bleeding risk, but should not be combined with anticoagulants given bleeding concerns [^116jfyJD] [^115KPDH2] [^116rYsPv].

> In summary, I should confirm that prophylactic anticoagulation is not routine for all NS but is reasonable in adults with membranous nephropathy and severe hypoalbuminemia, typically albumin below 20–25 g/L depending on assay, after assessing bleeding risk, and in children with congenital NS or when high-risk features are present. For confirmed thrombosis, treat with full-dose LMWH or warfarin, reserve DOACs for selected cases with caution, and continue therapy until disease remission with individualized reassessment of risk and bleeding [^115KPDH2] [^115DREJx] [^116xPxhZ] [^117Dzf9A] [^112iToy3].

Anticoagulation is **not routine** in nephrotic syndrome; it is reserved for patients at **high thrombotic risk** [^112GYEDG] with **low bleeding risk** [^112fM98g]. Use **prophylactic anticoagulation** when serum albumin is < 2.0–2.5 g/dL, especially in membranous nephropathy [^115KPDH2] or with additional risk factors (prior VTE, immobility, cancer, or severe proteinuria) [^115iBcFh] [^111XN7QW]. For established VTE, treat with therapeutic anticoagulation (LMWH/warfarin) [^115DREJx]; DOACs are not first-line due to albumin binding and urinary loss [^115DREJx]. In children, avoid routine prophylaxis [^117Dzf9A]; consider only with severe hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, or central venous lines [^113Msyvx] [^115uESgg]. Always individualize decisions using risk–benefit assessment and bleeding tools (e.g. HAS-BLED) [^115KPDH2].

---

## Pathophysiology of thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome increases VTE risk through **urinary loss of anticoagulants** (antithrombin III, protein C, protein S) [^1153q4U2] and **increased hepatic synthesis** of procoagulant factors (fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor) [^112iToy3], creating a hypercoagulable state [^115eftH5]. Additional contributors include platelet hyperactivity, hemoconcentration, and endothelial dysfunction [^113KM7QQ].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome

Anticoagulation is **not routine** [^113pVXJ1] and should be individualized based on thrombotic and bleeding risk [^112fM98g]. Indications include:

---

### Prophylactic anticoagulation

- **Severe hypoalbuminemia**: Serum albumin < 2.0–2.5 g/dL, especially in membranous nephropathy [^115KPDH2] [^11175oeQ].
- **Additional risk factors**: Prior VTE, immobility, malignancy, or severe proteinuria (> 10 g/day) [^111aPzGQ] [^115iBcFh] [^115VkEi7] [^111XN7QW].
- **Pediatric considerations**: Avoid routine prophylaxis [^117Dzf9A]; consider only with severe hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytosis, or central venous lines [^113Msyvx] [^116xPxhZ].

---

### Therapeutic anticoagulation

Therapeutic anticoagulation is indicated for **established VTE** (DVT, PE, RVT) [^115DREJx] and for **arterial thromboembolism** (e.g. stroke, MI) [^116jfyJD].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant agents

| **Anticoagulant** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| LMWH | - Prophylaxis <br/> - Treatment | Preferred initially; monitor anti-Xa in renal impairment [^115DREJx] |
| Warfarin | - Prophylaxis <br/> - Long-term treatment | INR monitoring; drug interactions |
| DOACs | Not first-line | - Albumin binding <br/> - Limited data <br/> - Not recommended for prophylaxis [^115DREJx] [^112fM98g] |

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation

Anticoagulation reduces **VTE incidence** [^116rYsPv] but increases **bleeding risk** [^116rYsPv]; balance is essential [^112GYEDG]. Major bleeding occurs in ~2–5% of patients, especially with combined antiplatelet therapy or supratherapeutic INR [^116rYsPv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **KDIGO 2021**: Prophylaxis based on serum albumin, proteinuria, and bleeding risk; not routine [^112GYEDG] [^115KPDH2].
- **KDOQI 2023**: Use LMWH or warfarin when thrombotic risk exceeds bleeding risk; DOACs not recommended for prophylaxis [^115DREJx] [^112fM98g].
- **IPNA 2023**: No routine prophylaxis in children; consider only with additional risk factors [^117Dzf9A] [^1134Kj5L].

---

## Monitoring and management of anticoagulation therapy

- **Laboratory monitoring**: INR for warfarin; anti-Xa for LMWH in renal impairment [^113hTQBS].
- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and anticoagulation-related nephropathy [^111y2Jiv].
- **Duration**: Continue until remission or albumin recovery; individualize based on response and risk [^112GYEDG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Use LMWH; avoid warfarin (teratogenic) [^112XfxuU].
- **Pediatric patients**: Avoid routine prophylaxis; consider only with severe hypoalbuminemia or central lines [^117Dzf9A] [^113Msyvx].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust LMWH dose; monitor anti-Xa levels [^113hTQBS].

---

Anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome is **selective**, not routine [^113pVXJ1]. Use prophylaxis for high-risk patients with severe hypoalbuminemia and low bleeding risk, and treat established thrombosis with LMWH or warfarin [^115DREJx]. DOACs are not first-line for prophylaxis due to albumin binding and limited data [^115DREJx]. Decisions should be individualized and regularly reassessed [^notfound].

Benefits

Anticoagulation was associated with reduced mortality with an RR of 0.12 (95% CI, 0.04–0.36). Among nonneonates, mortality with anticoagulation was 5 of 366 (1.4%), and 9 of 82 (11.0%) in those without anticoagulation. There were no studies that reported mortality in neonates. The description of neurologic deficits varied between studies and included a standardized assessment with a previously validated tool, (pediatric stroke outcome measure), presence of cranial nerve palsies, or a general description of neurologic deficits or symptoms. The risk of aggregate neurologic deficits was reduced (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69–1.30) in those who received anticoagulation. Pooled estimates were derived from studies that reported similar radiologic outcomes of CSVT. Of 79 pediatric patients who were treated with anticoagulation, 64 (78%) experienced partial or complete resolution compared with 38 of 71 (53.5%) of those not treated with anticoagulation (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.9). The relative effects for the risk of recurrence were not estimable because there were no events reported in the included studies. Of 6 patients in the nephrotic syndrome case series who received thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation, all had resolution of the CSVT. Thrombus resolution was also observed in all 4 patients who were treated with anticoagulation alone. There were no deaths or recurrent events; thus, the RR was not estimable. Overall, the certainty of these estimated effects is very low owing to the high risk of bias and confounding in the studies and imprecision of the estimates.

Introduction

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by excessive proteinuria (> 3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, and edema. It is associated with a variety of different glomerular pathologies, including membranous glomerulonephritis, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, and IgA nephropathy. The glomerular filtration barrier defect in NS leads to urinary loss of natural anticoagulants and other plasma proteins, which stimulates hepatic protein synthesis, including the synthesis of coagulation-related proteins. These changes cause a hypercoagulable state with an up to 25% increased risk of TE that may be even further increased in patients with membranous glomerulonephritis. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has overall been associated with a 6% and 12% 30-day mortality, respectively, but have never been evaluated in NS patients.

The hypercoagulability in NS is not fully understood but has been ascribed to at least three different mechanisms. First, elevated thromboxane A2 may increase platelet activation and aggregation. Second, urinary loss of natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin and protein S combined with increased hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen and coagulation factor V and VIII results in a prothrombotic state. Finally, decreased plasmin levels due to urinary loss, in combination with increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels, result in decreased fibrinolytic activity. Given this lack of knowledge, international guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with severe NS defined by the underlying condition and serum-albumin. Thus, prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended to patient with plasma-albumin below 24 g/L if membranous nephropathy and below 20 g/L in other conditions.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome prevents thromboembolic complications [^114qTmzP]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study is limited by the small study sample size, the retrospective design and the inclusion of only clinically reported TE and bleeding episodes which may underestimate the frequency of both smaller bleeding episodes and subclinical TE. Furthermore, although not significant male sex, a risk factor for TE, tended to be more frequent in the group receiving PAC. This may lead to an underestimation of the preventive effect of PAC when comparing to the group not receiving PAC. In addition, the allocation to PAC were based on different practices in two different nephrology departments implying that other differences in practices may affect the outcome. Furthermore, no algorithm for the selection between Warfarin, LMWH or aspirin was applied. However, except for plasma albumin levels the groups were similar and recruited within the same region of Denmark. Inclusion was based strictly on biochemical criteria and biopsy proven glomerular disease. Given the limited available evidence we believe that the findings provide relevant information to guide PAC in NS.

International guidelines recommend full-dose anticoagulation with LMWH or Warfarin should be considered if serum albumin is below 20–25 g/L in combination with one or more risk factors. Given our findings it is likely that this may prevent TE; however, at the possible costs of increased risk of major and potential fatal bleeding episodes. Thus, careful attention to other factors implying bleeding risks may be recommend and the combination with platelet inhibitors should be avoided.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^113cQ2qf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence supporting venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) is limited to case reports.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare bleeding and thromboembolic events in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adults with NS initiated on a DOAC or warfarin for VTE prophylaxis between January 2013 and July 2021 within the Ochsner Health System. Patients with study drug exposure within the preceding 7 days, acute VTE within the preceding 6 months, or ≤ 7 days of study drug exposure were excluded. The primary outcome was the composite rate of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included time to major bleeding and rate of new thromboembolic events. This study was approved by the Ochsner Health System Institutional Review Board.

Results

Twenty-five DOAC and 19 warfarin patients were included. The primary outcome occurred in 8% vs 26.3% (P = 0.21) of patients treated with a DOAC or warfarin, respectively, and was driven by major bleeding (4% vs 21%, P = 0.25). Other secondary outcomes were similar between cohorts. The study was limited by a small sample size.

Conclusion and Relevance

Use of DOACs for VTE prophylaxis resulted in a nonstatistically significant, but clinically relevant lower rate of major bleeding compared to warfarin. This study provides comparative data showing safe and effective use of DOACs in patients with NS. Prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm results.

Conclusion

The results of this study showed that the incidence of TE in PNS in children was 4.9%. To improve the quality of life and the prognosis of children with PNS, more attention should be paid to the incidence of TE. In addition, more studies should be conducted on risk factors, pathophysiology, and measures to prevent and treat TE, with the aim of reducing the incidence of TE.

### UK prescribing practice of anticoagulants in patients with chronic kidney disease: a nephrology and haematology-based survey [^114Ch29H]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Some consistency is required around the use of renal function estimating equations for the dosing of anticoagulants. DOACs are being used in a number of off-label scenarios including treatment of VTE and AF in patients with end-stage renal disease as well as active nephrotic syndrome. More evidence is needed to determine whether DOACs are the appropriate treatments in these situations. A best-practice guideline would be useful to support anticoagulant practice across the UK. The use of the Delphi technique with experts, has been used in such situations of limited evidence, to support development of best-practice guidelines.

### Retrospective analysis of a novel regimen for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in nephrotic syndrome [^114pMgA3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in 7%-40% of nephrotic patients. The risk of VTE depends on the severity and underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. This study investigated the use of low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent VTE in patients with nephrotic syndrome caused by primary glomerulonephritis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Since 2006, all patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome to Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre have been considered for treatment with a novel anticoagulation prophylaxis regimen. All cases of nephrotic syndrome secondary to primary membranous nephropathy, minimal-change disease, and FSGS over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with serum albumin < 2.0 g/dl received prophylactic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin or low-dose warfarin; patients with albumin levels of 2.0–3.0 g/dl received aspirin, 75 mg once daily. All thrombotic events and bleeding complications were recorded.

Results

A total of 143 patients received the prophylactic anticoagulation regimen. Median follow-up was 154 weeks (range, 30–298 weeks). The cohort had features associated with a high risk of developing VTE; 40% of the cohort had an underlying diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, and the initial median serum albumin was 1.5 g/dl (range, 0.5–2.9 g/dl). No VTE occurred in patients established on prophylaxis for at least 1 week. VTE was diagnosed in 2 of 143 patients (1.39%) within the first week after presentation and starting prophylaxis. In both cases, it is unclear whether the thrombus had developed before or after the start of prophylaxis. One of 143 (0.69%) patients receiving prophylaxis was admitted urgently with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Two of 143 patients (1.40%) had elective blood transfusions and procedures to manage occult gastrointestinal bleeding. No other bleeding events occurred in patients receiving prophylaxis.

Conclusions

This regimen of prophylactic antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy appears effective in preventing VTE in nephrotic syndrome, with relatively few hemorrhagic complications.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome prevents thromboembolic complications [^116MdxTo]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is associated with an elevated risk of thromboembolic events (TE) leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of TE in NS has been estimated to 3–44% depending on the localization of thrombosis and the extend of the diagnostic screening. The risk of TE is greatest within the first 3 months, although the risk remains elevated for more than 5 years. The pathophysiology underlying the prothrombotic state is not well understood. Several, essential hemostatic proteins, including antithrombin III, and protein S, may be lost in the urine because of the glomerular leakage associated to the primary glomerular defect. Despite the urinary loss of hemostatic proteins levels of some proteins, including fibrinogen, are increased and correlate with the hypoalbuminemia. It is believed that hypoalbuminemia stimulates the hepatic synthesis of hemostatic proteins to make up for the urinary loss.

Membranous nephropathy is associated with the greatest risk of TE at any level of serum albumin compared to minimal change and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Other risk factors for venous TE include the severity of NS at presentation, mail gender, increased ionized calcium, and a decrease in plasma antithrombin III. A low serum albumin level is also correlated with an increased risk of TE and a previous study showed a 3-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolic events when serum albumin was below 2.5 g/dL. Established risk factors for arterial TE in NS include age, sex, hypertension, smoking, diabetes and low eGFR.

While the increased risk of TE in NS is well established, there are no randomized studies to direct the use of anti-coagulative therapy as primary prophylaxis. Only two published trials have analyzed the effects of prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) on TE in patients with NS. PAC was administered depending on serum albumin levels and the findings suggested that the use of LMWH prevents TE, but no comparable control group were included in either of studies. Given the limited evidence international guidelines often suggest PAC in selected patients with NS based on decision analysis calculations of risk and benefits.

To further quantitate the potential benefits of PAC in NS, this study investigated retrospectively the number and type of TE as well as hemorrhagic complications in a cohort of NS patients treated with PAC and compared this to non-treated patients.

The use of prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome

There were four haematologists, 28 nephrologists and 24 pharmacists who responded that they use prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with NS. The majority of respondents, 93%, would use serum albumin as a factor in determining whether to use prophylactic anticoagulation, in addition 89% would take into consideration bleeding risks. A further 61% of respondents would use the degree of proteinuria (level not specified) and 50% would consider the primary cause of NS in their decision making.

The choice of agents used for prophylaxis in NS are shown in supplementary Fig. 3. For those with an albumin < 20 g/dL all respondents would administer anticoagulant therapy. This was more likely to be therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH, warfarin or DOACs than those with higher levels of albumin. Once albumin increased above 25 g/dL then anticoagulation was less likely, with 54% respondents not using any anticoagulation. From the four centres where multi-professional groups responded, nephrology doctors suggested use of DOACs off-label in nephrotic syndrome which was not suggested as an option by their haematology and renal pharmacist counterparts. In two centres there was variation between nephrology doctors in the options considered for anticoagulation in people with nephrotic syndrome.

Anticoagulant use in patients with AF and CKD

In terms of risk scores CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (Congestive heart failure = 1, Hypertension = 1, Age > 65 = 1, Age > 75 = 2, Diabetes = 1, Stroke/TIA/Thromboembolism history = 2, Vascular disease = 1, Female sex = 1) was used by 90% respondents (N = 64) to decide upon anticoagulant initiation for AF in patients with CKD. The bleeding scores HAS-BLED (Hypertension = 1, Age > 65 = 2, Stroke history = 1, renal disease = 1, Liver disease = 1, labile INR = 1, ethanol = 1, drugs = 1) and ORBIT being used by 78% and 8% respondents respectively. 10% of respondents did not use any risk scores when making anticoagulant decisions, supplementary Fig. 4.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a report of 21 cases [^115KDFKq]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events (TE) adding to the morbidity and mortality. International guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with NS and high risk of TE, but no studies have identified the optimal type of anticoagulation in NS. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) by analyzing the thromboembolic and bleeding events in NS patients prescribed DOAC as primary prophylaxis to prevent TE or as treatment for TE occurring in relation to NS.

Methods

We performed a single-center, retrospective study including patients with NS, a plasma albumin less than 25 g/L and prophylactic anticoagulation treatment with DOAC at the Department of Renal Medicine at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark from July 2016 to June 2021. Patients treated with DOAC as thromboprophylaxis for other indications than NS were excluded. Baseline characteristics and outcomes, including TE, bleeding and other adverse effects associated with DOAC were obtained from medical records.

Results

We identified 268 patients treated with DOAC of which 21 patients with NS were included in the study. Nineteen patients were prescribed DOAC as thromboprophylaxis and two patients received DOAC due to previous TE, which was considered associated with the NS. The type of DOAC prescribed was apixaban (n = 10) and rivaroxaban (n = 11). No patients experienced TE during DOAC treatment, while five patients had a minor bleeding episode. Patients who experienced bleeding episodes were older (median 62 vs 51 years), more often female (80%) and had been on DOAC for a longer period (204 days vs 47 days). Neither the HAS-BLED score nor GN-risk-score predicted the risk of minor bleedings in this population.

Conclusions

In this case series, no new TE and only minor bleeding complications were observed among adult NS patients treated with DOAC.

Pediatric cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) — anticoagulation efficacy and recurrence: In pediatric patients with CSVT, the risk of aggregate neurologic deficits was reduced with anticoagulation (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69–1.30). Radiologic outcomes favored anticoagulation, with 64 (78%) of 79 experiencing partial or complete resolution compared with 38 of 71 (53.5%) not treated (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.9). Recurrence effects were not estimable due to no events reported. In a nephrotic syndrome case series, all 6 who received thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation and all 4 who received anticoagulation alone had thrombus resolution, with no deaths or recurrent events; overall certainty of these effects is very low due to bias, confounding, and imprecision.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^113mP2hU]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and oedema, which manifest in utero or during the first 3 months of life. The main cause of CNS is genetic defects in podocytes; however, it can also be caused, in rare cases, by congenital infections or maternal allo-immune disease. Management of CNS is very challenging because patients are prone to severe complications, such as haemodynamic compromise, infections, thromboses, impaired growth and kidney failure. In this consensus statement, experts from the European Reference Network for Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN) summarize the current evidence and present recommendations for the management of CNS, including the use of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, diuretics, anticoagulation and infection prophylaxis. Therapeutic management should be adapted to the clinical severity of the condition with the aim of maintaining intravascular euvolaemia and adequate nutrition, while preventing complications and preserving central and peripheral vessels. We do not recommend performing routine early nephrectomies but suggest that they are considered in patients with severe complications despite optimal conservative treatment, and before transplantation in patients with persisting nephrotic syndrome and/or a WT1 -dominant pathogenic variant.

### Proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia are risk factors for thromboembolic events in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy: an observational study [^111C5jrW]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Investigators have suggested that randomized clinical trials should be conducted to identify whom to administer prophylactic anticoagulation, for how long and in to determine whether anti-coagulation in adult MN patients would improve overall outcomes. However, for trials involving idiopathic MN (IMN) patients key information that may help to design such studies are still lacking, in particular with regards to the timing of thromboembolic events with respect to the diagnosis, their relationship to disease activity and the risk factors. Moreover, the conditions associated with MN (secondary MN) such as lupus, human immunodeficiency viral infection or malignancies are themselves pro-thrombotic and per se require anti-coagulation irrespective of the presence of nephrotic syndrome. This means that these MN patients, if they have other indications for anticoagulation, may be not eligible to be randomised to anticoagulation.

Though the pathophysiological mechanisms of thromboembolic events in IMN patients are poorly understood, one of the major underlying mechanisms for such complication is the nephrotic syndrome with increased urinary loss of plasma proteins such as plasminogen (component of fibrinolytic system), factors IX, X and XII (components of the coagulation system) and antithrombin III (endogenous anticoagulant). The urinary losses of such plasma proteins correlate with the degree of proteinuria. Therefore, we hypothesized that the degree of proteinuria could be a risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with IMN. If so, this may aid in better risk stratification of patients with IMN with respect to TEs and anti-coagulation. To the best of our knowledge, TEs have not been thoroughly investigated in the adult IMN patients. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data on all consecutive biopsy-proven adult IMN patients diagnosed at our centre (i) to characterize the TEs (ii) to determine the timing of the thromboembolic events relative to the diagnosis and (iii) to identify, if any, risk factors for thromboembolic events in such patients.

### The risk of thromboembolic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome and relatively high albumin levels: a study over 10 years [^111J59FS]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with SLE, LA is an important biomarker for hypercoagulability. LA is an acquired autoantibody of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) type that acts on platelet factor III, inhibiting the generation of the prothrombin activator complex. One study showed a significant association between the presence of thrombotic complications in SLE and the presence of LA. Among patients with SLE, those with positive LA have a higher incidence of ATE and VTE than those without. This finding shows the importance of screening for secondary factors of NS and identifying autoimmune diseases in patients with NS. For those who were previously diagnosed with SLE, examinations of LA and aPLs are crucial.

Additionally, our study showed that patients with NS with high albumin levels had a significantly lower rate of anticoagulant usage, in accordance with the consensus that a low serum albumin level can increase VTE risk. A study found that prophylactic anticoagulants significantly decreased the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with NS but was also associated with more bleeding episodes, although the association was not significant. There were multiple reasons that prophylactic anticoagulation failed to prevent thromboembolic events in our patients, including inadequate anticoagulation, initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation before thorough screening for thromboembolic events, suspension prophylactic anticoagulation before renal biopsy. The 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline used 25 g/L of serum albumin level as the threshold to initiate prophylactic anticoagulant in patients with MN. To provide a personalized prophylactic anticoagulation decision in patients with MN, Lee et al. constructed a tool to estimate the likelihood of benefit based on the patient's bleeding risk profile, serum albumin level, and acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio. For other pathological types, the serum albumin threshold for anticoagulation initiation has not been clearly set, although the level between 20 and 25 g/l in combination with one or more risk factors is agreed upon by most studies. However, our study found that there was still a rather high percentage of patients with NS who developed thromboembolic events with relatively high albumin level, indicating that the level of albumin may not be the only criterion for giving prophylactic anticoagulants.

### The crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulation disorder: pathogenesis, treatment, and dilemmas [^111ZbLpx]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

As a blood filter and the most highly perfused organ, the kidney plays an important role in regulating hemodynamics and blood components, which directly affects coagulation processes. In fact, thrombosis is common in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) or CKD – or patients undergoing RRTs. While patients with ESKD are threatened with bleeding. However, improper anticoagulant or procoagulant therapies may induce adverse effects, such as anticoagulation-related nephropathy (ARN), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or bleeding, which trouble clinicians. Over the decades, researchers have conducted extensive mechanism studies on the crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulopathy, which provide guidance for clinical treatment to some extent. However, the complex interactions between the kidney and the coagulation system are still not fully understood.

Currently, there is no review to systematically summarize and analyze the significance and shortcomings of these findings. Therefore, we review the pathogenesis and treatment of coagulation abnormalities in nephropathy, as well as the manifestations and countermeasures of adverse effects resulting from anticoagulant therapies in nephropathy patients. We emphasize the current problems in clinical practice and the corresponding deficiencies in basic research and analyze the direction of future basic research efforts on the basis of existing studies, as well as the improvement programs that could be considered in clinical treatment.

NS

NS refers to a series of kidney diseases with similar clinical and laboratory features, which are mainly characterized by proteinuria, edema, hypercholesterolemia, and hypoalbuminemia. According to different pathological features, NS can be identified as membranous nephropathy (MN), minimal change disease, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Thromboembolism is the most serious complication of NS, which is life-threatening. The thrombosis incidence is highest in MN (approximately 37%) and lower in other pathological types of NS (with a cumulative incidence of 24%). Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most common type of thrombosis, and coronary thrombosis was also detected.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^11175oeQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) with nephrotic syndrome — prophylactic anticoagulation guidance states: We suggest that patients with IMN and nephrotic syndrome, with marked reduction in serum albumin (< 2.5 g/dl) and additional risks for thrombosis, be considered for prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, using oral warfarin. (2C). Commentary adds that anticoagulation is not as commonly used in the United States as it is in Europe for NS; NS is a thrombophilic milieu and MN appears to be an independent risk for venous thromboembolism even after adjustment, and in one study the threshold albumin for overall risk was 2.8 g/dL. Anticoagulation is warranted in patients who initially present with renal vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and although there is no clear consensus as to whom to stop anticoagulation, most thromboembolic events occur in the first 6 months after the diagnosis of NS.

### Urokinase prophylactic anticoagulation in children with nephrotic syndrome: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^113uwP6b]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical effect of urokinase on the prevention of thrombosis in children with primary nephrotic syndrome.

Methods

A total of 370 children diagnosed with primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University and Zibo Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022 were selected as the research objects. The patients were divided into a urokinase adjuvant therapy group and non-urokinase adjuvant therapy group according to the application of drugs. The clinical data of the children were collected, including sex, age, drug application, bleeding during treatment, and telephone follow-up, to record whether thromboembolism occurred in the acute stage and remission stage. The clinical pattern of PNS, renal biopsy, histopathological type, and related laboratory indexes before and after treatment were recorded.

Results

A total of 313 patients were treated with urokinase and 57 patients were not. More thrombotic events was observed in non-urokinase group compared to the urokinase group(2 versus 0 episodes, p = 0.02). The thrombotic events observed included one patient had pulmonary embolism combined with right ventricular thrombosis, and another had intracranial venous thrombosis. More minor bleeding events occurred in urokinase group compared to the non-urokinase group(7 versus 1 episodes, p = 1.0). No major bleeding events occurred in either group.

Conclusion

The rational prophylactic use of urokinase anticoagulation in children with PNS can prevent the formation of thromboembolism and has good safety.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^112mvYfM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Future research

We recognize the paucity of scientific evidence in the field of CNS. Indeed, during our literature search we identified 54 relevant articles but no randomized controlled trials. Compelling clinical questions remain unanswered and we propose a number of research themes to address these questions (Box 10).

Box 10 Future research

Develop a comprehensive registry for children with CNS to evaluate the variations in treatment and natural history of the disease, including rare complications.
Evaluate the impact of CNS on schooling, social life and professional activity.
Evaluate phenotype–genotype correlations in CNS.
Define the optimal indications, dose and frequency of albumin infusions to use once patients have achieved a stable disease state.
Evaluate the risk versus benefit ratio of approaches to preventing and/or treating CNS complications, such as use of anticoagulation, immunoglobulin infusion and vaccinations.

Albumin infusions

The use of albumin infusions in children with CNS varies between centres. Some centres administer intravenous albumin only when deemed clinically indicated, whereas others use regular albumin infusion protocols (1–4 g/kg/day). Potential advantages of regular albumin infusions are replacement of lost protein to support growth and psychomotor development, stabilization of intravascular volume and minimization of oedema. The disadvantages of regular albumin infusions are the need for a central line, which increases the risk of infection and/or thrombosis of large vessels, which endangers future haemodialysis access, the need for prolonged hospitalization (although home administration has been reported) and the associated costs. Retrospective studies show no difference in long-term outcomes with these two strategies. As most of the infused albumin is lost in the urine within hours, the purpose of albumin infusion is not to normalize serum albumin levels but to support intravascular volume and reduce extravascular fluid retention in patients with symptomatic hypovolaemia. Symptoms that are suggestive of hypovolaemia are prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria and abdominal discomfort. Impacts on quality of life and school attendance should be taken into account when considering regular albumin infusions.

We acknowledge that some children with no or minimal symptoms do well without regular albumin infusions and do not need a CVL. Others may need frequent albumin infusions to prevent the clinical consequences of hypovolaemia and failure to thrive. In the latter, we recommend basing the frequency and dosage of albumin infusion on the clinical indicators of hypovolaemia listed above, rather than on serum albumin levels. In patients with severe disease, daily albumin infusions of up to 1–4 g/kg may be initiated. In stable patients or when CKD progresses, albumin dose may be reduced and infusions might subsequently be made less frequent or even stopped.

Vascular access

When possible, we recommend avoiding CVLs in children with CNS owing to the high risk of thrombosis and the need to preserve the vasculature for future haemodialysis access. However, when regular albumin infusions are inevitable, a CVL becomes necessary. In such cases we recommend administering prophylactic anticoagulation for as long as the line is in place (discussed further below). We also recommend avoiding peripherally inserted catheters and unnecessary venepunctures to preserve arteries and veins for the potential future creation of arteriovenous fistulae.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome prevents thromboembolic complications [^1126cKGy]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design and inclusion

A retrospective analysis including incident and consecutive patients diagnosed with NS and a renal biopsy confirming glomerular disease from September 2006 to January 2012 at two Danish Renal Departments. NS was defined as urinary protein excretion greater than of 3.5 g/day and/or a urinary albumin excretion greater than 2.2 g/day or 2200 mg/g creatinine in association with a plasma albumin < 30 g/L. The follow up time were at least 3 weeks. Patients aged < 16 years, with diabetic kidney disease, on treatment with anticoagulants at onset of NS, or on renal replacement therapy were excluded. The study was approved by The Danish National Board of Health and the Danish Data Protection Agency. All data were anonymized prior to analyses and according to Danish regulations, individual patient consent was not required for this study.

Intervention

There were different practices regarding the use of PAC in the two Renal Departments. At the Department of Nephrology, Aarhus University Hospital all patients with NS and plasma albumin < 20 g/L were treated with PAC based on local guidelines recommending LMWH as the initial treatment followed by warfarin at an INR target of 2–3 as oral maintenance therapy if required. The dosing of LMWH and the monitoring of warfarin therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician; however, biochemical monitoring of LMWH by anti–factor Xa levels was not common practice at the time of the study. In contrast, PAC routinely used at the Department of Internal Medicine, Viborg Regional Hospital irrespective of plasma albumin levels.

PAC involved either warfarin alone, warfarin with bridging using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low dose or high LMWH. Aspirin was not used as PAC, but patients treated with aspirin prior to the diagnosis of NS continued the treatment when initiated on LMWH and/or warfarin. Aspirin was in general prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease; however, the exact indication in these 11 patients was not recorded.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome: a clinical conundrum [^111aPzGQ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

It has long been recognized that nephrotic syndrome is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic complications, including deep venous thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. This risk varies with the nature of the underlying disease and seems to be greatest for membranous nephropathy. Other factors, including the level of serum albumin, previous thromboembolic episodes, and a genetically determined predisposition to thrombosis, may also be involved. Prevention of thromboembolic events with oral anticoagulants in nephrotic syndrome requires a careful case-by-case analysis of the risks for thromboembolic events balanced by the risks for anticoagulant induced bleeding. Markov-based decision analysis using literature-based assumptions regarding these risks has suggested that prophylactic anticoagulants may be indicated in certain circumstances. Such decisions need to take into account the nature of the underlying disease, the severity of the nephrotic syndrome (as assessed by serum albumin concentration), preexisting thrombophilic states, and the overall likelihood of serious bleeding events consequent to oral anticoagulation (as assessed by the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time). The optimal duration of prophylactic anticoagulation is unknown but very likely extends to the duration of the nephrotic state per se.

### Anticoagulation-related nephropathy: the most common diagnosis you' ve never heard of… [^111y2Jiv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation-related nephropathy might just be the most common diagnosis you've never heard of. It was formerly known as warfarin-induced nephropathy, until it was observed with numerous other anticoagulants and broadened to anticoagulation-related nephropathy. It is a potentially devastating disorder with serious and life-changing consequences if not recognized and diagnosed swiftly. As the clinician is faced with new acute renal failure, it is important to appreciate those factors that place patients at greater risk of anticoagulation-related nephropathy: conditions such as underlying chronic kidney disease patients and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio. Through greater understanding of this common yet under-recognized condition, we become better equipped to diagnose and prognosticate potential patients. Currently, there are no specific guidelines to follow regarding anticoagulation-related nephropathy identification and management; however, it is an entity that is important to remember, especially given the number of patients requiring anticoagulation for numerous conditions.

### Incidence of thromboembolism in children with primary nephrotic syndrome: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^111jN4q5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several factors have been identified to be associated with the development of thromboembolic disease in NS. Multivariate analysis shows that age ≥ 12 years and severe proteinuria are independent risk factors for thromboembolism. Membranous nephropathy is the most common pathological type complicated by thromboembolism. Moreover, genetic predisposition may not be related to the occurrence of nephrotic syndrome in children, but it plays a significant role on thromboembolism after NS. Secondary NS is more prone to thrombosis than primary NS.

There are still many controversies on whether NS patients need prophylactic anticoagulant drugs, the timing of administration, drug selection and drug dosage. The latest guidelines issued by 2021 KDIGO clearly put forward the algorithm of anticoagulant prophylaxis for MN patients. In the guidelines, it is proposed that the timing and drug selection of medication should be determined according to serum protein concentration, risk factors of thrombosis and bleeding risk. No recommendations are made for other pathological types of NS. Evidence supporting recommendations for pediatric antithrombotic therapy is still weak. In children with VTE, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines suggests that thrombolysis therapy be used only for life- or limb-threatening thrombosis.

Our study had several limitations: (i) The number of studies included was small and the sample size was not large enough. Significant heterogeneity was found that could not be explained by the differences in region, sex, thrombosis type, and year of publication; (ii) Data in some of the included studies were not complete; iii) Image investigation was typically performed in symptomatic patients, and not universally performed in all NS patients, which may underestimate the true incidence of thromboembolic complications in children with PNS.

### Diagnosis and management of nephrotic syndrome in adults [^113pVXJ1]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) consists of peripheral edema, heavy proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia, often with hyperlipidemia. Patients typically present with edema and fatigue, without evidence of heart failure or severe liver disease. The diagnosis of NS is based on typical clinical features with confirmation of heavy proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. The patient history and selected diagnostic studies rule out important secondary causes, including diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and medication adverse effects. Most cases of NS are considered idiopathic or primary; membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are the most common histologic subtypes of primary NS in adults. Important complications of NS include venous thrombosis and hyperlipidemia; other potential complications include infection and acute kidney injury. Spontaneous acute kidney injury from NS is rare but can occur as a result of the underlying medical problem. Despite a lack of evidence-based guidelines, treatment consisting of sodium restriction, fluid restriction, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, and careful assessment for possible disease complications is appropriate for most patients. Renal biopsy is often recommended, although it may be most useful in patients with suspected underlying systemic lupus erythematosus or other renal disorders, in whom biopsy can guide management and prognosis. Immunosuppressive treatment, including corticosteroids, is often used for NS, although evidence is lacking. Routine prophylactic treatment to prevent infection or thrombosis is not recommended. A nephrologist should be consulted about use of anticoagulation and immunosuppressants, need for renal biopsy, and for other areas of uncertainty.

### Risk factors of venous thromboembolism in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^116UYHhk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the risk factors of VTE in nephrotic syndrome, other than hypoalbuminemia and severe proteinuria, are not well established. Therefore we aimed to investigate the risk factors of VTE in patients with nephrotic syndrome.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used data from a Japanese nationwide claims database. We identified patients ≥ 18years of age hospitalized with nephrotic syndrome. Through multivariable logistic regression, we determined the risk factors of VTE in patients with nephrotic syndrome during hospitalization.

Results

Of the 7473 hospitalized patients with nephrotic syndrome without VTE, 221 (3.0%) developed VTE. In the VTE group, 14 (6.3%), 11 (5.0%) and 198 (89.6%) patients developed pulmonary embolism, renal vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis, respectively. We found that female sex {odds ratio [OR] 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.85]}, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 [OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.35–2.99)], acute kidney injury [AKI; OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.07–2.62)], sepsis [OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.37–5.93)], lupus nephritis [OR 3.64 (95% CI 1.58–8.37)] and intravenous corticosteroids use [OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.52–3.80)] were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing VTE.

Conclusions

In patients with nephrotic syndrome, female sex, BMI ≥ 30, AKI, sepsis, lupus nephritis and intravenous corticosteroid use may help evaluate the risk of VTE.

### Urokinase prophylactic anticoagulation in children with nephrotic syndrome: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^116WaxCb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical effect of urokinase on the prevention of thrombosis in children with primary nephrotic syndrome.

Methods

A total of 370 children diagnosed with primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University and Zibo Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022 were selected as the research objects. The patients were divided into a urokinase adjuvant therapy group and non-urokinase adjuvant therapy group according to the application of drugs.

The clinical pattern of PNS, renal biopsy, histopathological type, and related laboratory indexes before and after treatment were recorded.

Results

A total of 313 patients were treated with urokinase and 57 patients were not. More thrombotic events was observed in non-urokinase group compared to the urokinase group(2 versus 0 episodes, p = 0.02). The thrombotic events observed included one patient had pulmonary embolism combined with right ventricular thrombosis, and another had intracranial venous thrombosis. More minor bleeding events occurred in urokinase group compared to the non-urokinase group(7 versus 1 episodes, p = 1.0). No major bleeding events occurred in either group.

Conclusion

The rational prophylactic use of urokinase anticoagulation in children with PNS can prevent the formation of thromboembolism and has good safety.

### Prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome [^115VkEi7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review published literature regarding use of strategies to prevent thrombotic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS).

Data Sources

The MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried from 1980 to December 2012 for articles in English using the search terms nephrotic syndrome, thrombosis, thromboembolism, anticoagulation, warfarin, heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, statin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, aspirin, direct thrombin inhibitor, rivaroxaban, argatroban, lepirudin, bivalirudin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and prasugrel.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All relevant original studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, guidelines, and review articles were assessed for inclusion. References from pertinent articles were examined for additional content not found during the initial search.

Data Synthesis

NS leads to multiple complications, including hypercoagulability. A small prospective cohort study used enoxaparin for primary prophylaxis and demonstrated successful prevention of thrombotic events with minimal adverse events. Additional information has come in the form of decision analyses, which show potential decreased morbidity and mortality when primary prophylaxis for thrombotic events is used; however, all data have numerous limitations. Other strategies for thrombus prevention, including statins and antiplatelet agents, also have been investigated.

Conclusions

When patients with NS are admitted to the hospital, develop an acute medical illness, or acquire an additional thrombotic events risk factor such as surgery, active malignancy, or pregnancy, consideration for primary pharmacologic prophylaxis with appropriately dosed low-molecular-weight heparin or other indicated anticoagulant should include the potential for increased thrombotic events risk in this patient population. Consideration may also be given to the use of primary pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or oral vitamin K antagonist in patients with membranous nephropathy once the albumin level drops below 2.0–2.5 g/dL. Short-term use of pharmacologic prophylaxis during the first 6 months following diagnosis warrants further investigation.

### Acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism in medical patients [^115iBcFh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and potentially fatal disorder, which often complicates the course of hospitalized patients, but may also affect ambulatory and otherwise healthy people. While the introduction of thromboprophylactic measures is expected to have reduced the occurrence of postoperative VTE, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of medical conditions in determining thromboembolic events. Among the conditions that predispose patients to VTE are increasing age, cancer and its treatment, prolonged immobility, stroke or paralysis, previous VTE, congestive heart failure, acute infection, pregnancy or puerperium, dehydration, hormonal treatment, varicose veins, long air travel, acute inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Other factors that have recently been associated with an increased risk of VTE disorders include persistent elevation of D-dimer and atherosclerotic disease. Recognition of the incidence and clinical importance of thrombosis will most likely encourage more widespread use of antithrombotic prophylaxis in medical patients.

Materials and methods

Design and study population

The study was a single centre, case series of incident or relapsing adult NS patients receiving DOAC as primary thromboprophylaxis or as treatment for TE in relation to NS from July 2016 to June 2021 at the Department of Renal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. As per local guidelines, patients with established membranous glomerulonephritis should receive primary thromboprophylaxis if the plasma-albumin concentration was less than 25 g/L, whereas other patients with NS should receive thromboprophylaxis if the plasma-albumin concentration was less than 20 g/L. DOAC was prescribed per discretion of the treating physician. All patients receiving DOAC at the Department of Renal Medicine during the defined period were identified through an electronic search of all medical records. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria, most notable having NS, and no exclusion criteria were identified by a manual review of medical records. The inclusion criteria were: 1) a urinary protein excretion > 3.5 g/day, a urinary albumin excretion > 2.2 g/day and/or a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > 2200 mg/g in combination with 2) a plasma albumin concentration < 25 g/L, 3) age > 18 years and 4) DOAC as primary thromboprophylaxis in NS or treatment for TE. Exclusion criteria were the prescription of DOAC for other indications (e.g. atrial fibrillation) and/or renal replacement therapy. The access to patient files as part of the study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 1–16–02–406–21) and patient consent was not required under Danish law. All study procedures adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Electronic medical files in the Danish healthcare system

The Danish health care system is tax financed providing free health care visits and admission to all citizens. Aarhus University Hospital is the major tertiary hospital within the Central Denmark Region with no private nephrology consults available within this region. The electronic medical file contains the patient's medical current and previous history, medical prescriptions, laboratory tests, imaging, relating to both outpatient visits and admissions at public for all hospitals within the region. In addition, the electronic records provide information on all laboratory and imaging analysis prescribed by general practitioners but does not include records from these. It is, however, unlikely that any TE or significant bleeding episode would be diagnosed or treated outside a public hospital.

### Nephrotic syndrome in adults: diagnosis and management [^116njoBU]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome may be caused by primary (idiopathic) renal disease or by a variety of secondary causes. Patients present with marked edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and often hyperlipidemia. In adults, diabetes mellitus is the most common secondary cause, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous nephropathy are the most common primary causes. Venous thromboembolism is a possible complication; acute renal failure and serious bacterial infection are also possible, but much less common. There are no established guidelines on the diagnostic workup or management of nephrotic syndrome. Imaging studies are generally not needed, and blood tests should be used selectively to diagnose specific disorders rather than for a broad or unguided workup. Renal biopsy may be useful in some cases to confirm an underlying disease or to identify idiopathic disease that is more likely to respond to corticosteroids. Treatment of most patients should include fluid and sodium restriction, oral or intravenous diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Some adults with nephrotic syndrome may benefit from corticosteroid treatment, although research data are limited. Intravenous albumin, prophylactic antibiotics, and prophylactic anticoagulation are not currently recommended.

A number of observational studies have found that the high risk factors of thrombosis in children with NS mainly include the age of onset (≥ 12 years), indwelling intravenous catheter, complicated by infection, persistent severe hypoproteinemia (< 20 g/l), hyperlipidemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, platelets (Plt) > 300 × 10 9 /l, glucocorticoids application, ATIII < 80%, Ddimer > 1 mg/l, and diuretics application. The occurrence of thrombosis often indicates a poor prognosis, and many cases of disability and even death have been reported in the literature at home and abroad. However, the potential adverse reactions to anticoagulants make the prophylactic use of anticoagulants in children with NS controversial.

At present, most clinicians are still cautious about the prophylactic use of anticoagulant drugs in children with PNS, and the 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines only proposes the use of anticoagulant drugs in adults with membranous nephropathy. The present study retrospectively analyzed the clinical results of urokinase (UK) application as an anticoagulant drug in the treatment of PNS in children in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University and Zibo Maternal and Child Health Hospital from 2018 to 2022, aiming to provide guidance for the prevention of thromboembolism in children with PNS.

### Case report: a 5-year-old with new onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 infection [^113ibiJq]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is a case report of an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with new-onset nephrotic syndrome in a pediatric patient. This is the third case of new-onset nephrotic syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is the first case report describing a new-onset nephrotic syndrome presentation in a patient who had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

Case Presentation

This is a case of a previously healthy 5year old female who presented with new-onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. She presented with progressive edema, and laboratory findings were significant for proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia. She was treated with albumin, diuretics, and corticosteroid therapy, and achieved clinical remission of her nephrotic syndrome within 3weeks of treatment. Though she was at risk of hypercoagulability due to her COVID-19 infection and nephrotic syndrome, she was not treated with anticoagulation, and did not develop any thrombotic events.

Conclusions

Our case report indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a trigger for nephrotic syndrome, even in the absence of overt COVID-19 symptoms.

Venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation in membranous nephropathy: Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in patients with MN and nephrotic syndrome should be based on an estimate of the risk of thrombotic events and the risk of bleeding complications (Practice Point 3.4.5); the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in MN is higher than in other causes of nephrotic syndrome and increases when serum albumin falls below 2.9 g/dL, though this threshold will vary by albumin assay — bromocresol green (BCG) or bromocresol purple (BCP) — and BCG is more common but overestimates serum albumin; despite growing use of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, they are largely untested for prophylactic treatment of VTE in the nephrotic syndrome, and their use is not recommended based on available data; when anticoagulation is used for known VTE or prophylaxis in the nephrotic syndrome, the dose recommended is that for known VTE.

### Urokinase prophylactic anticoagulation in children with nephrotic syndrome: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^113KM7QQ]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most common renal diseases in children, accounting for 25% of renal diseases. The main clinical manifestations are massive proteinuria accompanied by hypoproteinemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia.

The pathogenesis of NS is still unclear. Changes in "podocyte molecules" are considered to be the essence of the development of proteinuria, and changes in the properties of the glomerular capillary filtration barrier caused by the immune response are the primary factors of proteinuria. In the past, most scholars believed that the occurrence of nephrotic syndrome was related to T cells. However, the efficacy of rituximab and other specific B-cell suppressive agents has challenged the T-cell origin hypothesis. Recently, the discovery of circulating anti-nephrin antibodies has provided further evidence for the autoimmune etiology of minimal change disease (MCD). Thromboembolism is a serious complication of NS, and previous studies have found that the incidence of primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) thrombosis in children is about 2–5%, which is similar to the results of our previous study. The symptoms of thromboembolism have different manifestations according to the site of occurrence. High-risk pulmonary artery thrombosis often presents with the triad of chest pain, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. The most common symptom of intracranial thrombosis is headache. Deep vein thrombosis is a common cause of limb pain, swelling, and difficulty in walking. Severe costoabdominal pain, costoovertebral angle tenderness, hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction are the main manifestations of renal vein thrombosis. If bilateral renal vein thrombosis occurs rapidly, it might develop into oliguric acute renal failure. At present, there is still a lack of standard thrombolytic therapy after thrombosis, and once thromboembolism is formed, the prognosis is often poor; therefore, reasonable preventive anticoagulant therapy is particularly important. In 1884, Virchow first proposed three key factors for thrombosis: A hypercoagulable state, vascular endothelial injury, and hemodynamic factors. Large amounts of small molecular weight proteins, including coagulation factors IX, XI, and XII, are spilled into the urine because of glomerular permeability changes. At the same time, the concentrations of anticoagulant factors also decrease, including antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C, protein S, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. In contrast, the concentrations of high molecular weight proteins increase, including coagulation factor I, II, V, VII, VIII, X, Von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibrinogen. This is because these macromolecule proteins are not easily lost and, as a compensatory mechanism, there is increased hepatic protein synthesis. Under a hypercoagulable state, clotting function is activated and, at the same time, the fibrinolytic system is activated. In addition, the role of endothelial injury in thrombosis has received increased attention. Endothelial cells mainly play an anticoagulant role under physiological conditions; however, when the body is in a state of nephropathy, the increase in oxygen free radicals in the body, hyperlipidemia, and the application of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants can cause endothelial cell damage. In a injury state, endothelial cells synthesize and release tissue factor, thromboxane A2 (TXA2), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and vWF, which participate in the activation of internal and external coagulation pathways.

### Thromboembolic complications in the nephrotic syndrome: pathophysiology and clinical management [^115eftH5]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with the nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of developing venous and arterial thromboembolism, the most common of which is renal vein thrombosis. There are several unanswered or controversial issues relating to the nephrotic syndrome and thromboembolism, which include the mechanism of thromboembolism, and optimal diagnostic and anticoagulant management strategies. This review will discuss several of these issues: the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of thromboembolic disease occurring in patients with the nephrotic syndrome; the pathophysiology of the hypercoagulable state associated with the nephrotic syndrome; the diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis in the nephrotic syndrome; and the evidence for prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation strategies in such patients.

### Management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with primary membranous nephropathy [^117U9tQV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the leading causes of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults. The aims of therapy in primary MN have mainly focused on the prevention of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which usually occurs after several years, whereas other complications of primary MN may occur much earlier in the course of the disease. Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), renal vein thrombosis (RVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), are recognized as early complications of primary MN that carry significant morbidity and mortality. In particular, hypoalbuminemia is the most significant independent indicator of VTE risk. Along with VTEs, high absolute risks of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) were remarkably elevated within the first 6 months after presentation. Severe proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking were predictors of ATEs. The primary cardiovascular events (CVEs) included acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ischemic stroke (IS). It was reported in a Chinese study that 36% of primary MN patients had a VTE, 33% had an RVT and 17% had a PE. Recent research has provided novel data on the incidence of CVEs in primary MN. The morbidity of CVEs was 4.4, 5.4, 8.2, and 8.8% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively, in a primary MN cohort. In addition, they found that the incidence of CVEs was at least as high as that of ESRD early in the course of the disease. Therefore, a reduction in CVEs should be considered as a focus of intervention and as a therapeutic outcome measure in primary MN.

Thus, it is extremely important to implement measures to prevent thromboembolic events as part of the daily support care for primary MN patients with hypoalbuminemia. Unfortunately, the current evidence of the 2012 KDIGO supporting prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation is too weak to better meet the clinical needs of this patient population, given the need to carefully manage anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, and to tailor the therapeutic regime to an individual's risks of thromboembolic events and hemorrhage, we have conducted the present review to provide some suggestions to guide the decision on anticoagulant management in primary MN with a high risk of thrombosis or with thromboembolic complications.

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome-associated thromboembolic disease [^1153q4U2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

After infections, thromboembolism is considered by many experts to be the most significant life-threatening complication of nephrotic syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the epidemiology, clinical and molecular pathophysiology, and management of this complication. Children (2.8%) are less likely than adults (26.7%) with nephrotic syndrome to develop thromboembolism. However, infants and children aged > 12 years are at much greater risk. Membranous histologic changes increase thromboembolic risk at all ages; in particular, adults with membranous nephropathy have the highest reported risk (37.0%) and children with membranous histology have a rate (25%) that approaches the overall adult rate. There are striking, but variable, pathologic alterations of molecular hemostasis associated with nephrotic syndrome. No clear molecular therapeutic targets have been identified, but most studies show that the major pathologic changes involve antithrombin, fibrinogen, and factors V and VIII. There is inadequate evidence to support routine prophylactic therapy. Therapy includes anticoagulation in all cases, with thrombolysis reserved for those with the most severe thromboembolic disease. Future hemostatic research in nephrotic syndrome should focus on identifying cohorts at highest risk for thrombosis through the use of clinical markers and biomarkers as well as searching for molecular targets to correct the prothrombotic pathophysiology of this disease.

### Proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia are risk factors for thromboembolic events in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy: an observational study [^112WKc7Z]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of thromboembolic events (TEs) among whom, patients with membranous nephropathy are at an exaggerated risk. In 1980s, few case series found that the thromboembolic events occur in up to 20% of adult patients with MN. Subsequently, in early 1990s, Bellomo et al. in a letter to the editor reported that a significantly greater proportion of MN patients with thromboembolic events had nephrotic syndrome with serum albumin of less than 25 g/l as compared to patients without thromboembolic events. Based on these published data, it is widely believed that such patients should be prophylactically anticoagulated if serum albumin is less than 20–25 g/l. A recent large retrospective study found an eight times higher absolute risk of venous TEs in patients with nephrotic syndrome and the ratio of proteinuria to serum albumin, not serum albumin alone, predicted venous TEs in their cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome of varied causes. However, the IMN patients were not specifically the focus of investigation.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a report of 21 cases [^1121r6fm]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The HAS-BLED and the GN-risk-score did not accurately predict minor bleeding events. The HAS-BLEED score estimates the one-year risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and the score has been validated in patients with atrial fibrillation on prophylactic anticoagulation, aspirin, or no treatment, and thus has not been validated in this population. Since the coagulation profile of NS patients is distinct from that of patients with atrial fibrillation without renal dysfunction, this may explain why the HAS-BLED score failed to predict bleeding events. The GN-risk-score is a web-based tool, proposed by the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases, designed to assess risk of TE versus risk of bleeding events in patients with membranous glomerulonephritis treated with warfarin with an INR 2–3 dependent on plasma-albumin level. It is based on previously reported incidence of TE in membranous glomerulonephritis and bleeding episodes in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin. The GN-risk-score did not predict bleeding events in our 21 cases, which may be explained by the variety of underlying disease in our NS population and use of DOAC rather than warfarin as prophylactic anticoagulation. Importantly, our study may underestimate the frequency of both minor bleeding episodes and subclinical TE due to the retrospective design including only clinically reported TE and bleeding episodes. The study does not address how DOAC affects the coagulation profile in NS patients, and the sample size is insufficient to conclude on the effectiveness and overall safety of DOAC use in NS patients.

Thus, although we did not observe any TE or major bleeding episodes associated with the use of DOAC in NS, additional research is required before DOAC can be recommended as a standard pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population.

Initiate aspirin if the risk is high.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a report of 21 cases [^112QDmkR]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite international guidelines recommending pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients with NS and high risk of TE, it is currently not known whether or which type of prophylactic treatment are of benefit to these patients. Two trials have examined the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients with NS suggesting that LMWH was safe and effective in preventing TE, but the studies did not include a control group. One uncontrolled, retrospective study compared the use of LMWH and warfarin as thromboprophylaxis in NS with untreated NS patients. No episodes of TE were identified in NS patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, however major bleeding episodes occurred in patients on concomitant aspirin. DOAC represents a newer form of anticoagulation proven superior to LMWH and warfarin in preventing TE in other conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and following variety of orthopedic surgery procedures. Notably, the use of DOAC has been associated with fewer bleeding episodes and lower mortality. So far, the use of DOAC as thromboprophylaxis in NS has been reported in only two case reports, with mixed results as one suggested treatment failure and the other indicated a favorable response. In a pilot study, 16 patients with confirmed venous TE and NS were randomized to receive rivaroxaban or LMWH as treatment for TE showing no difference in the primary outcome measure, which was the absence of major bleeding episodes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DOAC in NS by analysing the thromboembolic and bleeding events in adult patients with NS receiving DOAC to prevent or treat TE.

### Podocytopathies [^1133xBXp]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Podocytopathies are kidney diseases in which direct or indirect podocyte injury drives proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. In children and young adults, genetic variants in > 50 podocyte-expressed genes, syndromal non-podocyte-specific genes and phenocopies with other underlying genetic abnormalities cause podocytopathies associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or severe proteinuria. A variety of genetic variants likely contribute to disease development. Among genes with non-Mendelian inheritance, variants in APOL1 have the largest effect size. In addition to genetic variants, environmental triggers such as immune-related, infection-related, toxic and haemodynamic factors and obesity are also important causes of podocyte injury and frequently combine to cause various degrees of proteinuria in children and adults. Typical manifestations on kidney biopsy are minimal change lesions and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions. Standard treatment for primary podocytopathies manifesting with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions includes glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs; individuals not responding with a resolution of proteinuria have a poor renal prognosis. Renin-angiotensin system antagonists help to control proteinuria and slow the progression of fibrosis. Symptomatic management may include the use of diuretics, statins, infection prophylaxis and anticoagulation. This Primer discusses a shift in paradigm from patient stratification based on kidney biopsy findings towards personalized management based on clinical, morphological and genetic data as well as pathophysiological understanding.

### UK prescribing practice of anticoagulants in patients with chronic kidney disease: a nephrology and haematology-based survey [^111uyRM7]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In renal transplant recipients, most renal pharmacists and nephrology doctors would use DOACs. Haematologists were more conservative with only 58% of them opting to use DOACs. Reluctance to use DOACs may relate to the current EHRA guidelines which suggest consider avoiding DOACs with tacrolimus due to a potential interaction, with tacrolimus being used in most transplant recipients. However, a recent study suggests that tacrolimus has a limited impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban levels and they may be considered as an anticoagulant option.

VTE prophylaxis

For patients with CKD stage 4, the majority of respondents suggested they would use a reduced dose of LMWH for VTE prophylaxis. This is despite only the manufacturers of enoxaparin suggesting a dose reduction is required with a CrCl < 30ml/min. As patients progressed to CKD stage 5 and dialysis, there was increased use of UFH which may relate to uncertainty in dosing of LMWH. To date there are only very small studies with limited patients that suggest dalteparin and tinzaparin do not accumulate at prophylactic doses based on anti-Xa level monitoring. These studies are short in duration so may not reflect what would happen with more prolonged administration.

Anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome

Over 80% of respondents use serum albumin and bleeding risk to consider the use of anticoagulation in NS. This practice corresponds with the recommendations in the KDIGO glomerular disease guide. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) also suggest proteinuria > 10 g/day should be considered a risk factor based on a study by Kumar et al, with 60% of respondents considering the degree of proteinuria in their anticoagulation decision-making. The majority of recommendations in KDIGO relate to membranous nephropathy although the primary reason for nephrotic syndrome was only a factor in decision making by 50% of respondents. The risks factors for VTE occurrence in NS are not yet fully elucidated which may explain the variability seen in what respondents use for decision making.

The choice of anticoagulant was mainly warfarin or therapeutic LMWH for patients with an albumin < 20 g/dL which are suggested options within KDIGO. However, 25% of respondents would use a DOAC in patients with albumin < 20 g/dL which has currently been poorly studied and is limited to a single report of two cases. There is an ongoing study to determine apixaban pharmacokinetics in patients with NS taking multiple doses compared to healthy volunteers (NCT04278729).

### The crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulation disorder: pathogenesis, treatment, and dilemmas [^116vLyuR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The interaction between the kidney and the coagulation system greatly affects each other because of the abundant vessel distribution and blood perfusion in the kidney. Clinically, the risks of complicated thrombosis and bleeding have become important concerns in the treatment of nephropathies, especially nephrotic syndrome, CKD, ESKD, and patients with nephropathy undergoing RRTs. Adverse effects of anticoagulant or procoagulant therapies in patients with nephropathy, especially anticoagulation-related nephropathy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding, seriously worsen the prognosis of patients, which have become challenges for clinicians. Over the decades, the interaction between the kidney and the coagulation system has been widely studied. However, the effects of the kidney on the coagulation system have not been systematically investigated. Although some coagulation-related proteins and signaling pathways have been shown to improve coagulation abnormalities while avoiding additional kidney damage in certain kidney diseases, their potential as anticoagulation targets in nephropathy requires further investigation. Here, we review the progression of research on the crosstalk between the coagulation system and kidney diseases and systematically analyze the significance and shortcomings of previous studies to provide new sight into future research. In addition, we highlight the status of clinical treatment for coagulation disorder and nephropathy caused by each other, indicating guidance for the formulation of therapeutic strategies or drug development.

These clinical observations suggest a heterogeneous pathogenesis underlying the current disease classification. As a result, the enrollment of patient populations with divergent causes of disease may have contributed to the failure of several clinical trials, and personalized treatments for MCD and FSGS are currently unavailable. Enhanced phenotyping may become possible through the emergence of novel biomarkers from well-defined cohorts, such as North American Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), as these allow for the identification of relevant disease pathways. For example, the detection of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) kidney pathway activation by molecular profiling identified a subgroup of patients with either MCD or FSGS. This discovery led to the design of a clinical trial testing TNF inhibition in a subgroup with a greater likelihood of disease progression.

This article considers the evidence supporting the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Glomerular Diseases (KDIGO 2021 GD), and highlights published and upcoming developments that might influence adjustments of guidelines and impact treatment decisions with particular considerations regarding immunosuppressive therapies, podocyte-directed drugs, or agents used to optimize chronic kidney disease (CKD) management. Few major advances have been reported since the publication of KDIGO 2021 GD; however, this article will dissect certain KDIGO recommendations and will also highlight the need for an upgrade of rituximab, which seems to be particularly effective in managing cases with MCD. Additional work can be found in the supplementary data (see online supplementary material), as we focus on alternative approaches when patients have relapsing/resistant disease, calcineurin inhibitor therapy in FSGS, extracorporeal therapies and anticoagulation with a specific focus on MCD/FSGS.

Hypercoagulability and thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome — venous thromboembolic disease is emphasized as more common in membranous nephropathy, often occurring within the first 6 months and increasing with hypoalbuminemia; unfractionated or low–molecular-weight heparin or warfarin are preferred when thromboembolic risk exceeds bleeding risk, while factor Xa inhibitors are not recommended at this time. The text states this "often occurs within the first 6 months of diagnosis, and at increasing frequency with a serum albumin level of less than 2.9 g/dL". It specifies that "treatment doses of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin are the preferred agents for treatment or prevention in those felt to have thromboembolic risk greater than bleeding risk". It also notes that "factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors have significant/ moderate albumin binding and are therefore lost in nephrotic urine", and "these popular agents are not recommended at this time".

### The risk of thromboembolic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome and relatively high albumin levels: a study over 10 years [^111XN7QW]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thromboembolic events are common complications of NS (nephrotic syndrome). Within the first 6 months of NS, the risks of thromboembolic events, both VTE (venous thrombus embolism) and ATE (atrial thrombus embolism), are considered to be particularly high (annual incidences, 9.85% and 5.52%). Regardless of the primary factors of the disease or the secondary factors caused by subsequent treatment, various factors jointly participate in the hypercoagulable state of patients with NS and lead to thromboembolic events, further worsening their prognosis.

In the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline, histological diagnosis [especially of MN (membranous nephropathy), proteinuria level (24-h proteinuria > 10 g/d), and serum albumin level (< 25 g/L) are listed as the best predictors of VTE for glomerulonephritis. Regardless of the degree of proteinuria, a low serum albumin level is considered to increase the VTE risk independently. The VTE risk increases proportionately with declining albumin level. A large cohort study identified a total of 158 VTE events in 7037 patients [absolute event rate (AER) 2.25%], an AER of 4.1% in patients with albumin < 2.5 g/dL, an AER of 3.4% in patients with albumin 2.5–2.99 g/dL, an AER of 2.5% in patients with albumin 3–3.99 g/dL and an AER of only 1.4% in patients with albumin > 4 g/dL. On the other hand, ATE has been associated with eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and multiple classical risk factors for atherosclerosis but not with either proteinuria or serum albumin level in patients with NS.

While current prophylactic anticoagulation indications mainly focus on low serum albumin level (< 25 g/L), little is known about the proportion and characteristics of patients with relatively high serum albumin levels. Therefore, we conducted a study to explore the proportion of patients with relatively high albumin levels among those with NS and relevant thromboembolic events and to assess the difference between those with relatively high albumin levels (≥ 25 g/L) and low albumin levels (< 25 g/L). Our findings could help with clinical decision making in regard to prophylactic anticoagulation.

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^116L9rns]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In these recommendations, we provide guidance to multidisciplinary teams for the initial diagnostic work-up and monitoring of complications in children with CNS. We recommend prompt genetic screening in all children with CNS and genetic counselling of their families. Routine kidney biopsy is not recommended but may be considered in patients with sporadic, non-syndromic disease if comprehensive genetic testing has not yielded a molecular diagnosis. Therapeutic management should be adapted to the clinical severity of the condition with the aim of maintaining intravascular euvolaemia and adequate nutrition, preventing complications such as infections, thrombosis, psychomotor delay and failure to thrive, and preserving the vasculature. We recommend basing the use of albumin infusions on clinical indicators of hypovolaemia or on failure to thrive, rather than on serum albumin levels. When possible, we recommend avoiding CVLs owing to the high risk of thrombosis. We provide guidance for symptomatic treatment of CNS, including use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, diuretics, anticoagulation during states of increased thrombosis, vaccination and IVIG infusions in selected patients. We do not recommend performing routine early nephrectomies but suggest that they are considered in patients with severe complications, despite optimization of conservative treatment, and before transplantation in patients with persisting nephrotic syndrome and/or WT1 -dominant pathogenic variants.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^116UqLe2]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.5.2

We suggest that non-nephrotic range proteinuria in pregnancy is a risk factor for thrombosis and thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin should be considered in the presence of additional risk factors (2D).

Rationale

The guideline committee endorses the assessment and management of VTE risk in women with CKD according to guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) which states that all pregnant women undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Nephrotic syndrome is included as a significant risk factor in RCOG guidance with thromboprophylaxis offered to women with nephrotic syndrome in the third trimester and post-partum in the absence of other risk factors. However, there is inherent difficulty in making the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy as physiological adaptation to pregnancy includes increased proteinuria, a fall in serum albumin concentrations, and peripheral oedema. Gestation specific thresholds for proteinuria and serum albumin for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy have not been established. This guideline therefore opts to use the Renal Association threshold for nephrotic range proteinuria (uPCR > 300 mg/mmol or ACR > 250 mg/mmol) to define high-risk proteinuria in pregnancy for which there is expert consensus that thromboprophylaxis is warranted in pregnancy and the post-partum period in the absence of other risk factors (with risk reassessed at 6 weeks post-partum).

Table 1
Stages of chronic kidney disease based on glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories 2

The risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is double in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2. 3 The study model most relevant to clinical practice is AF in CKD. The prevalence of AF increases with the decline in renal function, the prevalence of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) being two or even three times higher than in the general population. 4 Depending on the studied cohorts, the prevalence of AF in CKD patients was estimated to range between 12% and 18% compared to 7%‐8% in the general population over 65 years of age. The prevalence of AF remains high (11.6%) in dialysis‐dependent CKD, and 12 months after kidney transplantation, the risk of AF occurrence increases up to 35.6% per 1000 patient years. 5 On the other hand, large prospective cohort studies demonstrate the relationship between incident AF and an 80% higher risk of decline in eGFR and a 116% higher risk of proteinuria detection. 6 In the chronic renal insufficiency cohort prospective study, AF led to a 3‐fold higher risk of progression to ESRD. 7 The association between AF and CKD engenders a much higher thromboembolic risk, which in case of ischemic stroke ranges from 26% to 49%, depending on the study. 5 Also, the relative risk of mortality increases by up to 66%. 6 The association between ACS and CKD is also well documented in registries. Thus, 40% of non‐ST segment‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) cases and 30% of ST segment‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cases associate eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and mortality is double compared with general population. 3 The risk of pulmonary venous thromboembolism (VTE) in CKD increases by 25%‐30% is constant in all CKD stages, and typically characterizes the nephrotic syndrome. 8

### Case report: a 5-year-old with new onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 infection [^112smSTn]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

New-onset nephrotic syndrome following viral illnesses has been reported in literature and SARS-Cov-2 infection may be one more of these viruses. There are two case reports of new-onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 disease. We present the third case of new-onset nephrotic syndrome likely triggered by the novel SARS-Cov-2 infection.

In the two published case reports, both children had COVID-19-related symptoms prior to diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. One of the cases is an eight-year old boy, with the typical age range for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome while the other is a 15-year old boy.

Our patient, however, developed nephrotic syndrome despite being otherwise asymptomatic from a COVID-19 perspective. This suggests that kidney involvement may be possible even in the absence of any other clear COVID-19 clinical symptoms.

An important consideration for our patient was whether or not to treat her with corticosteroids given her COVID-19 positive status, and the potential to worsen her infection. Previous case reports reported giving corticosteroids to patients with COVID-19 and new-onset nephrotic syndrome without negative outcomes, and the decision was thus made to treat our patient with conventional corticosteroid therapy. Our patient did well with this course of treatment, and did not have any overt clinical symptoms following initiation of corticosteroid therapy. We were interested to find that our patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at her follow up visit 5 weeks after initial diagnosis. While we did not quantify the patient's antibody titers, which makes it difficult to know whether and at what rate antibodies were declining at this repeat check, studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 serum IgM begins to decline in the second month after onset of infection. Thus, the continued presence of serum IgM 5 weeks after an initial positive test may be related to the timing of infection in our patient. At this time, it is not known whether or not steroids influence the rate of antibody decline, though this is perhaps something that could be studied by future researchers. In consonance with childhood nephrotic syndrome we elected not to proceed with kidney biopsy but initiate treatment with corticosteroids first. Our patient did well, and had normalization of her coagulation profile following treatment of her nephrotic syndrome. She never required anticoagulation.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with nephrotic syndrome: a report of 21 cases [^115zxnQ1]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, no episodes of TE were observed in patients with NS when treated with DOAC for a mean of 72 days. The vast majority (n = 19, 90%) of patients were prescribed DOAC as primary thromboprophylaxis, while 2 (10%) patients was commenced on DOAC after a TE associated with NS. In most cases, the discontinuation of DOAC was due to an increase in plasma albumin or a decline in eGFR below 15 mL/min/1.73m2. The use of DOAC was not associated with any major bleedings, whereas minor bleeding episodes were identified in 23% of patients. Neither the HAS-BLED score nor the GN-risk-score predicted the risk of minor bleedings. Corticosteroid treatment is known to increase the risk of thromboembolic events as well as the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the general population. Fifteen patients were prescribed corticosteroids during the study, two of which had a non-gastrointestinal, minor bleeding episode while on treatment.

Previous research has shown that the risk of TE in NS patients varies significantly depending on the degree of the diagnostic screening and the underlying disease, with the highest risk in patients with membranous glomerulonephritis. In a cohort study including 206 NS patients not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation the overall incidence of TE was 6.8%. These patients had a serum albumin level below 19 g/L with different types of pathological leading to NS. We have previously reported an incidence of TE of 12% in a cohort of 35 NS patients also not receiving thromboprophylaxis and with a plasma albumin ranging from 11–29. In the cohort, on which the GN-risk-score is based, the frequency of TE in NS due to membranous glomerulonephritis and a serum albumin < 20 g/L was 11%. Based on these data, we estimate that the expected incidence of TE in this case series would be between 0.2 and 1.3 patient cases if not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation.

Regarding medical management for membranous nephropathy, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the risk of venous thromboembolic events is high if serum albumin is < 20 g/L by bromocresol purple or < 25 g/L by bromocresol green. Assess bleeding risk with glomerulonephritis tools. Initiate aspirin if the risk is high, or warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin with aspirin if the risk is low.

### Management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with primary membranous nephropathy [^116kSY5m]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been recognized that primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is related to an increased risk for thromboembolic complications. However, the current evidence supporting prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation is too weak to better meet the clinical needs of this patient population. The present review provides some suggestions to guide the decision on anticoagulant management in primary MN patients with a high risk of thrombosis or with thromboembolic complication.

Materials and Methods

We extracted relevant studies by searching the published literature using the Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed and Web of Science from March 1968 to March 2018. Eligible publications included guidelines, reviews, case reports, and clinical trial studies that concerned the rational management of anticoagulation therapy in the primary MN population. The evidence was thematically synthesized to contextualize implementation issues.

Results

It was helpful for clinicians to make a decision for personalized prophylactic aspirin or warfarin in primary MN patients when serum albumin was < 3.2g/dl to prevent arterial and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). The treatment regimen for thromboembolic complications (VTEs, acute coronary syndrome and ischemic stroke) in primary MN was almost similar to that for the general population with thromboembolic events. It is noteworthy that patients should continue the previous primary MN treatment protocol during the entire treatment period until they achieve remission, the protocol is complete and the underlying diseases resolve.

Conclusion

The utility of prophylactic aspirin or warfarin may have clinical benefits for the primary prevention of thromboembolic events in primary MN with hypoalbuminemia. It is necessary to perform large randomized controlled trials and to formulate relevant guidelines to support the present review.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^114fxaFL]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and research needs for these recommendations

The guideline panel determined that there is a very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit from using anticoagulation and/or thrombolysis in neonates with RVT related to avoiding long-term kidney disease. The decision to start anticoagulation and/or thrombolysis should be individualized based on balancing the risk of thrombotic complications with the underlying bleeding risk.

The panel identified the following additional research needs:
1 Treatment and outcomes of unprovoked or provoked RVT in subpopulations of pediatric patients other than the neonatal age group, which include older pediatric patients, and patients with nephrotic syndrome, infection-related RVT, or RVT associated with CVADs
2 Prospective evaluation of the prognostic impact of patient- and thrombosis-related factors, allowing for more precise risk stratification in various patient subpopulations
3 Subgroups of neonates and pediatric patients who would benefit most from thrombolysis

For neonates and children with PVT, should anticoagulation vs no anticoagulation be used?

Recommendation 11a

For neonates and children with occlusive PVT and for children with nonocclusive PVT, post–liver transplant PVT, or unprovoked PVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Recommendation 11b

For neonates with nonocclusive PVT, and for children who have already developed PHTN secondary to PVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks for recommendations 11a and 11b: Neonates and pediatric patients who did not receive anticoagulation warrant follow-up monitoring, because extension of thrombus or organ dysfunction may require reconsideration of treatment options. Evidence from the available observational studies describes (complete or partial) PVT resolution in patients who did receive anticoagulation, as well as those who did not receive anticoagulation. This does not allow for assessment of the degree of benefit from anticoagulation. However, the panel placed value on avoiding the potential increased risk of long-term complications associated with persistent occlusive thrombus, and therefore favored treatment in this setting. The panel also recognized the potential increased risk of bleeding in pediatric patients with PHTN and development of esophageal varices, and therefore did not recommend anticoagulation in that setting.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome prevents thromboembolic complications [^111AFyCh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on a retrospective analysis this study shows that the use of PAC to all patients with NS and a P-albumin < 2.0 g/dL significantly reduced the number of clinically significant TE. It was also associated with a non-significant increase in the number of bleeding episodes of which one was fatal.

We are able to compare the PAC-treated NS patients to a group of untreated patients as there were different practices regarding the use of PAC in the two neighboring, renal departments. The two groups were comparable regarding gender, age or renal function; however, plasma albumin was significantly lower in the PAC-group. Different studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia is a major risk factor and strongly associated with venous TE, and thus is possible that the non-treated group was biased against a lower risk of TE suggesting that benefit of PAC in preventing TE may be greater than observed. The incidence of TE in our study, including both arterial and venous thromboembolic events, was 12%. Like previous studies we also found most TE to occur within the first months after the diagnosis of NS.

### Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome prevents thromboembolic complications [^116rYsPv]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

An increased incidence of thromboembolic events (TE) are reported in nephrotic syndrome (NS) leading to recommendations for prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC). However, as no randomized clinical trial has established the efficacy or risks associated with PAC, guidelines are empiric or substantiated only by estimates of risks and benefits.

This study evaluates the risk of TE and hemorrhagic complications in patients with NS treated with PAC and compares to patients not receiving PAC.

Methods

We included patients diagnosed with NS from two Danish nephrology departments with different practices for the use of PAC. Patients were included if presenting with NS from September 2006 to January 2012, a P-albumin < 30 g/L, and renal biopsy confirming non-diabetic, glomerular disease. Patients aged < 16 years, on renal replacement therapy, or administered anticoagulants at the onset of NS were excluded. Bleeding episodes and/or TE were identified from patient records. Bleeding episodes were divided into minor and major bleeding.

Results

Of the 79 patients included, 44 patients received PAC either as low or high dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or as warfarin with or without LMWH as bridging, while 35 did not receive PAC. P-albumin was significant lower in the PAC group compared to those not receiving PAC. Significantly more TEs was observed in the non-PAC group compared to the PAC group (4 versus 0 episodes, P = 0.035). The TEs observed included one patient with pulmonary embolism (PE), one with PE and deep vein thrombosis, one with PE and renal vein thrombosis, and one with a stroke. Five patients with bleeding episodes were identified among those receiving PAC, of which two were major and three were minor, while two patients in the non-PAC group experienced a minor bleeding episode (P = 0.45 between groups). The major bleeding episodes only occurred in patients receiving PAC in combination with low dose aspirin.

Conclusions

In patients with NS the use of PAC was associated with a decreased risk of clinically significant TE, but may also be associated with more bleeding episodes although not statistically significant. Only patients treated with PAC in combination with anti-platelet therapy had major bleeding episodes.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^111eH6hZ]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP perioperative antiplatelet and anticoagulant management — development approach and referenced discontinuation guidance are described as follows: Guidelines are "developed based on a comprehensive review of the literature of thromboembolic risk, bleeding risk, anatomical factors, procedural factors and medical or physiologic status", with "Table 22" presenting management guidance and "Table 23" a procedural checklist. General advice cited from ASRA is "to discontinue the drugs for 5 half-lives for drugs following first-order metabolism; however, the stoppage for 5 half-lives recommendation should occur in individuals with hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction including nephrotic syndrome", though "Cessation of all drugs for 5 half-lives may not be sound for interventional techniques in the perioperative period", even as "5 half-lives are required to eliminate a drug completely". For direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), CHEST clinical practice guidelines "published in 2022 (10), recommend cessation for one day in patients with low- and moderate-risk, and 2 days for high-risk procedures", and they vary "if there is renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance of less than 50 mL per minute". Based on ASRA, "Dabigatran is recommended to stop for 4 days, whereas Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Edoxaban have been recommended to stop for 3 days", and ASRA "described 3 case reports of spinal hematoma related to DOAC, with all of them being subarachnoid or intrathecal injections". For the present document, "the panel has decided to utilize extensively studied guidelines for chest physicians (10), and other available literature including other available guidelines".

### Use of rivaroxaban in a patient with history of nephrotic syndrome and hypercoagulability [^114dfhwJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypercoagulability, resulting in thromboembolic events, can be a life-threatening complication of nephrotic syndrome (NS). Conventional anticoagulants, such as warfarin, have been the standard of care for more than 50 years; however, the availability of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) have provided additional options for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Documented use of the TSOACs in patients with NS and hypercoagulability is currently limited.

Case Summary

We present the case of an 18-year-old young woman with NS and renal vein thrombosis who was readmitted with bilateral pulmonary emboli on therapeutic doses of warfarin, with a goal international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The decision was made to transition the patient from warfarin to rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor.

Discussion

Rivaroxaban was the first of the emerging TSOACs to be FDA approved for both prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. With favorable safety and efficacy data compared with warfarin in addition to a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and the lack of requirement of routine monitoring, rivaroxaban provides a useful alternative in this patient population.

Summary

While on therapeutic anticoagulation, a patient previously diagnosed with NS and renal vein thrombosis experienced pulmonary emboli on a conventional anticoagulant and was switched to a target-specific oral anticoagulant with documented completion of 6 months of therapy without recurrent thromboembolism.

Despite the overall recommendation against AT use, subgroups in which AT might be justified include documented inherited antithrombin deficiency not achieving clinical benefit on anticoagulation; children with low AT compared with age-appropriate levels; acute lymphoblastic leukemia on induction using asparaginase; nephrotic syndrome; neonates; postliver transplant; and children with disseminated intravascular coagulation and VTE. Usually, AT would be commenced if there were continuous thrombus growth and/or failure of clinical response despite adequate anticoagulation, but there was no evidence to suggest improved outcomes in these patients.

### Association of serum albumin level and venous thromboembolic events in a large cohort of patients with nephrotic syndrome [^115zekMt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prior small studies have suggested an association between low serum albumin and increased risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS).

Methods

From a nationally representative prospective cohort of over 3 million US veterans with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, we identified 7037 patients with NS based on ICD-9 codes. Association between serum albumin and risk of incident VTE was assessed using Cox regression analysis with adjustments for age, gender, race, comorbidities, eGFR, body mass index and anticoagulant treatment.

Results

Mean age was 57 ± 11 years, patients were 96% male, 32% African-American and 60% diabetic. There were a total of 158 VTE events over a median follow-up of 8.1 years; 16 events [absolute event rate (AER) 4.1%, event rate 8.5/1000 patient-years (PY)] in patients with albumin < 2.5 g/dL, 18 events (AER 3.4%, event rate 5.7/1000 patient-years) in patients with albumin 2.5–2.99 g/dL, 89 events (AER 2.5%, event rate 3.4/1000 patient-years) in patients with albumin 3–3.99 g/dL and 35 events (AER 1.4%, event rate 1.9/1000 patient-years) in patients with albumin ≥ 4 g/dL. Compared with patients with albumin ≥ 4 g/dL, those with albumin levels of 3–3.99 g/dL [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–2.26], 2.5–2.99 g/dL (HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.24–4.05) and < 2.5 g/dL (HR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.45–5.37) experienced a linearly higher risk of VTE events.

Conclusions

Lower serum albumin is a strong independent predictor for VTE events in NS. The risk increases proportionately with declining albumin levels. Clinical trials are needed to determine benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation in NS patients with moderately lower serum albumin levels.

### The crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulation disorder: pathogenesis, treatment, and dilemmas [^1167oBLH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

The interaction between the kidney and the coagulation system greatly affects each other because of the abundant vessel distribution and blood perfusion in the kidney. Clinically, the risks of complicated thrombosis and bleeding have become important concerns in the treatment of nephropathies, especially nephrotic syndrome, CKD, ESKD, and patients with nephropathy undergoing RRTs. Adverse effects of anticoagulant or procoagulant therapies in patients with nephropathy, especially anticoagulation-related nephropathy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding, seriously worsen the prognosis of patients, which have become challenges for clinicians. Over the decades, the interaction between the kidney and the coagulation system has been widely studied. However, the effects of the kidney on the coagulation system have not been systematically investigated. Although some coagulation-related proteins and signaling pathways have been shown to improve coagulation abnormalities while avoiding additional kidney damage in certain kidney diseases, their potential as anticoagulation targets in nephropathy requires further investigation. Here, we review the progression of research on the crosstalk between the coagulation system and kidney diseases and systematically analyze the significance and shortcomings of previous studies to provide new sight into future research. In addition, we highlight the status of clinical treatment for coagulation disorder and nephropathy caused by each other, indicating guidance for the formulation of therapeutic strategies or drug development.

### Nephrotic syndrome [^111xSMRK]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

On the basis of observational studies, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in school-aged children is minimal change disease. On the basis of research evidence and consensus, corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy for treatment of nephrotic syndrome. On the basis of consensus, prednisone therapy should be initiated at doses of 60 mg/m2 per day (2 mg/kg per day) administered for 4 to 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 per dose (1.5 mg/kg) every other day for at least 6 to 8 weeks. On the basis of consensus and expert opinion, it is important to recognize and manage the complications that can arise in patients with nephrotic syndrome, such as dyslipidemia, infection, and thrombosis. On the basis of research evidence, consensus, and expert opinion, several alternative therapies have been observed to have variable efficacy in children with both corticosteroid-dependent and corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, although caution must be exercised in the administration of these corticosteroid-sparing medications secondary to toxic adverse effects. On the basis of observational studies, the course of nephrotic syndrome in most patients is that of relapse and remission.

Other Hypercoagulable States

Very limited data exist on the role of NOACs in other hypercoagulable states such as inherited coagulopathies (homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency, elevated levels of factors VII–XII), or the nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with these conditions were significantly underrepresented in the current trials. Dabigatran was prescribed in a 21‐year‐old woman with recurrent VTEs caused by protein C deficiency, complicated by warfarin‐induced skin necrosis, and inability to maintain anticoagulation on LMWH. The patient did not experience any VTE recurrence in 6 months of follow‐up. 106 Rivaroxaban was prescribed to a 30‐year‐old woman who had homozygosity of factor V Leiden mutation and who sustained an ovarian vein thrombosis with proximal extension to the renal vein. The patient remained free of symptoms without recurrence of thrombi or bleeding complications. 107 Dabigatran 108 and rivaroxaban 109 have been used for secondary prophylaxis in a few patients with nephrotic syndrome. Anticoagulation in these patients has been traditionally achieved with VKAs or heparins. 110, 111

### Should aspirin be used for primary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with membranous nephropathy? [^111BasRG]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of thrombosis. The risk of venous thrombosis is particularly high in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to primary membranous nephropathy. Recent data provide evidence that these patients also have a high absolute risk of arterial thrombotic events, which is associated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia. In this commentary we discuss whether prophylactic aspirin therapy might be indicated in this patient population.

### UK prescribing practice of anticoagulants in patients with chronic kidney disease: a nephrology and haematology-based survey [^113hTQBS]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

A survey to gain insight into anticoagulant prescribing practice in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) across the UK was disseminated via renal and haematology networks. Areas of anticoagulant use included patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), requiring thromboprophylaxis for VTE, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and nephrotic syndrome.

An online-survey was disseminated via British Haematology Society, UK Kidney Association, and Renal Pharmacy Group over a five month period. All responses were voluntary and anonymous.

Among 117 responses there were 49 nephrology doctors, 47 renal pharmacists and 20 haematology clinicians. A specialist multidisciplinary team to discuss the specific anticoagulant management of these patients was only available to 3% (4/117) respondents. Renal function estimate used for anticoagulant dosing was mainly Cockcroft-Gault for pharmacists and haematology but lab-based estimates were used by nephrology doctors. Therapeutic dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin was mostly likely to be reduced by one-third when used for VTE treatment, with the majority of units undertaking anti-Xa monitoring in CKD stage 5 and dialysis. Direct-acting Oral Anticoagulants are being used in patients with nephrotic syndrome, those with CKD stage 5 and on dialysis for VTE and AF in the absence of license in these indications.

This survey highlighted the significant differences between anticoagulant prescribing in CKD between two professional specialties and marked variation between centres in anticoagulant management strategies employed for these patients. With gaps still existing in the evidence base and answers to these not expected within the next few years, development of a best-practice guideline would be warranted to support clinicians in this field.

### An atypical cause of amyloidosis: a case of combined heavy and light chain amyloidosis [^115MyCgp]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The supportive care focuses on alleviating disease symptoms, mitigating the effects of treatment on the function of affected organs, and maintaining the patient's quality of life, therefore, an interdisciplinary team is essential for the management of these patients.

For patients with anasarca due nephrotic syndrome and/or heart failure, salt and fluid restriction along with diuretics, most commonly loop diuretics are the mainstay of treatment with close monitoring of electrolytes, kidney function, vital signs, and body weight.

Medications like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are known for their ability to protect kidney function and reduce proteinuria in non-AL kidney diseases. However, in patients with AL amyloidosis, these drugs can have an exaggerated hypotensive effect due to the increased reliance on angiotensin to maintain blood pressure, in addition to their unclear role in amyloidosis.

In addition, managing acute compensatory hyperlipidemia and evaluating thrombotic risk, especially in the context of severe hypoalbuminemia (< 2 g/dL), requires careful consideration. The use of prophylactic anticoagulation, as guided by findings from other causes of nephrotic syndrome, must be balanced against the increased risk of bleeding diatheses associated with amyloidosis.

Patients with kidney amyloidosis who progress to end-stage kidney disease may be treated with dialysis or transplantation. Patients with kidney amyloidosis can have good outcomes after renal transplantation, especially when they achieve complete or very good partial hematologic response prior to transplant.

Ten NS episodes (45%) were treated with apixaban (8 NS episodes were treated with 5 mg twice daily and 2 NS episodes treated with 2.5 mg twice daily because of low body weight and reduced kidney function), while 12 (55%) were treated with rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) (Table 3). The median duration of treatment was considerably shorter in patients receiving DOAC as primary thromboprophylaxis (median of 72 days) when compared to the patients with a preceding TE (median of 970 days).

No TE was recorded during DOAC administration. There were no major bleeding episodes; however, five minor bleeding episodes were noted during DOAC administration occurring at a median of 204 days [109–897] after commencement of treatment. No differences in histological diagnosis, type of DOAC, HAS-BLED score or GN-risk-score were observed when compared to patients without bleeding.

The minor bleeding episodes included macroscopic hematuria, cutaneous hematoma, abnormal menorrhagia, and subconjunctival bleeding. All recorded bleeding episodes were in patients with a HAS BLED score of 0 (n = 3) or 1 (n = 2) and GN-risk-score of low risk (n = 4) and intermediate risk (n = 1). One patient with a minor bleeding episode received concomitant antiplatelet treatment.

Treatment of lupus nephritis — general practice statements (GPS): "Prompt glucocorticoid treatment should be administered for suspected LN to suppress acute inflammation while awaiting a kidney biopsy and the histopathology results". "Dosage of LN medications should be adjusted in people with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the initiation of therapy and periodically as indicated during the disease course". "Adjunctive treatment with systemic anticoagulation for people with LN and significant risk factors for thrombosis (e.g., low serum albumin in the context of severe proteinuria) should be discussed with nephrology", and nephrology guidelines "recommend treating patients with a serum albumin concentration between 2.0–2.5 g/dl in the setting of nephrotic range proteinuria with full-dose anticoagulation to prevent clotting unless the risk of bleeding is high".

Outcome

Baseline characteristics included: demographic information, plasma albumin, blood haemoglobin, platelet count, plasma creatinine, urine albumin, kidney biopsy histological diagnosis, and the type and duration of DOAC treatment. The biochemical analyses were performed using automated, standardized clinical assays at the local laboratory. Patients were followed from the start date of DOAC treatment to the end of the treatment period or end of study period. Outcomes were any TE or bleeding episodes recorded in medical records and were based on clinical symptoms or findings that would lead to relevant examinations as judged by the treating physician. Asymptomatic patients were not regularly screened for TE by ultrasound or similar. Using the International Society on Thrombosis (ISTH) bleeding scale, bleedings were classified as major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, referred to as minor bleeding throughout this paper. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was calculated based on the presence or absence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or cerebral ischemia, vascular disease, age and gender, while the HAS-BLED score calculation was based on the presence or absence of hypertension, abnormal kidney and/or liver function, prior major bleeding, age, previous stroke, Labile INR, drugs and/or alcohol abuse. The GN-risk-score was calculated using an online tool, which estimate the ATRIA Bleeding Risk Category (Low Risk, Intermediate Risk or High Risk) in patients with membranous nephropathy. The GN-risk-score is used to estimate the risk of bleeding versus the benefit of anticoagulation based on age, gender, race, kidney function, serum albumin, haemoglobin level and history of haemorrhage and hypertension.

Supportive management of amyloidosis-associated nephrotic syndrome — Management is similar to other glomerulopathies and includes dietary sodium restriction, loop diuretic agents sometimes with a thiazide such as metolazone, and compression stockings to reduce edema and increase tolerability of diuretics. Torsemide or bumetanide orally, or intravenously administered loop diuretics, may be more effective than oral furosemide in intestinal wall edema, and intravenous albumin can facilitate diuresis when there is marked hypoalbuminemia (eg, serum albumin < 1.5–2 g/dL). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can be used for antiproteinuric effects if blood pressure is not prohibitively low. Although sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors slow decline in chronic kidney disease and in HFrEF, this class has not been studied in amyloid-associated kidney dysfunction. Managing volume overload requires balancing fluid removal with hemodynamic changes that reduce kidney perfusion and GFR, and lipid-lowering agents can have some effect though many patients continue to have markedly elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications is generally not recommended specifically for amyloidosis-associated nephrotic syndrome in the absence of other indications.

Box 3 Recommendations for fluid and albumin administration

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit due to the complexity of the disease and fluid management.
We recommend avoiding intravenous fluids and saline. Oral fluid intake should be concentrated if necessary to avoid marked oedema.
We recommend using albumin infusions based on clinical indicators of hypovolaemia (including oliguria, acute kidney injury, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension and abdominal discomfort) or upon failure to thrive. We do not recommend administering albumin infusions in children with CNS based on serum albumin levels.
When possible, we recommend avoiding central venous lines in children with CNS owing to the high risk of thrombosis. If central venous access is required for repeated albumin infusions, we recommend administering prophylactic anticoagulation for as long as the line is in place (Box 7).

General approach

We recommend rapid referral of children with CNS to a specialized paediatric nephrology unit. These children are often born prematurely and amniotic fluid may be stained with meconium but ventilator therapy is rarely needed. Pregnancy is usually uneventful. Given the wide variation in clinical findings in infants with CNS, individualized therapy is needed, with a number of key objectives: preserve all central and peripheral arteries and veins for potential dialysis access; avoid peripherally inserted catheters and unnecessary venepunctures; optimize fluid, protein and caloric intake; minimize administration of salt-containing fluids; prevent thrombosis, particularly in patients with a CVL or hypovolaemia; and treat infection when clinically suspected by starting empiric antibiotics before culture results are available. C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels are not reliable indicators of septicaemia in patients with CNS.

Fluid management

As no studies have investigated specific treatments for oedema in CNS, treatment should focus on assessment of volume status (that is, overfill versus underfill) and salt restriction, as recommended for adult patients. Fluid restriction is advocated for hyponatraemia and in the most severe cases of oedema.

Fluid prescription in patients with CNS should primarily be used to provide adequate nutrition. Intake of fluid should be limited, when feasible, by using concentrated high-calorie formulas to meet age-related energy needs, guided by the advice of expert renal dieticians. Intravenous albumin is the treatment of choice for acute symptomatic hypovolaemia (see below).

### Management of congenital nephrotic syndrome: consensus recommendations of the ERKNet-ESPN working group [^115PF8Ph]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

We suggest that preventive anticoagulation should be considered in all children with CNS and/or a prior thrombosis and during states of increased thrombosis risk (i.e. acute illness, risk of dehydration, inserted central lines and/or thrombocytosis > 750,000/ml) (Box 8). The general goal of antithrombotic therapy is to prevent the formation, local extension and recurrence of thrombosis, embolism, and long-term complications. Infusion of antithrombin III (ATIII; 50 units/kg) before the placement of a central venous catheter is recommended. Agents that have been used for antithrombotic prophylaxis in nephrotic syndrome include heparin, vitamin K antagonist and aspirin. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins may be ineffective owing to reduced antithrombin III levels. In Finnish patients with CNS and CVLs, long-term warfarin prophylaxis (target international normalized ratio 2–2.5) has been routinely used for decades and no substantial increase in the risk of bleeding has been observed (T. Hölttä, unpublished data). However, the clinical benefit of warfarin has not been substantiated in a controlled trial. Although early reports suggest that anticoagulation might prevent cerebral thromboses in children with CNS, a recent retrospective outcome study reported that anti-thrombotic prophylaxis with warfarin, heparin or aspirin did not change the incidence of thrombotic events. As aspirin might induce AKI, when considered for patients with CNS it should be used with caution and high doses should be avoided. Case reports exist of successful use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants that inhibit factor Xa as thromboprophylaxis in adults with nephrotic syndrome. Magnesium and calcium supplements should be given to children with CNS when necessary to avoid very low levels that may promote thromboses.

Infection prophylaxis and management

Antibiotics

Infections are a major concern and the primary cause of death in children with CNS. These children are prone to infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococci because of urinary losses of IgG and complement opsonins. However, prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely indicated as several studies have shown that they are not associated with a significant reduction in the rate of sepsis. Appropriate therapeutic antibiotics should be started promptly in patients with proven or suspected acute bacterial infection(Box 8).

Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) in pediatrics — thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone (Recommendation 6): For pediatric patients with CSVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation alone rather than thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕OOO). The panel suggests use of anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis for children with CSVT who have no evidence of ischemia; however, thrombolysis may be considered when there is neurologic deterioration despite anticoagulation and, in such or similar instances, reperfusion therapies may be considered depending on local resources or experiences. Evidence synthesis identified 9 pediatric studies comprising > 700 pediatric patients across neonates to adolescents aged 18 years; mortality was assessed in 3 studies, neurologic outcome in 6 studies (2 using the pediatric stroke outcome measure), thrombus resolution in 5 studies, thrombus recurrence in 3 studies, and bleeding in 6 studies. A single case series of 10 pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome addressed thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation (6 patients) vs anticoagulation alone in children aged 3 to 10 years with CSVT. Adult guidance noted reserving thrombolysis for deterioration or progression despite anticoagulation, and a randomized trial in adults did not show a benefit from endovascular treatment vs anticoagulation alone with higher mortality in the endovascular treatment arm.

### Case report: a 5-year-old with new onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 infection [^1173E12u]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This is the third case of new-onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 in children. However, in contrast to previous reports, our patient was asymptomatic with COVID illness. It could be that SARS-Cov-2 virus could be the trigger for new onset nephrotic syndrome. The steroid responsiveness seen in majority of childhood nephrotic syndrome does not seem to be altered by SARS-Cov-2 infection. Need for anticoagulation should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. More studies are needed to understand the impact and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 on new-onset nephrotic syndrome in children. In absence of clinical trials, therapeutic guidelines become more apparent as more cases are reported.

### The risk of thromboembolic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome and relatively high albumin levels: a study over 10 years [^115NxS5c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In general, our study found that there is still a high risk in patients with NS and relatively high albumin levels to develop thromboembolic events. MN is the most frequent type of NS among patients with relevant thromboembolic events, regardless of their albumin level. During remission of MN, there is still a risk of thromboembolic events. Therefore, adequate screening and prevention may be necessary for these patients.
