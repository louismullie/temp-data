## Question

What are the dd's of tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of tachycardia and how to approach it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stability and the QRS width branch point. Then, I should differentiate narrow complex versus wide complex tachycardias with their key subtypes and bedside clues. Next, I should review validated ECG algorithms for wide complex tachycardia and their limitations. After that, I need to consider special populations and systemic mimics that confound diagnosis. Finally, I should integrate practical decision-making, diagnostics, and when to involve electrophysiology and ablation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: the initial ECG assessment hinges on QRS duration, because narrow QRS usually points to supraventricular mechanisms whereas wide QRS broadens the differential and mandates that we presume ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise; simultaneously, I need to assess hemodynamics because any instability warrants immediate synchronized cardioversion rather than algorithmic parsing, and yes, QRS ≥ 120 ms defines wide complex tachycardia in adults with slight age-related considerations in children, so I should double-check that threshold and proceed accordingly [^114nq5KJ] [^116DgcLa] [^115RWt8e].

> Next, I will examine narrow complex tachycardia, and hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because while most NCTs are supraventricular, I should verify the mechanism by P wave timing, RP interval, and response to vagal maneuvers or adenosine; AVNRT and AVRT dominate regular SVT, atrial tachycardia and sinus node reentrant tachycardia are additional causes, while IST and POTS represent sinus mechanisms with distinct diagnostic criteria and are diagnoses of exclusion, and management acutely can include vagal maneuvers and adenosine for many SVTs while focal atrial tachycardia may respond or be unmasked diagnostically by adenosine, with longer term consideration of catheter ablation especially for AVNRT slow pathway modification [^114PyW29] [^1132e31g] [^113cX54r] [^112459Bv] [^114DheF4] [^114vZw6V].

> Wait, let me verify differentiation within long RP tachycardias because I need to ensure I do not misclassify AVNRT, AVRT, or atrial tachycardia; EP maneuvers and pacing responses such as a V-A-V versus V-A-A-V sequence after ventricular pacing can distinguish reentrant AV node mechanisms from atrial tachycardia, although I should double-check that atypical AVNRT may occasionally mimic these sequences, so pacing criteria must be applied carefully and in context [^114BnaPx] [^117RXNtQ].

> I will now examine wide complex tachycardia, and I should default to VT until proven otherwise because treatment errors can be catastrophic; monomorphic VT is common with structural heart disease, idiopathic VT such as RVOT VT can occur in structurally normal hearts and may mimic SVT by relative narrowness or typical LBBB inferior axis patterns, fascicular VT may even present with QRS near or below 120 ms, and I should also consider SVT with aberrancy, preexcited tachycardias, and toxic-metabolic QRS widening such as hyperkalemia or sodium-channel blockade; pacemaker-mediated tachycardia can simulate VT as well, so device interrogation is key when applicable [^114nq5KJ] [^115zqyc8] [^111xV4JH] [^117AvWcX] [^1139xznD] [^116DgcLa].

> Let me review validated WCT differentiation tools, but hold on, I should verify their limitations; the Brugada algorithm uses RS absence, RS interval, AV dissociation, and morphology criteria and is well established though less reliable with preexisting bundle branch block, the Vereckei aVR algorithm simplifies to lead aVR features, RWPT in lead II ≥ 50 ms strongly favors VT and is simple at the bedside, and augmenting atrial activity with a Lewis lead can help reveal AV dissociation; when noninvasive criteria are inconclusive, an EP study with pacing maneuvers remains the gold standard [^114Lmf7K] [^11475wTk] [^115UcK3v] [^113TwTsj] [^1159NEjp].

> But wait, what if the ECG criteria are equivocal; I should confirm that manual algorithms can fail in real life due to measurement imprecision, overlapping features, or human factors, that AV dissociation may be hard to see and sometimes retrograde VA conduction eliminates dissociation, that some VT variants have relatively short QRS durations, and that point-based or probabilistic approaches may better communicate diagnostic certainty than rigid decision trees; in such cases, treating as VT when in doubt is prudent while gathering more data [^117RvwTu] [^1144YAK8] [^115LHJZb] [^111xV4JH] [^111ipxDz] [^114v2eyr].

> Let me consider special populations because missteps here can be consequential; in pediatrics, SVT predominates and idiopathic RVOT VT should be considered for WCT in structurally normal hearts, in adults with congenital heart disease atrial tachycardias and flutter are frequent with guideline preferences for synchronized cardioversion when unstable and avoidance of flecainide in significant ventricular dysfunction, and in asthma, beta-agonists can precipitate SVT and adenosine may worsen bronchoconstriction, so I need to balance respiratory and arrhythmic management carefully and verify alternatives if bronchospasm is a concern [^116tmmMa] [^113JxRWg] [^112bL4WR] [^114JHdCD] [^1172R6ty].

> I should double-check autonomic sinus tachycardia syndromes because they often masquerade as arrhythmia; IST is a diagnosis of exclusion with multifactorial autonomic pathophysiology requiring careful rule-out of secondary causes, POTS requires orthostatic HR rise without hypotension and mandates exclusion of mimics such as hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, autoimmune disorders, Ehlers-Danlos, mast cell activation, and others, and I need to ensure appropriate autonomic testing and supportive management once secondary causes are excluded [^112459Bv] [^114DheF4] [^114imoTg] [^114KeoD1] [^114vZw6V].

> Next, I should review systemic mimics because failing to treat the driver will perpetuate tachycardia; endocrine emergencies like thyroid storm can present with sinus tachycardia and cardiomyopathy phenotypes, malignant hyperthermia and sepsis can produce profound tachycardia and hemodynamic instability, drug induced cardiotoxicity such as pazopanib-related failure can be implicated, and neurologic causes including spontaneous intracranial hypotension and subarachnoid hemorrhage can result in secondary sinus tachycardia, so targeted labs and imaging should be guided by clinical suspicion rather than indiscriminate testing [^114zWASj] [^115GMSXi] [^113QfVZS].

> I will now integrate decision-making into a concise clinical pathway; obtain a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia and if possible a baseline ECG, measure QRS duration to branch the differential, apply WCT algorithms while acknowledging their caveats and treat uncertain WCT as VT, assess for AV dissociation and use modified lead placement if needed, add targeted labs for mimics including electrolytes, TSH, troponin, BNP, and consider toxicology based on context, and involve electrophysiology when diagnosis remains uncertain, when pre-excitation is present, when recurrent episodes occur, or when catheter ablation is considered as first-line curative therapy in SVT syndromes [^1119ZAAV] [^114nq5KJ] [^116VGhWU] [^113cX54r].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety-critical checks are explicit; unstable patients get immediate synchronized cardioversion, adenosine is first-line for many regular narrow-complex SVTs but I should verify asthma status due to bronchospasm risk, and catheter ablation remains a highly effective strategy to prevent recurrence in AVNRT and AVRT after mechanism confirmation, with individualized considerations in older adults and those with congenital heart disease or ventricular dysfunction guiding selection of pharmacologic and procedural therapy [^115RWt8e] [^114JHdCD] [^116VGhWU] [^113kHibj] [^113JxRWg].

## Junctional tachycardias

Junctional tachycardias arise from the **atrioventricular junction** and include **junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET)**, commonly seen in pediatric patients — especially after cardiac surgery — and **accelerated junctional rhythm**, often associated with digitalis toxicity or myocardial infarction [^116tmmMa].

---

## Non-cardiac causes of tachycardia

Several **non-cardiac conditions** can cause tachycardia, including:

---

## Diagnostic approach

The **diagnostic approach** to tachycardia involves:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history, physical examination, identification of underlying causes [^1119ZAAV].

- **Laboratory tests**: Thyroid function tests, electrolyte levels, cardiac enzymes, toxicology screening.

- **Imaging studies**: Echocardiography, chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI, as indicated [^112AUQWr].

- **Electrophysiological studies**: Useful for complex arrhythmias or when ablation therapy is considered [^114AKNjB].

---

The differential diagnosis of tachycardia spans sinus, supraventricular, ventricular, and junctional tachycardias, as well as non-cardiac causes. Accurate diagnosis and management require a **comprehensive clinical evaluation**, ECG, and targeted diagnostic tests [^1136yHDD].

### New algorithm using only lead aVR for differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^11475wTk]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

We recently reported an ECG algorithm for the differential diagnosis of regular wide QRS complex tachycardias, which was superior to the Brugada algorithm.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to further simplify the algorithm by omitting the complicated morphologic criteria and restricting the analysis to lead aVR.

- **Methods**: In this study, 483 wide QRS complex tachycardias — comprising 351 ventricular tachycardias (VTs), 112 supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs), and 20 preexcited tachycardias — from 313 patients with proven diagnoses were prospectively analyzed by two authors blinded to the diagnosis. Lead aVR was analyzed for: (1) presence of an initial R wave, (2) width of an initial r or q wave > 40 ms, (3) notching on the initial downstroke of a predominantly negative QRS complex, and (4) ventricular activation-velocity ratio (v(i)/v(t)), the vertical excursion (in millivolts) recorded during the initial (v(i)) and terminal (v(t)) 40 ms of the QRS complex. When any of criteria 1 to 3 was present, VT was diagnosed; when absent, the next criterion was analyzed. In step 4, v(i)/v(t) > 1 suggested SVT, and v(i)/v(t) ≤ 1 suggested VT.

- **Results**: The accuracy of the new aVR algorithm and our previous algorithm was superior to that of the Brugada algorithm (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively). The aVR algorithm and our previous algorithm had greater sensitivity (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) and negative predictive value for diagnosing VT, and greater specificity (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) and positive predictive value for diagnosing SVT compared with the Brugada algorithm.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: Etiology, pathophysiology, and management: JACC review topic of the week [^112459Bv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome that generally affects young patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Although the most common symptom is palpitations, it can be accompanied by a myriad of symptoms, including anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST is not well understood and is considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction being the central abnormality. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Management of IST presents a clinical challenge. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. Recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have led to improvements in outcomes. In addition, increased focus has led to the development of multimodality, team-based interventions to improve outcomes in this group of patients.

This review discusses the mechanistic basis of IST, reviews approaches to diagnosis, and outlines contemporary therapeutic approaches.

### Supraventricular tachycardia diagnosis in asthma patients is associated with adverse health outcomes [^114JHdCD]. Pediatric pulmonology (2024). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be a significant public health concern. According to the CDC, over six million (or 8.4%) children in the United States have asthma. It is one of the leading causes of emergency department visits and hospitalizations in children and ranked among the top five medical conditions with the highest healthcare expenditure. Furthermore, in addition to being responsible for a high number of missed school days, asthma is associated with significant physical, social, and professional limitations and can cause early permanent disability and premature death. Although not curable, asthma can be managed and controlled with proper treatment, with inhaled or nebulized SABA being the preferred treatment for intermittent asthma and for acute asthma exacerbations.

SABAs are broadly used and largely well tolerated; however, their side effects can occur more frequently in patients with underlying health conditions. For instance, SABA can adversely affect cardiac function, causing ventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and palpitations, and these effects can occur more frequently in patients with pre-existing heart disease. These effects are dose-dependent and partially mediated by SABA's low β‐1 activity and stimulation of β‐2 adrenoceptors present in the heart. Furthermore, in cases where SABA does trigger SVT in an asthmatic patient, the first-line treatment of SVT with adenosine could worsen asthma symptoms through bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Thus, the clinical management of asthma patients with SVT is complex.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^111ipxDz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Decades of research have produced a rich literature base and an expanding myriad of diagnostic approaches to help clinicians accurately differentiate wide complex tachycardias (WCTs). Traditional manually applied WCT differentiation methods have proven their value in distinguishing the majority of WCTs; however, they uniformly depend on the ECG interpreter for their implementation, rendering them particularly susceptible to improper execution or refrained utilization. Promising automated WCT differentiation methods that make use of computerized ECG interpretation (CEI) software programs are beginning to emerge, signaling the eventual introduction of novel alternative solutions to effectively distinguish ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SWCT).

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^114nq5KJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. Identifying whether WCT has a ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatment for each is different, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences.

In conclusion, although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to the management of WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

- **Autoimmune and immune-related diseases**: coeliac disease, Sjögren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, common variable immunodeficiency

The norepinephrine level was elevated but not to the extent seen in pheochromocytoma.

Differential diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) includes the following:

- **Chronic conditions and syndromes**: chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, IBS, interstitial cystitis
- **Allergic and respiratory conditions**: generalized allergies, asthma, sinusitis
- **Dermatological conditions**: rosacea
- **Psychological conditions**: anxiety
- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma

The duration of the illness and the 5-HIAA measurement excludes carcinoid syndrome.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^117RvwTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Hallmark ECG features of ventricular tachycardia (VT) can be identified in Figure 1 of the study.

AV refers to atrioventricular; LAD stands for left axis deviation; LBBB denotes left bundle branch block; NW indicates northwest; RAD refers to right axis deviation; RBBB denotes right bundle branch block; RWPT signifies R wave peak time; and WCT is wide complex tachycardia.

Historically, identifying atrioventricular dissociation has proven to be quite challenging. Generally, atrioventricular dissociation can be recognized in roughly one-fifth of VTs recorded by 12-lead ECG. In many cases, VT coexists with an atrial arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, which lacks organized atrial depolarization (i.e. P waves). P wave activity may also be obscured due to overlying QRS complexes and T waves, making atrioventricular dissociation difficult to recognize. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that up to approximately half of VTs may exhibit retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction, wherein ventricular impulses conduct retrograde through the His-Purkinje system to depolarize the atria. In such scenarios, VTs will not exhibit atrioventricular dissociation; instead, they will display a regular (e.g. 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction) or erratic (e.g. ventriculoatrial conduction with a variable block) relationship.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^1155zTw9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. The answer to this question drives immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Thus, the importance of arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated and has naturally spurred rigorous research, which has brought forth an ever-expanding abundance of manually applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias.

In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of traditional and more contemporary methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia. We aim to:

- **Review hallmark wide complex tachycardia differentiation criteria**: Understanding the essential criteria is crucial for accurate diagnosis.
- **Examine the conceptual and structural design of standard wide complex tachycardia differentiation methods**: This exploration highlights the strengths and weaknesses of existing methodologies.
- **Discuss practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches**: Identifying and addressing these limitations is vital for improving diagnostic accuracy.
- **Highlight recently formulated methods designed to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia automatically**: These innovative methods promise to enhance clinical diagnostics and patient care.

Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for focal atrial tachycardia, specifically concerning acute management, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV amiodarone in the acute setting. This may be used to either restore sinus rhythm or slow the ventricular rate in hemodynamically stable patients with focal atrial tachycardia.

### A new approach to the differential diagnosis of a regular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex [^114Lmf7K]. Circulation (1991). High credibility.

The Brugada Criteria for Ventricular Tachycardia is a clinical calculator used in cardiology to differentiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients presenting with broad complex tachycardia. It is based on ECG findings, including the presence of an RS complex, the morphology of the QRS complex in precordial leads, and the duration of the RS interval.

The clinical utility of the Brugada Criteria lies in its ability to accurately identify ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. It is particularly useful in emergency settings where rapid diagnosis is critical.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Brugada Criteria. However, it may not be as reliable in patients with pre-existing bundle branch block or other conditions that affect the morphology of the QRS complex.

- **Decision-making process**: The Brugada Criteria help distinguish ventricular tachycardia (VT) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) using observations from a patient's ECG readings. This process evaluates four specific criteria, each reflecting certain ECG characteristics:
	- Absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads.
	- R to S interval greater than 100 milliseconds in any precordial lead.
	- Presence of atrioventricular dissociation.
	- Morphology criteria for VT.

### Recognition and management of a malignant hyperthermia crisis: updated 2024 guideline from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group [^115GMSXi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for malignant hyperthermia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, EMHG 2025 guidelines recommend including the following in the differential diagnosis of suspected MH:

- **Insufficient anesthesia, analgesia, or both**: Conditions where anesthesia is inadequate must be considered.

- **Infection or sepsis**: These conditions can mimic symptoms of malignant hyperthermia.

- **Insufficient ventilation or fresh gas flow**: Proper ventilation should be ensured to rule out adverse effects.

- **Anesthetic machine malfunction**: Equipment issues should be considered in the diagnosis.

- **Anaphylactic reaction**: Allergic reactions can sometimes present similarly.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: This can lead to hypermetabolic states that resemble MH.

- **Thyroid crisis**: Hyperthyroidism should be ruled out.

- **Cerebral ischemia and neuromuscular disorders**: These must be assessed to avoid misdiagnosis.

- **Elevated ETCO2 due to laparoscopic surgery**: Surgical procedures may lead to increased carbon dioxide levels.

- **Ecstasy or other recreational drugs**: Drug use can mimic or trigger hyperthermic symptoms.

- **Malignant neuroleptic syndrome and serotonin syndrome**: Both syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1136yHDD].

Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias can be associated with a decreased QRS duration, chest pain, lightheadedness, fatigue, and a pounding sensation in the chest, neck, or ears. Symptoms may also include dyspnea, syncope, palpitations, diaphoresis, tachycardia, increased QRS duration, PR depression or diffuse ST elevation, and pre-syncope.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: What's new [^115ktvuH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years, leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use.

In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of thyroid storm [^114zWASj]. BMJ Case Reports (2022).

Differential diagnoses for the patient's presentation of chest tightness, associated with shortness of breath, vomiting, and sinus tachycardia, include cardiac, pulmonary, and oesophageal aetiology. Her initial ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with no ischaemic changes. Her hs-cTnT was elevated, and a primary diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was made. Differentials included spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and coronary artery spasm. Coronary angiography demonstrated mild coronary artery disease with no evidence of SCAD or acute plaque rupture. The left ventriculogram was suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

The D-dimer assay performed to investigate dyspnoea and chest tightness was elevated (0.62 mg/L, normal < 0.50 mg/L). A CT pulmonary angiogram (CT-PA) showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Additionally, there was no evidence of tension or spontaneous pneumothorax nor oesophageal perforation on CT-PA.

Echocardiography confirmed the presence of mid-cavity dilatation and anterior wall hypokinesis, consistent with the left ventriculography results, leading to a diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Supraventricular tachycardia: Implications for the intensivist [^115GvdDM]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

The critical care physician must have a keen awareness of supraventricular tachycardia patterns, mechanisms, precipitants, and treatment. Although long-term management of most forms of supraventricular tachycardia lies primarily in the realm of the cardiac electrophysiologist, the intensivist must be proficient at acute arrhythmia therapy. Expertise in electrocardiography, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics is essential. Careful assessment of hemodynamics and prudent bedside clinical acumen help assure optimal patient outcomes.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Evaluation of the current diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis [^112Mimei]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Conditions that can mimic the ARVC phenotype (phenocopies) and enter into the differential diagnosis of ARVC include primary arrhythmia conditions and structural heart muscle diseases affecting the right ventricle (RV), left ventricle (LV), or both.

- **Primary arrhythmia conditions**: Primary arrhythmia conditions which may resemble ARVC include idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (RVOT-VT) and Brugada syndrome.

- **Key points**: Patients with idiopathic RVOT-VT have a normal 12-lead ECG, normal imaging tests, VT induction by isoproterenol test, and VT non-inducible by programmed ventricular stimulation. A septal origin of VT is significantly more often observed in idiopathic RVOT-VT than in ARVC, which usually affects the RV free wall and spares the septum. A single left bundle branch block (LBBB)/inferior axis VT morphology favors the diagnosis of idiopathic RVOT-VT, while multiple VT morphologies, either spontaneous or induced, strongly suggest ARVC. Brugada syndrome demonstrates substantial differences from ARVC with respect to involved genes, absence of overt cardiomyopathic changes, autonomic and antiarrhythmic drug modulation of ECG abnormalities, circumstances and mechanisms of arrhythmias, and outcomes.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115zqyc8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is a general term that broadly denotes the presence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular WCT (SWCT). Clinicians encountering patients with WCT must consider a broad variety of attributable causes, including VT, SWCT with preexisting or functional aberrancy, SWCT developing from impulse propagation using atrioventricular accessory pathways (i.e. preexcitation), rapid ventricular pacing, and tachyarrhythmias coinciding with toxic-metabolic QRS duration widening (e.g. hyperkalemia or antiarrhythmic drug toxicity). The most critical task for clinicians is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin, as accurate discrimination of VT and SWCT is essential. This accuracy impacts immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Therefore, proper patient management heavily relies on clinicians being equipped with and appropriately applying effective and reliable means to distinguish between VT and SWCT.

After decades of rigorous research, the quest for an effective, simplified, and practical means to noninvasively differentiate WCTs has led to an ever-expanding array of manually applied ECG interpretation methods. While manual methods have proven their value in research settings and can be readily adopted by clinicians, arriving at correct and timely VT or SWCT diagnoses remains challenging, even for experienced electrocardiographers.

### A novel approach to differentiating orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia from atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia [^114BnaPx]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Various diagnostic maneuvers have been proposed to help differentiate orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) from atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) prior to ablation. However, not all criteria are applicable in every situation as each has limitations.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the behavior of tachycardia during the onset of right ventricular (RV) pacing would help differentiate ORT from AVNRT.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 72 cases (42 typical AVNRT, 7 atypical AVNRT, 15 left free-wall pathways, 6 septal pathways, 2 right free-wall pathways). We assessed the number of beats required to accelerate the tachycardia cycle length (TCL) to the paced cycle length (PCL) once a fully RV-paced complex was achieved during supraventricular tachycardia.

- **Results**: In the AVNRT group, delta cycle length (DCL = PCL-TCL) was 29 ± 16 ms compared to 29 ± 10 ms in the ORT group (P = NS). In the AVNRT group, the average number of fully RV-paced beats required to reset the tachycardia was 3.7 ± 1.1 compared to 1 ± 0 in the ORT group (P < 0.001). A reset with 1 beat yielded both positive and negative predictive values of 100% for diagnosing AVNRT versus ORT. During entrainment attempts, AVNRT terminated 51% of the time and ORT terminated 65% of the time but still allowed application of the new criterion.

- **Conclusion**: Assessing timing and type of response of supraventricular tachycardia to RV pacing can help differentiate ORT from AVNRT with high certainty and prevent the need for other pacing maneuvers.

### Atypical presentation of right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia [^117AvWcX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the pediatric population is rare, has a wide differential diagnosis, and can present in numerous ways. In the absence of underlying heart disease, VT is considered idiopathic and is associated with an excellent prognosis. Right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (RVOT-VT) represents the most common form of idiopathic VT. The differential diagnosis, mechanism, presentation, management, and prognosis of RVOT-VT in the pediatric population will be discussed.

- **Case report**: We report a case of RVOT-VT that was incidentally discovered in an 11-year-old girl during an emergency department workup for a severe headache.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: It is essential for emergency physicians to have an approach to pediatric VT and appreciate the wide range of potential presentations. Differentiating idiopathic VT, such as RVOT-VT, from more malignant forms of VT can be challenging and requires expert consultation for further diagnostic workup and management.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^115xCNcq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia.

Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy, all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism.

The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115vLTEJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Since their inception, multistep algorithms have served as an excellent means for clinicians to wholly commit to VT or SWCT diagnosis with reasonably good diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, there are notable limitations worth acknowledging. For example, one common problem is that clinicians are ordinarily left unapprised of the likelihood that their VT or SWCT diagnoses are accurate. Unless clinicians (1) are sufficiently informed of the performance metrics (e.g. positive likelihood ratio [LR]) afforded by the algorithm step responsible for the diagnosis, and (2) accurately gauge the patient's pretest probability for VT or SWCT, they will not have a precise determination of whether their diagnosis is, in fact, correct.

Another limitation is that multistep algorithms purposely examine a narrower scope of ECG attributes. Although restricting the number of criteria evaluated by an algorithm helps ensure that it is readily recalled and easily implemented, this strategy ultimately increases the risk for overlooking other relevant diagnostic ECG findings. For instance, clinicians who choose to exclusively use the Vereckei aVR algorithm may paradoxically threaten near-certain VT diagnoses for WCTs demonstrating clear atrioventricular dissociation.

### What an anesthesiologist should know about pediatric arrhythmias [^116tmmMa]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Identifying and treating pediatric arrhythmias is essential for pediatric anesthesiologists. Pediatric patients can present with narrow or wide complex tachycardias, though the former is more common. Patients with inherited channelopathies or cardiomyopathies are at increased risk. Since most pediatric patients present for anesthesia without a baseline electrocardiogram, the first identification of an arrhythmia may occur under general anesthesia.

Supraventricular tachycardia, the most common pediatric tachyarrhythmia, represents a broad category of predominantly narrow complex tachycardias. Stimulating events including intubation, vascular guidewire manipulation, and surgical stimulation can trigger episodes. Valsalva maneuvers are unreliable as treatment, making adenosine or other intravenous antiarrhythmics the preferred acute therapy.

- **Reentrant tachycardias**: These are the most common supraventricular tachycardia in pediatric patients and include atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (due to a distinct accessory pathway) and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (due to an accessory pathway within the atrioventricular node). Patients with ventricular preexcitation, often referred to as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, have a wide QRS with a short PR interval, indicating antegrade conduction through the accessory pathway. These patients are at risk for sudden death if atrial fibrillation degenerates into ventricular fibrillation over a high-risk accessory pathway.

- **Automatic tachycardias**: These include atrial tachycardia and junctional ectopic tachycardia, which are causes of supraventricular arrhythmias in pediatric patients.

### The diagnosis and management of ventricular arrhythmias [^111fUxgs]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The term 'ventricular arrhythmias' incorporates a wide spectrum of abnormal cardiac rhythms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), polymorphic VT, and ventricular fibrillation. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias are the most common cause of sudden cardiac death. These arrhythmias occur predominantly in patients with structural heart disease, but are also seen in patients with no demonstrable cardiac disease.

The diagnosis of VT can be made reliably using electrocardiographic criteria, and a number of algorithms have been proposed. Among patients with VT and a structurally normal heart, the prognosis is usually benign, and treatment is predominantly focused on the elimination of symptoms. Patients who have VT in the presence of structural heart disease are often managed with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. These devices are effective for both primary and secondary prevention of VT and sudden cardiac death. Pharmacological therapy for VT has limited efficacy and is associated with a high incidence of adverse effects.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is useful for controlling episodes of monomorphic VT; however, research is needed to define the role of catheter ablation in the treatment of other ventricular arrhythmias.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^116Rsxx4]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia, without an underlying secondary cause, is often associated with troublesome symptoms. This condition is frequently neglected, leading to multiple consultations and causing frustration for both practitioners and patients. The heterogeneous nature of primary sinus tachycardias is seldom appreciated; therefore, a firm diagnosis is rarely reached, and management is often haphazard. There may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receives adequate and appropriate attention. Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e. secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and sinus node reentry tachycardia constitute this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

### Narrow complex tachycardias [^112AUQWr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Narrow-complex tachycardias are commonly encountered during shifts in the emergency department.

### R-wave peak time at DII: A new criterion for differentiating between wide complex QRS tachycardias [^115UcK3v]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias using the 12-lead ECG may be difficult in many clinical settings.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to determine the value of ECG lead II, specifically, the duration at its beginning, defined as R-wave peak time (RWPT), in differentiating ventricular tachycardia (VT) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients with broad QRS complex tachycardia.

- **Methods**: Two hundred eighteen ECGs showing wide QRS complex tachycardias were evaluated. Two cardiologists blinded to the diagnosis measured RWPT duration at lead II (from the isoelectric line to the point of first change in polarity), and results between VT and SVT were compared, with the findings of electrophysiologic study used as the gold standard.

- **Results**: One hundred sixty-three VTs had a significantly longer RWPT at DII (76.7 ± 21.7 ms vs. 26.8 ± 9.5 ms in 55 SVT, P = 0.00001). Receiver operating characteristic curve identified RWPT ≥ 50 ms at lead II as having greater specificity and sensitivity in discriminating VT from SVT. The area under the curve was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.95–0.99), positive likelihood ratio was 34.8, and kappa coefficient (kappa) was 0.86. Bivariate analysis identified higher age in VT patients (60.7 vs. 50.1 years, P < .0001). In conclusion, an RWPT ≥ 50 ms at DII is a simple and highly sensitive criterion that discriminates VT from SVT in patients with broad QRS complex tachycardia.

### Rapid and life-threatening heart failure induced by pazopanib [^113QfVZS]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of his acutely worsened cardiomyopathy includes new ischemia, tachycardia-induced, or pazopanib-induced cardiomyopathy. The mild elevation of the patient's troponin, in the context of negative ECG changes, was thought to be most likely secondary to Type 2 myocardial ischemia. His transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) findings showed global hypokinesis compared with prior echocardiograms, instead of new focal dysfunction, which again supports non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. His tachycardia began after the worsening of his ejection fraction (EF). Given the rapid onset of his symptoms shortly after starting pazopanib, and in the absence of other obvious causes, pazopanib-induced cardiomyopathy remained the most likely diagnosis.

### Lewis lead enhances atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia [^113TwTsj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of wide QRS tachycardia is a challenge for the emergency physician. The major tool is the electrocardiogram (ECG), even though the sensitivity and specificity may be variable, depending on presentation. Additional leads could be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG.

- **Objective**: To document the use of the Lewis lead in improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG in wide QRS tachycardia.

- **Case report**: A 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, undergoing treatment with methotrexate, was admitted with progressive dyspnea that evolved to acute respiratory distress and shock upon arrival. Pneumonia was diagnosed as the infection, and she received antibiotics, as well as respiratory and inotropic support. She had also been using amiodarone for more than 10 years, but she couldn't state the reason. On cardiac monitoring, wide QRS tachycardia was detected, and ventricular tachycardia was considered in the differential diagnosis. The standard 12-lead ECG was complemented with the Lewis lead, obtained with higher speed and amplitude, demonstrating atrioventricular concordance and excluding ventricular tachycardia. The patient was treated for septic shock, and she died 2 days later.

- **Conclusion**: The Lewis lead is a simple and easy strategy to enhance atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia.

### Initial evaluation and management of wide-complex tachycardia: A simplified and practical approach [^114EjykT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The evaluation and treatment of wide QRS-complex tachycardia remain challenging, and mismanagement is quite common. Diagnostic aids such as wide-complex tachycardia algorithms perform poorly in real-life settings.

### Differential diagnosis of regular, narrow-QRS tachycardias [^113uT3ka]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

We present an update on clinical and electrophysiological criteria used for the differential diagnosis of regular supraventricular tachycardias. Although several electrocardiographic clues may assist in the differential diagnosis, this is usually accomplished at electrophysiology study, and most often, the differential diagnosis is between atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia due to a concealed accessory pathway, and atrial tachycardia. Atrial and ventricular pacing maneuvers during sinus rhythm or tachycardia have been used with various success rates. In clinical practice, these techniques cannot be applied to all cases, and multiple criteria must be used for the differential diagnosis of narrow-complex tachycardias with atypical characteristics.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^114v2eyr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. This decision drives immediate patient care actions, subsequent clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. The importance of arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated, prompting rigorous research. This research has yielded a growing array of manually applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias.

In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of both traditional and contemporary methods to distinguish between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia. We aim to:

- **Review hallmark wide complex tachycardia differentiation criteria**: Analyze the established criteria used for differentiation.
- **Examine the conceptual and structural design of standard differentiation methods**: Evaluate the foundational design of existing strategies.
- **Discuss practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches**: Address the challenges and limitations inherent in manual interpretation.
- **Highlight recently formulated methods for automatic differentiation**: Present new automated methods designed to accurately differentiate between ventricular and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia.

### Encephalopathy and sinustachycardia in childhood — a possible differential diagnosis [^114yUDBs]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

We report on a 7-year-old girl with generalized seizures, somnolence, fever, and respiratory distress. The increase of sinus tachycardia with good hydration, sufficient analgesia, and hyperthermia in our patient led to the determination of thyroid hormones, and therefore finally to the diagnosis of a thyrotoxic crisis in Graves' disease. Thyrotoxic crisis is a very rare but severe disease with an incidence of 0.1/100,000–3/100,000 among children.

Important differential diagnoses of hyperthyroidism are Hashimoto thyroiditis, paraneoplastic thyroid-stimulating hormone production, thyroid autonomy, as well as central hyperthyroidism. Although symptoms disappear by thyrostatic therapy (thiamazole, carbimazole, dexamethasone), a euthyroid status could only be achieved by thyroidectomy. Thyrotoxic crisis should be considered a differential diagnosis in case of resistant unexplained sinus tachycardia, seizures, and encephalopathy. Immediate and adequate therapy contributes significantly to a reduction in the high morbidity and mortality rates. A combination of several treatment approaches for hyperthyroidism can lead to a successful outcome.

Regarding specific circumstances for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly in patients with congenital heart disease, ongoing management necessitates careful consideration.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^116VGhWU]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), defined as tachyarrhythmias that originate from or conduct through the atria or atrioventricular node with abrupt onset, affects 168 to 332 per 100,000 individuals. Untreated PSVT is associated with adverse outcomes, including high symptom burden and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

- **Observations**: Approximately 50% of patients with PSVT are aged 45 to 64 years, and 67.5% are female. The most common symptoms include palpitations (86%), chest discomfort (47%), and dyspnea (38%). Patients may rarely develop tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (1%) due to PSVT. Diagnosis is made on electrocardiogram during an arrhythmic event or using ambulatory monitoring. First-line acute therapy for hemodynamically stable patients includes vagal maneuvers such as the modified Valsalva maneuver (43% effective) and intravenous adenosine (91% effective). Emergent cardioversion is recommended for patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Catheter ablation is safe, highly effective, and recommended as first-line therapy to prevent recurrence of PSVT. A meta-analysis of observational studies shows single catheter ablation procedure success rates of 94.3% to 98.5%. Evidence is limited for the effectiveness of long-term pharmacotherapy to prevent PSVT; nonetheless, guidelines recommend therapies including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, and antiarrhythmic agents as management options.

- **Conclusion and relevance**: Paroxysmal SVT affects both adult and pediatric populations and is generally a benign condition. Catheter ablation is the most effective treatment for preventing recurrence.

### Nonutility of diagnostic testing in ambulatory patients with supraventricular tachycardia [^115Mtz27]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common arrhythmia in the pediatric population. Patients often present to the emergency department and undergo extensive diagnostic assessment. The objective of this study is to determine the frequency of diagnostic studies obtained in such patients and to assess the clinical significance of these results.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed from 2011 to 2018 in a single-center ED, including patients 21 years of age or younger presenting with SVT without shock.

- **Results**: A total of 40 patients with 92 encounters were included for analysis. The mean age was 8.58 (± 5.51) years; 55% female. A total of 67.4% underwent serologic laboratory evaluation, of which 8 (12.9%) had any abnormality. Only one was deemed clinically significant to warrant intervention. Nearly 30% of patients underwent chest radiography, with no clinically significant findings.

- **Conclusions**: Patients undergoing ED management of uncomplicated SVT are likely to undergo laboratory investigation and unlikely to have abnormal studies impacting their care. Given the associated risk of false-positive studies, the discomfort to the patient and parent, and the cost of these studies, routine laboratory or radiographic investigation in this population may be unwarranted.

### V-a-a-v activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: What is the mechanism [^117RXNtQ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of a long RP tachycardia, with the site of earliest atrial activation at the CS ostium (Fig. 1), includes: (a) a fast-slow type AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), (b) AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using a slowly conducting posteroseptal accessory pathway as the retrograde limb, and (c) a septal atrial tachycardia (AT). The absence of atrial resetting by premature ventricular stimuli delivered during His-bundle refractoriness is consistent with the absence of retrograde atrial activation over an AP, though it does not rule out its concealed presence.

This case illustrates an important observation in the differential diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with an initial "V-A-A-V" sequence upon cessation of ventricular pacing. The atrial response (V-A-A-V or V-A-V) following cessation of entrainment or induction of the tachycardia by ventricular pacing provides useful diagnostic information to distinguish AT from AVNRT. A "V-A-A-V" sequence is typically diagnostic of AT, whereas a "V-A-V" response excludes this diagnosis. However, the study population upon which this criterion was defined may have been biased by not including atypical AVNRT, which cannot be excluded based on the "V-A-A-V" sequence. Typical AV nodal reentry, included in that study, is unlikely to explain the second "A" of the "V-A-A-V" sequence, which occurs immediately after the first "A" and is caused by retrograde conduction through the AV node. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the origin of both "A" components of an initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence.

### The sinus tachycardias [^117FrYK9]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia — whether physiologic, pathologic, or iatrogenic — is predominantly catecholamine driven, virtually asymptomatic, and managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause.

- **Primary sinus tachycardias**: These include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and sinus node re-entry tachycardia. They have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms, and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management.

Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevent multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

### One tachycardia with two entrainment responses: What is the mechanism [^111rSu4G]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

The patient presented for electrophysiology study and ablation due to a history of narrow complex tachycardia. Both typical and atypical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) were induced. For the atypical AVNRT, two different entrainment responses were recorded owing to different timing in delivering the ventricular pacing train.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115c11zh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Decades of clinical research have brought forth a wide variety of thoughtfully designed methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SWCT). Separate from choosing the ideal electrophysiological determinants to secure accurate wide complex tachycardia (WCT) differentiation, algorithm creators were accountable for devising the organizational structure and operative mechanics that will enable their algorithm's generalized use.

- **Strategic blueprints for traditional methods**: We review the most common algorithm designs, discuss the overarching rationale behind their formulation, and examine the unique advantages and limitations of each diagnostic approach.

- **Multistep algorithms**: Without question, the most commonly utilized approaches to differentiate WCTs are the multistep decision-tree algorithms, including the Brugada, Vereckei aVR, and limb lead algorithms. In general, multistep algorithms prompt users to address a series of sequentially applied inquiries, with each step requesting the ECG interpreter to determine whether a highly specific attribute of VT is present or absent. If an affirmative response is rendered at any particular algorithm step, the algorithm's application is complete, and a VT diagnosis is secured. On the other hand, before SWCT is diagnosed, the ECG interpreter must navigate through the entire algorithm and confirm that each step warrants a negative response. In other words, SWCT diagnoses may only be reached once all highly specific attributes for VT, examined by the particular multistep algorithm, are absent.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^115LHJZb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In many cases, VT and SWCT cannot be confidently distinguished using 12‐lead ECG interpretation alone. Occasionally, standard criteria to establish VT diagnoses may not be unequivocally present or absent (e.g. "Are those small deflections dissociated P waves or ECG artifact?"), and manual measurements essential for establishing the correct diagnosis may be at the margin of predefined thresholds (e.g. "Is the RS interval convincingly < 100 ms or ≥ 100 ms?"). Additionally, there are occasions where criteria tend to be quite vulnerable to human error and imprecision (e.g. measurement of Vᵢ/Vₜ for minuscule QRS complexes in lead aVR). Furthermore, it is not rare for WCT to simultaneously possess ECG characteristics consistent with both VT and SWCT. Finally, we must also not overlook that many diagnostically challenging VT subtypes (e.g. fascicular VT or bundle branch reentry) routinely escape ECG criteria emphasized by standard WCT differentiation methods.

As a result of the aforementioned diagnostic challenges, it is easy to see why subscribing to one or more WCT methods that wholly commit to an absolute VT or SWCT diagnosis is problematic. Consequently, several authors have chosen to devise an alternative approach to differentiating WCTs, such as point‐based algorithms. Rather than absolutely committing to a definite SWCT or VT diagnosis for every WCT, point‐based scoring methods purposely aim to identify WCTs with near‐certain VT or SWCT diagnoses. For example, the point‐based algorithm put forth by Jastrzebski et al, the VT score, has shown potential in this regard.

**QRS duration**: Ordinarily, VT primarily relies on an inefficient means to depolarize the ventricular myocardium (i.e. cardiomyocyte-to-cardiomyocyte conduction). As a result, VT commonly expresses longer QRS durations than SWCT. This distinction was initially verified by Wellens and colleagues and later spurred interest in proposed WCT QRS duration cutoffs to define VT diagnoses: QRS > 140 ms for WCTs with right bundle branch block pattern and QRS > 160 ms for WCTs with left bundle branch block pattern. However, since VT and SWCT occupy broad and overlapping QRS duration ranges, the sole use of WCT QRS duration cutoffs to differentiate WCTs is unsatisfactory. A substantial proportion of SWCTs will display QRS durations > 160 ms, especially among patients with ongoing antiarrhythmic drug use, electrolyte disturbances, dramatic conduction delays, or severe underlying structural heart disease or cardiomyopathies. On the contrary, many patients demonstrating idiopathic VT variants or VTs that arise from within or rapidly engage the His-Purkinje system demonstrate QRS durations < 140 ms. In rarer cases, VTs may demonstrate substantial impulse propagation within the conduction system and express QRS durations < 120 ms (e.g. fascicular VT), thereby not fulfilling the technical definition of WCT (i.e. heart rate ≥ 100 beats per minute and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms).

The value of any diagnostic tool is dependent on the context in which it is used. Although individual WCT differentiation methods demonstrate their own unique shortcomings, the most emblematic weakness is that they wholly rely upon the ECG interpreter for their proper execution.

- **Practical limitations of traditional methods**: In general, traditional ECG interpretation methods require clinicians to thoroughly examine patients' 12‐lead ECG and carefully apply specific ECG criteria to establish a correct VT or SWCT diagnosis. Thus, manually applied interpretation approaches are entirely dependent on the competency of the ECG interpreter, making them vulnerable to improper application or abstained use. Consequently, the generalized usage of manual ECG interpretation methods is unsurprisingly problematic, particularly for clinicians who must promptly diagnose and manage high‐acuity patients.

Another relevant but often overlooked limitation stems from the fact that WCT differentiation methods were uniformly derived and independently validated using select investigational groups (e.g. only patients who undergo an electrophysiology procedure) and controlled experimental conditions (e.g. ECG interpretation performed by heart rhythm experts separated from the actual clinical settings in which the WCT presented). At the time of writing, only one validation study has assessed diagnostic performance using a broader collection of WCTs expected to be encountered in real‐life clinical practice.

- **Clinical evaluation**:

	- **Clinical presentation**: The clinical presentations of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) storm or sudden cardiac death.

- **Recommendation for clinical evaluation of patients with VAs**:
	1. History should identify the onset, duration, frequency, and trigger of any symptoms and should include medication use as well as comorbidities and family history. Available cardiac rhythm data include interrogation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to assess arrhythmia burden, morphologies, and duration as well as treatment. Electrogram storage may be programmed to include far- and near-field electrograms to allow superior assessment of VA morphologies. The laboratory workup should be individualized to the patient's presentation and may include electrolytes, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, genetic testing, or drug screening as appropriate.

- **Synopsis**: Presenting symptoms can be classified into five groups: due to the VA itself (e.g. premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, or VF); due to a secondary disease caused by the VAs (e.g. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy); due to an underlying pathology associated with the VAs (e.g. ischemia); due to ICD therapy; and a combination of these causes.

Idiopathic VA is frequently asymptomatic, especially when presenting as PVCs or nonsustained VT. In those cases, VAs are commonly detected coincidentally during routine exams. If symptomatic, symptoms can often be secondary to post-PVC augmentation of contractility or a post-PVC compensatory pause.

### Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: An ED-oriented algorithmic approach [^116iPp5U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist clinicians in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of narrow complex tachycardia, we propose three separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information.

- **Static algorithm**: This algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions.

- **Comparative algorithm**: It requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared.

- **Dynamic algorithm**: This encourages clinicians to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism.

Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either "yes" or "no" for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.

### The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^116DgcLa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia is defined as a cardiac rhythm with a rate greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) and a QRS complex duration greater than 0.10 to 0.12 seconds in adult patients; in children, WCT is defined according to age-related metrics. The differential diagnosis of WCT includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction, which can range from relatively benign to life-threatening dysrhythmias. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis of WCT, discussing strategies useful in making the appropriate diagnosis when possible.

### Sinus tachycardia: a multidisciplinary expert focused review [^114KeoD1]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals is a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may indicate serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms.

- **Classification**: ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (e.g. pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (e.g. inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome).

While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding. This article is unique in that it was composed by international experts in neurology, psychology, autonomic medicine, allergy and immunology, exercise physiology, pulmonology, and critical care medicine.

### Wide-complex tachycardia: Beyond the traditional differential diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia vs supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction [^114PL6en]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is defined as a rhythm disturbance with a rate greater than 100 beats per minute and a QRS complex duration of 0.12 seconds or more in the adult patient. In pediatric patients, both the rate and QRS complex width are age-related. In evaluating this type of tachycardia, two broad categories are usually discussed in the medical literature: ventricular and supraventricular with aberrant intraventricular conduction.

There are several other important causes of WCT encountered in clinical practice, which are less often discussed. These tachycardias often require specific therapies differing from the standard approach to WCT. These tachycardias are diverse; as such, the pathophysiology behind each form of WCT includes toxic, metabolic, and conduction system dysfunction mechanisms.

### What is this? VT versus SVT [^112QMSyV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We present a patient who had a wide QRS tachycardia; it was initially difficult to determine whether it was supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT). By some criteria — such as sinus capture beats, pseudo-δ waves, and wide QRS — the patient's ECG was suggestive of VT of epicardial origin. On the coronary angiogram, it was found that this patient had significant coronary artery disease. He was stented with three stents and later underwent a full electrophysiological study. We present here the ECGs, the differential diagnosis, and a brief review of the diagnostic features of epicardial VT.
