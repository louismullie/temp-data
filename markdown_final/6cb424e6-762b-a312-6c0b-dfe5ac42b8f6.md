## Question

Does treatment of hypertension in diabetes prevent retinopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether treating hypertension in people with diabetes prevents diabetic retinopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between preventing incident retinopathy versus slowing progression of existing retinopathy. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by study design and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine key trials like UKPDS, ACCORD-Eye, and DIRECT, and reconcile any apparent contradictions. After that, I should consider dose-response and blood pressure targets, including the role of renin–angiotensin system blockade. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and translate this into practical clinical advice with appropriate caveats about baseline risk and adverse effects.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: prevention of new retinopathy is a different question than slowing progression once retinopathy is established, and the evidence base differs for these outcomes, so I need to keep them separate as I appraise the data [^7eef94c8] [^b884ef54].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2023 Cochrane review of 29 randomized trials including 27,185 participants found that more intensive blood pressure control reduced the five-year incidence of diabetic retinopathy by about 18% (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–0.92; moderate certainty), with the clearest signal in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas there was no significant reduction in progression of existing retinopathy over five years (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.12; moderate certainty) [^7eef94c8].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across syntheses. Multiple meta-analyses converge on a roughly 15–20% relative risk reduction in incident retinopathy with intensive blood pressure lowering, including a 17% reduction in type 2 diabetes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95) and a 13% reduction per 10 mmHg lower systolic BP in broader diabetes cohorts, reinforcing a modest but real preventive effect on new disease [^adc50123] [^884864b6].

> I will now examine pivotal trials. In UKPDS, tight blood pressure control to less than 150/85 mmHg reduced progression of retinopathy by 34% and deterioration in visual acuity by 47% over about 7–9 years, and importantly, the effect appeared independent of glycemic control, which supports a causal benefit of BP lowering on retinopathy outcomes in hypertensive type 2 diabetes [^a1b479ec] [^5ddc7f6d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single study. ACCORD-Eye, which targeted systolic BP less than 120 mmHg versus less than 140 mmHg, did not show a significant reduction in retinopathy progression, and this null result has been cited as conflicting evidence; however, I should double-check the context because ACCORD enrolled patients with established retinopathy and focused on progression rather than incidence, and its follow-up was shorter, which aligns with the Cochrane finding that progression is harder to modify than incidence [^7abd5645] [^7eef94c8].

> Let me consider the DIRECT program, because it tested renin–angiotensin blockade in normotensive or well-controlled hypertensive patients. In type 1 diabetes, candesartan reduced incident retinopathy by about 18% (HR 0.82, P = 0.0508) and showed a larger effect in a post hoc three-step progression analysis, but did not slow progression of existing retinopathy; in type 2 diabetes, there was no significant reduction in progression, though regression was more likely, suggesting class effects may be modest and context-dependent [^e91b4d4e] [^05d9d3e0].

> I need to check dose-response and targets. Observational and trial data suggest a linear relationship between lower systolic BP and lower retinopathy risk, with about a 10–15% risk reduction per 10 mmHg fall in systolic BP, but benefits appear to plateau at very low BP, and intensive targets may increase hypotension risk without added retinal benefit; thus, a pragmatic target around 130/80 mmHg balances benefit and safety in most adults with diabetes, with individualization for stroke risk and frailty [^b4a647d5] [^5cc72c94] [^5830a65e].

> But wait, what if drug class matters beyond BP lowering itself. Meta-analyses of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors suggest additional benefits on progression and regression, particularly ACE inhibitors, though effects are modest and not universally consistent across populations; this supports choosing ACE inhibitors or ARBs when indicated, while acknowledging that much of the retinopathy benefit is likely mediated by BP reduction rather than purely pleiotropic effects [^93ea8f96] [^f8fe5d83].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary ADA Standards advise implementing strategies to reach BP and lipid goals to reduce risk or slow progression of diabetic retinopathy, and the AAO Preferred Practice Pattern notes that BP lowering has a modest benefit in preventing retinopathy, especially in type 2 diabetes with hypertension, while effects on progression are less clear; this matches the Cochrane conclusions and supports routine BP control as part of retinopathy prevention [^9baef26f] [^0bd3a7c6].

> I should confirm practical implications and safety. More intensive BP control reduces incident retinopathy but increases hypotension risk, so I need to individualize targets, avoid excessive lowering in older or frail patients, and prioritize BP control in those with higher baseline BP where absolute benefits are greater; shared decision-making is essential to weigh stroke prevention and retinopathy prevention against hypotension and falls risk [^5830a65e] [^5ca4a0ba].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that yes, treating hypertension in people with diabetes prevents incident diabetic retinopathy, with a modest but clinically meaningful relative risk reduction of about 15–20% over roughly 4–5 years, particularly in those with hypertension and type 2 diabetes; however, evidence is weaker for slowing progression once retinopathy is established, so BP control should be initiated early and sustained as part of comprehensive risk reduction, alongside glycemic and lipid management and regular retinal screening [^7eef94c8] [^adc50123] [^0bd3a7c6].

Treating hypertension in diabetes **reduces the incidence of diabetic retinopathy** [^7eef94c8] by about 18% over 5 years, especially in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes [^0bd3a7c6]. However, it **does not significantly slow progression** of existing retinopathy or prevent vision-threatening outcomes like proliferative retinopathy or macular edema [^7eef94c8] [^b884ef54]. The benefit is modest and most pronounced when blood pressure is lowered toward< 130/80 mmHg, but intensive targets (< 120 mmHg) do not add further retinal benefit and may increase adverse events [^5ca4a0ba] [^5830a65e]. Therefore, blood pressure control is a key part of primary prevention, but not a substitute for glycemic control or ophthalmic surveillance once retinopathy is present [^9baef26f] [^552ddb42].

## Evidence from major clinical trials

Several large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Intervention** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| UKPDS 38 | Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes | Tight BP control (< 150/85 mmHg) vs less tight control (< 180/105 mmHg) | - 34% reduction in retinopathy progression<br/> - 47% reduction in visual acuity deterioration [^a1b479ec] [^5ddc7f6d] |
| ACCORD Eye | Type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk | Intensive BP control (SBP< 120 mmHg) vs standard (< 140 mmHg) | No significant reduction in retinopathy progression [^7abd5645] [^d95f77e6] |
| DIRECT program | Normotensive or treated hypertensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes | Candesartan (ARB) vs placebo | - 18% reduction in incidence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes<br/> - No significant effect on progression in type 2 diabetes [^e91b4d4e] [^05d9d3e0] |
| Cochrane review 2023 | Mixed population with type 1 and type 2 diabetes | Intensive vs less intensive BP control | - 18% reduction in incidence of retinopathy over 5 years<br/> - No significant effect on progression or vision-threatening outcomes [^7eef94c8] [^b884ef54] |

## Mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of blood pressure control

Blood pressure control likely reduces retinopathy risk through several mechanisms:

- **Reduced microvascular damage**: Lower BP decreases mechanical stress on retinal capillaries, reducing leakage, ischemia, and neovascularization [^b1935918].
- **Improved endothelial function**: BP lowering improves endothelial function and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, which are implicated in retinopathy pathogenesis [^83475c55].
- **Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulation**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs may have additional protective effects via RAS blockade, though evidence is mixed and not fully independent of BP lowering [^93ea8f96] [^f8fe5d83].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite the evidence, several limitations and controversies persist:

- **Modest effect size**: The reduction in incidence is modest (~18%), and effects on progression are inconsistent or null [^7eef94c8] [^b884ef54].
- **Intensive targets**: Intensive BP targets (< 120 mmHg) do not confer additional retinal benefit and may increase adverse events such as hypotension and renal dysfunction [^5ca4a0ba] [^5830a65e].
- **Population differences**: Benefits appear stronger in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas effects in normotensive or type 1 diabetes are less consistent [^7eef94c8] [^b884ef54].
- **Confounding by glycemic control**: Many studies did not isolate BP effects from glycemic control, complicating interpretation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized BP targets** and risk stratification:

- **General target**: Most patients with diabetes should aim for< 140/90 mmHg [^bc4464e0] [^15712b59].
- **Intensive target**: < 130/80 mmHg may be considered for high-risk patients, such as those with cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, balancing benefits and risks [^5cc72c94] [^5830a65e].
- **Avoidance of overly aggressive targets**: SBP< 120 mmHg is not routinely recommended due to lack of added benefit and increased risk of adverse events [^5830a65e] [^bab7aee4].

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

- **Primary prevention**: BP control is most beneficial in preventing new retinopathy, particularly in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes [^7eef94c8] [^0bd3a7c6].
- **Secondary prevention**: Once retinopathy is established, BP control alone is insufficient; glycemic control, regular ophthalmic surveillance, and appropriate ocular therapies (e.g. laser, anti-VEGF) remain essential [^552ddb42] [^f3e02ae1].
- **Individualized approach**: Clinicians should tailor BP targets based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and tolerance to therapy [^5830a65e].

---

Treating hypertension in diabetes **reduces the incidence of diabetic retinopathy**, especially in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, but has limited impact on progression or vision-threatening outcomes. BP control should be integrated with glycemic management and regular eye care to optimize retinal outcomes [^9baef26f] [^552ddb42].

Background

Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. Research has established the importance of blood glucose control to prevent development and progression of the ocular complications of diabetes. Concurrent blood pressure control has been advocated for this purpose, but individual studies have reported varying conclusions regarding the effects of this intervention.

Objectives

To summarize the existing evidence regarding the effect of interventions to control blood pressure levels among diabetics on incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, preservation of visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched several electronic databases, including CENTRAL, and trial registries. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 September 2021. We also reviewed the reference lists of review articles and trial reports selected for inclusion.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which either type 1 or type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, were assigned randomly to more intense versus less intense blood pressure control; to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure (placebo); or to one class of antihypertensive medication versus another or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of records identified by the electronic and manual searches and the full-text reports of any records identified as potentially relevant. The included trials were independently assessed for risk of bias with respect to outcomes reported in this review.

Main Results

We included 29 RCTs conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East that had enrolled a total of 4620 type 1 and 22,565 type 2 diabetic participants (sample sizes from 16 to 4477 participants). In all 7 RCTs for normotensive type 1 diabetic participants, 8 of 12 RCTs with normotensive type 2 diabetic participants, and 5 of 10 RCTs with hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants, one group was assigned to one or more antihypertensive agents and the control group to placebo. In the remaining 4 RCTs for normotensive participants with type 2 diabetes and 5 RCTs for hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants, methods of intense blood pressure control were compared to usual care. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies; nine studies received support from other sources; and two studies did not report funding source. Study designs, populations, interventions, lengths of follow-up (range less than one year to nine years), and blood pressure targets varied among the included trials. For primary review outcomes after five years of treatment and follow-up, one of the seven trials for type 1 diabetics reported incidence of retinopathy and one trial reported progression of retinopathy; one trial reported a combined outcome of incidence and progression (as defined by study authors). Among normotensive type 2 diabetics, four of 12 trials reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy and two trials reported progression of retinopathy; two trials reported combined incidence and progression. Among hypertensive type 2 diabetics, six of the 10 trials reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy and two trials reported progression of retinopathy; five of the 10 trials reported combined incidence and progression. The evidence supports an overall benefit of more intensive blood pressure intervention for five-year incidence of diabetic retinopathy (11 studies; 4940 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.92; I 2 = 15%; moderate certainty evidence) and the combined outcome of incidence and progression (8 studies; 6212 participants; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; I 2 = 42%; low certainty evidence). The available evidence did not support a benefit regarding five-year progression of diabetic retinopathy (5 studies; 5144 participants; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; I 2 = 57%; moderate certainty evidence), incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, clinically significant macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage (9 studies; 8237 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.04; I 2 = 31%; low certainty evidence), or loss of 3 or more lines on a visual acuity chart with a logMAR scale (2 studies; 2326 participants; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.08; I 2 = 90%; very low certainty evidence). Hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants realized more benefit from intense blood pressure control for three of the four outcomes concerning incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. The adverse event reported most often (13 of 29 trials) was death, yielding an estimated RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.00; 13 studies; 13,979 participants; I 2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). Hypotension was reported in two trials, with an RR of 2.04 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.55; 2 studies; 3323 participants; I 2 = 37%; low certainty evidence), indicating an excess of hypotensive events among participants assigned to more intervention on blood pressure.

Authors' Conclusions

Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for several chronic conditions for which lowering blood pressure has proven to be beneficial. The available evidence supports a modest beneficial effect of intervention to reduce blood pressure with respect to preventing diabetic retinopathy for up to five years, particularly for hypertensive type 2 diabetics. However, there was a paucity of evidence to support such intervention to slow progression of diabetic retinopathy or to affect other outcomes considered in this review among normotensive diabetics. This weakens any conclusion regarding an overall benefit of intervening on blood pressure in diabetic patients without hypertension for the sole purpose of preventing diabetic retinopathy or avoiding the need for treatment for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.

### Should we change the target blood pressure in diabetic patients? [^0c6e3fc4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure (BP) to less than 130/80mmHg in diabetic patients. These recommendations are based on several studies in diabetic patients that showed the benefit of intensive BP control. However in all the studies the achieved BP was higher than 130/80mmHg. Re-evaluation of earlier studies, as well as more recently accumulated data suggest that intensive BP control is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and stroke rate, but with no benefit for other microvascular or macrovascular (cardiac, renal and retinal) outcomes. Intensive BP control is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, particularly for systolic BPs levels lower than 130mmHg. When determining the target BP in diabetic patients one should balance the potential cerebrovascular protection against the increased risk of serious side effects, and the absence of benefit for other circulatory system. It seems therefore, that lowering BP to levels close to 130/80mmHg should be the main goal of treatment in diabetic patients.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^e4453e5b]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings show the beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure targets on the incidence of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes patients, which was confirmed by our TSA. These findings are important to healthcare practitioners, as accumulated evidence recommends that the strict blood pressure targets should be specifically tailored to these diabetic individuals with non-diabetic retinopathy. However, available evidence suggests no effect of intensive blood pressure targets on the progression of retinopathy and incidence of PDR and macular edema. Before these findings are converted into clinical practice, additional work needs to be done.

### Preventing blindness in diabetic hypertensive patients (...) [^04a5bff3]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Does tight blood pressure control improve visual outcomes in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. The degree of retinopathy was evaluated at enrollment and every three years thereafter. Allocation to groups was concealed, outcome assessment was blinded, and analysis was by intention to treat. Patients were followed for a median of 9. 3 years. The average blood pressure in the tight control group was 144/82 mm Hg, and in the loose control group, it was 154/87 mm Hg. The mean glycohemoglobins were similar in these groups:

7. 2 percent during the first four years of the study, and
8. 2 to 8. 3 percent for the final four years. The tight control group had fewer micro-aneurysms after 4. 5 years of follow-up, fewer hard exudates, fewer cotton wool spots, less progression of retinopathy, and less need for photocoagulation. These are all disease-oriented end points and do not necessarily result in significant worsening of vision or visual loss. The primary patient-oriented outcomes were blindness and reduction in visual acuity. Visual loss in one eye was less likely in the tight control group, occurring in 2. 4 percent of patients compared with
3. 1 percent in the loose control group. This corresponds to an absolute increase in risk with loose control of approximately one per 1, 000 patient-years of treatment. After nine years, a lower likelihood of deterioration in either eye was noted in the tight control group. However, there was no significant difference in the reduction of vision as assessed by the better eye.

Bottom Line: Tight blood pressure control results in a small benefit in the prevention of blindness, with an NNT of 1, 000 patients for one year. Tight control also is associated with a reduction in loss of visual acuity after nine years and an apparent increase in the likelihood of cataract extraction. .

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^5803ebce]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy—evidence supporting education on blood pressure control includes randomized and observational data: in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, tight blood pressure control (<150/85 mm/Hg) had a 34 percent reduction in risk in the proportion of patients with deterioration of retinopathy by two steps and a 47 percent reduced risk of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart (Evidence Grade: A). Additional evidence shows elevated blood pressure is directly related to progression of diabetic retinopathy and to the development of diabetic macular edema in persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus (Evidence Grade: B), and among persons with type 2 diabetes, blood pressure lowering is associated with improved mortality and a reduced risk of retinopathy (Evidence Grade: B). A systematic review of 15 clinical trials supports lowering blood pressure to prevent diabetic retinopathy for up to four or five years in persons with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, but not to slow its progression (Evidence Grade: B).

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^9baef26f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diabetic retinopathy, more specifically with respect to primary prevention (BP and lipid control), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to implement strategies to help reach BP and lipid goals to reduce the risk or slow the progression of DR in patients with diabetes.

---

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^2d6f5eb1]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy—patient education on blood pressure control is advised as an evidence-based action: persons with diabetes should be educated about the potential benefits of blood pressure control in reducing the risk for development or progression of diabetic retinopathy, with Evidence Quality: Grade B, Level of Confidence: Medium, and Clinical Recommendation Strength: Strong Recommendation. This recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Potential benefits include reduced risk for development or progression of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema (DME), potential risks/harms are hypotension, benefits significantly outweigh harms, potential costs are time for counseling, the role of patient preferences is large, and gaps in evidence are none identified.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

Tight control of blood glucose levels and hypertension remains the key element for preventing or arresting diabetic retinopathy. However, two drugs (fenofibrate and candesartan), originally not designed for treatment of diabetic retinopathy, have become new adjuncts in its management. The information drawn from clinical trials indicates that in normotensive diabetic patients, candesartan reduces the incidence of diabetic retinopathy in those with type 1 diabetes and favors diabetic retinopathy regression only in type 2 diabetic patients with mild retinopathy. By contrast, fenofibrate, which has only been tested in type 2 diabetes, has no effect on the incidence of diabetic retinopathy. However, it reduces the progression of existing diabetic retinopathy, thus lessening the need for laser treatment in both DME and PDR, and this beneficial effect is unrelated to changes in serum lipids. Therefore, it would be reasonable to recommend candesartan for type 1 diabetic patients (with or without hypertension) at high risk to develop diabetic retinopathy and for type 2 diabetic patients with mild retinopathy, whereas fenofibrate seems to be a good option for type 2 diabetic patients (with or without dyslipemia) with a wide range of diabetic retinopathy stages (from mild to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy). In addition, the benefit on diabetic retinopathy shown by fenofibrate and candesartan should be considered an extra value when treating dyslipemia and hypertension in diabetic patients. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which candesartan and, in particular, fenofibrate exert their reported benefits need to be elucidated before these drugs can be launched (alone or in combination) as new tools in the management of diabetic retinopathy. Another question needing specific research is whether such treatments could be administered topically and directly into the eye in order to increase the benefits in diabetic retinopathy.

### Pharmacologic management of hypertension in patients with diabetes (...) [^cb89b0a9]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

In addition, hypertension markedly increases the risk of microvascular complications, such as nephropathy and retinopathy. 2, 3 The U. K. Prospective Diabetes Study 38 showed that tight control of blood pressure is associated with significant reductions in the risk of stroke, macrovascular complications, and diabetes-related mortality. 5 In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial, patients with diabetes whose diastolic blood pressure was less than 80 mm Hg had a 50 percent reduction in major cardiovascular events compared with those whose DBP was less than 90 mm Hg. 6 Controlling hypertension is key to reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. It is an integral component of a comprehensive care plan that should include optimal management of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, aspirin therapy, and lifestyle modifications.

Pharmacologic Therapy ACE INHIBITORS Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent or delay microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes and are recommended as first-line antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes. A systematic review of the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetic kidney disease showed that treatment at maximum tolerable dosages was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality. 13 Treatment with dosages of up to one half the maximum did not reduce all-cause mortality rates. 13 Because ACE inhibitors reduce complications of diabetes, patients with hypertension and diabetes should be treated with a regimen that includes an ACE inhibitor.
8. ARBs are effective in delaying the onset of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and macroalbuminuria.

7 In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, chlorthalidone reduced cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. 20 The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial showed no significant difference in rates of fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, or total mortality in patients with diabetes who were treated with a chlorthalidone-based regimen compared with those treated with lisinopril or amlodipine. BETA BLOCKERS Beta blockers are a useful adjunct when combination therapy is needed to achieve target blood pressure in patients with diabetes.

### How do we define cure of diabetes? [^f8eb0872]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In addition to hyperglycemia, diabetes is characterized by specific (microvascular) or nonspecific (cardiovascular) complications. Diabetes management includes treating cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, often to more stringent goals than those for patients who do not have diabetes. People with diabetes also need regular screenings for the microvascular complications of the disease, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. If a patient is in remission from diabetes, do they still require diabetes-specific treatment goals and screening protocols, and if so, for how long? The consensus group considered both issues to be a function of risk over time. For cardiovascular disease, the very high risk that diabetes imparts is unlikely to be modified quickly, if ever, by amelioration of hyperglycemia, particularly if the usual coexisting risk factors are still present. For diabetes-specific complications such as retinopathy, risk for incident complications is likely to decline significantly with prolonged normoglycemia, while established complications would likely need ongoing monitoring indefinitely.

In a partial or complete remission of less than 5 years' duration, the goals for treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia) should remain the same as for those with diabetes (e.g. blood pressure goal <130/80 mmHg). When complete remission exceeds 5 years, goals appropriate for a patient without diabetes could be considered, as long as the patient remained without recurrence of diabetes and without cardiovascular events.

In a partial or complete remission of less than 5 years' duration, the patient should receive screening for the complications of diabetes at the same frequency as when diabetes was present. Once a complete remission exceeds 5 years, complication screening might occur at a reduced frequency (depending on the status of each complication). Completely stopping screening for a particular complication should be considered only if there is no history of that complication.

These definitions and consensus recommendations, summarized in Table 1, are based on what the consensus group felt to be reasonable given the therapies of today. The authors hope that this article will engender active discussion in the field. As new therapies of curative intent emerge for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and actuarial and scientific evidence regarding prognosis builds, these issues will surely require further deliberation.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^5ddc7f6d]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure control and diabetic retinopathy—long-term outcomes: in the UKPDS, tight blood pressure control (<150/85 mmHg) in hypertension and type 2 diabetes reduced diabetes-related complications including progression of diabetic retinopathy and deterioration in visual acuity; after nine years of follow up, the tight-control group had a 34 percent reduction in risk of deterioration of retinopathy by two steps and a 47 percent reduced risk of deterioration in visual acuity by three lines of the ETDRS chart, and it appears that good blood pressure control must be continued if the benefits are to be maintained. Elevated blood pressure is directly related to progression of diabetic retinopathy and to development of diabetic macular edema in persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and a systematic review of 15 clinical trials supports lowering blood pressure to prevent diabetic retinopathy for up to four or five years in type 1 or type 2 diabetes but not to slow its progression; however, the ACCORD Study did not find a significant difference in progression between standard versus intensive antihypertensive therapy.

The goals of blood pressure in the patient with diabetes and hypertension

Hypertension is present in 20% to 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes, depending on age, ethnicity, obesity, and the presence of micro or macro albuminuria. High BP substantially increases the risk of both macro and micro vascular complications, doubling the risk of all-cause mortality and stroke, tripling the risk of coronary heart disease and significantly hastening the progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy [-]. In these patients, a difference of 5 mmHg in either systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases the risk of cardiovascular events or death by 20% to 30%. In observational studies, people with both diabetes and hypertension have approximately twice the risk of cardiovascular disease as no diabetic people with hypertension, and are also at increased risk for diabetes specific complications, including retinopathy and nephropathy. In the UKPDS epidemiologic analysis, for each 10 mmHg decrease in mean SBP the estimated risk of any complication related to diabetes, deaths related to diabetes, MI, and micro vascular complications was reduced by 12%, 15%, 11%, and 13%, respectively. These results are in keeping with the 15% risk reduction for cardiovascular death reported in the Seven Countries Study and to the estimates of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) for diabetic patients. Thus, BP lowering is a major priority in preventing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with DM2 and hypertension.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^a10047a9]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the primary cause of visual impairment and blindness for diabetic individuals from 30 to 70 years. The current standard care for preventing or delaying DR consists of strict glycemic control, while vision loss may still appear even up to the glucose control standard. The increased incidence of retinopathy suggests that more precautionary measures are imperative to prevent the development of the condition and subsequent blindness.

Intensive blood pressure control prevents cardiovascular events. Blood vessels are directly visible in the retina. Hypertension may lead to retinal macroaneurysm, retinal vascular occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy, which further cause visual loss. Hypertension may also exacerbate the vision-threatening effects of DR.

Given the effect of blood pressure on the pathologic changes of diabetic retinopathy, tight blood pressure control may be another method to prevent or delay the risk of DR. Findings of previous studies indicate that intensive blood pressure targets in diabetic individuals could decrease the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy, but results of some studies did not support the beneficial effect of intensive blood pressure targets. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye Study Group has shown that intensive blood pressure control had no beneficial effect on reducing the rate of DR in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Tight blood glucose targets in the UKPDS decreased still did not eliminate the risk of DR.

Given this knowledge gap, we did a meta-analysis to assess the possible effect of lowering blood pressure on diabetic retinopathy, a trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the changes over time and whether more studies need to be performed, by adjusting the significance levels for sparse data and multiple testing on accumulating trials. The primary aim of our study was to explore the effect of interventions to control or reduce blood pressure on the incidence and progression of DR and the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or macular edema (ME).

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^bc4464e0]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure control—Hypertension is a common co-morbidity of diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and microvascular complications. There is substantial evidence that antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in individuals with and without diabetes mellitus, and among persons with type 2 diabetes, blood pressure lowering is associated with improved mortality and other clinical outcomes, including a lower risk of retinopathy; blood pressure <140/90 mmHg is a recommended goal by the ADA for most patients with diabetes.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^6359886a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

The recent Latin American and European guidelines published this year has proposed as a goal for blood pressure control in patients with diabetes type 2 a value similar or inferior to 140/90 mmHg. High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases and deaths globally. Although once hypertension is detected, 80% of individuals are on a pharmacologic therapy only a minority is controlled. Diabetes also is a risk factor for other serious chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Whether specifically targeting lower fasting glucose levels can reduce cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. Hypertension is present in 20% to 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes, depending on age, ethnicity, obesity, and the presence of micro or macro albuminuria. High blood pressure substantially increases the risk of both macro and micro vascular complications, doubling the risk of all-cause mortality and stroke, tripling the risk of coronary heart disease and significantly hastening the progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Thus, blood pressure lowering is a major priority in preventing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with diabetes and hypertension. During many years the BP goals recommended in patients with diabetes were more aggressive than in patients without diabetes. As reviewed in this article many clinical trials have demonstrated not only the lack of benefits of lowering the BP below 130/80 mmHg, but also the J-shaped relationship in DM patients. Overall we discuss the importance of define the group of patients in whom significant BP reduction could be particularly dangerous and, on the other hand, those with a high risk of stroke who could benefit most from an intensive hypotensive therapy. In any case, the big challenge now is avoid the therapeutic inertia (leaving diabetic patients with BP values of 140/90 mmHg or higher) at all costs, as this would lead to an unacceptable toll in terms of human lives, suffering, and socioeconomic costs.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^167ac97c]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Our study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. Therefore, ethical approval was not necessary.

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for articles from inception to April. 2018 using a search strategy as follows: [diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), macular edema, diabetic maculopathy, retinal disorders, retinal disease, diabetic eye disease, or vision loss], (randomized, random, placebo-controlled, double-blind), (hypertension or blood pressure) and (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, adrenergic alpha antagonist, adrenergic beta antagonists, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antihypertensive agents). Reference lists of identified trials and relevant reviews were also searched. To avoid missing any relevant studies in the search, reference lists of key articles were also searched for relevant articles that could have been missed. There were no publication form restrictions. Only articles in the English language were searched.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of strict blood pressure targeting on the incidence, progression of DR, or incidence of PDR and ME were included for analysis. Two authors independently reviewed all identified abstracts and excluded clearly irrelevant hits. Characteristics of trials for analyses were extracted by two authors independently from the included reports. Although intensive versus conventional blood pressure targets were not defined uniformly in the relevant studies, the definition according to the criteria used in the original trials was taken into consideration in this meta-analysis. A summary of the included individuals’ data is presented in Table 1 [,–]. The included trials were divided into those with a low risk of bias and those with a high risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook risk of bias tool on the basis of assessment of sequence generation, blinding and concealment of allocation. When all three domains were judged to have a low risk of bias, the trial was classified as having a low risk of bias. Eight trials had a low risk of bias. Articles were excluded if they were non-randomized trials, were crossover trials, or used dual therapies or quasi-experiments.

### Blood pressure control in type II diabetics with diabetic retinopathy [^65008e89]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Large clinical trials have emphasized that blood pressure control provides a major clinical benefit in reducing the risk of blindness in patients with diabetic retinopathy.

Methods

This audit was carried out to assess the quality of care for hypertension in 100 consecutive type II diabetics with diabetic retinopathy.

Results

The target blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg was achieved only in 38% of the patients. We also observed that 65% of the patients requiring diabetic macular laser treatment in this cohort had suboptimal control. The factors associated with suboptimal blood pressure control are identified and discussed.

Conclusion

Despite the unequivocal fact that lowering BP significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in diabetics, the majority of patients are not treated to a goal BP.

### The role of antihypertensive therapy in reducing vascular complications of type 2 diabetes. findings from the DIabetic REtinopathy candesartan trials-protect 2 study [^1757daff]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent trials question previously accepted low blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetes to reduce complication risk. We explored this question in the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials-Protect 2 clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 1905 normoalbuminuric participants with type 2 diabetes and mild-moderate retinopathy were randomized to candesartan or placebo. Participants were normotensive [untreated, blood pressure (BP) < 130/85 mmHg] or treated hypertensive [(62%), BP < 160/90 mmHg]. The effects of candesartan on microvascular and macrovascular endpoints alone and in combination were analysed, including subgroup analyses by baseline hypertension status.

Results

Mean age was 57 ± 8 years, 50% were men, mean diabetes duration was 9 ± 5 years and baseline HbA1c was 8.2 ± 1.6%. Mean randomization BP was 123/75 mmHg in the normotensive, and 139/79 mmHg in the treated hypertensive subgroups. During the median 4.7-year follow-up, achieved systolic pressure on candesartan was 128 mmHg in baseline normotensive individuals, and 136 mmHg in treated hypertensive patients. Candesartan reduced combined macrovascular and microvascular complication risk; the age and baseline SBP overall adjusted hazard ratio for candesartan vs. placebo was 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.99], P = 0.040, reflecting hazard ratios of 0.86 (0.66-1.13) for baseline normotensive individuals and 0.83 (0.68-1.02) for hypertensive patients. Hazard ratios were 0.87 (0.74-1.04) for microvascular and 0.84 (0.57-1.25) for macrovascular complications, when analysed separately. However, an interaction (P = 0.06) between hypertensive [hazard ratio 0.67 (0.42-1.07)] and normotensive (1.45, 0.71-2.94) subgroups was observed for macrovascular events.

Conclusion

Candesartan modestly reduces vascular complication risk in treated hypertensive diabetic individuals at low risk of cardiovascular disease. Separate analyses of microvascular and macrovascular events suggest that candesartan may not reduce macrovascular events in normotensive persons with type 2 diabetes.

Blood pressure management in diabetes—Hypertension is identified as an important comorbidity, and nonpregnant patients are recommended to maintain blood pressures of less than 140/90 mm Hg to minimize cardiovascular events and microvascular complications. Trials have found that blood pressure control decreases the risk of developing new retinopathy in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with a meta-analysis calculating a 20% reduction in the incidence of retinopathy with blood pressure intervention; however, the data are mixed regarding the association between blood pressure control and progression once retinopathy is established.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^e5f37886]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is one of the most important comorbidities of diabetes, contributing significantly to death and disability. It is responsible for macrovascular (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke) and microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy) complications. Although we have an array of antihypertensive drugs, recently newer blood pressure-lowering drugs and antidiabetic drugs with antihypertensive properties have become available. Several trials have shown the significance of managing hypertension in diabetes; thus, treating hypertension is an important part of cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction. This article aims to present a practical approach to hypertension in diabetes. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by the author.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^16b30200]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Evidence base—hypertension burden and outcomes in diabetes: The majority of individuals with DM either have elevated BP or are receiving treatment for hypertension, and once diagnosed with hypertension, an individual is 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with T2D within the next 5 years. The U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that hypertension treatment decreased both micro- and macrovascular complications of T2D, and each 10 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP was associated with a 15% reduction in DM-related mortality, an 11% reduction in myocardial infarction (MI), and a 13% reduction in the microvascular complication of retinopathy or DKD. Professional organizations have recommended that BP in persons with T2D be controlled to <130/80 mm Hg, although the preferred goal for BP lowering remains controversial as clinical trial data to support the level of <130/80 mm Hg are limited; epidemiologic data suggest no evidence of a threshold for adverse outcomes with a BP level <115/75 mm Hg, and some guidelines include an option to individualize to the lower target of <120/70 mm Hg.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^0bd3a7c6]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR)—modifiable risk factors and glycemic/blood pressure targets include HbA1c and systolic blood pressure, where elevated HbA1c and longer diabetes duration predicted progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.42; P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (HR = 1.24 per 10 mmHg; P = 0.009). It is recommended that a HbA1c of 7% or lower is the target for glycemic control in most patients, with possible benefit to a lower target of 6.5%; in type 1 diabetes, an HbA1c 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) or lower was reported as ideal to avoid PDR and macroalbuminuria. A meta-analysis showed that reduction of blood pressure had a modest beneficial effect in preventing DR for up to 5 years, particularly in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Young-onset type 2 diabetes carried higher risk, with an adjusted OR of 2.8 for DR compared with those diagnosed at 60 to under 70 years of age.

### Effect of systemic medications on onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy [^f8fe5d83]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of visual loss worldwide. Patients with diabetes mellitus commonly have multiple comorbidities treated with a wide variety of medications. Systemic medications that target glycemic control and coexisting conditions may have beneficial or deleterious effects on the onset or progression of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, data is accumulating to suggest that the use of systemic therapy primarily to address ocular complications of diabetic retinopathy may be a promising therapeutic approach. This article reviews our current understanding of the ocular-specific effects of systemic medications commonly used by patients with diabetes mellitus, including those directed at control of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiac disease, anemia, inflammation and cancer. Current clinical evidence is strongest for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers in preventing the onset or slowing the progression of early diabetic retinopathy. To a more limited extent, evidence of a benefit of fibrates for diabetic macular edema exists. Numerous other agents hold considerable promise or potential risk. Thus, these compounds must undergo further rigorous study to determine the actual clinical efficacy and adverse effects before definitive therapeutic care recommendations can be offered.

### Review of therapeutic advances in diabetic retinopathy [^6e8ce7e2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication of prolonged diabetes. It is one of the leading causes of vision loss in working age adults and a significant source of morbidity. To reduce the incidence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, it is important to identify patients at risk and promptly implement intensive glycemic and hypertensive control. To date, there are many interventions that can limit moderate and severe vision loss in people with diabetes, including laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy surgery, and intravitreal pharmacological injections. This review aims to define the different stages of diabetic retinopathy and the important therapeutic advances developed to address the major causes of vision loss in each stage.

### How does hypertension affect your eyes? [^51d0582b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has profound effects on various parts of the eye. Classically, elevated blood pressure results in a series of retinal microvascular changes called hypertensive retinopathy, comprising of generalized and focal retinal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, retinal hemorrhages, microaneurysms and, in severe cases, optic disc and macular edema. Studies have shown that mild hypertensive retinopathy signs are common and seen in nearly 10% of the general adult non-diabetic population. Hypertensive retinopathy signs are associated with other indicators of end-organ damage (for example, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal impairment) and may be a risk marker of future clinical events, such as stroke, congestive heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, hypertension is one of the major risk factors for development and progression of diabetic retinopathy, and control of blood pressure has been shown in large clinical trials to prevent visual loss from diabetic retinopathy. In addition, several retinal diseases such as retinal vascular occlusion (artery and vein occlusion), retinal arteriolar emboli, macroaneurysm, ischemic optic neuropathy and age-related macular degeneration may also be related to hypertension; however, there is as yet no evidence that treatment of hypertension prevents vision loss from these conditions. In management of patients with hypertension, physicians should be aware of the full spectrum of the relationship of blood pressure and the eye.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular and renal outcomes: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ca4a0ba]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent hypertension guidelines have reversed previous recommendations for lower blood pressure targets in high-risk patients, such as those with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. This change represents uncertainty about whether more intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies are associated with greater reductions in risk of major cardiovascular and renal events. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies.

Methods

For this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for trials published between Jan 1, 1950, and Nov 3, 2015. We included randomised controlled trials with at least 6 months' follow-up that randomly assigned participants to more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment, with different blood pressure targets or different blood pressure changes from baseline. We did not use any age or language restrictions. We did a meta-analysis of blood pressure reductions on relative risk (RR) of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death, separately and combined), and non-vascular and all-cause mortality, end-stage kidney disease, and adverse events, as well as albuminuria and progression of retinopathy in trials done in patients with diabetes.

Findings

We identified 19 trials including 44,989 participants, in whom 2496 major cardiovascular events were recorded during a mean 3·8 years of follow-up (range 1·0-8·4 years). Our meta-analysis showed that after randomisation, patients in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment group had mean blood pressure levels of 133/76 mm Hg, compared with 140/81 mm Hg in the less intensive treatment group. Intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment achieved RR reductions for major cardiovascular events (14% [95% CI 4-22]), myocardial infarction (13% [0-24]), stroke (22% [10-32]), albuminuria (10% [3-16]), and retinopathy progression (19% [0-34]). However, more intensive treatment had no clear effects on heart failure (15% [95% CI -11 to 34]), cardiovascular death (9% [-11 to 26]), total mortality (9% [-3 to 19]), or end-stage kidney disease (10% [-6 to 23]). The reduction in major cardiovascular events was consistent across patient groups, and additional blood pressure lowering had a clear benefit even in patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mm Hg. The absolute benefits were greatest in trials in which all enrolled patients had vascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. Serious adverse events associated with blood pressure lowering were only reported by six trials and had an event rate of 1·2% per year in intensive blood pressure-lowering group participants, compared with 0·9% in the less intensive treatment group (RR 1·35 [95% CI 0·93-1·97]). Severe hypotension was more frequent in the more intensive treatment regimen (RR 2·68 [1·21-5·89], p=0·015), but the absolute excess was small (0·3% vs 0·1% per person-year for the duration of follow-up).

Interpretation

Intensive blood pressure lowering provided greater vascular protection than standard regimens. In high-risk patients, there are additional benefits from more intensive blood pressure lowering, including for those with systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. The net absolute benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering in high-risk individuals are large.

### Blood pressure lowering in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^884864b6]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lowering blood pressure (BP) is widely used to reduce vascular risk in individuals with diabetes.

Objective

To determine the associations between BP-lowering treatment and vascular disease in type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE for large-scale randomized controlled trials of BP-lowering treatment including patients with diabetes, published between January 1966 and October 2014.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics and vascular outcome data. Estimates were stratified by baseline BP and achieved BP, and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease events, stroke, heart failure, retinopathy, new or worsening albuminuria, and renal failure.

Results

Forty trials judged to be of low risk of bias (100,354 participants) were included. Each 10-mm Hg lower systolic BP was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.96); absolute risk reduction (ARR) in events per 1000 patient-years (3.16; 95% CI, 0.90-5.22), cardiovascular events (RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.95]; ARR, 3.90 [95% CI, 1.57-6.06]), coronary heart disease (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80-0.98]; ARR, 1.81 [95% CI, 0.35-3.11]), stroke (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64-0.83]; ARR, 4.06 [95% CI, 2.53-5.40]), albuminuria (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.79-0.87]; ARR, 9.33 [95% CI, 7.13-11.37]), and retinopathy (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.99]; ARR, 2.23 [95% CI, 0.15-4.04]). When trials were stratified by mean baseline systolic BP at greater than or less than 140 mm Hg, RRs for outcomes other than stroke, retinopathy, and renal failure were lower in studies with greater baseline systolic BP (P interaction <0.1). The associations between BP-lowering treatments and outcomes were not significantly different, irrespective of drug class, except for stroke and heart failure. Estimates were similar when all trials, regardless of risk of bias, were included.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, BP lowering was associated with improved mortality and other clinical outcomes with lower RRs observed among those with baseline BP of 140 mm Hg and greater. These findings support the use of medications for BP lowering in these patients.

### Are individuals with diabetes seeing better?: a long-term epidemiological perspective [^83475c55]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence of a relationship of hypertension to DR.

Randomized clinical trial data have shown the efficacy of the tight control of blood pressure in reducing the progression of DR in subjects with type 2 diabetes. In the UKPDS, tight blood pressure control (defined as achieving blood pressure values <150/<85 mmHg) in subjects with type 2 diabetes resulted in a 34% reduction in the progression of DR and a 47% reduction in the decrease in visual acuity of three lines or more over 7½ years of follow-up compared with conventional control (defined as blood pressure values <180/<105 mmHg). The reduction in the loss of vision was due mainly to a 42% reduction in the incidence of macular edema. In the UKPDS, the effects of blood pressure control were independent of those attributable to glycemic control. In the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT), candesartan was associated with a statistically insignificant reduction in the progression of DR over a 4½ year period in subjects with type 2 diabetes who were normotensive or had controlled hypertension, as compared with those randomized to a placebo.

Three randomized controlled clinical trials, the EURODIAB (Epidemiology and Prevention of Diabetes project) Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes (EUCLID), the Renin-Angiotensin System Study (RASS), and the DIRECT Prevent-1, have shown that either ACE inhibition (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reduction was associated with the reduction in the progression of DR in normotensive type 1 diabetic subjects with no or very mild DR (–). In each of these trials, the effect was independent of blood pressure level. It remains uncertain and speculative whether there are pleiotropic drug effects of renin-angiotensin blockade such that improvement in endothelial function and reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, rather than a lowering of blood pressure, account for the efficacy of these drugs in type 1 diabetic subjects. The data, when taken together for both types of diabetes, suggest that the greatest efficacy of ARBs and ACE-Is in decreasing DR is in reducing blood pressure in subjects in whom it is poorly controlled and in normotensive subjects in whom DR is absent or minimally present. These findings have led to the current American Heart Association guidelines of a target goal for blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg or below the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height, whichever is lower, for individuals with diabetes.

### Microvascular disease: what does the UKPDS tell us about diabetic retinopathy? [^b4a647d5]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a randomised controlled clinical study which looked at the effect of improved blood glucose and blood pressure control on macro- and microvascular complications in Type 2 diabetes. Retinopathy was the commonest microvascular outcome and this paper looks at this complication. Methods Newly diagnosed diabetic patients were randomised to intensive or conventional glycaemic control and a subset of hypertensive patients to tight or less tight blood pressure control. Patients were seen every 3 months in study clinics and retinopathy was assessed by adjudicated grading of triennial colour retinal photographs. Photocoagulation treatment, vitreous haemorrhage and cataract extraction were predefined UKPDS endpoints. Observational analyses of the data were used to examine the relationship of updated mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and mean blood pressure levels to retinopathy outcomes. Results The UKPDS showed that both improved glucose control and improved blood pressure control reduced the risk of retinopathy, with a linear relationship between the log hazard ratio for retinopathy and both updated mean HbA(1c) and updated mean blood pressure. A 1% decrement in HbA(1c) equated to a 31% reduction in retinopathy and a 10 mmHg decrement in systolic blood pressure equated to an 11% reduction in photocoagulation or vitreous haemorrhage. Evidence of retinopathy at diagnosis, including the presence of microaneurysms only, increased significantly the risk of progression to photocoagulation. Conclusions The UKPDS stands out as a landmark study in Type 2 diabetes, emphasising the crucial importance of controlling both blood glucose and blood pressure in order to minimise the risk of developing sight-threatening retinopathy.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^adc50123]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To explore the accumulated evidence concerning the effect of intensive blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and macular edema (ME).

Methods

A number of electronic databases were searched including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, conferences and proceedings. Randomized controlled trials comparing intensive blood pressure targets with conventional blood pressure targets in patients with type 2 diabetes were included. The definition of intensive versus conventional blood pressure targets was from the pertinent original studies. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomized trials were analyzed in STATA.

Results

Eight trials randomizing 6989 patients were assessed and reviewed in full text; 3749 vs. 3240 were in each arm (intensive vs. conventional). All trials had a low risk of bias. Intensive blood pressure control supported a 17% reduction in the incidence of DR (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.72–0.95). Trial sequential analyses confirmed that sufficient evidence indicated a relative risk reduction above 17% for the incidence of DR when intensive blood pressure control was targeted. Heterogeneity was absent (I 2 = 0%; P = 0.56). No statistically significant effect was found for intensive blood pressure targeting on the progress of DR (relative risk 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.81–1.08). TSA showed that insufficient evidence had been found, although the Z value line appeared to have a tendency of approaching the futility boundaries. There were also no statistically significant effects on the incidence of PDR and ME (TSA-adjusted CI 0.84–1.12).

Conclusion

Intensive blood pressure control reduced the relative risk of incidence of DR by 17%. The available data were insufficient to prove or refute a relative risk reduction for the progression of DR or incidence of PDR and ME at a magnitude of 15%.

### Combined intensive blood pressure and glycemic control does not produce an additive benefit on microvascular outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients [^c0ec9c67]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

A reduction of either blood pressure or glycemia decreases some microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, and we studied here their combined effects. In total, 4733 older adults with established type 2 diabetes and hypertension were randomly assigned to intensive (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg) or standard (systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg) blood pressure control, and separately to intensive (HbA1c less than 0.060) or standard (HbA1c 0.070-0.079) glycemic control. Prespecified microvascular outcomes were a composite of renal failure and retinopathy and nine single outcomes. Proportional hazard regression models were used without correction for type I error due to multiple tests. During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, the primary outcome occurred in 11.4% of intensive and 10.9% of standard blood pressure patients (hazard ratio 1.08), and in 11.1% of intensive and 11.2% of standard glycemia control patients. Intensive blood pressure control only reduced the incidence of microalbuminuria (hazard ratio 0.84), and intensive glycemic control reduced the incidence of macroalbuminuria and a few other microvascular outcomes. There was no interaction between blood pressure and glycemic control, and neither treatment prevented renal failure. Thus, in older patients with established type 2 diabetes and hypertension, intensive blood pressure control improved only 1 of 10 prespecified microvascular outcomes. None of the outcomes were significantly reduced by simultaneous intensive treatment of glycemia and blood pressure, signifying the lack of an additional beneficial effect from combined treatment.

There is an increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes, which is attributable to a growing population, an increase in life expectancy, increased diagnostic efforts, and a reduced diabetes attributable risk due to recent advances in diabetes treatment. Hypertension is the most frequent (90%) among the co-morbid disease conditions and further increases the risk for disease and treatment related complications. The combination of both hypertension and diabetes accelerates the progression of diabetes related complications such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic heart failure and doubles the risk of stroke, CV and all-cause mortality as compared to non-diabetic patients with hypertension. Risk prediction in this population is however not easy making the adaption of available risk prediction tools necessary, partly because risks have gone down in recent years.

United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)—blood pressure control in hypertensive type 2 diabetes randomized a total of 1,148 hypertensive patients (mean blood pressure at entry 160/94 mmHg) to tight control of blood pressure (<150/85 mmHg) or less tight control (<180/105 mmHg), with 758 and 390 patients respectively, and tight blood pressure control achieves a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths and complications related to diabetes, progression of diabetic retinopathy, and deterioration in visual acuity.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^b628378b]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition and diabetic retinopathy: overactivity of the RAS is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular events, and chronic kidney disease, and in adults with type 1 diabetes a renin-angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients. In patients with diabetes, RAS inhibitors reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy and increase the possibility of diabetic retinopathy regression; however, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might be better than angiotensin-receptor blockers for treating diabetic retinopathy, and might exert the most beneficial effect on diabetic retinopathy of all widely used antihypertensive drug classes.

### Role of systemic factors in improving the prognosis of diabetic retinal disease and predicting response to diabetic retinopathy treatment [^7abd5645]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

The UKPDS was the first RCT that showed the importance of tight BP control in reducing DR.A total of 1048 hypertensive people with T2D were randomized into intensive BP control (target SBP/DBP: < 150/85 mmHg) versus the conventional control group (target SBP/DBP: < 180/< 105 mmHg). After 9 years of follow-up, patients with tight BP control had a reduction in risk of DR progression by 34% (99% CI, 11–50) and VA deterioration by 47% (99% CI, 7–70). However, a more recent study performed in a type 2 diabetic population (the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD-EYE] study) did not reveal any significant effect of intensive BP versus standard treatment in retinopathy progression of ≥3 steps on the ETDRS scale. However, in this study the intensive treatment arm targeted SBP < 120 mmHg, and the standard treatment arm SBP < 140 mmHg. A Cochrane systematic review conducted in 2015 found 15 trials, including the ACCORD-EYE study, that examined the effect of antihypertensive treatment on retinopathy (5 in T1D and 10 in T2D). It concluded that BP control reduced the incidence of DR (estimated RR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.92) although effects on progression were only significant for T2D.

Another systematic review from 2015 that captured mostly the same trials of BP lowering, but restricted to people with T2D, reported a relative risk of 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76–0.99] for 3 or more step progression of retinopathy per 10 mmHg-lower SBP.

Metrics

It has been shown that every 10 mmHg increase in SBP was associated with 10% increased risk of early DR and 15% risk of PDR or DME. In the UKDPS study, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic was associated with approximately 40% to 50% reduction in DRD progression, need for laser treatment, and vision loss. The systematic review above reported a relative risk of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76–0.99) for ≥3 step progression of retinopathy per 10 mmHg-lower SBP in T2D.

Time Relationship

The deleterious effect can be seen after several years of hypertension, but there are no studies that specifically address this question. A “legacy” effect that occurs with glycemic control has not been reported with hypertension.

### Advances in the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^a053345d]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) program was therefore designed to answer the question of whether the blockade of RAS with AT1-R blocker candesartan could prevent the incidence and progression of retinopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes independent of lowering blood pressure. This program consisted of three randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group studies: 1) a primary prevention study involving 1,241 type 1 diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy (DIRECT-Prevent 1), 2) a secondary prevention study involving 1,905 type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy (DIRECT-Protect 1), and 3) a secondary prevention study involving 1,905 type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy (DIRECT-Protect 2). In each trial, patients were randomized to receive candesartan (16–32 mg/day) or placebo and the median follow-up was 4.7 years. Patients with type 1 diabetes were eligible for inclusion if they were normoalbuminuric and normotensive (blood pressure ≤130/85 mmHg). For patients with type 2 diabetes, the inclusion criteria were normoalbuminuria and either normal blood pressure without antihypertensive therapy or blood pressure ≤160/90 mmHg during treatment. The primary end point was the incidence of diabetic retinopathy in the primary prevention study and progression of diabetic retinopathy in the secondary prevention studies. In the DIRECT-Prevent 1 study, a nonsignificant reduction (18% relative risk reduction; P = 0.051) in the risk of incidence of diabetic retinopathy was observed. However, in a post hoc analysis in which the primary end point was changed from a two-step increase to at least a three-step increase in the ETDRS scale, a significant difference was detected (35% relative risk reduction; P = 0.003). This beneficial effect was attenuated but still significant after the data were adjusted for duration of diabetes, A1C, and systolic blood pressure (26% relative risk reduction; P = 0.046). In DIRECT-Protect 1, an identical progression of diabetic retinopathy was found in the placebo and in the candesartan groups, thus suggesting that candesartan is not effective in preventing diabetic retinopathy progression. DIRECT-Protect 2 showed a nonsignificant reduction in the progression of diabetic retinopathy (13% relative risk; P = 0.20). However, a significant increase in diabetic retinopathy regression was observed (34%, P = 0.009), this effect being more evident in patients with mild retinopathy. Thus, although the prespecified primary end point was not reached in the DIRECT program, data analysis suggests an overall beneficial effect of candesartan in diabetic retinopathy.

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^d95f77e6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A Cochrane Review assessed the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic control on long‐term diabetic complications in people with T1D, and aimed to determine whether near normoglycaemic values are beneficial. The review confirmed that tight blood sugar control significantly reduced the risk of developing retinopathy (23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 768 participants; high‐quality evidence). However, the beneficial effect of tight blood sugar control seemed to become weaker once retinopathy was present (Fullerton 2014). A recent review, consisting of five RCTs with large sample sizes and long‐term follow‐up, found that in people with worse‐than‐moderate NPDR, intensive glycaemic control may not confer any benefits in terms of progression (Liu 2020).

International evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines recognise the benefit of glycaemic control (Fred Hollows Foundation 2015). However, current management approaches do not fully prevent progression to PDR, and there is no glycaemic threshold below which protection is certain (Diabetes Control and Complications Group 1993).

Prior to the undertaking of this systematic review, the current evidence on the effect of hypertension on progression to and within PDR seemed unclear. Although the Wisconsin Epidemiological Study of Diabetic Retinopathy determined hypertension to be associated with progression to PDR in people with T1D (Klein 1998), and the UKPDS identified a corresponding relationship in those with T2D (Turner 1998), other studies failed to corroborate these findings (Chew 2014; Harris 2013 ; Jin 2015). In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye study, intensive blood pressure control did not have a significant effect on retinopathy progression (Chew 2014). A Cochrane Review of 15 RCTs, including participants with T1D and T2D conducted mainly in North America and Europe, determined an association between reduced blood pressure and prevention of DR for up to four to five years (Do 2015). However, the review concluded that the available evidence did not support a benefit of intervention on blood pressure on progression to PDR or moderate/severe visual loss after five years of follow‐up. Similarly, a recent meta‐analysis concluded that intensive blood pressure control reduced relative risk of incidence of DR by 17% in T2D (Zhou 2018a). However, the available data were insufficient to confirm a relative risk reduction for DR progression or incidence of PDR (Zhou 2018a).

### The retinal renin-angiotensin system: implications for therapy in diabetic retinopathy [^89c05031]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Retinopathy is the most common complication of diabetes, and a leading cause of blindness in people of working age. Optimal blood pressure and metabolic control can reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, but are difficult to achieve in clinical practice. In the EUCLID Study, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril reduced the risk of progression of retinopathy by approximately 50%, and also significantly reduced the risk of progression to proliferative retinopathy. These findings are consistent with extensive evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is expressed in the eye, and that adverse effects of angiotensin II on retinal angiogenesis and function can be inhibited by ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers. However, in the EUCLID Study retinopathy was not a primary end-point and the study was not sufficiently powered for the eye-related outcomes. Hence, the Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) programme has been established to determine whether AT(1)-receptor blockade with candesartan can prevent the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. This programme comprises three studies, involving a total of 4500 patients recruited from about 300 centres worldwide. The patients are normotensive or treated hypertensive individuals, and so the DIRECT programme should assess the potential of an AT(1)-receptor blocker to protect against the pathological changes in the eye following diabetes.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^9055ef1e]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The reasons for the discrepancy of the effect of strict blood pressure control on the incidence and progression of DR remain unknown. The discrepancy might be the different definition of the progression of DR used in the different trials. Thus, in the UKPDS, the definition of DR progression seemed crude in relation to blindness and the need for laser or vitreoretinal surgery, etc. while the progression of DR in DIRECT Protect2 was defined as an increase of three or more ETDRS levels. Another possibility might be that the baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values differed in the included various trials; nearly 11% of HbA1c in the intensive and conventional arms in the ABCD trial, while nearly 8% of HbA1c in other trials. The separate effect of blood glucose might lead to the various outcomes of diabetic retinopathy. Third, blood pressure control can sometimes be a trade-off between risks of hypotension and adequate risk factor control in people with diabetic complications, especially for people with progression of DR who could have longer duration of diabetes and more cardiovascular risk factors. The nature of the effect of blood pressure control on the progression of DR might appear to exclude the intervention of these covariants. Besides, various antihypertensive drugs were used in previous studies, and the different effects of antihypertensive drugs on diabetic retinopathy might be the reason for these conflicting findings. Selection bias of language might be a limitation of this study.

In addition, our finding regarding the beneficial efficacy of intensive blood pressure targets in the development of T2D individuals with DR concords with previous observational studies, which demonstrated a detrimental effect of high blood pressure in people with DR, and blood pressures were only associated with new development of DR, but not with its progression. Additional studies are needed to focus on why strict blood pressure targets affected the incidence but not progression of diabetic retinopathy.

The implications of our study findings for daily clinical practice should be emphasized. Understanding whether diabetic individuals have a lower risk of DR with the strict blood pressure targets will help diabetologists to provide effective clinical counseling for patients. BP optimization should be done in primary care or by a diabetologist before the patients even see the ophthalmologist.

### Effect of candesartan on progression and regression of retinopathy in type 2 diabetes (DIRECT-protect 2): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^05d9d3e0]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of visual loss in people of working age. We examined whether candesartan treatment could slow the progression and, secondly, induce regression of retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in 309 centres worldwide. We recruited normoalbuminuric, normotensive, or treated hypertensive people with type 2 diabetes with mild to moderately severe retinopathy and assigned them to candesartan 16 mg once a day or placebo. After a month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg once per day. Investigators and patients were unaware of the treatment allocation status. Progression of retinopathy was the primary endpoint, and regression was a secondary endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00252694.

Findings

1905 participants (aged 37-75 years) were randomised to candesartan (n=951) or placebo (n=954). 161 (17%) patients in the candesartan group and 182 (19%) in the placebo group had progression of retinopathy by three steps or more on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale. The risk of progression of retinopathy was non-significantly reduced by 13% in patients on candesartan compared with those on placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.70-1.08, p=0.20). Regression on active treatment was increased by 34% (1.34, 1.08-1.68, p=0.009). HRs were not attenuated by adjustment for baseline risk factors or changes in blood pressure during the trial. An overall change towards less severe retinopathy by the end of the trial was observed in the candesartan group (odds 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.003). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.

Interpretation

Treatment with candesartan in type 2 diabetic patients with mild to moderate retinopathy might induce improvement of retinopathy.

### Retinopathy (...) [^6e9d315e]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The retina lines the back two-thirds of the eye and is responsible for receiving visual images. Retinopathy means disease of the retina. There are several types of retinopathy but all involve disease of the small retinal blood vessels. Signs of retinopathy can be seen when the retina is viewed through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope. The August 22/29, 2007, issue of JAMA includes an article about management of diabetic retinopathy. This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the January 5, 2005, issue of JAMA. Hypertension and vascular diseases can affect the small blood vessels of the retina just as they can affect other blood vessels. Retinopathy may therefore be an indicator of vascular damage elsewhere in the body. Visual changes sometimes develop because of advanced retinopathy and may be a sign of undiagnosed or poorly controlled hypertension. Although rare, blindness may occur.

The most common type of retinopathy is related to diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy can be proliferative or nonproliferative, referring to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Nonproliferative retinopathy is much more common and may not require treatment. In proliferative retinopathy, abnormal blood vessels start to grow when the existing blood vessels close off. The proliferative type of retinopathy can lead to impaired vision. Regular eye examinations are important to check for progression of retinopathy from nonproliferative to proliferative stages. Preventing retinopathy starts with early diagnosis and treatment of conditions that cause retinopathy. For persons with diabetes, good control of blood glucose levels, proper control of high blood pressure, and regular medical examinations are crucial to preventing retinopathy. Persons with diabetes should have an annual eye examination including pupil dilation for the best possible view of the retina.

Good blood pressure control is essential for anyone with hypertension. Individuals with eye disorders or other health problems that put them at risk for visual impairment should see an ophthalmologist. Once retinopathy is detected, early treatment is essential to prevent blindness. Several forms of treatment are available for persons with proliferative retinopathy.

BP and Progression of DR

Five trials reported progression of DR that was present at the time of trial enrollment among 5132 type 2 diabetics [,–]. The overall RR of strict blood pressure for progression was 0.94 (95% CI 0.81–1.08), indicating a possible 6% reduction (Fig. 4). Heterogeneity was low (I 2 = 15.6%; P = 0.31).

Trial sequential analysis showed a lack of sufficient evidence in Fig. 5. The cumulative Z curve did not cross monitoring boundaries (trial sequential analysis adjusted 95% CI 0.80–1.06). After the first three trials, the cumulative Z statistic crossed the conventional significance boundary (Z = 1.96) but did not cross the O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. From the fourth trial onwards, the meta-analysis was no longer nominally statistically significant. With the publication of the last trial, the Z score approached the futility boundaries.

Data regarding the incidence of PDR or macular edema were available from five trials [–,]. No beneficial effect of blood pressure intervention was shown: RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.72–1.30), 0.93 (95% CI 0.80–1.08). Heterogeneity was present (I 2 = 54.6%, P = 0.07; I 2 = 15.6%; P = 0.31, for PDR or ME, respectively, Fig. 6).

### Retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^552ddb42]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy—epidemiology, risk factors, and management effects include that "Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20–74 years in developed countries" and is described as "a highly specific neurovascular complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes." Risk is increased as "factors that increase the risk of, or are associated with, retinopathy include chronic hyperglycemia (2,3), nephropathy (4), hypertension (5), and dyslipidemia (6–8)." Therapeutically, "Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to prevent and/or delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy, reduce the need for future ocular surgical procedures, and potentially improve self-reported visual function (2,6–9,11)." Regarding GLP-1 receptor agonists, "A meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcomes studies showed no association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment and retinopathy per se, except through the association between retinopathy and A1C reduction at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up," and "Long-term impact of improved glycemic management on retinopathy was not studied in these trials."

### New approaches to the treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^41b09fb7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of visual impairment in working age in industrialized countries. It is classified as non-proliferative (mild, moderate or severe) and proliferative, with diabetic macular oedema potentially developing at any of these stages. The prevalence and incidence of DR increase with diabetes duration and worsening of metabolic and blood pressure control. Current approaches to prevent and/or treat DR include optimized control of blood glucose and blood pressure and screening for early identification of high-risk, although still asymptomatic, retinal lesions. Results from recent clinical trials suggest a role for blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) and for fenofibrate in reducing progression and/or inducing regression of mild-to-moderate non-proliferative DR. Intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents was shown to reduce visual loss in more advanced stages of DR, especially in macular oedema.

### Optimal treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^3fc64b3d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DRP) is a common complication caused by multiple biochemical abnormalities of the underlying metabolic disease. While the incidence of DRP appears to decline due to evidence-based changes in diabetes management, the predicted increase in patients affected in particular by type 2 diabetes may outweigh the positive trend. The diagnosis is based on the alterations of the vessels, usually indicating abnormalities of the blood-retinal barrier and increased vasoregression, but the neuroglial elements appear equally vulnerable to the diabetic condition. Control of blood glucose, blood pressure and timely identification of coincident nephropathy are important to prevent progression to vision-threatening stages. Guidelines give specific indications for laser photocoagulation, in particular when euglycemia is no longer effective in preventing progression to advanced stages. Intravitreal administration of antibodies directed against the single best characterized propagator of clinically significant macular edema, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has become popular despite uncertainty about the patient subgroups which benefit best and the optimum administration schedule. Multifactorial intervention beyond glycemic control includes antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antiaggregatory and is effective in type 2 diabetic patients with high-risk profiles, in particular coincident nephropathy.

### Advances in the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^984061be]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

STANDARD TREATMENT

Although tight control of both blood glucose levels and hypertension is essential to prevent or arrest progression of the disease, the recommended goals are difficult to achieve in many patients and, consequently, diabetic retinopathy develops during the evolution of the disease. When PDR or clinically significant DME do appear, argon-laser photocoagulation is currently indicated, which the efficacy of has been widely demonstrated. However, the optimal period for laser treatment has frequently passed; moreover, it is not uniformly successful in halting visual decline. In addition, argon-laser photocoagulation is associated with moderate visual loss, some diminished visual field, reduced color vision, and reduced contrast sensitivity. The presence of these symptoms led to the prevailing thinking that laser treatment prevents vision loss but rarely results in visual improvement.

Intravitreal corticosteroids have been successfully used in the eyes of patients with persistent DME and loss of vision following the failure of conventional treatment (i.e. focal laser treatment and attention to systemic risk factors). However, reinjections are commonly needed, and there are substantial adverse effects such as infection, glaucoma, and cataract formation. In addition, recent reports have shown that focal/grid photocoagulation is more effective and has fewer side effects than intravitreal triamcinolone for DME.

### Effectiveness of quality improvement strategies on the management of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ae2fadfa]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of quality improvement (QI) strategies on diabetes care remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of QI strategies on glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), vascular risk management, microvascular complication monitoring, and smoking cessation in patients with diabetes.

Methods

We identified studies through Medline, the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care database (from inception to July 2010), and references of included randomised clinical trials. We included trials assessing 11 predefined QI strategies or financial incentives targeting health systems, health-care professionals, or patients to improve management of adult outpatients with diabetes. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and appraised risk of bias.

Findings

We reviewed 48 cluster randomised controlled trials, including 2538 clusters and 84,865 patients, and 94 patient randomised controlled trials, including 38,664 patients. In random effects meta-analysis, the QI strategies reduced HbA(1c) by a mean difference of 0·37% (95% CI 0·28-0·45; 120 trials), LDL cholesterol by 0·10 mmol/L (0·05-0.14; 47 trials), systolic blood pressure by 3·13 mm Hg (2·19-4·06, 65 trials), and diastolic blood pressure by 1·55 mm Hg (0·95-2·15, 61 trials) versus usual care. We noted larger effects when baseline concentrations were greater than 8·0% for HbA(1c), 2·59 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol, and 80 mm Hg for diastolic and 140 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure. The effectiveness of QI strategies varied depending on baseline HbA(1c) control. QI strategies increased the likelihood that patients received aspirin (11 trials; relative risk [RR] 1·33, 95% CI 1·21-1·45), antihypertensive drugs (ten trials; RR 1·17, 1·01-1·37), and screening for retinopathy (23 trials; RR 1·22, 1·13-1·32), renal function (14 trials; RR 128, 1·13-1·44), and foot abnormalities (22 trials; RR 1·27, 1·16-1·39). However, statin use (ten trials; RR 1·12, 0·99-1·28), hypertension control (18 trials; RR 1·01, 0·96-1·07), and smoking cessation (13 trials; RR 1·13, 0·99-1·29) were not significantly increased.

Interpretation

Many trials of QI strategies showed improvements in diabetes care. Interventions targeting the system of chronic disease management along with patient-mediated QI strategies should be an important component of interventions aimed at improving diabetes management. Interventions solely targeting health-care professionals seem to be beneficial only if baseline HbA(1c) control is poor.

### Achievement of individualized treatment targets in patients with comorbid type-2 diabetes and hypertension: 6 months results of the DIALOGUE registry [^c8851d2b]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A large body of evidence indicates that type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In fact, those with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop CVD, which is the leading cause of mortality in patients with T2DM. In addition, the prevalence of hypertension is more than double in diabetic patients compared to those with normal blood glucose levels, making it the most common comorbid disease associated with T2DM. Hypertension has been found to increase the risk of nephropathy, retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM.

Current guidelines have recommended a multi-factorial approach for treating diabetic patients with hypertension, involving simultaneous targeting of blood pressure (BP) and glucose levels. Although there has been a recent focus on individualized treatment targets in patients with T2DM, guidelines have not been sufficiently translated into clinical practice. Moreover, adequate guidance with regard to individualized BP targets remains to be established. Thus, in order to define effective criteria for individualized treatment approaches, information regarding patient characteristics that might be associated with specific HbA1c and BP target groups as well as investigation into the efficacy of meeting individualized therapeutic goals set by physicians in daily clinical practice are fundamental. This is especially important considering that drugs that perform well within specialized populations in clinical trials are often less effective when employed in clinical practice. Thus, it is also essential to carefully evaluate whether treatment targets can be met using specific antidiabetic and antihypertensive therapies in unselected patient populations and within real clinical settings. For this reason, comparisons between different drug classes are required.

The ongoing DIALOGUE registry represents the first study to assess the effectiveness, tolerability, and impact of different therapeutic approaches in patients with T2DM and hypertension while applying newly established individualized treatment targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Here, we aimed to characterize patients based on their chosen therapeutic targets as well as actual target achievement rates (overall and by comorbidity). Furthermore, we identified patient characteristics associated with loose treatment goals.

### Effect of a multifactorial intervention on retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes: a secondary analysis of the J-DOIT3 randomized clinical trial [^4302ddcc]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Prevention of diabetic retinopathy is important to keep vision and quality of life.

Objective

To examine the effects of an intensive multifactorial intervention and hypoglycemia on retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

J-DOIT3 (Japan Diabetes Optimal Integrated Treatment Study for 3 Major Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Diseases) is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group randomized clinical trial that examined the efficacy of an intensified multifactorial intervention on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes aged 45 to 69 years with hypertension and/or dyslipidemia. The study was conducted at 81 sites in Japan from June 2006 to March 2009, and data analysis was performed from September 2018 to August 2025.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to intensive therapy for glucose, blood pressure, and lipids or conventional therapy and were followed up for a median duration of 8.5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study is a secondary analysis of retinopathy events of the secondary outcomes, composed of onset of retinopathy, progression of retinopathy, and loss of vision likely due to retinopathy.

Results

Among 2540 total participants (5080 eyes) randomly assigned to intensive therapy or conventional therapy, mean (SD) age was 59.0 (6.3) years, and 965 participants (38.0%) were female. Intensive therapy was associated with a risk reduction in onset of retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.98; P=.03) but not with progression of retinopathy (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70-1.49; P=.93). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 1 year after randomization was associated with onset (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.51; P<.001), even after adjustment for baseline risk factors (ie, lower body mass index, longer duration of diabetes, higher fasting plasma glucose, higher blood pressure, and comorbid nephropathy), with no clear HbA1c threshold observed. Moreover, compared with those without a hypoglycemic episode during the intervention, the risk of onset was higher in those with 0.5 hypoglycemic episodes per year or fewer (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53) and even higher in those with more than 1 hypoglycemic episode per year (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.39-2.47).

Conclusions and Relevance

This secondary analysis of the J-DOIT3 randomized clinical trial shows that in a randomized clinical trial setting, higher HbA1c and nonsevere hypoglycemia are associated with higher risk of onset of retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes, even when good glycemic management, with a very low incidence of severe hypoglycemia, is achieved, suggesting the importance of strict glycemic management without any hypoglycemia.

### Effects of RAS inhibitors on diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^93ea8f96]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of several studies have shown a possible beneficial effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors on diabetic retinopathy, but the findings were contradictory. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of RAS inhibitors on diabetic retinopathy.

Methods

We identified relevant publications in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and abstracts from main annual meetings. Only randomised controlled trials comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy with other antihypertensive drugs or placebo in type 1 or type 2 diabetes were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The primary outcomes were progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy in all patients and several subgroups. Risk ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were pooled. We also did a network meta-analysis to assess the effect of different antihypertensive drugs on diabetic retinopathy by ranking order. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42013004548.

Findings

21 randomised clinical trials with 13,823 participants were included in the meta-analysis. RAS inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of progression (absolute risk difference -3%, 95% CI -5 to -1; pooled RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95; p=0.002) and increased possibility of regression of diabetic retinopathy (8%, 1-16; RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.61; p=0.00002). In normotensive patients, RAS inhibitors decreased risk of diabetic retinopathy progression (0.81, 0.69-0.94; p=0.007) and increased possibility of regression (1.43, 1.14-1.79; p=0.002). In hypertensive patients, RAS inhibitors were not associated with difference in risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (0.93, 0.79-1.10; p=0.42) or possibility of diabetic retinopathy regression (2.21, 0.92-5.31; p=0.08). ACE inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy progression (0.84, 0.75-0.94; p=0.002) and higher possibility of disease regression (1.50, 1.20-1.86; p=0.0003). ARBs were associated with a higher possibility of diabetic retinopathy regression (1.32, 1.07-1.61; p=0.008), but had no effect on disease progression (0.92, 0.80-1.06; p=0.25). Network meta-analysis showed the association of antihypertensive drugs with risk of diabetic retinopathy progression was lowest for ACE inhibitors, followed by ARBs, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, and placebo in rank order. The association of antihypertensive drugs with possibility of diabetic retinopathy regression was highest for ACE inhibitors, followed by ARBs, placebo, and calcium channel blockers in rank order.

Interpretation

In patients with diabetes, RAS inhibitors reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, and increase the possibility of diabetic retinopathy regression. ACE inhibitors might be better than ARBs for treating diabetic retinopathy, and might exert the most beneficial effect on diabetic retinopathy of all widely used antihypertensive drug classes.

### Blood pressure control for patients with diabetic retinopathy (...) [^b9287c2a]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Does blood pressure control prevent diabetic retinopathy or slow its progression. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP. 1 There are many definitions for more intensive BP control, from a diastolic BP of less than 75 mm Hg to a BP target of less than 135/75 mm Hg or a systolic BP of less than 120 mm Hg; nonintensive control is typically a systolic BP of less than 140 mm Hg.
1. More intensive BP control does not slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy once it has developed. Reduction of BP in normotensive people with diabetes does not prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy. Treatment of hypertension increases the risk of hypotension.

### Diabetic retinal neurodegeneration is associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress and is improved by an angiotensin receptor blocker in a model combining hypertension and diabetes [^71a174e0]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a vision-threatening disease presenting neurodegenerative features associated with extensive vascular changes. At present, there is no established neuroprotective treatment that avoids visual disturbance in patients with diabetes. Earlier studies have focused on improving glycemic control for prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. However, with the publication ofEURODIAB EUCLID (Controlled Trial of Lisinopril in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes) and U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study results, controlling blood pressure and, specifically, interference in the renin-angiotensin system have emerged as important strategies for treating diabetic retinopathy. More recently, DIRECT (Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trial), a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with type 1 or type 2 diabetic patients into daily placebo or 32 mg candesartan groups, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, showed the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetic retinopathy. In patients with type 1 diabetes, candesartan had a mild effect on reducing the incidence of retinopathy by 18%, and in post hoc analyses, candesartan reduced the incidence of retinopathy by three or more steps by 35%. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with candesartan decreased the progression of retinopathy by 34% in participants with early retinopathy. These data showed that the potential benefits of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan might be seen in early stages of diabetic retinopathy.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^827315c9]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Summary listing of action statements—patient education and systemic risk-factor control includes the following recommendations: Individuals should be made aware of the effectiveness of diet and physical activity programs in delaying the onset or preventing type 2 diabetes (Evidence Grade: A, Strong Recommendation); Individuals with diabetes should be educated about the long-term benefits of glucose control in reducing the risk of onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy (Evidence Grade: A, Strong Recommendation); Persons with diabetes should be educated about the potential benefits of blood pressure control in reducing the risk for development or progression of diabetic retinopathy (Evidence Grade: B, Strong Recommendation); Individuals with diabetes should be educated about the long-term benefits of optimizing lipid control in reducing the risk for progression of diabetic retinopathy (Evidence Grade: B, Strong Recommendation); and Patients should be counseled about the benefits of physical exercise in delaying or reducing the ocular effects of diabetes (Evidence Grade: C, Discretional).

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^af1fc8e7]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes—In high-risk patients with advanced type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose lowering targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6 percent reduced five-year nonfatal myocardial infarctions but increased five-year mortality; therefore, such a strategy cannot be recommended for high-risk patients with advanced type 2 diabetes (Evidence Grade: A). Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are synergistic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and optimal control of blood pressure and LDL cholesterol can help prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Successful prevention and treatment of CVD risk factors have reduced the burden of coronary heart disease among adults with diabetes in the United States, and significant progress can be achieved when multiple risk factors such as blood pressure control, lipid management, antiplatelet agents, and smoking cessation are addressed globally.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^15712b59]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure measurement in persons with diabetes may be performed at the time of the eye examination, particularly in individuals who may not be under regular medical care, because hypertension is more prevalent in persons with diabetes and is a potential risk factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy. Blood pressure <140/90 mmHg has been recommended for most patients with diabetes.

### Diabetic retinopathy and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: new data from the DIRECT study programme [^8016354a]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis and medical management of diabetic retinopathy is reviewed. The importance of good control of blood glucose and blood pressure remain key elements in the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and a number of specific metabolic pathways have been identified that may be useful additional targets for therapeutic intervention. Trial data, however, aimed specifically to answer the questions of optimum medical management are limited, so the DIRECT study of renin-angiotensin blockade using oral candesartan 32 mg daily is a welcome addition to our knowledge. This arose from the promising improvement of retinopathy outcomes in the EUCLID study of lisinopril in type I diabetes. In DIRECT, 5 years of candesartan treatment in type I diabetes reduced the incidence of retinopathy by two or more steps (EDTRS) in severity by 18% (P=0.0508) and, in a post hoc analysis, reduced the incidence of retinopathy by three-step progression by 35% (P=0.034). In type I diabetes patients there was no effect on progression of established retinopathy. In contrast, in type II diabetes, 5 years of candesartan treatment resulted in 34% regression of retinopathy (P=0.009). Importantly, an overall significant change towards less-severe retinopathy was noted in both type I and II diabetes (P<or=0.03). Although there is still no absolute proof that these effects were specific to RAS blockade, or just an effect of lower blood pressure, it is reasonable to conclude that candesartan has earned a place in the medical management of diabetic retinopathy, to prevent the problem in type I diabetes and to treat the early stages in type II diabetes.

### The eye in hypertension [^b1935918]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension has a range of effects on the eye. Hypertensive retinopathy refers to retinal microvascular signs that develop in response to raised blood pressure. Signs of hypertensive retinopathy are frequently seen in adults 40 years and older, and are predictive of incident stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality--independently of traditional risk factors. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for the development of other retinal vascular diseases, such as retinal vein and artery occlusion, and ischaemic optic neuropathy. High blood pressure increases the risk of both development of diabetic retinopathy and its progression. Adequate control of blood pressure has been proven in randomised clinical trials to reduce vision loss associated with diabetic retinopathy. Finally, hypertension has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Recognition of the ocular effects of blood pressure could allow physicians to better manage patients with hypertension, and to monitor its end-organ effects.

### Benefits of renin-angiotensin blockade on retinopathy in type 1 diabetes vary with glycemic control [^381886c0]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes and remains the leading cause of new blindness among adults aged 20–74 years in the U.S. The estimated prevalence of DR and vision-threatening DR among Americans with diabetes who are 40 years or older are 28.5 and 4.4%, respectively. Consequent to the ongoing increase in diabetes prevalence, the total number of people older than 40 years with DR is projected to be 16 million by year 2050. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) clearly demonstrated the benefit of intensive glycemic control in reducing the incidence and progression of DR in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. As a consequence of these studies, guidelines to maintain glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) <7.0% are now accepted as a standard of care in diabetes. However, achieving and sustaining A1C at these levels remains problematic. Thus additional treatment approaches to DR prevention may be helpful.

Tight blood pressure control per se has been shown to reduce progression of retinopathy in hypertensive diabetic patients. Previous studies have also suggested beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) on progression of DR in both normotensive and hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients (–). Recently, the Renin Angiotensin System Study (RASS) documented a beneficial role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade on DR progression but did not slow nephropathy progression in normotensive normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients. The Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trial (DIRECT-Prevent 1) also reported a reduction in the incidence of DR in type 1 diabetic patients that just failed to achieve statistical significance (P = 0.0508).

Herein we evaluated the role of glycemic control on the treatment benefit of RAS blockade on DR progression in the RASS.

### Combined effect of glycemic and blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy among Chinese with type-2 diabetes mellitus [^81d0c3b2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Elevated glucose and blood pressure (BP) are well-established risk factors for diabetes. Both glycemia and BP lowering treatments were documented to reduce the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications among patients with T2DM. Nevertheless, lowering glycemia and BP in individuals with T2DM is an area of current controversy, with particular debates surrounding who should be offered therapy and what the glucose/BP targets should be achieved. When it comes to DR, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study revealed that an intensive compared with a conventional glycemia control policy could reduce the risk of DR, while other studies revealed inconsistent results that there was a non-significant trend toward a beneficial effect in the intensive-therapy group with respect to DRin the standard-therapy group. A recent meta-analysis of landmark diabetes trials reported that each 10-mmHg decrease in systolic BP (SBP) was associated with a 13% reduction in the risk of DR; however, when trials were stratified by mean baseline SBP at greater than or less than 140 mmHg, the relative risk for DR was not lower in studies with greater baseline SBP. Additionally, regarding therapies to lower glucose and SBP, it remains uncertain whether treatment of either alone is sufficient, or whether, to obtain maximum benefit, both of these risk factors need to be treated simultaneously. Multiple risk factor intervention trials in T2DM has shown that increased benefits can be obtained by targeting several risk factors simultaneously, while other studies demonstrated that combined intensive BP and glycemic control does not produce an additive benefit on microvascular outcomes in T2DM. With regard to the above mentioned conflict findings, it remains unknown as to whether there is a specific threshold at which glycemic and BP control would complement each other multiplicatively in the clinical management of T2DM and DR, or if extremes of each risk factor might mitigate or enhance the benefits of controlling the other.

Diabetes is a major public health concern in the mainland of China, the world’s most populous country. We undertook a cross-sectional study in urban communities located in eastern China to explore the associations of glycemic and BP control with DR, with special focus on whether different combinations of categories of these factors are additive.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^65cbc9a2]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion—Vision impairment from diabetes is a significant public health problem which affects the health, economic well-being, and productivity of individuals, families, and society as a whole. Steps to prevent visual impairment in persons with diabetes include optimal glycemic control, the treatment of ancillary risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels, and ongoing comprehensive eye examinations for the early detection and, when needed, treatment of eye and vision problems. All persons with diabetes should be informed of the possibility of developing retinopathy or other nonretinal ocular complications, with or without symptoms, and of the associated threat of vision loss. The natural course and treatment of diabetic retinopathy should be discussed with the person, and the importance of lifelong eye examinations should be stressed; they should be made aware of the benefits of early diagnosis and available treatment options in preserving vision, and should be advised of the availability of vision rehabilitation services to address functional vision issues and provided with referral or treatment for diabetes-related vision loss. Until therapies are available to prevent or cure diabetic retinopathy and other ocular complications of diabetes, emphasis must be placed on diagnosis, careful follow-up, and timely treatment, and doctors of optometry may be the first to examine persons with signs of diabetes or diabetic retinopathy; therefore, they have a key role in identifying individuals with undiagnosed diabetes and reinforcing the importance of diabetes control and appropriate follow-up care to lower the risk for vision loss.

### The relationship between carotid disease and retinopathy in diabetes: a systematic review [^087ba886]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication affecting over one-third of people with diabetes mellitus. It is one of the leading causes of moderate or severe visual impairment globally. Known modifiable risk factors comprise hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia, but the pathophysiology of DR is not fully understood. Several biochemical mechanisms have been suggested including increased oxidative stress, inflammation, neurodegeneration and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Despite screening programs aimed at early detection, there are few treatments for DR and most can only be used to prevent worsening of established disease. There is, therefore, a need for improved understanding of the epidemiology of DR including risk factors so that it can be identified earlier, new preventive strategies and treatments developed, and vision loss prevented or delayed.

Diabetic retinopathy is characterised by vascular lesions including microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. Less severe DR typically refers to mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), while more severe DR generally comprises severe NPDR or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) which have a greater effect on vision. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol is commonly used to assess the severity of DR. According to this scheme, mild NPDR consists of at least one microaneurysm without evidence of other pathological lesions. When NPDR progresses to PDR there is evidence of neovascularisation.

Appropriately intensive management of hyperglycemia and hypertension reduces the risk of DR. Of the few available specific treatments, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, such as aflibercept, ranibizumab and bevacizumab, are now considered as a first-line treatment for vision-threatening DR but not all patients respond and these therapies are costly. Laser photocoagulation, which used to be the first-line treatment, and intravitreal corticosteroids are also used to treat severe DR [–,]. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), fenofibrate is a treatment that can prevent DR progression. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, which recruited 9795 participants, showed fenofibrate reduced the need for laser treatment and, in those with pre-existing DR, the risk of progression. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye study, which involved 10,251 participants, showed that those in the fenofibrate and statin arm had lower odds of DR progression after 4 years than those in the placebo and statin only arm. Nevertheless, there is still a residual risk of DR progression despite these interventions.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^675b4eec]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for future studies

The studies presented in this review suggest that specific non‐proliferative retinopathy lesion patterns may be weighted to individual risks of developing sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy. To implement additional lesion measurements into current classification systems, robust natural history studies of lesion types are needed to fully characterize these non‐proliferative retinopathy progression profiles. Future studies investigating the systematic progression and regression and local distribution of different lesion types should be performed to identify markers of the risk of rapid progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent sight loss.

In addition to the standard stepwise changes on the diabetic retinopathy severity scale and best‐corrected visual acuity, valuable information on the progression of non‐proliferative retinopathy could be acquired in future clinical trials specifically to investigate treatment effects on early and reversible lesion changes. Suggested supplementary measurements are listed in Table 3.

Table 3 
Suggested supplementary measurements for non‐proliferative retinopathy lesion assessment

A detailed assessment of concomitant hypertension would be helpful, particularly in determining whether hypertensive retinopathy affects non‐proliferative retinopathy disease progression and whether specifically targeting hypertension would be more effective in the non‐proliferative retinopathy population.

Advances in adaptive optics can already reveal the microscopic changes that could help elucidate underlying pathology imaging such as vessel occlusion and the presence of leukostasis 50 ; therefore, future developments in imaging could involve high‐resolution visualization of retinal circulation. Further research is required to determine new blood biomarkers, retinal imaging markers, and genetic determinants of diabetic retinopathy. These findings will enable us to further our understanding of the pathogenesis, risk prediction, prevention, and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

Current non‐proliferative retinopathy classifications are limited owing to their broad description of moderately severe and severe non‐proliferative retinopathy categories, which presents a challenge when predicting people with a high risk of progressing to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy, even if stratified by ‘traditional’ risk factors (such as diabetes duration, haemoglobin levels, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Furthermore, standard imaging techniques may not capture predominantly peripheral lesions. There is a clear unmet need for improved and earlier detection of moderate‐to‐severe non‐proliferative retinopathy to improve outcomes. It is hoped that combining a robust qualitative classification with quantitative metrics may allow us to better stratify people with non‐proliferative retinopathy. Clinical applications of this approach may prove useful in better understanding microvascular disease progression and may help point the way to more successful treatment regimens.

### Effect of candesartan on prevention (DIRECT-prevent 1) and progression (DIRECT-protect 1) of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes: randomised, placebo-controlled trials [^e91b4d4e]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Results of previous studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system blockers might reduce the burden of diabetic retinopathy. We therefore designed the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) Programme to assess whether candesartan could reduce the incidence and progression of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Two randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled trials were done in 309 centres worldwide. Participants with normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes without retinopathy were recruited to the DIRECT-Prevent 1 trial and those with existing retinopathy were recruited to DIRECT-Protect 1, and were assigned to candesartan 16 mg once a day or matching placebo. After 1 month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg. Investigators and participants were unaware of the treatment allocation status. The primary endpoints were incidence and progression of retinopathy and were defined as at least a two-step and at least a three-step increase on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, respectively. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00252733 for DIRECT-Prevent 1 and NCT00252720 for DIRECT-Protect 1.

Findings

1421 participants (aged 18-50 years) were randomly assigned to candesartan (n=711) or to placebo (n=710) in DIRECT-Prevent 1, and 1905 (aged 18-55 years) to candesartan (n=951) or to placebo (n=954) in DIRECT-Protect 1. Incidence of retinopathy was seen in 178 (25%) participants in the candesartan group versus 217 (31%) in the placebo group. Progression of retinopathy occurred in 127 (13%) participants in the candesartan group versus 124 (13%) in the placebo group. Hazard ratio (HR for candesartan vs placebo) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.67-1.00, p=0.0508) for incidence of retinopathy and 1.02 (0.80-1.31, p=0.85) for progression of retinopathy. The post-hoc outcome of at least a three-step increase for incidence yielded an HR of 0.65 (0.48-0.87, p=0.0034), which was attenuated but still significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics (0.71, 0.53-0.95, p=0.046). Final ETDRS level was more likely to have improved with candesartan treatment in both DIRECT-Prevent 1 (odds 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p=0.0048) and DIRECT-Protect 1 (1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25, p=0.0264). Adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups.

Interpretation

Although candesartan reduces the incidence of retinopathy, we did not see a beneficial effect on retinopathy progression.

### Glycemic control and prevention of microvascular and macrovascular disease in the steno 2 study [^2af82dbc]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review key findings and insights from the Steno 2 trial involving 160 patients with type 2 diabetes in Denmark.

Methods

The Steno 2 study design, with conventional and intensive treatment arms, is described, and the outcomes are summarized.

Results

Intensive and target-driven behavior modeling and polypharmacy for 7.8 years induced an absolute risk reduction of 20% in cardiovascular disease events in patients with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in comparison with a conventional multifactorial treatment. The relative risk reduction found for microvascular events after 4 years was maintained at a similar level after 7.8 years of intervention: nephropathy 61%, retinopathy 58%, and autonomic neuropathy 63%.

Conclusion

Improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes may be as important as, or even more important than, treating hypertension and dyslipidemia for the prevention of both microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly when aggressive treatment is initiated at an early stage of the disease.

### Diabetic retinopathy, its progression, and incident cardiovascular events in the ACCORD trial [^b6703cb8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was a large, randomized, controlled trial of the effects of intensive versus standard degrees of glucose lowering, intensive versus standard degrees of systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering, and the addition of a fibrate versus placebo to a statin on the 5-year incidence of serious CV outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and other CV risk factors. A subset of participants also consented to the ACCORD Eye Study, which assessed the effect of the interventions on retinal pathology at baseline and after 4 years of follow-up. Data from individuals in this subset provide a unique opportunity to confirm the relationship between severity of baseline retinopathy and incident CV outcomes and to determine whether the deterioration of retinopathy with time is also linked to incident CV outcomes.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin? [^201d2db8]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

PRIMARY PREVENTION TRIALS

The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study and the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) comprised only a small number of diabetic patients (1 and 2% of the patients studied, respectively), precluding a meaningful subanalysis of this patient population.

In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA), 24% of the 19,342 hypertensive patients enrolled had diabetes. The proportional effect of atorvastatin on the primary end point of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD did not differ significantly in any prespecified subgroup from that noted overall, although the benefit was not significant in patients with diabetes. However, the absolute number of events among patients with diabetes was small, so the study may have had inadequate power, especially due to the shortened follow-up period (the study was stopped prematurely after a median of 3.3 years' follow-up because of the obvious benefit of atorvastatin). Another issue was the high rate of statin use among patients with diabetes assigned to placebo: 14% compared with 8% in individuals without diabetes. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) is the only diabetes-specific primary prevention trial performed. In this trial, 2,838 diabetic patients without CHD, but with at least one other risk factor (hypertension, retinopathy, albuminuria, or smoking), were randomized to 10 mg atorvastatin daily, or placebo. The primary end point was the time to first occurrence of acute CHD events, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated 2 years earlier than expected because the prespecified stopping rule for efficacy had been met. There was a significant relative risk reduction of 37%, with 37 major vascular events prevented per 1,000 people treated for 4 years. Overall mortality was also reduced with atorvastatin, although just failing to reach statistical significance.

Hypertension promotes the progression of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy

Many researchers have studied the mechanism by which hyperglycemia promotes the progression of other diabetic microvascular disorders such as retinopathy and neuropathy. However, few have studied the mechanism by which hypertension aggravates these microvascular disorders.

The JDCS conducted in Japan mentioned earlier showed that the rate of new onset of retinopathy and its rate of worsening in Japan were 38.3 and 21.1 per 1000 person×years, respectively. The risk factors for developing retinopathy are duration of diabetes (HR of 1.26 with a 5-year morbidity period), BMI (HR of 1.05 for every additional 1 kg/m 2), SBP (HR of 1.09 for every additional 10 mm Hg), and HbA1c (HR of 1.36 for every additional 1%). Hypertension is clearly a risk factor for developing retinopathy. The UKPDS has reported that hypotensive treatment suppresses the onset and progression of retinopathy. The DIRECT Study that used candesartan, an ARB, is also well known. It examined candesartan’s effects of reducing the rate of onset of retinopathy, and of suppressing its progression, in type 1 diabetic patients. Candesartan suppressed the onset of retinopathy (HR 0.82, P = 0.0508) but did not slow its progression. Conversely, candesartan did not suppress the onset of retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients, but it significantly improved retinopathy (HR 1.34, P = 0.0091).

The fact that hypertension is a risk factor for neuropathy was reported in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) Study that observed, over a period of 6 years, 453 type 1 diabetic patients without neuropathy. Hypertension was the greatest risk factor for the onset of neuropathy, followed by the duration of diabetes, hyperglycemia, height, and smoking. Although this was a small-scale trial, using 41 type 1 or type 2 diabetics, it reported that a 12-month administration of trandolapril, an ACE inhibitor, significantly improved electrophysiological data such as a reduction in F-wave latency.

### Effects of aggressive blood pressure control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients on albuminuria, retinopathy and strokes [^9e3128af]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although several important studies have been performed in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, it is not known whether lowering blood pressure in normotensive (BP <140/90 mm Hg) patients offers any beneficial results on vascular complications. The current study evaluated the effect of intensive versus moderate diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control on diabetic vascular complications in 480 normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.

Methods

The current study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial in normotensive type 2 diabetic subjects. The subjects were randomized to intensive (10 mm Hg below the baseline DBP) versus moderate (80 to 89 mm Hg) DBP control. Patients in the moderate therapy group were given placebo, while the patients randomized to intensive therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril in a blinded manner as the initial antihypertensive medication. The primary end point evaluated was the change in creatinine clearance with the secondary endpoints consisting of change in urinary albumin excretion, progression of retinopathy and neuropathy and the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

Results

The mean follow-up was 5.3 years. Mean BP in the intensive group was 128 +/- 0.8/75 +/- 0.3 mm Hg versus 137 +/- 0.7/81 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the moderate group, P < 0.0001. Although no difference was demonstrated in creatinine clearance (P = 0.43), a lower percentage of patients in the intensive group progressed from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (P = 0.012) and microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria (P = 0.028). The intensive BP control group also demonstrated less progression of diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.019) and a lower incidence of strokes (P = 0.03). The results were the same whether enalapril or nisoldipine was used as the initial antihypertensive agent.

Conclusion

Over a five-year follow-up period, intensive (approximately 128/75 mm Hg) BP control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients: (1) slowed the progression to incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy; (2) decreased the progression of diabetic retinopathy; and (3) diminished the incidence of stroke.

### Diabetic nephropathy: diagnosis, prevention, and treatment [^95e1dec7]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of kidney disease in patients starting renal replacement therapy and affects approximately 40% of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of death, mainly from cardiovascular causes, and is defined by increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in the absence of other renal diseases. Diabetic nephropathy is categorized into stages: microalbuminuria (UAE >20 microg/min and < or =199 microg/min) and macroalbuminuria (UAE > or =200 microg/min). Hyperglycemia, increased blood pressure levels, and genetic predisposition are the main risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy. Elevated serum lipids, smoking habits, and the amount and origin of dietary protein also seem to play a role as risk factors. Screening for microalbuminuria should be performed yearly, starting 5 years after diagnosis in type 1 diabetes or earlier in the presence of puberty or poor metabolic control. In patients with type 2 diabetes, screening should be performed at diagnosis and yearly thereafter. Patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria should undergo an evaluation regarding the presence of comorbid associations, especially retinopathy and macrovascular disease. Achieving the best metabolic control (A1c <7%), treating hypertension (<130/80 mmHg or <125/75 mmHg if proteinuria >1.0 g/24 h and increased serum creatinine), using drugs with blockade effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and treating dyslipidemia (LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl) are effective strategies for preventing the development of microalbuminuria, in delaying the progression to more advanced stages of nephropathy and in reducing cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

In northern USA with good access to care, cumulative lifetime incidence of diabetic retinopathy for a person with type 1 diabetes was estimated at 90% in 1984 and for type 2 diabetes, approximately 50% (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). The risk seems to be decreasing over time, particularly in high-income countries, probably because of improved risk factor control and advances in diagnostics over the past 30 years (Sabanayagam et al, 2019 and 2016).

Several factors influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. Glycaemic control is a key factor, particularly in type 1 diabetes, and improved glycaemic control reduces the incident risk of diabetic retinopathy, progression, and sight loss (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] Group, 1998). Increasing duration of diabetes is another major determinant for diabetic retinopathy, with incident risk rising to more than 75% in those living with diabetes for more than 15 years (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). Hypertension is the third risk factor and might be more important in people with type 2 diabetes. Tight blood pressure control is thought to prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy, although its effect on diabetic retinopathy progression is less clear (UKPDS, 1998; Do et al, 2015). There appears to be genetic variation in diabetic retinopathy susceptibility, particularly among people with type 1 diabetes (Arar et al, 2008; Huang et al, 2011). Epigenetic factors might also be important in the pathophysiology (Kowluru et al, 2015).

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^47f17dae]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Although absolute risk varies as a spectrum among a group of individuals, the National Lipid Association (NLA) currently defines only two risk categories for patients with diabetes: very high risk and high risk. The very-high-risk category for diabetes includes not only secondary prevention patients (i.e. those with prior clinical ASCVD events) but also primary prevention patients with ≥2 other major risk factors: low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL [<1.04 mmol/L]), hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg) or on antihypertensive medication, smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in a male first-degree relative <55 years of age or in a female first-degree relative <65 years of age, age (men ≥45 years of age; women ≥55 years of age), or evidence of end-organ damage (albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g [>3.39 mg/mmol], CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73 m 2], or retinopathy). The high-risk category for diabetes includes primary prevention patients (i.e. no recognized prior clinical ASCVD events) with ≤1 other major ASCVD risk factor and no evidence of end-organ damage. While not defining lower limits for atherogenic cholesterol goals, for very-high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B, have treatment goals of <100 mg/dL [<2.59 mmol/L], <70 mg/dL [<1.81 mmol/L], and <80 mg/dL [<0.80 g/L], respectively. For high-risk patients with diabetes, the specific lipid targets of non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and apo B have treatment goals of <130 mg/dL [<3.37 mmol/L], <100 mg/dL [<2.59 mmol/L], and <90 mg/dL [<0.90 g/L], respectively. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) currently also describes only two categories of risk for patients with diabetes. Targeted atherogenic cholesterol particle goals (i.e. non-HDL-C, LDL-C, apo B) are similar to those of the NLA, with the added targeted LDL-P goal of <1000 nmol/L for very-high-risk and <1200 nmol/L for high-risk patients, consistent with the population percentile cut-points and equivalent to apo B <80 mg/dL [<0.80 g/L] and <90 mg/dL [0.9 g/L], respectively (Table 1). Recommendations for dyslipidemia management in diabetes, utilizing lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering agents (e.g. statins, possibly in combination with a fibrate, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, or ezetimibe) that target atherogenic cholesterol particles to specific goals determined by absolute risk, have recently been published.

### How and why SGLT2 inhibitors should be explored as potential treatment option in diabetic retinopathy: clinical concept and methodology [^719f106b]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients suffering from type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing classical microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, which represent a significant health burden. Tight control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol reduce the risk of microvascular complications but effective pharmacologically targeted treatment options for the treatment and prevention of diabetic microangiopathy are still lacking. Pharmacological inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) might have the potential to directly protect against microvascular complications and could represent a potential treatment option. Randomized controlled clinical proof of concept trials are needed to investigate a potential central role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the prevention of diabetic microangiopathy and its classical clinical complications of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.

### The hypertension in diabetes study (HDS): a catalyst for change [^bf597693]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hypertension is now established as a major risk factor for premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with Type 2 diabetes and all modern treatment guidelines recommend the routine treatment of hypertension in these patients. However, these developments have been relatively recent. Only a decade ago, outside of small studies in patients with nephropathy, there was little evidence with regard to the efficacy and safety of treating elevated blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes. Consequently, for many patients, elevated blood pressure remained undetected and untreated. This changed with the publication of the Hypertension in Diabetes Study (HDS) in 1998. This study revealed that hypertension was very common in people with Type 2 diabetes and demonstrated the dramatic benefits of blood pressure lowering in reducing their risk of major macrovascular and microvascular complications. The unequivocal evidence from this study provided a much-needed catalyst for change, propelling blood pressure measurement and its treatment to the forefront of risk management in these patients. Many studies have followed and many questions remain with regard to the preferred anti-hypertensive treatment strategy and optimal treatment targets for blood pressure. In the meantime, many millions of patients with Type 2 diabetes worldwide have benefited and will continue to benefit from the therapeutic insights gained from the treatment of blood pressure in the 1148 patients enrolled in the Hypertension in Diabetes Study in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study.

### Diabetic retinopathy in 2011: further insights from new epidemiological studies and clinical trials [^08cbca7a]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Zavrelova et al. also confirm the importance of blood pressure control on the developmental patterns of DR in this sample. In their article, systolic blood pressure (sBP) control appears to play a more important role than diastolic blood pressure, with the two progressive clusters (C and D) correlated with periods of deterioration in sBP ranging between 10–15 mmHg in these two groups. In contrast, at no time during the follow-up was there an increase in sBP exceeding 5 mmHg in clusters A and B. These findings indicate that large increments in sBP may impact on the progression of DR in type 2 patients, and they confirm previous reports that for each 10-mmHg increase in sBP, there is an approximately 10% excess risk of early DR and a 15% excess risk of proliferative retinopathy.

Data from new clinical trials, however, suggest that there is a limit to the effectiveness of blood pressure control in preventing DR. In contrast to the UKPDS, both the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) study and the ACCORD Eye trial did not find intensive blood pressure control to be useful in reducing the progression of DR. This could be related to a short follow-up time in the ACCORD Eye trial (∼5 years) compared with the 20-year follow-up of the UKPDS, where tighter blood pressure control reduced the risks of retinopathy progression by about one-third, visual loss by one-half, and the need for laser treatment by one-third in people with type 2 diabetes. It is also possible that the aggressive lower blood pressure targets set by the ACCORD Eye trial, i.e. sBP <120 mmHg (compared with <150 mmHg in the UKPDS), may indicate a floor effect to the benefits of lowering blood pressure below normal ranges.

### Action on diabetic macular oedema: achieving optimal patient management in treating visual impairment due to diabetic eye disease [^9196d7a1]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Another study by the UKPDS Group, involving hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and a median follow-up of 8.4 years, showed that tight blood pressure control (144/82 mm Hg) achieved a clinically important reduction in the risk of deaths related to diabetes, complications related to diabetes, progression of DR, and deterioration in visual acuity.After 9 years of follow-up, the group assigned to tight blood pressure control had a 47% reduced risk (7–70%, P =0.004) of deterioration in visual acuity by 3 or more lines on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart.

Ten-year non-interventional post-trial monitoring was undertaken to determine whether improved glucose control persisted and whether such therapy had a long-term effect on macrovascular outcomes. Results revealed a continued reduction in microvascular risk and emergent risk reductions for myocardial infarction and death from any cause in the patient group originally assigned to receive intensive glucose-lowering therapy.Relative risk reductions persisted at 10 years for microvascular disease (24%, P =0.001). This was despite an early loss of between-group differences in HbA1c levels after the first year of post-trial monitoring.

Multiple risk factor intervention for hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia

Sustained beneficial effects on vascular complications from intensive proactive multiple risk factor intervention was demonstrated in the Steno-2 Study, which involved 160 patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria.With a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, results show that the relative risk of developing kidney, eye, and nerve complications all remained diminished by about 50% for the intensively-treated group, treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, and glucose-lowering drugs. The impact of such an approach is highlighted by the fact that seven people in the conventional group became blind in one eye, compared with only one person in the group assigned to intensive therapy.

Patients in the Steno-2 Study were subsequently followed observationally for a mean of 5.5 years. The intensive goal-directed multifactorial intervention group demonstrated sustained beneficial effects with regard to vascular complications as well as all-cause and cardiovascular complications.

These data thus clearly illustrate the benefit of a proactive target driven multifactorial risk modification approach to optimising outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^f3e02ae1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In addition to duration of diabetes, other factors that increase the risk of, or are associated with, retinopathy include chronic hyperglycemia, the presence of nephropathy, and hypertension. Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to prevent and/or delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Lowering blood pressure has been shown to decrease the progression of retinopathy. Several case series and a controlled prospective study suggest that pregnancy in type 1 diabetic patients may aggravate retinopathy ; laser photocoagulation surgery can minimize this risk.

One of the main motivations for screening for diabetic retinopathy is the established efficacy of laser photocoagulation surgery in preventing vision loss. Two large trials, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), provide the strongest support for the therapeutic benefits of photocoagulation surgery.

The DRS showed that panretinal photocoagulation surgery reduced the risk of severe vision loss from PDR from 15.9% in untreated eyes to 6.4% in treated eyes. The benefit was greatest among patients whose baseline evaluation revealed high-risk characteristics (chiefly disc neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage). Given the risks of modest loss of visual acuity and contraction of the visual field from panretinal laser surgery, such therapy is primarily recommended for eyes with PDR approaching or having high-risk characteristics.

The ETDRS established the benefit of focal laser photocoagulation surgery in eyes with macular edema, particularly those with clinically significant macular edema, with reduction of doubling of the visual angle (e.g. 20/50–20/100) from 20% in untreated eyes to 8% in treated eyes. The ETDRS also verified the benefits of panretinal photocoagulation for high-risk PDR, but not for mild or moderate NPDR. In older-onset patients with severe NPDR or less-than-high-risk PDR, the risk of severe vision loss or vitrectomy was reduced 50% by early laser photocoagulation surgery at these stages.

### Rates of progression in diabetic retinopathy during different time periods: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4dbd81ac]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects more than 170 million individuals worldwide, and diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of visual impairment among working-age individuals. In the last 3 decades, a relative decline in rates of diabetic retinopathy has been suggested by some studies, (–) possibly reflecting improved patient and physician awareness, screening, and prevention, as well as better management of diabetes. In 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) demonstrated the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation. Systemic control of both hyperglycemia and hypertension was shown to be important in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in the 1990s. Findings from these trials, other studies, and clinical practice guidelines may have led to increased public awareness to diabetes risk factors and a shorter time from onset to diagnosis, potentially altering the rates of diabetic retinopathy progression.

Understanding the natural history of diabetic retinopathy is also important for estimating sample size for testing new interventions in clinical trials. Already, inadequate sample size estimations may have resulted in underpowered trials. Traditionally, progression rates from the ETDRS and the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) were used for sample size calculations (–). However, these studies were conducted almost 30 years ago. Contemporary estimates for diabetic retinopathy progression are clearly needed, some of which may, in part, be provided by more recent studies, such as the Daily-Dose Consensus Interferon and Ribavirin: Efficacy of Combined Therapy (DIRECT) trial.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarized the best available evidence to provide contemporary data on the clinical course of diabetic retinopathy and to examine potential differences in rates of diabetic retinopathy progression over time.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^8e3bf393]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prognosis and follow-up—diabetes and ocular complications: Disability and premature death are not inevitable consequences of diabetes, and lifestyle and behavioral modification and pharmacotherapy can delay progression to type 2 diabetes among persons with prediabetes; (Evidence Grade: A) however, all patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for the development of ocular-related complications, and adherence to treatment recommendations to maintain optimal control of blood glucose levels is a substantial factor in slowing the development and progression of complications of diabetes. Studies indicate that the rates of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and severe vision loss are substantially lower, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes, than reported thirty or more years ago, and these findings may be due to improvements in the management of risk factors (hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and overall diabetes care, along with earlier identification of diabetes.

### Pulse pressure is a stronger predictor than systolic blood pressure for severe eye diseases in diabetes mellitus [^0358d542]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PP is not only more strongly associated with incident DR but is a stronger predictor of severe DR than SBP, suggesting the importance of DBP in addition to SBP and the difficulty of administering antihypertensive treatments for prevention of severe DR leading to vision loss given the current lack of any therapy that exclusively targets PP. However, priority should be given to monitoring HbA1c for identifying patients at high risk of severe DR.

### Systemic considerations in the management of diabetic retinopathy [^563c0cb8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the systemic factors which affect onset and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to emphasize the role and responsibilities of ophthalmologists and other eye care providers to ensure that appropriate systemic medical evaluation of the patient with diabetes is being pursued.

Design

Literature review of publications relevant to diabetic retinopathy, blood glucose control, diabetes mellitus type, hypertension, renal disease, elevated serum lipids, exercise, pregnancy, anticoagulation, thrombolysis, smoking, anemia and antioxidant ingestion.

Findings

Intensive blood glucose control and control of systemic hypertension reduce the risk of new onset DR and slow the progression of existing DR. Severe DR may be an indicator of renal disease while severe renal disease and its treatment can affect the progression of DR. Elevated serum lipids are associated with macular exudate and moderate visual loss. Certain types of excessive exercise in patients with advanced stages of retinopathy may aggravate vitreous hemorrhage. During pregnancy, DR should be monitored closely as transient progression of DR can occur. Therapeutic anticoagulation and thrombolysis are not contraindicated at any stage of DR. Anemia can result in progression of DR, smoking in general should be discouraged, and the role of antioxidant therapy requires further study.

Conclusions

Blindness from diabetic retinopathy is now largely preventable with timely detection and appropriate interventional therapy. Routine, repetitive, lifelong, expert clinical retinal examination is essential for the fundamental ophthalmic care of the patient with diabetes. However, diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease and thus optimal ophthalmic care must include diligent evaluation and treatment of concomitant systemic disorders that influence the development, progression and ultimate outcome of diabetic retinopathy. Optimization of these systemic considerations through an intensive, multi-disciplinary, healthcare team-based approach will maximize the ophthalmic and general health of these patients. Ophthalmologists and other eye care providers are critical members of this team with unique responsibilities to ensure that appropriate systemic medical evaluation is being pursued.

We reviewed the records of all patients with NAION evaluated by the neuro-ophthalmology service between October 1990 and August 2009, after obtaining institutional review board approval. Criteria for NAION were similar to those used in past studies.

2 Patients were excluded if they had significant cataract, presumed toxic causes of NAION such as amiodarone hydrochloride or erectile dysfunction drug use, perioperative NAION, diabetic retinopathy, temporal arteritis, or other disorders that could cause the vision loss. A standardized comprehensive medical history and comprehensive neuro-ophthalmologic examination were obtained for all patients, including best-corrected visual acuity, Humphrey automated perimetry program 24-2 or 30-2 Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm fast results, and dilated ophthalmoscopy. Patients were classified as having DM with or without hypertension or not having DM with or without hypertension. Diabetes was identified if the patient had been diagnosed by the primary care physician as having DM or if the patient had been prescribed oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin prior to NAION. Patients with hypertension had been prescribed antihypertensive medications.

### Rationale, design, and methods of the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes eye study (ACCORD-EYE) [^9df5d6ef]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Eye Study (ACCORD-EYE), a prospective study of a subset of patients in the randomized controlled clinical ACCORD trial, is being conducted at enrollment and after 4 years of follow-up to assess the progression of DR with standardized comprehensive eye exams and fundus photography of 7 standard stereoscopic fields. This study aims to assess the effects of the ACCORD medical treatment strategies of tight control of glycemia and blood pressure and management of dyslipidemia on the course of DR in patients with type 2 diabetes. Photographs will be evaluated at a centralized location using the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classification. The primary outcome of ACCORD-EYE, which will measure the development and progression of DR, is a composite of (1) progression of DR (> or = 3 steps on the ETDRS scale), (2) photocoagulation for DR, or (3) vitrectomy for DR. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: (1) Does a therapeutic strategy targeting a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) level <6.0% reduce development and progression of DR more than one targeting an HbA(1c) level of 7.0%-7.9% (target median level, 7.5%)? (2) In the context of good glycemic control, does a strategy using a fibrate to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels and a statin to maintain the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at <2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) reduce development and progression of DR compared with one using placebo and a statin to treat LDL cholesterol? (3) In the context of good glycemic control, does a strategy targeting a systolic blood pressure level <120 mm Hg reduce development and progression of DR compared with one targeting a level <140 mm Hg? Secondary outcome variables include various levels of loss of visual acuity at 4 years versus baseline, cataract extraction, and the development or progression of diabetic macular edema. Methods to measure DR progression have been incorporated into ACCORD, and complete baseline data have been collected on 3,537 participants. These data will provide valuable information regarding the effects of medical treatment on the prevention and progression of DR.

### Could intensive blood pressure control really reduce diabetic retinopathy outcomes? Evidence from meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis from randomized controlled trials [^15c2e241]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The definition of incidence of DR is to have mild-to-severe non-proliferative DR or proliferative DR, which is a score on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) in individuals who had no DR signs at baseline. The definition of progression of DR is to a two-step or greater progression from baseline on the ETDRS final scale in individuals who had DR signs at baseline.

Statistics

We assessed the within- and between-study variation or heterogeneity by testing Cochran’s Q statistic. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I 2 metric, which was independent of the number of studies in the systematic review. The pooled OR was estimated using fixed effects (FE, Mantel and Haenszel) and random effects (RE, DerSimonian and Laird) models. When there was heterogeneity among studies, the pooled OR was estimated using the random effects model. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger’s regression test and Begg’s rank correlation test. Statistical manipulations were undertaken using STATA (version 13.0, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

Trial Sequential Analysis

We conducted the trial sequential analysis (TSA). Conventional meta-analysis had the risks of random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing. TSA adjusted the confidence intervals if data were sparse or repeatedly analyzed as a result of multiple updates to allow firm conclusions. Trial sequential monitoring boundaries were employed to control the risks for type I and II errors and to indicate whether additional trials were needed. For the required information size, we calculated the incidence in the control group from the actual meta-analyses. The intervention was able to reduce the relative risk by 15%. TSA was conducted with the intention to maintain an overall 5% risk of a type I error and a power of 80%. Meta-analysis will be updated by adding component studies sequentially in the order of publication. The β-spending function was constructed to indicate futility of the intervention. We used TSA version 0.9 beta (Copenhagen Trial Unit, 2011) for these analyses.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^bab7aee4]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets in diabetes—cardiovascular outcomes: there are differing conclusions regarding whether lowering systolic blood pressure to <130 mmHg is beneficial, and in the ACCORD Study lowering systolic blood pressure to <120 mmHg did not reduce cardiovascular events; several systematic reviews concluded that lowering systolic blood pressure below 130 mmHg does not add any further benefit. A more aggressive blood pressure goal (<130 mmHg) may be beneficial for those at higher risk for stroke; however, it may also result in an increased risk of serious adverse events including cardiovascular death, and one systematic review found strong support for lowering systolic blood pressures to <130 mmHg in individuals with cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, recommending a shift from rigid targets to risk-based targets.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^5830a65e]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Individualization of treatment goals—shared decision-making is advised to set person-specific blood pressure goals acknowledging uncertain and variable benefit–risk. People with diabetes and clinicians should engage in a shared decision-making process to determine individual blood pressure goals. This approach acknowledges that the benefits and risks of intensive blood pressure goals are uncertain and vary across individuals. Secondary analyses of ACCORD BP and SPRINT suggest that clinical factors can help identify individuals more likely to benefit from and less likely to be harmed by intensive blood pressure management. Among trials with lower baseline or attained blood pressure, antihypertensive treatment reduced stroke, retinopathy, and albuminuria, but effects on other ASCVD outcomes and heart failure were not evident. Absolute benefit from blood pressure reduction correlated with absolute baseline cardiovascular risk in SPRINT and earlier trials with higher baseline pressures.

### (pro) renin receptor: a treatment target for diabetic retinopathy? [^9d6028f8]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Many lines of evidence implicate the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. A recent multicenter trial showed that angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade (ARB) reduced the incidence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetic patients and improved the regression of retinal disease in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the failure of ARB to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy indicates a role for mechanisms additional to angiotensin II in its pathogenesis. In this issue of Diabetes, Satofuka et al. provide evidence that prorenin and the (pro)renin receptor, acting in part through mechanisms unrelated to angiotensin II, may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. This evidence holds promise for new therapies for diabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes.

Prorenin is a high–molecular weight biosynthetic precursor of renin. It has a low intrinsic activity of <2% of the activity of renin because it has an amino-terminal 43–amino acid prosegment that masks the active site, thereby preventing access by the renin substrate—angiotensinogen. Renal juxtaglomerular cells are the only known site of renin production, whereas the kidney and a number of extrarenal tissues including adrenal, ovary, testis, placenta, and retina produce prorenin (–). Plasma prorenin concentrations are ∼10- to 20-fold higher than those of renin. Prorenin concentrations in plasma and vitreous fluid are increased in diabetic subjects, and plasma prorenin is a powerful marker for both prevalent and incident microvascular complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.

Design and description of trials of aspirin therapy included in systematic review and meta-analysis

PHS: Physicians' Health Study, ETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, HOT: Hypertension Optimal Treatment, PPP: Primary Prevention Project, WHS: Women's' Health Study, POPADAD: Prevention and Progression of Arterial Disease and Diabetes Trial, JPAD: Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes, DM: diabetes, ASA: aspirin, RF: risk factor, CVD: cardiovascular disease, ABI: ankle brachial index, NR: data not reported, * patients and outcomes assessors, ## Patients were also randomly assigned to one of three diastolic blood pressure target groups, ** median, ***: ASA, control group median years, CV: cardiovascular, MI: myocardial infarction, CHD: coronary heart disease, PAD: peripheral arterial disease

A summary of study quality indicators is presented in Table 2. Randomization occurred in all seven studies, but the use of allocation concealment was clearly stated in only five of the trials [-,,,]. All seven studies had a Jadad score of three or greater. Intention-to-treat analysis was explicit in four trials and loss to follow-up was accounted for in all trials except one. Treatment in three studies was randomly assigned according to a 2 × 2 factorial design [-]. The WHS, PPP, and POPADAD trials also had a vitamin or anti-oxidant component. Two trials were open-labeled. None of the trials appeared to have substantial baseline differences between patients allocated to aspirin therapy versus the comparator-arm.
