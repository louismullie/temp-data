## Question

Nicotinic acid:

○ a. Should not be used in combination with cholestyramine resin
○ b. Can increase serum triglyceride levels
c. Can lower HDL levels
d. Reduces production of VLDL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly characterizes nicotinic acid (niacin) among four choices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action of niacin and its expected lipid effects. Then, I should verify the drug–drug interaction context, especially with bile acid sequestrants. Next, I will evaluate each option against mechanistic and guideline-level evidence. Finally, I will select the best answer and summarize why the alternatives are incorrect, ensuring consistency with authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. Niacin lowers triglycerides and LDL by decreasing hepatic VLDL production via multiple pathways: it partially inhibits adipose lipolysis to reduce hepatic fatty acid flux, directly inhibits DGAT2 in hepatocytes, and downregulates apoB-100 synthesis, which collectively lowers VLDL and downstream LDL; simultaneously, it increases HDL-C by increasing apoA-I production and reducing hepatic HDL holoparticle catabolism, and it lowers Lp(a) as well [^111cSRJx] [^114FFJZY] [^115GkTMe] [^116kr34R] [^114ghj8x].

> Wait, let me verify the claim that niacin "can increase serum triglyceride levels". Hold on, I should double-check that this would contradict the core mechanism. All mechanistic and clinical data show niacin lowers triglycerides by 20–50% depending on baseline and dose, primarily by reducing VLDL production, so stating it increases triglycerides is incorrect; in fact, it is among agents considered first-line when triglycerides are severely elevated to mitigate pancreatitis risk, which further argues against a triglyceride-raising effect [^111cSRJx] [^1135ETkY] [^112rpny1].

> Next, I should review whether niacin can lower HDL. Let me think about this carefully. Niacin is consistently described as the most potent agent for raising HDL-C, typically increasing it by about 15–35% through increased apoA-I production and slowed HDL catabolism; thus, an option claiming niacin lowers HDL is mechanistically and clinically incompatible with established effects and with guideline summaries of its pharmacodynamics [^115GkTMe] [^114FFJZY] [^116kr34R].

> I will now examine the claim that niacin should not be used with cholestyramine resin. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether there is a contraindication or instead historical evidence of combination use. Niacin has been used safely with bile acid sequestrants, including cholestyramine/colestipol, to achieve additive LDL-C lowering; the classic CLAS and FATS programs used niacin plus colestipol and showed substantial LDL-C reductions and regression, and contemporary lipid guidelines still list niacin among combination options for patients not at LDL-C or non–HDL-C goals, without a prohibition against sequestrants; if anything, some bile acid sequestrants can worsen triglycerides, which is a different issue than an interaction with niacin [^111cSRJx] [^111vtyEB] [^112ZF27Q] [^113uYkco].

> Let me consider option d, that niacin reduces VLDL production. I should confirm that this aligns with both mechanistic and clinical kinetic data. Multiple independent sources indicate niacin decreases hepatic VLDL synthesis and secretion via reduced fatty acid delivery to liver, DGAT2 inhibition, and decreased apoB-100 production, with tracer studies demonstrating reductions in VLDL-apoB production and VLDL-TG secretion; clinically, this translates into robust triglyceride lowering, supporting the correctness of this statement [^111cSRJx] [^114FFJZY] [^115GkTMe] [^1139Lu4g] [^116BeyKz].

> Putting this together, options a, b, and c are incorrect: niacin can be combined with bile acid sequestrants and has supportive historical and guideline precedent, it lowers rather than raises triglycerides, and it increases rather than decreases HDL-C; the accurate statement is that nicotinic acid reduces the production of VLDL, which mechanistically explains its triglyceride-lowering effect and downstream LDL-C reduction [^111cSRJx] [^111vtyEB] [^112ZF27Q] [^11245Zxk].

> Final answer: d. Reduces production of VLDL.

---

The correct answer is **d. Reduces production of VLDL**. Nicotinic acid (niacin) **lowers triglycerides by decreasing hepatic VLDL synthesis** via inhibition of DGAT2 and reduced free fatty acid flux, and it also increases HDL by slowing hepatic HDL clearance [^112Qh3j6] [^115GkTMe] [^114FFJZY]. Options a, b, and c are incorrect: niacin can be combined with cholestyramine, it lowers (not raises) triglycerides, and it increases (not lowers) HDL [^111cSRJx] [^111vtyEB] [^115Y3Ygp].

## Mechanism of action of nicotinic acid

Nicotinic acid exerts its lipid-modifying effects through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Inhibition of hepatic VLDL synthesis**: Nicotinic acid inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2), a key enzyme in triglyceride synthesis, thereby reducing hepatic production of VLDL particles [^112Qh3j6] [^115GkTMe].

- **Reduction of free fatty acid flux**: Nicotinic acid partially inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue, decreasing free fatty acid release and subsequently reducing hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production [^111tqkQH] [^112Qh3j6].

- **Increased HDL cholesterol**: Nicotinic acid slows hepatic clearance of HDL apolipoprotein A-I, thereby increasing HDL cholesterol levels [^115GkTMe] [^114FFJZY].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting option d

Multiple clinical studies and reviews consistently demonstrate that nicotinic acid **reduces VLDL production**, leading to significant reductions in triglyceride levels [^112Qh3j6] [^116BeyKz]. For example, a study in obese individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease showed that extended-release niacin **significantly decreased VLDL-triglyceride secretion** without affecting clearance, indicating reduced hepatic VLDL production [^116BeyKz]. Another study in patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that extended-release niacin **reduced VLDL-apoB-100 production** and plasma concentrations, further supporting its role in decreasing VLDL production [^1139Lu4g].

---

## Clinical implications of reduced VLDL production

The reduction in VLDL production by nicotinic acid has **important clinical implications**:

- **Lower triglyceride levels**: Reduced VLDL production directly translates to lower plasma triglyceride levels, which is beneficial for patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^116BeyKz].

- **Improved lipid profile**: By lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol, nicotinic acid improves the overall lipid profile, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk [^116xZo9T].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Nicotinic acid is often used adjunctively with other lipid-lowering agents, such as statins, to achieve comprehensive lipid control [^113uYkco].

---

## Evaluation of other options

### Option a: Should not be used in combination with cholestyramine resin

This statement is **incorrect**. Nicotinic acid can be safely combined with bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine, and such combinations have been used clinically to enhance lipid-lowering effects [^111vtyEB] [^111cSRJx].

---

### Option b: Can increase serum triglyceride levels

This statement is **incorrect**. Nicotinic acid **significantly lowers triglyceride levels** by reducing hepatic VLDL production, and there is no evidence that it increases triglyceride levels [^116kr34R] [^112Qh3j6].

---

### Option c: Can lower HDL levels

This statement is **incorrect**. Nicotinic acid is well known for its ability to **increase HDL cholesterol levels** by slowing hepatic clearance of HDL apolipoprotein A-I [^115Hh5s4] [^114FFJZY].

---

Nicotinic acid **reduces VLDL production** by inhibiting hepatic triglyceride synthesis and decreasing free fatty acid flux, thereby lowering triglyceride levels and improving the lipid profile [^115GkTMe] [^111tqkQH].

### Mechanism of action of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta agonist on lipoprotein metabolism in dyslipidemic subjects with central obesity [^116MCG6J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Dyslipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in obesity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-δ agonists decrease plasma triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in humans.

Objective

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of GW501516, a PPAR-δ agonist, on lipoprotein metabolism. Design, Setting, and Intervention: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 6-wk intervention periods with placebo or GW501516 (2.5 mg/d), with 2-wk placebo washout between treatment periods.

Participants

We recruited 13 dyslipidemic men with central obesity from the general community.

Main Outcome Measures

We measured the kinetics of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-, intermediate-density lipoprotein-, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apolipoprotein (apo) B-100, plasma apoC-III, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (LpA-I and LpA-I:A-II).

Results

GW501516 decreased plasma triglycerides, fatty acid, apoB-100, and apoB-48 concentrations. GW501516 decreased the concentrations of VLDL-apoB by increasing its fractional catabolism and of apoC-III by decreasing its production rate (P < 0.05). GW501516 reduced VLDL-to-LDL conversion and LDL-apoB production. GW501516 increased HDL-cholesterol, apoA-II, and LpA-I:A-II concentrations by increasing apoA-II and LpA-I:A-II production (P < 0.05). GW501516 decreased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, and this was paralleled by falls in the triglyceride content of VLDL, LDL, and HDL and the cholesterol content of VLDL and LDL.

Conclusions

GW501516 increased the hepatic removal of VLDL particles, which might have resulted from decreased apoC-III concentration. GW501516 increased apoA-II production, resulting in an increased concentration of LpA-I:A-II particles. This study elucidates the mechanism of action of this PPAR-δ agonist on lipoprotein metabolism and supports its potential use in treating dyslipidemia in obesity.

Fibric acid derivatives

Fibrate therapy with Fenofibrate or Gemfibrozil can decrease TGs by reducing the production of VLDL-C, and increasing LPL activity through activation of PPARα. Their main reduction effect is on VLDL-C, but have a little beneficial effect on LDL-C. They can decrease TGs by 40%, increase HDL-C by 10%, and enhance the formation of large less dense LDL-particles. They can increase the risk of pancreatitis in patients with normal or mildly elevated TGs level, bile stones, and myopathy.

Nicotinic acid

The most inexpensive drug of this group is niacin that can reduce TGs by reduction of VLDL-C production through binding to G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 109A and inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase activity. Niacin can directly inhibit hepatic diacylglycerol acyl transferase (DGAT-2) which is the key enzyme in TGs synthesis. This group can reduce TGs by 30–40%, TChol and LDL-C by 15–30%, and lipoprotein by 40%, and increase HDL-C by 15–25%. Their adverse effects are flashing, hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity, and gout.

Intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor

Zetimibe is the first drug that can prevent absorption of TChol in entrocytes through uncertain mechanism. It can reduce LDL-C levels in a sole administration by 15–20%, but it is mostly recommended to be consumed in combination with statins which can further reduce LDL-C. However, there are ongoing researches in the assessment of the combination form of Zetimibe with statin.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Lovoza (Omacor®) is a fish oil supplement that contains Eicosapentaenoic acid/Docosahexaenoic acid (EPA/DHA). It is effective on hypertriglyceridemia via reduction of VLDL-C production, but in the U.S. A, it is only recommended in TGs level higher than 500 mg/dl. In patients with TGs level of 200–500 mg/dl, it can reduce TGs by 20 to 50%, depending on baseline level, decrease VLDL-C by 40%, minimally increase HDL-C, and increase LDL-C secondary to conversion of VLDL-C to LDL-C. Its most commonly reported adverse effect is an increase in the susceptibility to bleeding while consumed with anti-coagulant drugs.

### CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibition with anacetrapib decreases production of lipoprotein (a) in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects [^115zjidQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

CETP inhibition does alter VLDL core lipid composition, with triglyceride (TG) enrichment resulting from the lack of exchange with HDL cholesteryl ester (CE), and TG-enriched VLDL (often referred to as VLDL1) may be removed directly by the liver more than normal TG. If apo(a) at the surface of the liver binds to a TG-rich lipoprotein such as newly secreted VLDL that, as a result of CETP inhibition, is removed by the liver directly without conversion to more dense lipoproteins, which could result in a fall in the PR of the mature Lp(a) that we isolated at density: 1.019 to 1.210 g/mL. Although we previously reported that anacetrapib treatment increased the FCRs of both VLDL and IDL apoB, the conversion of VLDL to LDL was ≈90% during both placebo and anacetrapib treatment periods. Thus, it is unlikely that greater hepatic clearance of a TG-rich Lp(a) precursor during anacetrapib administration accounted for the reduction in Lp(a) PR that we observed. In addition, we determined the FCR of apo(a) in the VLDL/IDL fraction in our subjects, and it was similar to the FCR of apo(a) in the LDL/HDL (data not shown). Because 90% of Lp(a) is in the LDL/HDL density range, a small VLDL/IDL Lp(a) pool with an FCR similar to that of Lp(a) in the much larger LDL/HDL density range could not be a significant precursor to the latter. At present, we do not have a clear explanation for the reduction in Lp(a) PR that we observed during inhibition of CETP activity with anacetrapib. Additional studies in cells or rodent models that have been modified to produce Lp(a) should be conducted to examine the mechanisms whereby CETP inhibition, estrogen treatment, and niacin therapy all reduce Lp(a) production.

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: pathophysiological, genetic, and therapeutic insights: a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel [^114mZdVX]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Individuals with plasma TG in the range 0.85–1.7 mmol/L (75–150 mg/dL) release VLDL1 and VLDL2 from the liver, which are delipidated rapidly to IDL and then principally to LDL of medium size;, thus, the LDL profile is dominated by LDL-II (Figure 2A). In contrast, people with low plasma TG levels (< 0.85 mmoL/L or 75 mg/dL) have highly active lipolysis and generally low hepatic TG content. Consequently, hepatic VLDL tend to be smaller and indeed some IDL/LDL-sized particles are directly released from the liver. The LDL profile displays a higher proportion of larger LDL-I (Figure 2 B) and is associated with a healthy state (as in young women). However, this pattern is also seen with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), in which LDL levels are high, because of overproduction of small VLDL and reduced LDL clearance due to low receptor numbers. Finally, formation of small dense LDL is favoured when plasma TG levels exceed 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), and especially at levels > 2.23 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) due to VLDL overproduction (as in insulin-resistant states, such as Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome), and potentially when lipolysis is defective due to high apoC-III content [which inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) action and possibly VLDL particle clearance]. An LDL subfraction profile in which small particles predominate (Figure 2 C) is part of an atherogenic dyslipidaemia in which remnant lipoproteins are also abundant. As particle size decreases and the conformation of apoB100 is altered, LDL receptor binding affinity is attenuated, resulting in a prolonged residence time in plasma (Box).

### Novel therapeutic targets and agents for pediatric dyslipidemia [^116UQRf9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor: lomitapide

In 2012 lomitapide became the first MTP inhibitor approved by the FDA for HoFH as an adjunct to diet and other lipid-lowering therapies.

Mechanism: Lomitapide works through the inhibition of MTP in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and enterocytes (Figure 3). MTP is required for assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the intestines (chylomicrons) and liver (VLDL). Following hepatic excretion, VLDL is converted to LDL in the circulation. Reduction in VLDL leads to decrease substrate for conversion to LDLand a decrease in measured LDL-C concentration.

Figure 3.
The mechanism of action of lomitapide. MTP is required for assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the liver (apoB100) and intestine (apoB48). After production in the liver, VLDL is released into the plasma, where the TG content of the VLDL is hydrolyzed into free fatty acids, eventually forming LDL. By inhibiting MTP, lomitapide reduces the production and release of VLDL and LDL levels in plasma while at the same time reducing TG levels by reducing intestinal chylomicron formation.

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: pathophysiological, genetic, and therapeutic insights: a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel [^116P3e4w]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Model of the metabolic interrelationships between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions and their hepatic precursors. The liver produces apolipoprotein (apo)B100-containing particles ranging in size from large triglyceride (TG)-rich very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1, through small VLDL2 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) to LDL. The hepatic TG content (TG pool) affects the profile of the secreted particles. Secreted VLDL undergoes lipolysis and remodelling to form remnants/IDL; LDL is then formed via the actions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hepatic lipase (HL), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). (A) In people with population average TG levels, about half the lipolytic remnants (which correspond to IDL based on density and size) in this pathway are cleared relatively efficiently and the remainder are converted mainly to LDL-II, which has higher LDL receptor affinity and shorter residence time than the LDL arising from VLDL1. The composition of IDL-derived LDL is modulated both by CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters (CE) from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and by CETP-mediated transfer of TG from VLDL and their remnants. (B) In individuals with low plasma TG, LDL-I and -II predominate. Clearance of these lipoproteins is rapid and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB concentrations are low. (C) Individuals with elevated plasma TG levels overproduce VLDL1 and have reduced lipolysis rates due in part to inhibition of LPL activity by their abundant content of apoC-III, an LPL inhibitor. Very low-density lipoprotein 1 remodelling gives rise to remnants within the VLDL size range that are enriched in apoE; such circulating remnants can be removed by several mechanisms, primarily in the liver, including the LDL receptor-related protein, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and LDL receptor. Hepatic clearance of VLDL1-derived remnant particles may, however, be slowed by enrichment with apoC-III. Very low-density lipoprotein 1 and VLDL2 are targeted by CETP, which exchanges core CE in LDL for TG in both VLDL1 and VLDL2. Hydrolysis of TG by HL action then shrinks LDL particles to preferentially form small, dense LDL-III in moderate hypertriglyceridaemia, or even smaller LDL-IV in severe hypertriglyceridaemia; such small dense LDL exhibit attenuated binding affinity for the LDL receptor, resulting in prolonged plasma residence (Box). Together, this constellation of lipoprotein changes, originating in increased levels of large VLDL1 and small dense LDL, represents a lipid phenotype designated atherogenic dyslipidaemia, a key feature of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. Typical LDL subfraction patterns are indicated together with relevant plasma lipid and apoB levels. Note that when small dense LDL is abundant, apoB is elevated more than LDL-C. The width of the red arrows reflects the quantity of apoB/particle production and release from the liver, while the width of the blue arrows depicts relative lipolytic efficiency.

### New dimension of statin action on apoB atherogenicity [^115xhncc]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Newer, more effective statins are powerful agents for reducing elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and thereby lowering the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related adverse events. Although LDL remains the primary target of therapy for reducing CHD risk, increased interest is focusing on apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoprotein subfractions — particularly very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). VLDL remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) — as secondary targets of therapy. Elevated apoB is known to be an important risk factor for CHD, and dysregulation of the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins is involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Statins reduce circulating concentrations of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins by decreasing the production of VLDL in the liver and, thus, the production of VLDL remnants and LDL. Statins also increase the clearance of these particles through upregulation of LDL receptors in the liver. Efforts to develop statins with enhanced lipid-modifying properties are ongoing. The optimal statin would offer a high degree of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a prolonged duration of action, hepatic selectivity for maximal upregulation of LDL receptors, and a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Recent studies have shown that rosuvastatin, a new agent in this class, demonstrates these qualities. Rosuvastatin is a highly effective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, is relatively nonlipophilic, has a half-life of approximately 20 h, exhibits hepatic selectivity, has little systemic availability, and has a low potential for drug-drug interactions because of its limited degree of metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system. A recent double-blind, crossover study revealed that treatment with rosuvastatin resulted in marked reductions in apoB-containing lipoproteins in patients with type IIa or IIb dyslipidemia. By reducing the number of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, rosuvastatin decreases the atherosclerotic burden in hyperlipidemic patients at high risk for CHD and related adverse outcomes.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: at the heart of the action of lipid-modulating therapy with statins, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors [^114FFJZY]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Niacin

The broad spectrum action and efficacy of niacin (nicotinic acid; vitamin B3) in markedly lowering elevated concentrations of TG-rich lipoproteins, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a), together with its capacity to raise HDL-C, are especially notable. Indeed, niacin is presently the most effective agent available for raising HDL-C, typically increasing levels by up to 30% on a dose-dependent basis. The clinical benefits associated with niacin treatment, both as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, feature attenuation of atherosclerosis progression and/or induction of plaque regression in addition to reduction in cardiovascular risk, and have been reviewed elsewhere. The mechanisms underlying the action of niacin in reducing plasma VLDL, LDL, and apoB levels in vivo involve enhanced clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins containing either apoB100 or B48, although evidence is equally available to support decreased rates of VLDL production; such discrepancies may depend upon the metabolic background. Only recently has attention been focused on delineating the mechanisms which underlie the HDL-raising action of niacin. Four key processes are considered to contribute to niacin-mediated elevation in apoA-I and HDL-C levels: (i) up-regulation of apoA-I production rate (+24%) relative to placebo without change in fractional catabolic rate, with no change in either the concentration of or kinetic parameters for apoA-II; (ii) the ability of niacin to exert transient inhibition of hormone-sensitive TG lipase in adipose tissue and attenuate liberation of free fatty acids via TG lipolysis, with consequent reduction in hepatic VLDL-TG production, plasma VLDL levels, and thence in CETP-mediated depletion of HDL-CE; (iii) reduction in plasma CETP activity as a result of the combined effect of reduction in hepatic CETP gene expression, plasma CETP mass, and numbers of apoB-containing acceptor particles available for HDL-CE (see below);, and (iv) reduction in the hepatic uptake of HDL, potentially by the holo-particle uptake pathway. Considered together, these processes would feasibly increase the plasma residence time of HDL and apoA-I and thus increase HDL-C levels. Such action is entirely consistent with recent findings in low HDL-C human subjects with established CAD who were treated with a niacin/statin combination, and in whom abnormalities in the HDL proteome were partially reversed. Finally, the potential role of niacin in enhancing cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 from macrophages to HDL acceptors, with positive impact on HDL-C levels, cannot be excluded. The above observations concur to place CETP firmly at the centre of the processes mediated by niacin treatment which directly lead to efficacious elevation of both HDL-C and apoA-I.

### Effects of dietary fats on blood lipids: a review of direct comparison trials [^112KRrz9]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Besides decreasing sdLDL and postprandial TG levels, fish oil has been found to lower the concentrations of medium and small VLDLs, which may be more atherogenic compared with larger VLDL. In fact, it has been suggested that if VLDL penetrates into the subendothelium, which is more likely to occur with smaller VLDL particles, it is even more atherogenic than LDL as it delivers a larger oxidative load. By reducing VLDL concentrations and increasing VLDL particle size, fish oil likely reduces the number of VLDL particles that penetrate and oxidise in the subendothelium. This benefit also likely occurs with LDL since fish oil increases LDL size and reduces its density. Finally, the Agency for Health Research and Quality systematic review found that in general omega-3s increase HDL by 3–5 mg/dL, whereas omega-6 PUFA decreases HDL. Boxs 4 and 5 summarise the beneficial effects of DHA and EPA on lipids, whereas box 6 summarises the benefits of DHA versus EPA.

### Lovastatin [^1161VJuj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

The involvement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in atherogenesis has been well-documented in clinical and pathological studies, as well as in many animal experiments. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that high LDL-C and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are both associated with coronary heart disease. However, the risk of developing coronary heart disease is continuous and graded over the range of cholesterol levels and many coronary events do occur in patients with total cholesterol (total-C) and LDL-C in the lower end of this range.

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. LDL is formed from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and is catabolized predominantly by the high affinity LDL receptor. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of lovastatin may involve both reduction of VLDL-C concentration, and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL-C. Apolipoprotein B also falls during treatment with lovastatin.

Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111H9u15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia risk rationale — In randomized controlled trials, each reduction of 1% in LDL-C or non-HDL-C is associated with a 1% reduction in coronary heart disease event risk over a period of ~5 years, and genetic variants generally show that each 1% difference in LDL-C is associated with a 2–3% difference in CHD risk; results from intervention studies lasting only ~ 5 years likely underestimate the potential benefit of decades-long exposure to lower levels of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol. In the Copenhagen Heart Studies, each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in LDL-C was associated with a 47% difference in CHD event risk, whereas each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in VLDL-C was associated with a CHD risk difference of 182%, supporting the importance of both LDL-C and non-HDL-C as targets of therapy.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^114bM7cy]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Reduced HDL-C and obesity — the contributors and mechanisms are outlined, noting that blood levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are largely determined by individual genetics and that common causes accompanying obesity include ultra-processed foods containing refined simple sugars and physical inactivity. In obesity, adiposopathic reduction in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity impairs metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons, and obesity may facilitate greater cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediated transfer of cholesterol from HDL particles to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in exchange for triglycerides, leading to hepatic lipase lipolysis of triglyceride-rich HDL particles into smaller HDL particles that are more easily metabolized by the liver and kidneys, resulting in reduced blood HDL-C levels. Endocrine changes in obesity further lower HDL-C, as increased leptin levels increase CETP activity and reduced adiponectin levels remove adiponectin's effects of increasing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) production and hepatic adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette sub-family member 1 (ABCA1), which mediates transfer of cellular phospholipid and free cholesterol to apoA-I; thus, decreased adiponectin would be expected to decrease blood HDL-C levels. Adiposopathic promotion of insulin resistance may also reduce apoA-I production, and adipocyte inflammation may downregulate ABCA1 and scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI) expression, impairing cholesterol efflux from adipocytes to HDL particles.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Individuals with T2DM often have elevated levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides (TGs), and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which further increase their cardiovascular risk. Mixed dyslipidaemia is commonly associated with insulin resistance, which accounts for increased hepatic production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), enhanced intestinal production of chylomicrons, and reduced hepatic clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL). The management of mixed dyslipidaemia is a persistent challenge in clinical practice.

The relationship between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk is well established. However, non-HDL-C, which can easily be calculated from a routine lipid panel by subtracting HDL-C from total cholesterol (TC), is considered a better predictor of cardiovascular risk, particularly in individuals with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia. Non-HDL-C has been proposed as a therapeutic target for mixed dyslipidaemia since it encompasses all circulating atherogenic cholesterol carried by apolipoprotein (Apo) B-containing lipoprotein particles, like TRL, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. The National Lipid Association recommendations indicate non-HDL-C as a co-primary, but superior, treatment target with LDL-C. Recent European guidelines recommend non-HDL-C as a practical alternative treatment target. However, the effect of novel lipid-lowering treatments on this parameter is still poorly studied.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^113SJaBS]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Atherogenic lipoprotein burden and cardiovascular risk — evidence base and therapeutic target markers — shows a log-linear relationship between elevated circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particles and adverse cardiovascular event risk, with the strength of this relationship increasing with greater duration of exposure. Adverse cardiovascular event risk is lowered by reduction of the plasma atherogenic lipoprotein level, with benefit proportionate to both the degree of reduction and the length of time that a lower level is maintained, and this benefit appears to be independent of the mechanism of reduction provided there are no deleterious off-target effects. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the most frequently used surrogate for atherogenic lipoprotein concentration, although non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) have been found to be stronger and more consistent indicators of ASCVD risk; adjustment for Apo B reduces the associations of both LDL-C and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) to non-significance, consistent with the view that lowering the concentration of all Apo B-containing lipoproteins should be the main focus of therapeutic strategies.

### Profound reductions in first and total cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl in the REDUCE-IT trial: why these results usher in a new era in dyslipidaemia therapeutics [^112ZffAb]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride levels in plasma may be influenced by multiple genes as well as environmental factors. Several genetic studies have likewise shown that genetically lower TG irrespective of the mechanism results in a lower risk of incident ASCVD events. In contrast, there was no association observed with genetically lower levels of HDL-C and incident ASCVD event rates. In another recent, very large Mendelian randomization study involving 654 783 participants, TG were shown to be an independent causal factor for ASCVD, with an effect that seemed to be modulated by ApoB100 levels. This latter finding likely reflects the fact that TG are carried in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and VLDL remnants, such as small VLDL particles and intermediate-density lipoproteins, all of which contain ApoB100. Triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins correlate highly with increased risk for ASCVD events. In addition to their TG cargo, remnant lipoproteins may be proatherogenic because they also carry cholesterol and are proinflammatory. Multiple prior placebo-controlled trials in the statin era, which tested the co-administration of fibrates or niacin, have failed to demonstrate incremental ASCVD event reduction after 'optimally controlled' LDL-C levels have been achieved with statins. Notably, therapies such as fibrates (in particular gemfibrozil) and niacin also lower LDL-C and ApoB with benefits proportional to the reductions in ApoB.

### Effects of PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab on lipoprotein metabolism in healthy humans [^113hNaxd]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Reductions in IDL- and LDL-apoB concentrations were caused by increases in the mean FCRs of these lipoproteins (46.1%, P < 0.001 and 80.4%, P ≤ 0.0001, respectively) (Figure 1). No significant change occurred in the mean VLDL-apoB FCR during alirocumab administration. In addition to the marked increase in LDL-apoB FCR, mean LDL-apoB PR was reduced by 23.9% (P < 0.0001). The decrease in the PR of LDL-apoB was caused by the significant increase in the FCR of IDL-apoB noted earlier coupled with a mean 27.2% decrease in the conversion of IDL-apoB to LDL-apoB (P < 0.005). No significant changes were found in the mean VLDL- or IDL-apoB PRs. Consistent with alirocumab lack of effects on VLDL-TG levels or VLDL-apoB metabolism, no changes occurred in mean FCR or PR of VLDL-TG (Figure 2).

Effects of alirocumab on VLDL-, IDL-, and LDL–apoB fractional clearance rates (A) and production rates (B). FCRs of VLDL, IDL, and LDL-apoB (mean ± SE) were determined by stable isotopic enrichment of apoB in each lipoproteins. PRs (mean ± SE) were calculated using the FCRs and plasma pool size of apoB in each lipoprotein. Alirocumab treatment significantly increased the FCRs of IDL and LDL apoB and reduced the PR of LDL apoB compared with placebo. No significant effects of alirocumab on VLDL apoB metabolism were found. apoB indicates apolipoprotein B; FCR, fractional clearance rate; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; ns, not significant; PR, production rate; SE, standard error; and VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: at the heart of the action of lipid-modulating therapy with statins, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors [^111ocURv]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Statins

In all common forms of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, notably hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, therapy to attenuate atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk is firmly focused on marked reduction of circulating concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, and remnants) with inhibitors of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, i.e. statins. A number of clinical trials have however revealed that statins typically induce modest and sustained elevation in HDL-C of up to 16%;, most frequently, such elevations are in the range of 5–10% as revealed in the recent VOYAGER meta-analysis. The mechanism(s) underlying the statin-mediated increase in HDL-C is unclear, but appears to be multiple. Significantly, both in vitro and in vivo studies, in addition to post hoc analyses from large statin-related outcomes studies, have identified key factors which may contribute to the HDL response and facilitate deduction of putative mechanisms. In sum, these studies have revealed that statins reduce supranormal rates of endogenous CETP-mediated CE transfer from HDL to atherogenic particles in dyslipidaemic subjects. This effect, whether in normolipidaemic or dyslipidaemic subjects, or in animal models, involves several mechanisms which include reduction in the number of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles available to accept CE from HDL, and down-regulation of hepatic CETP mRNA expression with subsequent reduction of circulating plasma CETP concentration. As the absolute degree of reduction in baseline levels of apoB-containing particles by statins is largely dose-dependent for each statin, it is predictable that incremental statin-mediated reduction in atherogenic lipoprotein acceptor levels drives concomitant reduction in CETP activity (Table 1). Thus, the most potent statin, rosuvastatin, at its highest dose (40 mg/day), induced decrements of 12 and 59%, respectively, in CETP activity in hypercholesterolaemic and in mixed dyslipidaemic subjects, together with reductions in plasma CETP mass of 33–37%. The superior reduction in CETP activity seen in mixed dyslipidaemia reflects potent reduction in TG-rich lipoproteins, notably the VLDL1 subfraction (–46%), the most avid CE acceptor particle. Indeed, earlier studies with atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in a similar mixed lipid phenotype revealed that decrease in CETP activity was significantly correlated with statin-mediated reduction in VLDL1 levels. Clearly then, the effects of statins on lipoprotein profile and CETP activity are intimately related and are at least in part dependent on baseline lipid phenotype. Statins equally appear to moderately enhance hepatic apoA-I production (10–15%) and reduce CETP gene expression by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver; the cholesterol response element in the promoter of the CETP gene presumably underlies this latter effect. Finally, statin-induced increase in HDL-C may in part be attributable to enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α activity, which may stimulate both hepatic apoA-I synthesis and HDL formation.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: at the heart of the action of lipid-modulating therapy with statins, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors [^115PnTPF]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Fibrates

Early prospective trials of fibrates and of niacin promoted the concept that raising HDL-C levels by therapeutic means – would translate into clinical benefit in dyslipidaemic patients at high cardiovascular risk.

Fibrates are a chemically heterogeneous class of agents, among which the most widely clinically used, fenofibrate, is primarily a PPARα-agonist of moderate affinity. Fibrates bind to PPARα by mimicking the structure of free fatty acidsand may increase HDL-C by up to 20% as a function of baseline lipid phenotype. Fibrates appear to increase HDL-C levels in part by reducing plasma CETP activity, an action associated primarily with the potent ability of these agents to lower levels of TG-rich acceptor lipoproteins for CE, mainly VLDL, in both the fasting and post-prandial phases, (Table 1). The capacity of fibrates to reduce (endogenous) plasma CETP concentration by up to −26% in patients with mixed dyslipidaemiaappears related at least in part to CETP gene expression, suggesting that fibrates may modulate CETP gene expression through activation of PPARα. Reduction in VLDL, and specifically in the VLDL1 subfraction, following treatment with fenofibrate or ciprofibrate in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia was associated with a significant decrease (up to –35%) in the CETP-mediated transfer and targeting of CE from HDL to these particles. Reduction in the CETP-mediated flux of CE from HDL to VLDL therefore represents a common feature of the impact of statins and fibrates on the perturbed intravascular cholesterol metabolism characteristic of mixed dyslipidaemia.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^112Vbqxj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia — mechanisms emphasize hepatic overproduction and impaired clearance: "In mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, there is typically overproduction of VLDL-TG by the liver". This is "often driven by excessive exposure of hepatocytes to free fatty acids", including from expanded abdominal/visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance. With high VLDL-TG production, VLDL particles are "enriched with Apo C3 and are Apo E deficient", leading to "impairment of TG clearance by LPL due to inhibition of LPL activity by Apo C3" and reduced hepatic uptake of remnants; consequently, "in most patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia, increased VLDL-TG output by the liver and impaired TG clearance are contributing factors".

### RNA interference targeting ANGPTL3 for triglyceride and cholesterol lowering: phase 1 basket trial cohorts [^116kZauL]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

ARO-ANG3 showed durable pharmacologic effects lasting over 3 months after a single dose. This is a consequence of the unique intracellular mechanism of action of RNAi. After hepatic uptake of ARO-ANG3 and cleavage of its passenger RNA strand, the guide strand loads onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and pairs with and degrades the ANGPTL3 mRNA, reducing protein synthesis. RISC effectuates a catalytic process that prolongs the RNAi effect, providing a durable treatment response.

Inherited deficiency in ANGPTL3 yields lower serum TG, LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations and is independently protective against coronary disease. The lipid changes induced by ARO-ANG3 phenocopy ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations. The therapeutic mechanism behind ANGPTL3 inhibition has been partially elucidated. By inhibiting hepatic ANGPTL3 synthesis, ARO-ANG3 enhances LPL activity, which lowers circulating TG levels through hydrolysis of TRLs. The decrease in serum ApoC-III in our study paralleled the reduction of TGs and does not account for the effect of ARO-ANG3 on TRLs, consistent with experimental data. Inhibition of ANGPTL3 promotes VLDL remodeling and preferential removal of VLDL remnants from circulation, thereby limiting conversion to LDL-C. In addition, inhibition of ANGPTL3 synthesis enhances endothelial lipase activity, which lowers HDL-C levels. Although studies have shown that ANGPTL3 regulates the clearance of ApoB-containing lipoproteins, its role in regulating hepatic production of ApoB is less clear. Hence, studies to fully define the mechanism of action of ARO-ANG3 on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in humans, including those with different dyslipidemias, are required.

### Inhibition of angiopoietin-like protein 3 with a monoclonal antibody reduces triglycerides in hypertriglyceridemia [^111EsEns]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Elevated triglycerides or hypertriglyceridemia are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. – The National Lipid Association and National Cholesterol Education Program define borderline high hypertriglyceridemia when triglyceride levels are 150–199 mg/dL, high hypertriglyceridemia as 200–499 mg/dL, and very high or severe hypertriglyceridemia as ≥ 500 mg/dL. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a well-established cause of acute pancreatitis. –

Hypertriglyceridemia may result from abnormalities in peripheral lipolysis or from overproduction or impaired clearance of lipoprotein. Chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are the major triglyceride-rich lipoproteins synthesized in the intestine and liver, respectively. Hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major enzyme acting on core triglycerides of chylomicrons and VLDL. Accordingly, carriers of loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in apolipoprotein C3, a protein that inhibits LPL activity, have lower levels of plasma triglycerides and are less prone to coronary heart disease. Additionally, variants of the LPL gene coding for LOF are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.

Approved triglyceride-lowering drugs address triglyceride overproduction but have limited efficacy or are associated with adverse events and drug-drug interactions, indicating an urgent need for alternative therapeutic options for hypertriglyceridemic patients. – Several outcome trials of triglyceride-lowering drugs failed to lower residual cardiovascular risk, notably fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin. – A recent cardiovascular outcomes study showed reduced residual risk with icosapent ethyl treatment in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, on background statin therapy; the benefit observed was similar across baseline and attained triglyceride levels (≥ 150 or < 150 mg/dL), indicating that the risk reduction observed may be partly attributable to metabolic effects other than triglyceride lowering.

Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is a secreted protein expressed primarily in the liver. It inhibits LPL activity and endothelial lipase activity, and retards clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins upstream of low-density lipoprotein production. These actions raise plasma concentrations of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

### Factorial effects of evolocumab and atorvastatin on lipoprotein metabolism [^117YRrPs]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), such as evolocumab, lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations. Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on lipoprotein metabolism remains to be fully evaluated. Stable isotope tracer kinetics can effectively elucidate the mode of action of new lipid-regulating pharmacotherapies.

Methods

We conducted a 2-by-2 factorial trial of the effects of atorvastatin (80 mg daily) and subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg every 2 weeks) for 8 weeks on the plasma kinetics of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), intermediate-density lipoprotein-apoB, and LDL-apoB in 81 healthy, normolipidemic, nonobese men. The kinetics of apoB in these lipoproteins was studied using a stable isotope infusion of D3-leucine, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling.

Results

Atorvastatin and evolocumab independently accelerated the fractional catabolism of VLDL-apoB (P < 0.001 and P.032, respectively), intermediate-density lipoprotein-apoB (P = 0.021 and P = .002, respectively), and LDL-apoB (P < 0.001, both interventions). Evolocumab but not atorvastatin decreased the production rate of intermediate-density lipoprotein-apoB (P = 0.043) and LDL-apoB (P < 0.001), which contributed to the reduction in the plasma pool sizes of these lipoprotein particles. The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (P < 0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/campesterol ratio (a measure of cholesterol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration. Both interventions decreased plasma apoE, but neither significantly altered lipoprotein lipase and cholesteryl ester protein mass or measures of insulin resistance.

Conclusions

In healthy, normolipidemic subjects, evolocumab decreased the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins, particularly LDL, by accelerating their catabolism. Reductions in intermediate-density lipoprotein and LDL production also contributed to the decrease in LDL particle concentration with evolocumab by a mechanism distinct from that of atorvastatin. These kinetic findings provide a metabolic basis for understanding the potential benefits of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies incremental to statins in on-going clinical end point trials.

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^115HNeMJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological Determinants of the Number ofParticles in Plasma

Because apo B 48 contributes so little to total apoB, plasma apoB is effectively determined by the total number of VLDL, and especially LDL, particles. The number of VLDL and LDL particles can increase either because their production increases, their clearance decreases, or by a combination of increased production and decreased clearance (Figure 3). Thus, a high number of VLDL particles could be because of (1) increased production of VLDL particles by the liver, (2) impaired clearance of VLDL particles by the liver, (3) impaired conversion of VLDL to LDL particles, or (4) any combination of these factors. Similarly, an elevated number of LDL particles could be because of (1) impaired clearance of LDL particles by the LDL receptor pathway, (2) to increased production of LDL particles from VLDL particles, or (3) to a combination of decreased clearance and increased production. Accordingly, the pathophysiology of every apoB dyslipoproteinemia can be characterized by whether the primary defect is in clearance or production of apoB particles or whether there are significant defects in both.

Figure 3
VLDL‐LDL particle metabolism.

This figure illustrates schematically the regulation of VLDL and LDL particle number in plasma. VLDL particles are secreted by the liver into the plasma compartment, from which they are either removed directly by the liver after much of their TG have been removed or converted to LDL particles. At steady state, the rate at which VLDL particles are secreted from the liver is equal to the rate at which they are removed from plasma. Once steady state is achieved, either an increase in the rate of production or a decrease in the rate of removal will produce an increased VLDL particle number. Similarly, the rate at which LDL particles are produced at steady state is equal to the rate at which they are removed from plasma. LDL particles are produced by conversion of VLDL to LDL particles and are removed either by a specific clearance pathway or by multiple nonspecific pathways. Almost all LDL particles are cleared from plasma by the liver. Only a small minority are removed by peripheral cells. IDL indicates intermediate‐density lipoprotein; LDL indicates low‐density lipoprotein; TG, triglycerides; and VLDL, very low‐density lipoprotein.

### Lixisenatide reduces chylomicron triacylglycerol by increased clearance [^114yWUaX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

In the repeated feeding study, the IMP was administered during consumption of the first meal at −270 minutes. The drug concentrations of lixisenatide peak after 1 to 2 hours, and it has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Although the high affinity of lixisenatide for the GLP-1 receptor might allow for a more persistent metabolic response, a waning drug effect could explain the discrepancy between the lack of effect of lixisenatide on the CM production rate (measured during the repeated feeding study) and the reduction in CM [13 C]oleate after a single meal at −120 minutes.

The effect of lixisenatide to increase CM clearance might have resulted from an increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. The control of LPL expression and action is complex and is tissue specific; however, includes regulation by insulin and glucagon, both of which can be affected by GLP-1. We did not find statistically significant differences in these hormones. LPL is also negatively regulated by apoCIII, and it has been shown that a single injection of exenatide can reduce the postprandial elevation of apoCIII. Microvascular recruitment could also facilitate the clearance of CM-TAG, and this mechanism requires further study.

We hypothesized that lixisenatide would decrease VLDL-TAG production owing to improved insulin sensitivity. After 4 weeks of lixisenatide, the Matsuda Index (a measure of whole body insulin sensitivity) had improved significantly. However, HOMA2-IR (considered to represent hepatic sensitivity) did not change, which might explain the lack of effect on hepatic VLDL-TAG production.

At study inception, it was postulated that lixisenatide resulted in a multimodal reduction of postprandial glucose. However, we found that the predominant mechanism by which lixisenatide reduces postprandial glycemia was through a reduction of glucose Ra from the meal — itself a consequence of delayed gastric emptying. We found that lixisenatide had no additional suppressive effect on EGP from that observed with placebo. Our data, therefore, have confirmed that slowing gastric emptying is the primary mechanism for prandial glucose regulation with lixisenatide.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117CYeQV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### Complex effects of inhibiting hepatic apolipoprotein B100 synthesis in humans [^1116oVZi]. Science Translational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mipomersen is a 20mer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that inhibits apolipoprotein B (apoB) synthesis; its low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering effects should therefore result from reduced secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). We enrolled 17 healthy volunteers who received placebo injections weekly for 3 weeks followed by mipomersen weekly for 7 to 9 weeks. Stable isotopes were used after each treatment to determine fractional catabolic rates and production rates of apoB in VLDL, IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), and LDL, and of triglycerides in VLDL. Mipomersen significantly reduced apoB in VLDL, IDL, and LDL, which was associated with increases in fractional catabolic rates of VLDL and LDL apoB and reductions in production rates of IDL and LDL apoB. Unexpectedly, the production rates of VLDL apoB and VLDL triglycerides were unaffected. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of apoB expression in human liver cells demonstrated preservation of apoB secretion across a range of apoB synthesis. Titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in chow-fed mice preserved both apoB and triglyceride secretion. In contrast, titrated ASO knockdown of apoB mRNA in high-fat-fed mice resulted in stepwise reductions in both apoB and triglyceride secretion. Mipomersen lowered all apoB lipoproteins without reducing the production rate of either VLDL apoB or triglyceride. Our human data are consistent with long-standing models of posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of apoB secretion and are supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Targeting apoB synthesis may lower levels of apoB lipoproteins without necessarily reducing VLDL secretion, thereby lowering the risk of steatosis associated with this therapeutic strategy.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes? [^116bkV5g]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Niacin

Niacin monotherapy or in combination with other agents was in clinical use during the late 1970s and 1980s, but lipid-lowering treatments shifted largely to statins. Recent failures in developing HDL cholesterol–raising drugs have rekindled interest in this drug. High-dose niacin (1–3 g) decreases VLDL, increases HDL, and has a modest effect on LDL. Among lipid-modifying agents, niacin is the most potent agent currently available to increase HDL cholesterol and the only one that reduces lipoprotein(a) concentrations.

Much of VLDL production is controlled by the provision of fatty acids to the liver. Niacin is thought to decrease circulating fatty acids by inhibiting the release of fatty acids in adipose tissue mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase. The underlying mechanism is unknown, but recent data suggest that an orphan G protein–coupled receptor may be the nicotinic acid receptor and mediate the antilipolytic effects of this vitamin.

In the Coronary Drug Project, niacin reduced mortality among myocardial infarction survivors, although, contrary to the relatively rapid effect of statins, mortality rates were almost identical throughout the first 68 months of follow-up and did not begin to diverge until month 72. In the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS), the combination of niacin and simvastatin was associated with regression of atherosclerosis, as assessed by coronary angiography. The simvastatin-niacin combination was also associated with a 90% reduction in the composite end point of major cardiovascular events. In the Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol-2 (ARBITER-2) study, the addition of niacin to statin therapy slowed the progression of atherosclerosis as assessed by intima-media thickness among individuals with known CHD and moderately low HDL cholesterol. In addition to the beneficial effects on intima-media thickness progression, a large, although statistically nonsignificant, reduction in recurrent CHD events was also noted.

Although there are concerns regarding the effect of niacin on the control of diabetes, most studies demonstrated that niacin therapy has only a minor effect on glucose levels in diabetic patients.

All studies examining the effects of niacin on morbidity and mortality were relatively small-scale. Two large clinical outcome studies, the Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) and the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) studies are under way and expected to shed more light on the role of niacin.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^113bLz1q]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Niacin

The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles is not completely understood and may involve several actions, including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity (which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma). Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and LDL-C, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids.

Lovastatin

Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Lovastatin is a prodrug and has little, if any, activity until hydrolyzed to its active beta-hydroxyacid form, lovastatin acid. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of lovastatin may involve both reduction of VLDL-C concentration and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL-C.

### Simvastatin and niacin (simcor) [^114hW2Nn]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Niacin

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles is not completely understood and may involve several actions, including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity (which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma). Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL-C and LDL-C, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids.

Simvastatin

Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active ß-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, simvastatin reduces VLDL and TG and increases HDL-C.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of Total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

SIMCOR

SIMCOR reduces total-C, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, Apo B, TG, and Lp(a) levels and increases HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, or hypertriglyceridemia.

Adiposopathic dyslipidemia — excess adiposity–related lipid abnormalities include hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and elevated smaller, more dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles; cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)–mediated lipid exchange and lipase remodeling are described as key mechanisms, with CETP increased in obesity facilitating triglyceride–cholesteryl ester exchange between very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), HDL, and LDL and lipases producing smaller HDL and LDL particles that lower HDL-C and increase small, dense LDL.

Fig. 1
Overview of changes in type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia. Chylomicron in T2D there is an increased secretion of apoB-48, which is also stimulated by high circulating FFA. The delayed catabolism of chylomicrons is mainly due to metabolomic enrichment of apoC-III and reduced expression of LRP. VLDL overproduction, mainly VLDL1, produces an increased level of TG. There is both an increased production and delayed catabolism due to the increased FFA flux from adipocytes to liver. Metabolomic changes of VLDL include enrichment of apoC-III an inhibitor of LPL, which associated to glycation of apolipoproteins causes a reduced elimination. LDL has a reduced catabolism in T2D, inducing a longer half-life in plasma and promoting oxidation and production of sdLDL. As a consequence of hyperglycemia, there is glycation of LDL which further reduce the affinity to the receptors. HDL undergoes several changes in T2D as there is an increased activity of CETP and there is an enrichment of TG in HDLs. This promotes HL activity and results in an increased elimination of HDL from circulation. Also in T2D its known that HDL undergoes glycation and therefore has metabolomic changes (loss of phospholipid content and reduced apoE). apoB-100 apolipoprotein B-100, apoB-48 apolipoprotein B-48, apoC-III apolipoprotein C-III, apoE apolipoprotein E, CE cholesteryl ester, CETP cholesteryl ester transfer protein, CM chylomicron, FFAs free fatty acids, glycLDL glycated low-density lipoprotein, HL hepatic lipase, IDL intermediate density lipoprotein, LDLR low-density lipoprotein receptor, LPL lipoprotein lipase, sdLDL small, dense low-density lipoproteins, SR-B1 scavenger receptor B1, TG triglycerides, VLDL very-low-density lipoprotein

### Nicotinic acid (niacin) receptor agonists: will they be useful therapeutic agents? [^111hLaqZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Nicotinic acid (niacin) favorably affects very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipoprotein (a) (LP[a]) and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Emerging data indicates vascular anti-inflammatory properties to additionally account for niacin's proven effects in cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence indicates that niacin acts on GPR109A and GPR109B (HM74A and HM74, respectively), receptors expressed in adipocytes and immune cells. In adipocytes, GPR109A activation reduces triglyceride (TG) lipolysis, resulting in decreased free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization to the liver. In humans, this mechanism has yet to be confirmed because the plasma FFA decrease is transient and is followed by a rebound increase in FFA levels. New evidence indicates niacin directly inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) isolated from human hepatocytes, resulting in accelerated hepatic apolipoprotein (apo)B degradation and decreased apoB secretion, thus explaining reductions in VLDL and LDL. This raises important questions as to whether stimulation of GPR109A in adipocytes or inhibition of DGAT2 in liver by niacin best explain the reduction in VLDL and LDL in dyslipidemic patients. Kinetic and in vitro studies indicate that niacin retards the hepatic catabolism of apoA-I but not liver scavenger receptor B1-mediated cholesterol esters, suggesting that niacin inhibits hepatic holoparticle HDL removal. Indeed, recent preliminary evidence suggests that niacin decreases surface expression of hepatic beta-chain of adenosine triphosphate synthase, which has been implicated in apoA-I/HDL holoparticle catabolism. GPR109A-mediated production of prostaglandin D2 in macrophages and Langerhan cells causes skin capillary vasodilation and explains, in part, niacin's effect on flushing. Development of niacin receptor agonists would, theoretically, result in adipocyte TG accumulation (and clinical adiposity) and increased flushing. This raises questions about niacin receptor agonists as therapeutic agents. Several niacin receptor agonists have been developed and patented, but their clinical effects have not been described. Future research is needed to determine whether niacin receptor agonists will demonstrate all the beneficial properties of nicotinic acid on atherosclerosis and without significant adverse effects.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the current standard of care treatment, patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a high residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. 1 Most of these patients have atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which is characterized by high levels of fasting and postprandial triglycerides, low levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and high levels of small low‐density lipoprotein particles (LDLP). 2, 3 The increase in large very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles is at the root of the atherogenic dyslipidaemia in T2D, which is partially secondary to insulin resistance. 4 While statins reduce low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and the number of LDLP, their effect on triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins and their remnants is minimal. 5 Apolipoprotein (apo) C‐III is a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. 6, 7, 8 It is well known that apoC‐III is the inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the rate‐limiting enzyme of the hydrolysis. 9, 10 Recent data also suggest that apoC‐III inhibition reduces plasma triglycerides by LPL‐independent pathways by enhancing hepatic uptake of triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnants via low‐density lipoprotein receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 1 receptors in the liver. 8, 11 Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists have been shown to be effective in reducing major adverse cardiac events in T2D. 12, 13, 14 Numerous mechanisms beyond glucose lowering have been considered as possible contributors to their cardioprotective effects. These mechanisms include weight loss, reducing blood pressure, renal protection, and lowering chronic inflammation and liver fat, which are all known to be associated with cardiovascular risk. 15, 16, 17 GLP‐1 receptor agonists have been shown to reduce lipoprotein and chylomicron production, as well as postprandial triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol and free fatty acids, 18, 19, 20 but the magnitude of these effects is not large.

### Effects of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib on apolipoprotein B100 metabolism in humans [^112WARTZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition with torcetrapib not only increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but also significantly reduces plasma triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels. The goal of the present study was to define the kinetic mechanism(s) by which CETP inhibition reduces levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Methods and Results

Nineteen subjects, 9 of whom were pretreated with 20 mg atorvastatin, received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 120 mg torcetrapib once daily for 4 weeks. Six subjects in the nonatorvastatin group received 120 mg torcetrapib twice daily for an additional 4 weeks. After each phase, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of deuterated leucine to endogenously label newly synthesized apoB to determine very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL apoB100 production, and fractional catabolic rates (FCRs). Once-daily 120 mg torcetrapib significantly reduced VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 pool sizes by enhancing the FCR of apoB100 within each fraction. On a background of atorvastatin, 120 mg torcetrapib significantly reduced VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 pool sizes. The reduction in VLDL apoB100 was associated with an enhanced apoB100 FCR, whereas the decreases in IDL and LDL apoB100 were associated with reduced apoB100 production.

Conclusions

These data indicate that when used alone, torcetrapib reduces VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 levels primarily by increasing the rate of apoB100 clearance. In contrast, when added to atorvastatin treatment, torcetrapib reduces apoB100 levels mainly by enhancing VLDL apoB100 clearance and reducing production of IDL and LDL apoB100.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

LOPID is a lipid regulating agent which decreases serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. While modest decreases in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may be observed with LOPID therapy, treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides due to Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia often results in a rise in LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol levels in Type IIb patients with elevations of both serum LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are, in general, minimally affected by LOPID treatment; however, LOPID usually raises HDL-cholesterol significantly in this group. LOPID increases levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions HDL2and HDL3, as well as apolipoproteins AI and AII. Epidemiological studies have shown that both low HDL-cholesterol and high LDL-cholesterol are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.

In the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, in which 4081 male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, LOPID therapy was associated with significant reductions in total plasma triglycerides and a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moderate reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed for the LOPID treatment group as a whole, but the lipid response was heterogeneous, especially among different Fredrickson types. The study involved subjects with serum non-HDL-cholesterol of over 200 mg/dL and no previous history of coronary heart disease. Over the five-year study period, the LOPID group experienced a 1.4% absolute (34% relative) reduction in the rate of serious coronary events (sudden cardiac deaths plus fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions) compared to placebo, p = 0.04 (see Table I). There was a 37% relative reduction in the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction compared to placebo, equivalent to a treatment-related difference of 13.1 events per thousand persons. Deaths from any cause during the double-blind portion of the study totaled 44 (2.2%) in the LOPID randomization group and 43 (2.1%) in the placebo group.

Niacin — niacin may lower Lp(a) by decreasing apo(a) production and, in meta-analysis of 14 trials with 9013 patients, was associated with a "23% reduction in Lp(a) levels", but combination studies with statins showed no clinical benefit "despite ~20% reductions in Lp(a) level", so "niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) lowering".

### VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein)-apo E (apolipoprotein E) may influence Lp (a) (lipoprotein [a]) synthesis or assembly [^111ui5ha]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To clarify the association between PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) and Lp(a) (lipoprotein [a]), we studied Lp(a) kinetics in patients with loss-of-function and gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations and in patients in whom extended-release niacin reduced Lp(a) and PCSK9 concentrations. Approach and Results: Six healthy controls, 9 heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (5 with low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR] mutations and 4 with PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations) and 3 patients with heterozygous dominant-negative PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations were included in the preliminary study. Eight patients were enrolled in a second study assessing the effects of 2 g/day extended-release niacin. Apolipoprotein kinetics in VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and Lp(a) were studied using stable isotope techniques. Plasma Lp(a) concentrations were increased in PCSK9 -gain-of-function and familial hypercholesterolemia- LDLR groups compared with controls and PCSK9 -loss-of-function groups (14 ± 12 versus 5 ± 4 mg/dL; P = 0.04), but no change was observed in Lp(a) fractional catabolic rate. Subjects with PCSK9 -loss-of-function mutations displayed reduced apoE (apolipoprotein E) concentrations associated with a VLDL-apoE absolute production rate reduction. Lp(a) and VLDL-apoE absolute production rates were correlated (r = 0.50; P < 0.05). ApoE-to-apolipoprotein (a) molar ratios in Lp(a) increased with plasma Lp(a) (r = 0.96; P < 0.001) but not with PCSK9 levels. Extended-release niacin-induced reductions in Lp(a) and VLDL-apoE absolute production rate were correlated (r = 0.83; P = 0.015). In contrast, PCSK9 reduction (-35%; P = 0.008) was only correlated with that of VLDL-apoE absolute production rate (r = 0.79; P = 0.028).

Conclusions

VLDL-apoE production could determine Lp(a) production and/or assembly. As PCSK9 inhibitors reduce plasma apoE and Lp(a) concentrations, apoE could be the link between PCSK9 and Lp(a).

Although animal models suggest that HDL has antiatherosclerotic effects, clinical studies showing benefit from increasing HDL are limited. Niacin reduced events in the coronary drug project, and niacin appears to improve the effect of statins. Infusion of A-1 Milano improved atherosclerosis, as measured by intravascular ultrasound. "The challenge", Brewer said, "has been to develop a good HDL-raising drug". Statins raise HDL cholesterol level by 6–14%, fibrates by 15%, and niacin by 20–30% but with poor tolerability; although CETP inhibitors double HDL, "we'll have to find out if they are safe and effective", with adverse outcome seen with such an agent in a recent large clinical trial.

Ronald Krauss (Oakland, CA) discussed nutritional and genomic regulation of atherogenic dyslipidemia and focused on small dense LDL particles. LDL consists of four distinct subsets, classes 3 and 4, smaller particles with greater arterial proteoglycans binding, greater oxidative susceptibility, greater endothelial transport, and reduced LDL receptor binding; medium size class 2 particles, the most abundant species in plasma of healthy individuals; and large LDL class 1 particles that carry the largest cholesterol mass but do not have adverse arterial effects, explaining the relatively weak correlation of LDL with CVD. Apolipoprotein B and, even more, particle number may be better measures than LDL cholesterol per se. The identification of LDL subpopulations is aided by plasma triglyceride levels, with two clusters of subjects, those with peak LDL diameter > 260 and those with LDL peak < 260 A, the latter having higher triglyceride levels. VLDL secreted by the liver is acted upon by lipoprotein lipase, forming LDL. High triglyceride levels are associated with large VLDL production, forming remnant particles that are slowly acted on by lipoprotein and hepatic lipase to produce small LDL. HDL interacts with small LDL via CETP.

Lipid-modulating agents that act to modify the atherogenic lipid profile via indirect or direct action on cholesteryl ester transfer protein

Abundant evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies reveals that the current pharmacological agents (i.e. statins, fibrates, and niacin) commonly used in the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidaemia share the characteristic that their mechanisms of action involve — to varying degrees — direct and/or indirect reduction in plasma CETP activity. Such pharmacologically mediated modulation of CETP typically occurs either through reduction in numbers of apoB-containing lipoprotein acceptor particles (CM, VLDL, remnants, and LDL) for CETP-mediated CE transfer during the fasting and/or post-prandial phases, or through effects on CETP gene expression with resulting alteration in circulating concentrations of CETP protein, or both. These effects are especially relevant to the atherogenic lipid profile typical of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome; such dysmetabolic states not only feature the atherogenic lipid triad, i.e. elevated levels of TG-rich lipoproteins and small dense LDL, together with subnormal levels of HDL-C, but also elevated levels of endogenous CETP activity, a key driver of this lipid phenotype. Indeed, supranormal CETP activity equally favours the qualitative abnormalities in HDL particles discussed above, which are intimately associated with defective anti-atherogenic function.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^1119pUDp]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Effects on lipids

ADVICOR

ADVICOR reduces LDL-C, TC, and TG, and increases HDL-C due to the individual actions of niacin and lovastatin. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality.

Niacin

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces LDL-C, Apo B, Lp(a), TG, and TC, and increases HDL-C. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL2:HDL3ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect is not yet clear.

Lovastatin

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. Apo B also falls substantially during treatment with lovastatin. Since each LDL-C particle contains one molecule of Apo B, and since little Apo B is found in other lipoproteins, this strongly suggests that lovastatin does not merely cause cholesterol to be lost from LDL-C, but also reduces the concentration of circulating LDL particles. In addition, lovastatin can produce increases of variable magnitude in HDL-C, and modestly reduces VLDL-C and plasma TG. The effects of lovastatin on Lp(a), fibrinogen, and certain other independent biochemical risk markers for coronary heart disease are not well characterized.

Conclusions

The EAS Consensus Panel believes that adoption of these recommendations for clinical management of elevated triglycerides, a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low concentrations of HDL-C, supported by appraisal of the current evidence, will facilitate reduction in the substantial CV risk that persists in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal, especially those with cardiometabolic abnormalities (Box 7).

Box 7
Key messages

- High-risk individuals, especially with cardiometabolic disease, who achieve LDL-C goals remain at high risk of CV events

- Appraisal of the current evidence base implicates elevated triglycerides, a marker of TRL and their remnants, and low levels of HDL-C in this excess CV risk

- In clinical intervention studies using surrogate outcome measures, the addition of niacin to statin reduced atherosclerosis progression in high-risk patients with low LDL-C and elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C. Subgroup analyses also showed additional reduction in CV events with fibrate therapy, either alone or in combination with a statin, in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia

- Consistent with European guidelines, elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) and/or low HDL-C levels (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) should be triggers for considering further treatment in high-risk individuals

- Lifestyle intervention and addressing compliance and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia constitutes the first step in management

- Adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering, are suggested options for correction of atherogenic dyslipidaemia

### Lovastatin (Altoprev) [^114Xi3BC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lovastatin is a lactone prodrug that is hydrolyzed in vivo to its active β-hydroxyacid form, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by lovastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of lovastatin is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that.

### Reducing elevated plasma LDL cholesterol: the central role of the LDL receptor [^113uKT7y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and reduction of elevated LDL-C reduces mortality in patients at risk. This benefit has evolved from the use of statins and knowledge of the LDL receptor (LDLR). The most potent drugs used for dyslipidemias act by mechanisms that involve this receptor. Advances in molecular genetics and understanding of the regulation of this receptor have revealed several pharmacological targets that are being explored to develop more targeted therapies for dyslipidemias.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: at the heart of the action of lipid-modulating therapy with statins, fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors [^1143D3Hi]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Critically, CETP may exert both pro-atherogenic and anti-atherogenic actions. In its pro-atherogenic dimension, CETP-mediated CE transfer may effectively reduce the flux of cholesterol through HDL to hepatic scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and HDL receptors in the direct RCT pathway, concomitantly enhancing the mass of cholesterol transported by atherogenic VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), remnants, and LDL. In this way, the cholesterol burden of these particles is increased, potentially resulting in enhanced deposition in peripheral tissues and the arterial wall. As we and others have proposed, this mechanism may be of special relevance in the post-prandial state. In moderate to marked hypertriglyceridaemia, a second major CETP-mediated, pro-atherogenic pathway is of critical importance. Thus, under such conditions, elevated levels of apoB-containing acceptor particles for CETP drive enhanced transfer of TG from VLDL to HDL, leading to TG enrichment of HDL with abnormal intravascular metabolism involving reduction in particle size and fall in HDL-C and apoA-I levels due to accelerated renal catabolism (see below).

### New therapeutic principles in dyslipidaemia: focus on LDL and Lp (a) lowering drugs [^112Qd5ii]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Dyslipidaemias play a key role in determining cardiovascular risk; the discovery of statins has contributed a very effective approach. However, many patients do not achieve, at the maximal tolerated dose, the recommended goals for low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Available agents combined with statins can provide additional LDL-C reduction, and agents in development will increase therapeutic options impacting also other atherogenic lipoprotein classes. In fact, genetic insights into mechanisms underlying regulation of LDL-C levels has expanded potential targets of drug therapy and led to the development of novel agents. Among them are modulators of apoB containing lipoproteins production and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors. Alternative targets such as lipoprotein(a) also require attention; however, until we have a better understanding of these issues, further LDL-C lowering in high and very high-risk patients will represent the most sound clinical approach.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1135ETkY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy selection by triglyceride level — states that when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (fibric acids, high-dose [2–4 g/d] long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid) should be the first-line agent if the fasting triglyceride concentration is ≥ 1000 mg/dL. For patients with triglycerides of 500 to 999 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin (if no history of pancreatitis) may be reasonable first-line drug options. For patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), a statin will generally be first-line drug therapy, and if maximum tolerated statin therapy does not lower non–HDL-C below goal levels in patients with triglycerides 200 to 499 mg/dL, adding an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and VLDL-C may help to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals. Subgroup analyses from cardiovascular outcome studies provide suggestive evidence of reduced ASCVD event risk with the addition of a triglyceride-lowering agent to statin therapy, particularly in patients with the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.

### The long-term efficacy and safety of Evinacumab in patients with Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^114QiyhH]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, acting mainly by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. Animal models have shown that ANGPTL3 knock-out, or its pharmacologic inhibition, reduces LDL-C independently of the LDLR. In humans, familial combined hypolipidemia due to homozygous loss-of-function polymorphisms in ANGPTL3 is associated with low LDL-C and reduced ASCVD risk. Mendelian randomization studies also show decreased LDL-C and ASCVD in association with loss-of-function polymorphisms in ANGPTL3.

ANGPTL3 inhibition leads to enhanced lipoprotein clearance upstream of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) production, with very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) being cleared from the circulation by an endothelial lipase-dependent VLDL remodeling and remnant clearance pathway independent of the LDLR (Figure 1).

Figure 1
LDL Metabolism and Mechanism of ANGPTL3 Inhibition in Patients With HoFH

LDL metabolism in (A) patients with HoFH, and (B) mechanism of ANGPTL3 inhibition in patients with HoFH. ANGPTL3 regulates lipoprotein metabolism via inhibition of LPL and EL. LPL is a key enzyme responsible for the catabolism of TGs, converting VLDL into IDL, and further to LDL. In patients with HoFH, that have near or absent LDLR function, hepatic uptake of LDL is impaired resulting in elevated LDL-C. Inhibition of ANGPTL3 by evinacumab leads to extensive remodeling of VLDL, generating lipid-depleted remnant particles, which accelerates their removal from circulation via remnant receptors. This in turn leads to depletion of the LDL precursor pool, thus reducing LDL-C levels. Endothelial lipase is the key mediator of this LDLR-independent pathway. ANGPTL3 = angiopoietin-like 3; EL = endothelial lipase; FFA = free fatty acid; HoFH = homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDLR = low-density lipoprotein receptor; LPL = lipoprotein lipase; mAb = monoclonal antibody; PL = phospholipase; TG = triglyceride; VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein.

### Abnormal hepatic apolipoprotein B metabolism in type 2 diabetes [^1152P1ja]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Increased Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) production is a major feature of diabetic dyslipidemia with consequences on the metabolism of other lipoproteins such as Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) and High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). More precisely, we observe, in patients with type 2 diabetes, an increased production of VLDL(1) particles that is potentially detrimental by generating atherogenic remnants, small dense LDL particles and triglyceride-rich HDL particles. Several pathophysiological factors are responsible for increased VLDL production, in type 2 diabetes. Among those, insulin resistance plays an important role. Indeed, defective activation of PI3-kinase, secondary to insulin resistance, is associated with a reduction of apoB degradation in the hepatocytes, a rise in MTP expression (by increasing nuclear transcription factors Fox01 and Foxa2) and an increased activity of phospholipase D1 and ARF-1, which are involved in VLDL(1) formation. Moreover, peripheral insulin resistance is responsible for increased lipolysis of adipose tissue leading to augmented portal flux of FFA to the liver and, as a consequence, activation of VLDL production. In addition, increased de novo lipogenesis is observed in type 2 diabetes. This is secondary to increased activation of SREBP-1c (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c), mainly by Endoplasmic Reticulum stress, and of ChREBP (Carbohydrate Responsive Element Binding Protein), mainly by hyperglycemia. Furthermore, decreased plasma adiponectin observed in type 2 diabetes, may also play a role in increased VLDL production by decreasing liver AMP-kinase activation and by increasing plasma FFA levels as a consequence of reduced muscle FFA oxidation.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^115wT8ir]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dyslipidemia — elevated lipoprotein(a) and combined lipid abnormalities are addressed as follows: There is currently no medication therapy specific for elevated Lp(a), and in adults, niacin will lower Lp(a) approximately 15 percent, but this has not been studied in children; management may focus on addressing other risk factors and concomitant elevations of LDL–C, TG, and non–HDL–C. In obesity-associated combined dyslipidemia (low HDL–C, high TG, and a mild increase in LDL–C with smaller, denser particles), these patients do not meet the criteria for pharmacologic therapy and management focuses on reducing adiposity and changing diet composition, with the CHILD 2–TG diet referenced. When risk factors cluster, pharmacologic therapy may be selectively directed at elevations in non–HDL–C; treatment with statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates might be considered, but evidence is very limited in children and there have been no RCTs. For primary dyslipidemias with elevated VLDL–C (often with elevated LDL–C and high TG), pharmacologic therapy is usually guided by non–HDL–C levels, and statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates should be considered as first-line agents for patients who meet the criteria for medication therapy under the direction of a lipid specialist.

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 1. evidence from genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies. A consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel [^116uUm1j]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and its clinical manifestations, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Multiple exposures have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. The most extensively studied of these exposures by far is low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Multiple lines of evidence have established that cholesterol-rich LDL and other apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and their remnants, intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], are directly implicated in the development of ASCVD.

Despite this extensive body of evidence, however, some still express scepticism of the causal nature of the relationship between LDL and the development of ASCVD. With the availability of new, highly efficacious LDL-lowering agents and the development of additional novel lipid-lowering agents with prolonged duration of action, there is a need for a consensus as to whether LDL causes ASCVD in order to inform treatment guidelines and help shape regulatory agency guidance for the approval of new medicines.

This Consensus Statement, the first of two that evaluates the case for LDL causality, appraises evidence from genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical intervention studies. The second paper discusses the evidence for LDL causality based on the current understanding of the pathophysiology of ASCVD. While our focus is on LDL, this does not diminish the importance of the role of other apoB-containing lipoproteins on the development of ASCVD nor does it exclude potential atherogenic actions of the individual components of the lipidome and proteome of LDL beyond cholesterol and apoB.

Most publications that question the causal effect of LDL on the development of ASCVD tend to cite evidence from individual studies or a small group of highly selected studies, often without a quantitative synthesis of the presented evidence. Therefore, to avoid this type of selection bias, we have based our conclusions on the totality of evidence from separate meta-analyses of genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized clinical trials. This evidence base includes over 200 studies involving over 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and more than 150 000 cardiovascular events. Together these studies provide remarkably consistent and unequivocal evidence that LDL causes ASCVD as summarized in Table 1.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated
levels of total cholesterol (Total-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (a membrane transport complex
for LDL-C) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A, are
associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations
have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with
the level of Total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins,
including VLDL, IDL and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated
plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and
small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk
factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not
consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore,
the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

In patients with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, treatment
with Lescol®(fluvastatin sodium) or Lescol®XL (fluvastatin sodium) reduced Total-C, LDL-C,
apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides while producing an increase in HDL-C.
Increases in HDL-C are greater in patients with low HDL-C (< 35 mg/dL).
Neither agent had a consistent effect on either Lp(a) or fibrinogen. The effect
of Lescol or Lescol XL induced changes in lipoprotein levels, including
reduction of serum cholesterol, on cardiovascular mortality has not been
determined.

Cholesterol, LDL, and LDL-C

The terms 'cholesterol', 'LDL', and 'LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)' are frequently conflated or used interchangeably, potentially leading to confusion. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids and steroid hormones. Importantly, cholesterol of both exogenous and endogenous origin is transported to peripheral cells largely by the apoB-containing lipoproteins in plasma. In most people, LDL particles constitute ∼90% of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins in fasting blood (Figure 1). However, in clinical practice, the plasma LDL level is generally not measured directly but instead is estimated from its cholesterol concentration — LDL-C — a measure of the total amount of cholesterol contained in LDL particles. As a result, calculated plasma LDL-C has become the focus for assessing cardiovascular risk and for evaluating therapeutic benefit in randomized clinical trials.

Figure 1
Relative concentration of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) contained in circulating lipoproteins in normolipidaemic individuals. ApoB content was calculated in nanomoles per litre using 500 000 as the defined molecular mass [i.e. low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 100 mg/dL or 2000 nmol/L, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) remnants 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L and lipoprotein(a) 10 nmol/l*]. *Based on population median.

Under most conditions, LDL-C concentration and LDL particle number are highly correlated, and therefore plasma LDL-C is a good surrogate for LDL particle concentration. However, in certain conditions (e.g. the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridaemia), plasma LDL-C and LDL particle concentration can become discordant as a result of the predominance of small, dense cholesterol-poor LDL, and therefore plasma LDL-C may not accurately reflect LDL particle concentration or its effect on cardiovascular risk. Under these conditions, direct measurement of LDL particle number or apoB concentration (recognizing that each LDL particle contains a single apoB molecule) may more accurately reflect the causal effect of LDL on ASCVD. In this Consensus Statement, we assess the evidence that LDL causes ASCVD by critically appraising the clinical evidence, with the understanding that the majority of clinical studies have used LDL-C as an estimate of LDL concentration.

Statins are the frontline therapy for this disorder, and apoB is the target of therapy. Addition of ezetimibe may be required. In high‐risk individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors may be required as well.

Dysbetalipoproteinemia

Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Figure 6E) is characterized by markedly increased numbers of cholesterol‐enriched chylomicron and VLDL remnant particles. By contrast, the number of LDL particles is low. Total apoB is < 120 mg/dL, triglycerides are elevated (> 1.5 mmol/L), the triglycerides/apoB ratio is < 10:1, and the TC apoB ratio is > 6.2:1. Dysbetalipoproteinemia is a highly atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia, less common than heterozygous FH, but often much more easily treatable. The pathophysiology is complex. The great majority of those affected are homozygous for the apoE E2 isoform. However, this is only a precondition, not a sufficient requirement. Obesity, diabetes, and exogenous hormones are among the factors that may trigger the expression of the abnormal accumulation of remnant particles, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, in contrast to all the other phenotypes, apoB is not the primary target of therapy. The targets of therapy are the cholesterol‐enriched chylomicron VLDL and remnant particles, but statins, once again, are still be the preferred initial therapy, although fibrates and even niacin are effective in many patients.

### The pharmacological bases for repurposing statins in depression: a review of mechanistic studies [^112ygP5y]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

General pharmacology of statins

Statins' primary mechanism of action involves the competitive, reversible antagonism of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins thwart the physiological production of cholesterol with a subsequent decline of its blood levels. The ensuing reduction in cholesterol concentration within hepatocytes triggers the upregulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor via sterol regulatory element binding proteins, leading to increased uptake of LDL cholesterol from systemic circulation. In other words, statins' cholesterol-lowering properties depend not only on the reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis from the liver, but also on the consequent substantial upsurge in LDL clearance from plasma. Ancillary mechanisms of cholesterol reduction comprise inhibition of hepatic synthesis of apolipoprotein B100 and decreased production and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Overall, the effects on lipid profile include substantial contractions in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides, as well as an accrue in high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Additionally, statins differ from other lipid-lowering agents because their upstream inhibition of the mevalonate pathway affects several end-products other than cholesterol, which are responsible for numerous homoeostatic processes, including Coenzyme Q (mitochondrial respiratory chain), farnesyl- and geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate moieties (protein post-translational modifications), isopentenyl tRNAs (RNA transcription), and dolichol (protein N-glycosylation). On this basis, statins are described as possessing 'pleiotropic effects'.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^113uYkco]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Special cases for statin combination and other combination therapies — among patients who require multiple LDL-C–lowering therapies (e.g., intolerant to statins or familial hypercholesterolemia) combining statin and therapies with different mechanisms of action and in the order above is recommended, with careful consideration of cost and polypharmacy risks. In atherogenic dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides (TG) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) plus low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), options include therapies that mainly lower TG and VLDL-C such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids; prescription omega-3 fatty acids are currently only indicated for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Colesevelam may worsen TG, especially in those with levels ≥ 200 mg/dL at baseline, and niacin may be used in patients with stable type 2 diabetes for lipid management with monitoring of glucose control.

### Effect of rosuvastatin on hepatic production of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in an animal model of insulin resistance and metabolic dyslipidemia [^117UexDG]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster, was employed to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of rosuvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in ameliorating metabolic dyslipidemia in insulin-resistant states. Fructose feeding for a 2-week period induced insulin resistance and a significant increase in hepatic secretion of VLDL. This was followed by a fructose-enriched diet with or without 10 mg/kg rosuvastatin for 14 days. Fructose feeding in the first 2 weeks caused a significant increase in plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride in both groups (n = 6, p < 0.001). However, there was a significant decline (30%, n = 8, p < 0.05) in plasma triglyceride levels following rosuvastatin feeding (10 mg/kg). A significant decrease (n = 6, p < 0.05) was also observed in VLDL-apoB production in hepatocytes isolated from drug-treated hamsters, together with an increased apoB degradation (n = 6, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in parallel cell culture experiments in which primary hepatocytes were first isolated from chow-fed hamsters, and then treated in vitro with 15 microM rosuvastatin for 18 h. Rosuvastatin at 5 microM caused a substantial reduction in synthesis of unesterified cholesterol and cholesterol ester (98 and 25%, n = 9, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) and secretion of newly synthesized unesterified cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and triglyceride (95, 42, and 60% reduction, respectively, n = 9, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). This concentration of rosuvastatin also caused a significant reduction (75% decrease, n = 4, p < 0.01) in the extracellular secretion of VLDL-apoB100, accompanied by a significant increase in the intracellular degradation of apoB100. There was a 12% reduction (not significant, p > 0.05) in hepatic MTP and no changes in ER-60 (a chaperone involved in apoB degradation) protein levels. Taken together, these data suggest that the assembly and secretion of VLDL particles in hamster hepatocytes can be acutely inhibited by rosuvastatin in a process involving enhanced apoB degradation. This appears to lead to a significant amelioration of hepatic VLDL-apoB overproduction observed in the fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamster model.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^1117EUvd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years. However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridaemia are associated with a substantially increased long term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to reduction in HDL and increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms, such excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intensive lifestyle therapy is the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Statins are a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. If the primary goal is to lower TG levels, fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate for monotherapy, and in combination with statin; gemfibrozil only for monotherapy) could be the preferable drugs. Also ezetimibe has mild positive effects in lowering TG. Initial experience with en ezetimibe/fibrates combination seems promising. The recently released IMPROVE-IT Trial is the first to prove that adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe) to a statin lowers the risk of future CV events. In conclusion, the classical clinical paradigm of lipids-modifying treatment should be changed and high TG should be recognized as an important target for therapy in their own right. Hypertriglyceridemia should be treated.

- Ongoing trials (AIM-HIGH, HPS2-THRIVE) will evaluate whether ER niacin on top of statin therapy can reduce the CV risk that typically persists despite statin monotherapy in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic disease

- HPS2-THRIVE, given the broad range of patients, will reveal whether niacin–statin therapy is effective across a wide spectrum of dyslipidaemic patients or only in those with high triglycerides/low HDL-C dyslipidaemia

Fibrates

Fibrates impact multiple pathways of lipid metabolism and may equally exert pleiotropic effects via regulation of genes influencing vascular inflammation and thrombogenesis. Their lipid-modifying effects (Box 2) are mediated primarily via interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) (Table 3).–

Angiographic trials showed that fibrate therapy may attenuate atherosclerosis progression, – although the impact on the progression of intima–media thickening has not been consistent –. Results from individual monotherapy outcomes trials have been variable and primarily indicate a reduction in nonfatal MI and revascularization, with no effect on stroke or CV death, – subsequently confirmed by a meta-analysis. Post hoc analyses of several of these trials provided consistent evidence suggestive of clinical benefit in the subgroup of patients with elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C (Table 4). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis confirmed enhanced benefit with fibrates in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia vs. those without. On the basis of such evidence, fibrate treatment appears appropriate in this subgroup (Box 4).

### Influence of atorvastatin and simvastatin on apolipoprotein B metabolism in moderate combined hyperlipidemic subjects with low VLDL and LDL fractional clearance rates [^117MjRb8]. Atherosclerosis (2002). Low credibility.

Subjects with moderate combined hyperlipidemia (n = 11) were assessed in an investigation of the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin (both 40 mg per day) on apolipoprotein B (apoB) metabolism. The objective of the study was to examine the mechanism by which statins lower plasma triglyceride levels. Patients were studied on three occasions, in the basal state, after 8 weeks on atorvastatin or simvastatin and then again on the alternate treatment. Atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions than simvastatin in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (49.7 vs. 44.1% decrease on simvastatin) and plasma triglyceride (46.4 vs. 39.4% decrease on simvastatin). ApoB metabolism was followed using a tracer of deuterated leucine. Both drugs stimulated direct catabolism of large very low density lipoprotein (VLDL(1)) apoB (4.52 ± 3.06 pools per day on atorvastatin; 5.48 ± 4.76 pools per day on simvastatin versus 2.26 ± 1.65 pools per day at baseline (both P < 0.05)) and this was the basis of the 50% reduction in plasma VLDL(1) concentration; apoB production in this fraction was not significantly altered. On atorvastatin and simvastatin the fractional transfer rates (FTR) of VLDL(1) to VLDL(2) and of VLDL(2) to intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) were increased significantly, in the latter instance nearly twofold. IDL apoB direct catabolism rose from 0.54 ± 0.30 pools per day at baseline to 1.17 ± 0.87 pools per day on atorvastatin and to 0.95 ± 0.43 pools per day on simvastatin (both P < 0.05). Similarly the fractional transfer rate for IDL to LDL conversion was enhanced 58–84% by statin treatment (P < 0.01) LDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) which was low at baseline in these subjects (0.22 ± 0.04 pools per day) increased to 0.44 ± 0.11 pools per day on atorvastatin and 0.38 ± 0.11 pools per day on simvastatin (both P < 0.01). ApoB-containing lipoproteins were more triglyceride-rich and contained less free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester on statin therapy. Further, patients on both treatments showed marked decreases in all LDL subfractions. In particular the concentration of small dense LDL (LDL-III) fell 64% on atorvastatin and 45% on simvastatin. We conclude that in patients with moderate combined hyperlipidemia who initially have a low FCR for VLDL and LDL apoB, the principal action of atorvastatin and simvastatin is to stimulate receptor-mediated catabolism across the spectrum of apoB-containing lipoproteins. This leads to a substantial, and approximately equivalent, percentage reduction in plasma triglyceride and LDL cholesterol.

d. Treatment of other lipoprotein fractions or targets.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia may warrant immediate therapy of this abnormality with lifestyle and usually pharmacologic therapy (fibric acid derivative or niacin) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. In the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapy targeting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides has intuitive appeal but lacks the evidence base of statin therapy. If the HDL cholesterol is < 40 mg/dl and the LDL cholesterol is 100–129 mg/dl, gemfibrozil or niacin might be used, especially if a patient is intolerant to statins. Niacin is the most effective drug for raising HDL cholesterol. It can significantly increase blood glucose at high doses, but recent studies demonstrate that at modest doses (750–2,000 mg/day), significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are accompanied by only modest changes in glucose that are generally amenable to adjustment of diabetes therapy.

Combination therapy with a statin and a fibrate or a statin and niacin may be efficacious for treatment of all three lipid fractions, but this combination is associated with an increased risk for abnormal transaminase levels, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is higher with higher doses of statins and with renal insufficiency and seems to be lower when statins are combined with fenofibrate than gemfibrozil. Several ongoing trials may provide much-needed evidence for the effects of combination therapy on cardiovascular outcomes.

In 2008, a consensus panel convened by ADA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommended a greater focus on non-HDL cholesterol and apo lipoprotein B (apo B) in patients who are likely to have small LDL particles, such as people with diabetes. The consensus panel suggested that for statin-treated patients in whom the LDL cholesterol goal would be < 70 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to < 80 mg/dl. For patients on statins with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl (non-HDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl), apo B should be measured and treated to < 90 mg/dl.

### REVIEW: efficacy and mechanisms of action of statins in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia [^112kpFdn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

The Adult Treatment Panel III recommends 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, as first-line lipid-altering therapy for all adult patients with diabetes mellitus. This is based on the well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles of this class of agents as well as several clinical trials demonstrating that statin treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.

Evidence Acquisition

This review provides an overview of the effectiveness and mechanisms of action of statins in patients with diabetes mellitus using small efficacy trials and large clinical outcomes trials as well as studies of the effects of statins on apolipoprotein B (apoB) metabolism.

Evidence Synthesis

The major findings presented are a review of mechanistic studies of selected subjects with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia and a compilation of results from large-scale clinical trials of patients with diabetes.

Conclusions

Statins are highly efficacious as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering agents and have more modest effects on very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The effects of statins on plasma lipids and lipoproteins result from their ability to both increase the efficiency with which very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein are cleared from the circulation and reduce the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver. Additional investigations are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which statins reduce apoB secretion from the liver.

Fibrates also mediate modification in qualitative features of HDL and LDL particles. Thus, fenofibrate induced increases in the mass of light HDL subspecies at the expense of dense HDL3 particles in mixed dyslipidaemia, and equally shifted the dense LDL profile to a normalized distribution in which particles of lower density predominated; reduction in CETP activity is readily implicated in each of these effects. Fibrates preferentially enhance concentrations of apoA-I plus apoA-II-containing HDL particles with physicochemical properties intermediate between those of large HDL2 and small dense HDL3. Such action is in contrast to that of statins, however, which induce increase in the apoA-I-rich HDL subpopulation of largest size (α-1-HDL particles). The effect of fibrates on HDL particle subspecies result in part from fibrate-mediated up-regulation of apoA-I and apoA-II gene expression, although the increment in their plasma levels of apoA-I is minor as their fractional catabolic rate in the plasma compartment is accelerated.

Other documented effects of fibrates on HDL metabolism result from PPARα-mediated up-regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity with enhanced lipolysis of CM and VLDL, resulting in release of surface fragments containing phospholipid and free cholesterol that sequester to the HDL pool under the action of PLTP; this latter effect may be amplified by PPARα-mediated attenuation of the hepatic synthesis and production of apoC-III. The potent TG-lowering action of fibrates is of course central to the attenuation of elevated basal levels of CETP activity in dyslipidaemic subjects, as it effects marked reduction in numbers of TG-rich particle acceptors with high avidity for CETP. Finally, enhanced cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL/apoA-I acceptors subsequent to PPARα-mediated up-regulation of SR-B1 and ABCA1 expression may impact on plasma HDL-C levels to a minor degree.

Introduction

Low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) is the primary lipid treatment target to reduce atherosclerotic risk. 1, 2, 3, 4 Non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) is considered to be a co‐primary 3 or secondary treatment target, 1, 2, 4 while apolipoprotein B (ApoB) can be considered as a secondary target 2, 3 or an alternative to LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) as the primary measurement, and may be preferred over non‐HDL‐C in patients with high triglycerides, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or very low LDL‐C. 1 Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is recognized as a risk factor, based on Mendelian randomization, for atherosclerotic disease 1 and cardiovascular events, 5, 6 and its measurement can help improve cardiovascular risk classification under certain conditions. 1, 2 Non‐HDL‐C levels are an estimate of the concentration of atherogenic cholesterol in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. 7 ApoB is a direct measure of non‐HDL atherogenic lipoprotein particle concentration. 8

Both non‐HDL‐C and ApoB are well‐validated measures of cardiovascular risk, particularly for patients with elevated triglyceride levels, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome. 1, 2, 8 For patients at very high total cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend lowering of non‐HDL‐C (< 100 mg/dL) for which treatment intensification on top of statin therapy may be needed. 1, 2 A treatment goal for ApoB < 80 mg/dL has also been recommended for these patients. 1 It has been suggested that in patients at cardiovascular risk with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L, intensification of treatment directed to modifiable risk factors, including LDL‐C, is a reasonable strategy. 1, 2 Another recommendation suggests that levels of Lp(a) > 75 nmol/L are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. 9

### Niacin (niaspan) [^111GCejy]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Niacin functions in the body after conversion to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in the NAD coenzyme system. Niacin (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses reduces total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in HDL-C is associated with an increase in apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and a shift in the distribution of HDL subfractions. These shifts include an increase in the HDL :HDL ratio, and an elevation in lipoprotein A-I (Lp A-I, an HDL-C particle containing only Apo A-I). Niacin treatment also decreases serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of Lp(a), a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. In addition, preliminary reports suggest that niacin causes favorable LDL particle size transformations, although the clinical relevance of this effect requires further investigation. The effect of niacin-induced changes in lipids/proteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without preexisting coronary disease has not been established.23

A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of TC, LDL-C, and Apo B promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of Total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.

Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and their remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma TG are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

I. Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Nicotinic acid, alone or in combination with a bile-acid binding resin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb) †, when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also the NCEP treatment guidelines6). Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

II. Nicotinic acid is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) † who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum triglyceride levels over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia) †. Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis. Therapy with nicotinic acid may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. Some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1,000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of nicotinic acid therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL. Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia7.

Figure 1
Overview of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism focused on disease genes and drug targets. Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein assembly begins with triglyceride synthesis, which derive from fatty acids in the intestine from the diet or in the liver taken up from plasma, fatty acids released from lysosomes after breakdown of endocytosed triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and fatty acids generated from glucose by de novo lipogenesis. A series of enzymes, culminating in tissue-specific isoforms of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in intestine and liver, produce triglyceride. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein unites triglyceride, cholesterol, and phospholipids, with tissue-specific isoforms of apolipoprotein (apo) B, i.e. small B-48, shortened as a result of RNA editing in enterocytes and full-length B-100 in hepatocytes, forming chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein, respectively. Chylomicrons formation also requires Sar1 homolog B GTPase (SAR1B gene product, not shown). Chylomicrons enter plasma indirectly through lymphatics while very-low-density lipoprotein is secreted directly into the circulation. Hydrolysis of circulating chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoprotein by lipoprotein lipase releases free fatty acids and produce chylomicron remnant clearance and intermediate-density lipoprotein particles, respectively. Chylomicrons remnant clearance by the liver (not shown) requires apo E, as apo B-48 does not have the low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain. Intermediate-density lipoprotein can also be removed by the liver (not shown) with apo B-100 and apo E both acting as ligands for the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Intermediate-density lipoprotein can be further lipolyzed by lipoprotein lipase and also remodelled by hepatic lipase to generate low-density lipoprotein, which is cleared by the low-density lipoprotein receptor, whose activity is reduced by proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9. The inset depicts lipoprotein lipase activity on a triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle as well as several interacting proteins at the endothelial surface that affect lipoprotein lipase activity. A plus sign indicates enhancement or stimulation of lipolysis, whereas a minus sign indicates inhibition. Lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) is a chaperone protein that ensures that lipoprotein lipase attains functionality and is properly secreted from adipose cells or myocytes. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein-1 (GPIHBP1) is necessary for transcytosis of lipoprotein lipase across the endothelium of capillaries in adipose and muscle tissues as well as tethering lipoprotein lipase to the endothelium, thereby stabilizing it. Apo C-II activates lipoprotein lipase, while apo A-V is a stabilizing cofactor. Lipolysis is reduced by apo C-III, which is a component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and by angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4 (ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4), which both operate near the endothelium. Volanesorsen and AKCEA-APOCIII-LRx reduce triglyceride by targeting apo C-III, while evinacumab and IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx lower triglyceride by targeting ANGPTL3. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (not shown), particularly alpha and delta types, form a regulatory network that influences several of the above target molecules. Adapted from Ref.

### Comparison of the effects of fibrates versus statins on plasma lipoprotein (a) concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^117RQEgK]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Mixed dyslipidemia is characterized by high serum concentrations of total and LDL-C as well as of triglycerides. Statins and fibrates are among the first-line pharmacotherapies for mixed dyslipidemia. Findings of clinical trials have shown that the combination of statins and fibrates results in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C and triglyceride levels and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with monotherapy with either drug. In addition, both statins and fibrates have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, these classes of drug affect different aspects of lipoprotein metabolism. Fibrates decrease serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and increase HDL-C levels in hyperlipidemic patients, thereby reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The main mechanisms of action of fibrates are induction of lipoprotein lipolysis, induction of hepatic fatty acid uptake and reduction of hepatic triglyceride production, enhancement of hepatic removal of LDL particles, reduction of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and elevation of HDL production.

Statins mainly act through enhancement of plasma clearance of LDL and reduction of hepatic very low-density lipoprotein production. Statins reduce hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, causing depletion of intracellular cholesterol content and resulting in an increase in the expression and density of hepatic LDL receptors.

Owing to the importance of Lp(a) as an emerging coronary risk factor, and the wide use of statins and fibrates in the management dyslipidemias, the present study aimed to compare the effects of these two classes of drugs on plasma Lp(a) concentrations through a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials. A secondary aim was to assess if combination therapy with statins and fibrates is associated with a greater effect on plasma Lp(a) levels compared with monotherapy with either of the agents.

### Effects of extended-release niacin on the postprandial metabolism of Lp (a) and apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in statin-treated men with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1139Lu4g]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of extended-release niacin (ERN; 1–2 g/d) on the metabolism of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-containing lipoproteins were investigated in 11 statin-treated white men with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a randomized, crossover trial of 12-weeks duration.

Approach and Results

The kinetics of Lp(a) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100 were determined following a standardized oral fat load (87% fat) using intravenous administration of D3-leucine, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and compartmental modeling. ERN significantly decreased fasting plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. These effects were achieved without significant changes in body weight or insulin resistance. ERN significantly decreased plasma Lp(a) concentration (-26.5%) and the production rates of apo(a) (-41.5%) and Lp(a)-apoB-100 (-32.1%); the effect was greater in individuals with elevated Lp(a) concentration. ERN significantly decreased VLDL (-58.7%), intermediate-density lipoprotein (-33.6%), and LDL (-18.3%) apoB-100 concentrations and the corresponding production rates (VLDL, -49.8%; intermediate-density lipoprotein, -44.7%; LDL, -46.1%). The number of VLDL apoB-100 particles secreted increased in response to the oral fat load. Despite this, total VLDL apoB-100 production over the 10-hour postprandial period was significantly decreased with ERN (-21.9%).

Conclusions

In statin-treated men with type 2 diabetes mellitus, ERN decreased plasma Lp(a) concentrations by decreasing the production of apo(a) and Lp(a)-apoB-100. ERN also decreased the concentrations of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by decreasing VLDL production and the transport of these particles down the VLDL to LDL cascade. Our study provides further mechanistic insights into the lipid-regulating effects of ERN.

### Emerging LDL therapies: mipomersen-antisense oligonucleotide therapy in the management of hypercholesterolemia [^111ZqMwL]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by severe elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and poses considerable treatment challenges. Substantive LDL-C reductions are difficult to achieve with standard therapies, and many patients with FH do not tolerate currently available lipid-lowering medications. Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide injectable drug that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of homozygous FH. It is complementary in sequence to a segment of the human apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100 messenger RNA and specifically binds to it, blocking translation of the gene product. Reducing the production of Apo B-100 reduces hepatic production of very low-density lipoprotein, consequently decreasing circulating levels of atherogenic very low-density lipoprotein remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins, LDL, and lipoprotein(a) particles. Results from a pivotal trial conducted in patients with homozygous FH, and supporting trials in patients with heterozygous FH with coronary artery disease (CAD) (LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL, triglycerides < 200 mg/dL), severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 300 mg/dL or ≥ 200 mg/dL with CAD), and individuals at high risk for CAD (LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL, triglycerides ≤ 200 mg/dL), have indicated that mipomersen reduces all Apo B-containing atherogenic lipoproteins. The average LDL-C reduction was > 100 mg/dL in homozygous FH and severe hypercholesterolemia populations. The main on-treatment adverse events were mild-to-moderate injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Available data regarding the efficacy, safety and tolerability of mipomersen, including results at up to 104 weeks of therapy, support the use of mipomersen for the treatment of FH.

### Comparing the effects of ipragliflozin versus metformin on visceral fat reduction and metabolic dysfunction in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin: a prospective, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled study (PRIME-V study) [^115AX65n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The extent to which HbA1c levels were reduced was greater in the metformin versus ipragliflozin group at 24 weeks. The combination of sitagliptin and metformin reportedly augments GLP‐1 secretion, 14 which might have contributed to this result. Moreover, metformin increased HOMA‐beta, a marker of pancreatic insulin secretion, suggesting that the combination of metformin with DPP‐4i is suitable for Japanese patients with low insulin secretion and without excess visceral fat.

Clustering of multiple risk factors can remarkably increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), even when the involved risk factors have mild individual impacts. Therefore, it is important to manage lipids and fasting glucose levels to efficiently prevent ASCVD. In the present study, both drugs had positive effects on improving dyslipidaemia. Ipragliflozin was associated with increased HDL‐cholesterol and decreased triglyceride levels. It is assumed that a decrease in visceral adiposity leads to a reduction of free fatty acid influx into the liver, which results in lower production of very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride. 15 Moreover, increased insulin sensitivity may improve lipoprotein lipase activity, 16 facilitating VLDL‐triacylglycerol hydrolysis and HDL maturation. 17 However, ipragliflozin increased LDL‐cholesterol. Previous studies have shown that SGLT2is increase LDL‐cholesterol levels. 7, 18 In fasting conditions, SGLT2 inhibition switches from carbohydrate to fat oxidation and stimulates ketone body production and hepatic cholesterol synthesis. These metabolic alterations result in lower LDL receptor expression and moderate increases in LDL‐cholesterol levels. 19 By contrast, metformin lowered LDL‐cholesterol levels, through increased recycling of LDL receptors via reduced arachidonic acid in the liver. 20 The decrease in LDL‐cholesterol was observed in parallel with a decrease in total cholesterol. There were no significant differences in changes in blood pressure between the two groups.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112ZF27Q]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chart 13 — residual risk management after statin and lifestyle therapy outlines that fibrates and prescription omega-3 fatty acids are first-line drug choices for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, and consideration may be given to using statin therapy as a first-line drug in patients with TG 500–999 without a history of pancreatitis (E Moderate). In patients with elevated TG (200 to 499 mg/dL) on maximum tolerated statin therapy who are at their LDL-C goal but not their non-HDL-C goal, the addition of therapies that primarily lower TG and VLDL-C (fibrates, high-dose omega-3 fatty acids) may be considered to help achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals, particularly when elevated TG coexists with low HDL-C (B Moderate). For patients not at goal levels for atherogenic cholesterol on maximally tolerated statin therapy, consideration should be given to adding non-statin lipid-altering therapy to ongoing statin therapy when ASCVD risk and benefit justify it (B Moderate). Recommended combination options, in order, are ezetimibe 10 mg every day; colesevelam 625 mg 3 tablets twice a day (or 3.75 g powder form every day or in divided doses); and extended release niacin titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg, daily (B Moderate). Until cardiovascular outcomes trials are completed with PCSK9 inhibitors, these drugs should be considered primarily in 1) patients with ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin (± ezetimibe) therapy; and 2) heterozygous FH patients without ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin (± ezetimibe) therapy (B Moderate). PCSK9 inhibitor use may be considered for selected high risk patients with ASCVD who have levels below those specified but above goals (i.e. LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL [non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL]) based on clinical judgment (C Low), and may also be considered in selected high or very high risk patients with statin intolerance who require substantial additional atherogenic cholesterol lowering despite other therapies (C Low).

### Long-term experience with lomitapide treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: over 10 years of efficacy and safety data [^116LoAeQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Lomitapide mechanism of action in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): Lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes and enterocytes, preventing assembly of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]) and lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) via mechanisms independent of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). It binds directly to MTP in the endoplasmic reticulum and acts independently of the LDLR, being effective in HoFH with absent or very low LDLR residual functionality.

### Atherogenic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic options beyond statins [^115dUXnd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence also suggests that there is a 'fibrate effect' that mediates the reduction in CAD risk beyond the favorable impact of these agents on HDL-C levels. This last notion is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of fibrates which are known to be related to their mechanisms of action. Through PPAR alpha, fibrates have a significant impact on the synthesis of several apolipoproteins (apo) and enzymes of lipoprotein metabolism as well as on the expression of several genes involved in fibrinolysis and inflammation. Such changes contribute to improve the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to a substantial increase in HDL-C levels accompanied by a shift in the size and density of LDL particles: from small, dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant cholesteryl ester-rich LDL. These observations becomes particularly important given the dramatic increase in obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, conditions associated with low HDL and high triglyceride levels and small, dense LDL particles, the lipid profile for which fibrates would seem to be ideally suited.

However, different fibrates may have a somewhat different spectrum of effects. Pooled together evidence suggests, that gemfibrozil and bezafibrate have optimum cardiovascular benefit in metabolic syndrome and/or other appearances of insulin resistance.

Nicotinic acid

Nicotinic acid (or niacin) has beneficial effects on all traditional blood lipid and lipoprotein fractions, particularly for increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and reducing lipoprotein(a). Nicotinic acid has been used for the treatment of dyslipidemia since the 1950's, but the mechanism of action has only recently been elucidated. Niacin, a vitamin of the B complex which participates in tissue respiration oxidation-reduction reactions, decreases the fractional catabolic rate of apoA-I via reduction in hepatocytes uptake. Increasing apoA-I would facilitate greater RCT by making apoA-I more bioavailable to remove excess cellular cholesterol from the arterial wall macrophage. Niacin also inhibits hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of triglycerides destined for VLDL. Nicotinic acid additionally inhibits adipose tissue lipolysis by inhibiting hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase. It is through this combination of action that nicotinic acid exerts its changes upon lipid parameters – increased HDL, lowered LDL and TG – and the clinical consequences of these effects have been positively borne out in clinical trials.

### Niacin [^114ghj8x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined. It may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of VLDL and LDL, and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats, sterols, or bile acids.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Due to extensive and saturable first-pass metabolism, niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable. Time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extended-release. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) upset, administration of niacin extended-release with a low-fat meal or snack is recommended.

Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent.

Metabolism

The pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive first-pass metabolism that is dose-rate specific and, at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia, saturable. In humans, one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid (NUA). NUA is then excreted in the urine, although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin. The other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). It is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to, or following the synthesis of, NAD. Nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NNO). MNA is further metabolized to two other compounds, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4PY). The formation of 2PY appears to predominate over 4PY in humans. At the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia, these metabolic pathways are saturable, which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multiple-dose niacin extended-release administration.

### The short-term effects of vitamin D repletion on cholesterol: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^117W7JXS]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Vitamin D deficiency is common and associated with dyslipidemia. However, it is unclear whether oral vitamin D supplementation improves the lipid profile. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the short-term effects of vitamin D repletion on the lipid profile.

Methods and Results

One hundred fifty-one vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL) adults with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive either 50 000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number. Secondary outcomes included changes in other nuclear magnetic resonance-based and chemical lipid fractions. Vitamin D failed to improve the lipid profile. Compared with the placebo, vitamin D repletion did not change small LDL particle number (mean change, +18 nmol/L; 95% CI [-80 to +116 nmol/L]; P = 0.63). There were also no changes in the chemical lipid profile: total cholesterol (+5.8 mg/dL, 95% CI [-1.4 to +13.0 mg/dL], P = 0.14); LDL cholesterol (+3.8 mg/dL, 95% CI [-2.5 to +10.2 mg/dL], P = 0.13); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.4 mg/dL 95% CI [-1.6 to +2.6 mg/dL], P = 0.71); and triglycerides (+7.9 mg/dL 95% CI [-6.5 to +22.3 mg/dL]). In the vitamin D repletion group, exploratory multivariate regression analysis demonstrates that changes in LDL cholesterol were positively correlated with the changes in serum calcium (P < 0.001) and inversely with the changes in serum parathyroid hormone (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In contrast to the association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and dyslipidemia, correcting vitamin D deficiency in the short-term does not improve the lipid profile. Repletion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels raised serum calcium levels and decreased serum parathyroid hormone levels. These expected physiological responses to vitamin D therapy were correlated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01008384.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^112rpny1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Drugs affecting lipoprotein metabolism (Table 13) — statins lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ↓18%–55%, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) by ↓15%–51%, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by ↑5%–15%, and reduce triglycerides (TG) by ↓7%–30%; TG reduction with statins is higher in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, producing reductions in the range of 20% to 50%. Bile acid sequestrants lower LDL-C by ↓15%–30%, non–HDL-C by ↓4%–16%, raise HDL-C by ↑3%–5%, and TG 0%–10%. Nicotinic acid lowers LDL-C by ↓5%–25%, non–HDL-C by ↓8%–23%, raises HDL-C by ↑15%–35%, and reduces TG by ↓20%–50%. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor lowers LDL-C by ↓13%–20%, non–HDL-C by ↓14%–19%, raises HDL-C by ↑3%–5%, and lowers TG by ↓5%–11%. LDL-C may increase in patients with very high triglycerides when using fibric acids or long-chain omega-3 fatty acid drugs except for omega-3 products that contain eicosapentaenoic acid only, and no docosahexaenoic acid.

### Long-term experience with lomitapide treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: over 10 years of efficacy and safety data [^113Tjpgb]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) management and lomitapide are outlined with key targets and mechanisms: HoFH is described as a rare disease with loss of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) function and extreme elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from birth, with patients frequently diagnosed late and at markedly elevated risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The current European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on the treatment of HoFH recommends an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD or major ASCVD risk factors, < 70 mg/dL for adults without ASCVD risk factors, and < 115 mg/dL for pediatric patients without ASCVD; achieving these targets is challenging, necessitating combination lipid-lowering therapy including statins, ezetimibe, lipoprotein apheresis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), lomitapide, and evinacumab. Lomitapide is a small molecule inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that reduces production of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins and whose mechanism of action is independent of LDLR; this review summarizes available evidence for lomitapide use in HoFH.

### The role of thyroid hormone in metabolism and metabolic syndrome [^113wtRwU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid function acting on lipid metabolism related to metabolic syndrome

The lipid abnormalities related to MetS are hypertriglyceridemia and low serum HDL-c levels. These abnormalities will be the focus of the present revision despite a high number of studies evaluating several other alterations in lipid profile associated with thyroid function.

THs have effects throughout the whole body, stimulating both lipid synthesis and degradation, but in the hyperthyroid condition, there is a predominant increase in lipolysis from fat stores. In the liver, THs stimulate the re-esterification of free fatty acids into triacylglycerol and also induce de novo lipogenesis from glucose metabolism. However, THs also concurrently stimulate fatty-acid oxidation, and, under physiological conditions, the result is a balance that does not increase hepatic triacylglycerol levels. The mechanisms of TH action involve direct regulation of the transcription rate of specific lipogenic/oxidative genes, in addition to alterations in the concentrations of metabolites, energy state of the cells, and post-translational modifications of proteins involved in the liver lipid metabolism.

TH increases cholesterol clearance because even though they stimulate endogenous cholesterol synthesis, they potently increase hepatic cholesterol uptake and excretion as bile acids. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-c accumulates in the serum of hypothyroid patients since the LDL-receptor and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) are under-expressed in hypothyroidism. LDL-receptors mediate liver uptake of cholesterol that comes from peripheral tissues. SREBP2 is a key transcription factor that induces the expression of lipogenic-related genes, including Ldlr. Levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver and in serum are influenced by lipoprotein lipases that are up-regulated by thyroid hormones, a mechanism that may contribute to the high serum triglycerides in hypothyroidism. In addition, ApoB100 levels are reduced by THs contributing to the increase in VLDL and LDL production observed in the liver during hypothyroidism.

### Gut microbiota-associated activation of TLR5 induces apolipoprotein A1 production in the liver [^116YBo7J]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In This Issue, see p

Meet the First Author, see p

HDL (High-density lipoprotein) is strongly associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. – The apolipoprotein on HDL, ApoA1, facilitates reverse cholesterol transport by acquiring phospholipids and cholesterol through its interaction with ATP-binding cassette transporters on macrophages, thus preventing foam cell formation, a key etiological feature of atherogenesis. Low-fat diet (LFD) aiming to decrease LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) has been advocated for decades to improve cardiovascular health, but several clinical studies fail to show any reduced risk. – One of the reasons is due to the parallel decrease in HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) level by low fat intake. People with normolipidemia are not benefited upon LFD compared with those with dyslipidemia owing to the unchanged LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. In mice, high-fat diet (HFD) treatment increases both HDL-C and LDL-C levels. How dietary fat leads to increased HDL-C remains unclear.

Gut microbiota refers to the trillions of bacteria residing in our gastrointestinal tract which exerts commensal effects to us as host. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated with various diseases, including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. HFD can weaken gut integrity leading to metabolic endotoxemia, and such effect is partially due to the decrease in a particular strain of gut bacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila. Oral supplementation of A muciniphila by preserving gut integrity ameliorates systemic inflammation and subsequently protects against obesity and atherosclerosis. Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei are able to inhibit atherosclerosis through reducing gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production. Conversely, a positive correlation between circulating trimethylamine N-oxide, a bacteria-derived metabolite from dietary choline, and cardiovascular risk is observed in human. These studies suggest that different types of gut microbiota can yield different medical outcomes.

### Effect of fenofibrate and niacin on intrahepatic triglyceride content, very low-density lipoprotein kinetics, and insulin action in obese subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116BeyKz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, particularly increased plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations and insulin resistance. Fenofibrate and extended release nicotinic acid (Niaspan) are used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and can affect fatty acid oxidation and plasma free fatty acid concentrations, which influence intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content and metabolic function.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the effects of fenofibrate and nicotinic acid therapy on IHTG content and cardiovascular risk factors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects of fenofibrate (8 wk, 200 mg/d), Niaspan (16 wk, 2000 mg/d), or placebo (8 wk) on IHTG content, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) kinetics, and insulin sensitivity.

Setting and Participants

Twenty-seven obese subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (body mass index 36 ± 1 kg/m(2), IHTG 23 ± 2%) were studied at Washington University.

Results

Neither fenofibrate nor Niaspan affected IHTG content, but both decreased plasma TG, VLDL-TG, and VLDL-apolipoprotein B concentrations (P < 0.05). Fenofibrate increased VLDL-TG clearance from plasma (33 to 54 ml/min; P < 0.05) but not VLDL-TG secretion. Niaspan decreased VLDL-TG secretion (27 to 15 micromol/min; P < 0.05) without affecting clearance. Both fenofibrate and Niaspan decreased VLDL-apolipoprotein B secretion (1.6 to 1.2 and 1.3 to 0.9 nmol/min, respectively; P < 0.05). Niaspan reduced hepatic, adipose tissue, and muscle insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05), whereas fenofibrate had no effect on insulin action.

Conclusions

Fenofibrate and Niaspan decrease plasma VLDL-TG concentration without altering IHTG content. However, the mechanism responsible for the change in VLDL-TG concentration is different for each drug; fenofibrate increases plasma VLDL-TG clearance, whereas nicotinic acid decreases VLDL-TG secretion.

### Understanding PCSK9 and anti-PCSK9 therapies [^116XgLi8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) represent a new therapeutic category of drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To appreciate the efficacy of these agents and interpret research results, it is important to understand the dynamic relationship between PCSK9, low-density lipoprotein-receptors, intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis, and blood cholesterol levels. Drugs which negate the action of PCSK9 can produce substantial reductions in atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol-carrying particles and thereby hold the potential for further reducing events associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This article will describe and discuss PCSK9 interactive mechanisms and apply them to the interpretation of clinical trial results, which involve PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies.

### Mechanism of action of niacin [^115GkTMe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Nicotinic acid (niacin) has long been used for the treatment of lipid disorders and cardiovascular disease. Niacin favorably affects apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (eg, very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], lipoprotein[a]) and increases apo A-I-containing lipoproteins (high-density lipoprotein [HDL]). Recently, new discoveries have enlarged our understanding of the mechanism of action of niacin and challenged older concepts. There are new data on (1) how niacin affects triglycerides (TGs) and apo B-containing lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, (2) how it affects apo A-I and HDL metabolism, (3) how it affects vascular anti-inflammatory events, (4) a specific niacin receptor in adipocytes and immune cells, (5) how niacin causes flushing, and (6) the characterization of a niacin transport system in liver and intestinal cells. New findings indicate that niacin directly and noncompetitively inhibits hepatocyte diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, a key enzyme for TG synthesis. The inhibition of TG synthesis by niacin results in accelerated intracellular hepatic apo B degradation and the decreased secretion of VLDL and LDL particles. Previous kinetic studies in humans and recent in vitro cell culture findings indicate that niacin retards mainly the hepatic catabolism of apo A-I (vs apo A-II) but not scavenger receptor BI-mediated cholesterol esters. Decreased HDL-apo A-I catabolism by niacin explains the increases in HDL half-life and concentrations of lipoprotein A-I HDL subfractions, which augment reverse cholesterol transport. Initial data suggest that niacin, by inhibiting the hepatocyte surface expression of beta-chain adenosine triphosphate synthase (a recently reported HDL-apo A-I holoparticle receptor), inhibits the removal of HDL-apo A-I. Recent studies indicate that niacin increases vascular endothelial cell redox state, resulting in the inhibition of oxidative stress and vascular inflammatory genes, key cytokines involved in atherosclerosis. The niacin flush results from the stimulation of prostaglandins D(2) and E(2) by subcutaneous Langerhans cells via the G protein-coupled receptor 109A niacin receptor. Although decreased free fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue via the G protein-coupled receptor 109A niacin receptor has been a widely suggested mechanism of niacin to decrease TGs, physiologically and clinically, this pathway may be only a minor factor in explaining the lipid effects of niacin.

### The nicotinic acid receptor – a new mechanism for an old drug [^111tqkQH]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Non-esterified fatty acids in plasma originate from adipose tissue. Delivery of fatty acids to the liver provides the substrate for VLDL triglycerides. Insulin-sensitive organs, overburdened by high concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, may develop resistance to insulin action. In addition, insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells may be impaired by long-standing elevation of concentrations of non-esterified fatty acid in plasma. Normally, such concentrations fluctuate over the day depending on the transient suppression of lipolysis from adipose tissue by insulin released after meals. Diurnal concentrations of non-esterified fatty acid are often elevated in obesity, in particular in male-pattern upper-body fat accumulation. Nicotinic acid is the only drug that primarily lowers concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids and thereby lowers VLDL triglycerides. Nicotinic acid, or its analogues, seems to alleviate insulin resistance in the short-term whereas, paradoxically, the long-term effect is often the opposite. Suppression of lipolysis by nicotinic acid gives rise to a prominent rebound and the degree to which this occurs might explain this paradox.

Starting Point

The exact cellular mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts its antilipolytic effects has not been known until the recent discovery of a distinct G-protein coupled receptor. Nicotinic acid is a high affinity ligand, but the endogenous ligand is still unknown. Recently, Tina Rubic and colleagues (Biochem Pharmacol 2004; 67: 411–19) proposed a mechanism in which nicotinic acid stimulates cholesterol mobilisation from macrophages, thereby providing a potential link between regression of atherosclerosis and use of nicotinic acid.

Where Next

Research on signalling through the nicotinic acid receptor might give rise to novel and more effective methods to interfere with fatty-acid metabolism, with insulin resistance, hyperlipidaemia, and atherosclerosis as target diseases.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^114SsxhC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Lp(a) is a covalent conjugate of an LDL‐like lipoprotein particle and apolipoprotein(a). Prospective longitudinal cohort and Mendelian randomization studies confirm that elevated levels of Lp(a) are causally associated with risk for ASCVD‐related events. 1, 5, 6, 21, 22 Neither statins nor ezetimibe impact serum levels of Lp(a). Nicotinic acid was long heralded as a therapy that reduced Lp(a). 23 In a post hoc analysis of the AIM HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial, there was no demonstrable impact of the limited extent of Lp(a) lowering with nicotinic acid on risk for cardiovascular events. 24 In a recent kinetic analysis by Watts et al, it was shown that evolocumab therapy decreases hepatic production of Lp(a) when used as monotherapy and increases the clearance of Lp(a) when used in combination with a statin, 25 likely via a LDL receptor–dependent pathway. 26, 27 In the FOURIER trial, evolocumab reduced Lp(a) by a median of 26.9%, consistent with our findings herein. 28 This analysis of FOURIER also demonstrated that higher baseline Lp(a) concentration helped to identify individuals with greater clinical efficacy with evolocumab, raising the possibility that in addition to LDL lowering, concurrent reduction in Lp(a) by evolocumab may have provided incremental risk reduction.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^116Rau2d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia — abstract emphasizes that lifestyle habits can have a profound impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and outlines an update focused on three dyslipidemia patterns in adults: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) elevation, triglyceride (TG) elevation including severe hypertriglyceridemia with chylomicronemia, and combined dyslipidemia with elevations in both LDL-C and TG levels. Lowering LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are stated as the primary objectives for reducing ASCVD risk, while with severe TG elevation (≥ 500 mg/dL) the primary objective is to prevent pancreatitis and ASCVD risk reduction is secondary. Nutrition interventions to lower LDL-C include reducing cholesterol-raising fatty acids and dietary cholesterol, and increasing intakes of unsaturated fatty acids, plant proteins.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia and risk of coronary artery disease [^112UoNUm]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

An elevated serum level of LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of elevated triglyceride levels is debated. Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality.

### Postprandial triglyceride reduction following acute treatment of a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-2c agonist and characterization using a semi-physiological model [^113ymKqF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and postprandial triglyceride (TG) response of single, escalating oral doses of a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-2c (5-HT 2c) agonist in subjects with overweight/obesity and apply mechanistic population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling to identify a plausible drug mechanism of action.

Materials and Methods

This phase 1, single-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-period, two-alternating cohorts study evaluated single escalating oral doses ranging from 5 to 130mg of LY2140112 (LY) in subjects with overweight/obesity (body mass index: 27–39kg/m 2). Postprandial TG response (total TG, chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles [VLDL]-V6) following a high-fat meal were assessed for 11 h postmeal for each dose level. The PK profile was assessed for 96h postdose. Drug exposure and TG concentrations in chylomicrons and VLDL-V6 were used to characterize the drug mechanism of action using non-linear mixed-effect modelling.

Results

Seventeen subjects entered the study and 16 subjects received at least one dose of LY. LY2140112 was generally well tolerated up to 75mg. The PK of LY were described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. The 100and 130mg dose levels of LY significantly reduced the postprandial TG of VLDL-V6 by approximately 50%, while total TG and chylomicrons were not significantly different from placebo. The application of a published lipokinetic model successfully described the postprandial TG response in this study and indicated that LY reduced the conversion of TGs from chylomicron to VLDL-V6.

Conclusions

LY significantly reduced the postprandial TG of VLDL-V6 following a single dose, when food consumption was controlled. The data indicate that a selective 5-HT 2c agonist alters lipid metabolism, beyond the reported reduction in satiety. The application of a semi-physiological lipokinetic model enabled identification of a plausible drug mechanism of action of LY.

### Extended-release niacin alters the metabolism of plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoB-containing lipoproteins [^115Hh5s4]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Extended-release niacin effectively lowers plasma TG levels and raises plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, but the mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear.

Methods and Results

We examined the effects of extended-release niacin (2 g/d) and extended-release niacin (2 g/d) plus lovastatin (40 mg/d), relative to placebo, on the kinetics of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II in HDL, apoB-100 in TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and apoB-48 in TRL in 5 men with combined hyperlipidemia. Niacin significantly increased HDL cholesterol and apoA-I concentrations, associated with a significant increase in apoA-I production rate (PR) and no change in fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Plasma TRL apoB-100 levels were significantly lowered by niacin, accompanied by a trend toward an increase in FCR and no change in PR. Niacin treatment significantly increased TRL apoB-48 FCR but had no effect on apoB-48 PR. No effects of niacin on concentrations or kinetic parameters of IDL and LDL apoB-100 and HDL apoA-II were noted. The addition of lovastatin to niacin promoted a lowering in LDL apoB-100 attributable to increased LDL apoB-100 FCR.

Conclusions

Niacin treatment was associated with significant increases in HDL apoA-I concentrations and production, as well as enhanced clearance of TRL apoB-100 and apoB-48.

### Niacin (Niacor) [^116kr34R]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) in gram doses produces an average 10% to 20% reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, a 30% to 70% reduction in triglycerides, and an average 20% to 35% increase in HDL cholesterol. The magnitude of individual lipid and lipoprotein responses may be influenced by the severity and type of underlying lipid abnormality. The increase in total HDL is associated with a shift in the distribution of HDL sub-fractions (as defined by ultra-centrifugation) with an increase in the HDL2:HDL3ratio and an increase in apolipoprotein A-I content. The mechanism by which nicotinic acid exerts these effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Nicotinic acid treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, and of lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], a variant form of LDL independently associated with coronary risk. The effect of nicotinic acid-induced changes in lipids/lipoproteins on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in individuals without pre-existing coronary disease has not been established.

Pharmacokinetics

Following an oral dose, the pharmacokinetic profile of nicotinic acid is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short plasma elimination half-life. At a 1 gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 µg/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes.

Mechanisms of action of plant sterols/stanols (PS) — lipid lowering: PS lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption via competition with cholesterol for limited space in mixed micelles and by increasing enterocyte efflux of sterols through up-regulation of ABCG5 and ABCG8 transporters, which reduces hepatic cholesterol content, up-regulates hepatic LDL receptors, removes apo B–containing lipoproteins from blood, and lowers LDL-C.

### Low-density lipoprotein apheresis: principles and indications [^112hFyu6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis describes a group of apheresis techniques that selectively remove apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins producing an acute reduction in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Six devices are available for the removal of LDL-C while sparing other important plasma components. The LDL-apheresis (LDL-A) is not routinely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, which usually responds to medical management, but is used to treat familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited metabolic abnormality resulting in premature death due to progressive coronary artery disease, and to treat patients who fail medical management. The mechanism of action of the available LDL-A devices, reactions that can occur with these treatments, and the role of this specialized apheresis technique in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia are described.

### Extended-release niacin and hyperlipidemia management… [^112keusW]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Niacin lowers lipids by inhibiting very-low-density lipoprotein production in the liver and reducing the level of VLDL that can be converted into low-density lipoprotein. Niacin can lower LDL cholesterol by 10 to 25 percent and triglyceride levels by 20 to 50 percent, and can raise levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol by 15 to 35 percent. These effects may be even greater in patients with a predominance of small, dense LDL, which has been associated with greater coronary heart disease risk. For these reasons, niacin is considered a useful treatment in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. The adverse effects of immediate-acting niacin preparations, including flushing, itching, gastrointestinal upset and hepatotoxicity, have limited its use. An extended-release form, called Niaspan, was designed to be taken nightly to minimize liver toxicity and other side effects.

Fifty-one patients terminated the study early; 31 of them withdrew for medical reasons. One half of the extended-release niacin group dropped out because of flushing or rash. The extended-release niacin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and significant increases in HDL levels, beginning with the 500-mg per day dosage and apparent at all subsequent dosage levels. Significant decreases in the triglyceride level occurred in patients taking 1, 000 mg per day of the extended-release niacin and were apparent at all subsequent dosage levels. None of these changes occurred in the placebo recipients. A significant decrease in platelet count was noted in patients taking the niacin preparation, but there were no incidents of bleeding or bruising in these patients.

Although the frequency of hepatotoxicity represented by hepatic enzyme effects is probably similar with both preparations, the extended-release formulation causes a lower uric acid rise. Taking the extended-release formulation at bedtime may diminish lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids to the liver, limiting the usual diurnal increase in plasma triglycerides. This may result in decreased formation and secretion of triglyceride in the VLDL cholesterol fraction. Once-daily nighttime dosing may also increase compliance. The use of niacin alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents, such as statins, has now become an easier option. — r. s.

They raise high-density liporotein cholesterol levels a modest 3% to 10% and lower triglyceride levels 15% to 35% depending on baseline triglyceride levels. 1, 8. Niacin indirectly affects LDL-C by reducing synthesis of the LDL precursor, very low-density lipoprotein. It decreases the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue and the resultant decrease in triglyceride levels reduces hepatic synthesis and triglyceride content of VLDL. 16, 17 Niacin also inhibits synthesis of apolipoprotein B-100, essential for the assembly of VLDL particles, 18 and enhances VLDL catabolism by inducing lipoprotein lipase. 17, 19. Niacin's effects on lipid levels have been shown to be additive when combined with other lipid-altering therapies. In the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study, niacin plus the bile acid sequestrant colestipol reduced LDL-C level by 43% and raised HDL-C level by 37% after 2 years and by 40% and 37%, respectively, after 4 years of treatment.

33, 34 Similarly, in FATS, 2½ years of niacin-colestipol therapy reduced LDL-C levels by 32% and raised HDL-C levels by 43%.
35. Given the superior efficacies of niacin and statins on HDL-C and LDL-C, respectively, combining them provides a regimen with greater overall lipid-altering efficacy than either drug can provide alone. 1 In one study, patients assigned to niacin plus fluvastatin had significantly greater reductions in both LDL-C and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio than patients receiving niacin plus placebo.
36. Both niacin and fibrates can be effective choices for lowering LDL-C and triglyceride levels and raising HDL-C levels, and both have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Thus, choosing between them often depends on specific patient factors. As previously discussed, one factor is the presence of hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates usually increase rather than reduce LDL-C levels. 1, 60.

Niacin similarly did not affect LDL-C, but increased HDL-C levels by 30% and decreased triglyceride levels by 35%.

### Efficacy of extended-release niacin with lovastatin for hypercholesterolemia… [^116xZo9T]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Despite recent advances in prevention and treatment, coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. 1 The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are highly effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and have lesser effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Convergent lines of epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggest that low HDL-C levels and hypertriglyceridemia are also appropriate targets for intervention. 8–13 Niacin is the most potent agent available for elevating HDL-C level. 14 It also reduces TG and lipoprotein levels but has a lesser effect on LDL-C level. In the Coronary Drug Project, niacin therapy reduced the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction 27%, stroke 24%, and long-term mortality 11% compared with placebo. 15, 16.

The changes in TC, TG, and VLDL-C levels were approximately equal to the sum of changes induced by the individual components. Lipoprotein levels tended to increase slightly at lower doses of lovastatin and niacin ER but generally decreased progressively with niacin ER doses 1000 mg or above, alone or in combination. The effects of the individual drugs in combination were generally additive for LDL-C and TG and, except at higher doses, for HDL-C. This latter result may suggest a plateau effect for HDL-C above a niacin ER dose of 2000 mg. The effects of combination treatment were also much greater than those achieved by doubling the lovastatin dose alone. raising HDL-C and lowering TG levels, in the absence of any change in LDL-C level, was associated with significant reductions in coronary events. 13 Moreover, the substantial risk reductions observed in HATS approximated the reduction predicted by epidemiologic studies based on the percent decrease in LDL-C level plus the.

Our data show that combination therapy with niacin and a statin results in favorable changes in all 4 lipoprotein classes that are independently associated with the risk of developing CHD. Future clinical trials are needed to directly compare combination therapy with niacin and a statin against statin monotherapy to test the hypothesis that such broad control of dyslipidemia will result in greater reductions in coronary risk and will cause regression of arterial lesions of atherosclerosis.

### Effect of niacin on lipid and lipoprotein levels and glycemic control in patients with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease… [^1135d2AF]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context Although niacin increases low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which frequently accompany diabetes, current guidelines do not recommend use of niacin in patients with diabetes because of concerns about adverse effects on glycemic control; however, this is based on limited clinical data. Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of lipid-modifying dosages of niacin. niacin vs placebo. Results Niacin use significantly increased HDL-C by 29% and 29% and decreased triglycerides by 23% and 28% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% and 9%, respectively, in participants with and without diabetes. Corresponding. changes in participants receiving placebo were increases of 0% and 2% in HDL-C and increases of 7% and 0% in triglycerides, and increases of 1% and 1% in LDL-C. Glucose levels were modestly increased by niacin. Following randomization, HDL-C levels continued to increase and triglycerides decreased further in participants both with and without diabetes randomized to active. niacin. Table 2 summarizes the baseline and treatment lipoprotein values by diabetes status and niacin treatment assignment. Niacin treatment resulted in significant decreases in LDL-C and triglycerides, and increased HDL-C compared with placebo control for participants both with and without diabetes. The reduction in total cholesterol, LDL-C. on LDL-C as a risk factor, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C are common in the dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 10, 11, 13 and contribute to the increased risk of arterial vascular disease in subjects with diabetes. Despite its proven ability to increase HDL and lower triglycerides.

as the primary target of therapy, it is recognized that hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL-C are highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and are associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. 10, 13 Niacin effectively reduces plasma triglycerides by reducing hepatic production of very LDL, and increases HDL.

### Over-the-counter niacin preparations for dyslipidemia | AAFP… [^1154oiuW]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Nicotinic acid, or vitamin B 3, was used as early as 1955 to treat dyslipidemia. Daily dosages of 1, 000 to 4, 000 mg have been shown to lower triglyceride levels by 20 to 50 percent and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 10 to 25 percent, and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 10 to 30 percent. In the Coronary Drug Project, documented nicotinic acid therapy for six years reduced the frequency of nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with placebo. When combined with a bile-acid sequestrant or a statin, nicotinic acid therapy resulted in angiographic regression of atherosclerosis and fewer cardiovascular events. Side effects, however, have limited the use of nicotinic acid; patients taking low dosages report cutaneous symptoms with flushing episodes that seem to decrease with continued use. Other reported side effects include hepatotoxicity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia.

The variety of preparations and the irregularity of nicotinic acid content in over-the-counter supplements not controlled by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration make the choice of an effective preparation difficult. Meyers and associates looked at over-the-counter niacin preparations to determine the cost and the content of free nicotinic acid. However, little free nicotinic acid is released, and plasma nicotinic acid levels reach only about one tenth of the levels achieved with immediate preparations of equal dosage. Sustained-release niacin causes less flushing but may result in more hepatotoxicity. There are some favorable published data about two specific brands of sustained release preparations, Slo-Niacin and Enduracin. Niaspan, approved by the FDA, is effective and provokes less flushing but is more expensive than immediate-release preparations. Immediate-release preparations are inexpensive and have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events and death.

editor's note: Niacin was used as early as 1955 to treat dyslipidemia. Beneficial actions include decreased levels of triglycerides and apolipoprotein-B, increased HDL levels, and increased cardioprotective subfraction of HDL cholesterol in patients with low HDL levels. These actions make niacin, taken alone or in combination, a useful treatment to prevent progression and promote regression of coronary atherogenic lesions and significantly reduce coronary artery disease–related morbidity and mortality.
