## Question

What is the exact risk of lymphoma for a patient on long term Mycophenolate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the exact risk of lymphoma with long-term mycophenolate mofetil therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where mycophenolate is used and how that shapes risk. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about lymphoma and PTLD incidence. Next, I will examine high-quality cohort and registry data for quantitative estimates. After that, I need to distinguish PTLD from other lymphomas and consider EBV-related risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize an answer with absolute and relative risks, highlight uncertainties, and outline practical counseling points with appropriate caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because risk is not uniform. Mycophenolate is used in solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, and thyroid eye disease; the lymphoma signal is strongest in transplant populations via PTLD, whereas autoimmune disease cohorts generally show a much smaller or uncertain signal, so I need to keep these buckets separate in my estimates and counseling [^a3b6aa19] [^f30950a9] [^1aee3c08].

> I will now examine the FDA labeling for the most reliable incidence figures in transplant cohorts. Multiple FDA sources consistently report that post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder occurred in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 2–3 g/day with other immunosuppressants in controlled trials of kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients followed for at least 1 year, and pediatric PTLD occurred in 1.35% by 12 months in one dataset, which gives me a pragmatic absolute risk anchor for long-term therapy in transplant populations [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21] [^d67db6f2].

> Wait, let me verify whether this 0.4–1% figure reflects cumulative incidence over a fixed period or an annualized rate, because that distinction matters for long-term risk. The FDA language indicates cumulative incidence over at least 1 year of follow-up, and three-year safety data did not show unexpected changes in malignancy incidence compared with one-year data, suggesting the annual risk does not escalate dramatically with longer follow-up in those trials, though this does not capture lifetime risk beyond the trial windows [^44ba7c21] [^d67db6f2].

> Next, I should review large observational cohorts to see if they align with trial data. A prospective registry-based study of 6,751 de novo renal transplant recipients found no increased risk of lymphoma with mycophenolate compared with non-mycophenolate regimens, with relative risks of 0.4 in one registry and 1.04 in another, indicating no consistent elevation and in some analyses a trend toward lower risk, which reassures me that the boxed warning reflects class immunosuppression risk rather than a mycophenolate-specific oncogenic effect [^f464f1a2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "lymphoma" being a single entity. I need to distinguish PTLD from other lymphomas because PTLD is EBV-driven and tightly linked to transplant immunosuppression intensity and EBV serostatus. The FDA explicitly notes that most PTLD cases are EBV-related and that risk is greatest in EBV-seronegative recipients, particularly children, which explains why pediatric cohorts can show higher PTLD rates despite similar mycophenolate exposure, and this is why EBV matching and monitoring are emphasized in transplant guidance [^a3b6aa19] [^fd0ca857] [^8c76677b].

> Let me consider autoimmune disease contexts, where baseline lymphoma risk is already modestly elevated due to disease activity. In SLE and vasculitis cohorts, meta-analytic and trial data do not show a clearly increased lymphoma signal attributable to mycophenolate compared with other immunosuppressants, and in some analyses mycophenolate may carry a lower malignancy risk than cyclophosphamide, though confounding by indication and concomitant therapies persists, so I should frame this as no proven excess versus comparators rather than zero risk [^9815439d] [^f30950a9].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup or case series contradicts this. Case reports describe lymphoproliferative disorders after prolonged mycophenolate in non-transplant settings, including CNS lymphoma and EBV-associated disease, but these are rare, uncontrolled observations that cannot establish incidence; they reinforce biological plausibility and the need for vigilance in patients with new neurologic or systemic symptoms on long-term immunosuppression, especially with EBV reactivation risk, rather than providing a reliable quantitative estimate [^140ea76f] [^2f73b404].

> Now, I will synthesize the quantitative answer while acknowledging uncertainty. In solid organ transplant recipients on mycophenolate-based regimens, the best estimate for PTLD is a cumulative incidence of about 0.4% to 1% within the first year, with pediatric risk around 1.35% by 12 months in one dataset; beyond year one, available data suggest no marked increase in annual incidence, though lifetime risk remains difficult to quantify and is influenced by cumulative immunosuppression and EBV factors, so I should present this as a low but nontrivial absolute risk that is primarily PTLD rather than de novo lymphoma [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21] [^d67db6f2].

> For autoimmune disease populations, I need to be cautious. There is no robust, population-based estimate of lymphoma incidence attributable specifically to mycophenolate, and comparative data suggest no clear excess versus other immunosuppressants; if I were to extrapolate from general autoimmune cohorts, background lymphoma risk is modestly elevated versus the general population, and any incremental risk from mycophenolate appears small and unquantified, so I should avoid overstatement and emphasize that the balance of benefit versus risk remains favorable in most indications [^9815439d] [^f30950a9].

> But wait, what if the user is asking for a single number like "X per 100,000 patient-years". I should confirm that such a figure is not available from high-quality sources for mycophenolate monotherapy outside transplant PTLD, and indeed the most reliable quantitative anchor remains the 0.4–1% cumulative PTLD incidence in transplant cohorts; attempts to convert this to an annualized rate would be imprecise given variable follow-up and competing risks, so I will avoid inventing a patient-year estimate and stick to the labeled incidence range with context [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and monitoring. Patients should be informed that long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of lymphomas, particularly PTLD in transplant recipients, and that risk is driven by the intensity and duration of immunosuppression and EBV status rather than mycophenolate alone; in transplant, EBV serostatus should be assessed and monitored, and in patients with new constitutional or neurologic symptoms, EBV viral load and appropriate imaging should be considered to evaluate for PTLD, with management coordinated by the transplant team if suspected [^a3b6aa19] [^fd0ca857] [^8c76677b].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: in solid organ transplant recipients on mycophenolate-containing regimens, the estimated cumulative incidence of PTLD is approximately 0.4% to 1% within the first year, with pediatric risk around 1.35% by 12 months in one series, and longer-term annual risk does not appear to rise sharply in trial follow-up; in autoimmune disease, there is no established excess lymphoma risk attributable to mycophenolate versus comparators, though a small, unquantified increase due to immunosuppression cannot be excluded, so counseling should be individualized and grounded in the clinical context and EBV risk profile [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21] [^d67db6f2] [^9815439d].

The exact risk of lymphoma with long-term mycophenolate therapy is **not precisely quantified** beyond transplant cohorts, where post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) occurs in 0.4–1% of patients receiving mycophenolate with other immunosuppressants [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21]. Outside transplantation, **robust incidence data are lacking**; risk appears low but cannot be specified, and any excess risk is likely modest and influenced by disease severity, concomitant immunosuppression, and EBV status [^a3b6aa19] [^fd0ca857]. Clinicians should counsel patients on a small, uncertain lymphoma risk, monitor for new symptoms, and consider EBV testing in high-risk settings [^dfd5dc86] [^8c76677b].

## Quantitative risk estimates

### Transplant populations

In transplant populations, **PTLD incidence** is 0.4–1% in kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate with other immunosuppressants over at least 1 year [^a3b6aa19] [^44ba7c21]. Pediatric risk is approximately 1.35% (2/148) by 12 months post-transplant [^44ba7c21]. Three-year safety data show no unexpected increase in malignancy incidence compared with 1-year data [^44ba7c21].

---

### Non-transplant populations

In non-transplant populations, **limited data** mean no precise incidence estimates exist for lymphoma with mycophenolate alone; risk appears low but unquantified. Autoimmune cohorts suggest a modest increase in overall malignancy risk with immunosuppression, but lymphoma-specific risk is not well defined [^3b5b5c50].

---

## Factors influencing lymphoma risk

Several factors influence **lymphoma risk** in patients receiving mycophenolate:

- **Intensity and duration of immunosuppression**: Higher intensity and longer duration increase risk [^a3b6aa19].
- **Concomitant immunosuppressive agents**: Combination therapy, especially with calcineurin inhibitors or thiopurines, elevates risk [^90f2cd31].
- **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status**: EBV-seronegative patients, particularly children, have higher PTLD risk [^fd0ca857] [^8c76677b].
- **Age**: Older patients have higher absolute risk; younger patients may have higher relative risk [^6f73122d].

---

## Comparison with other immunosuppressive agents

| **Medication** | **Lymphoma risk estimate** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Mycophenolate mofetil | 0.4–1% (PTLD in transplant) | Risk varies with immunosuppression intensity and EBV status [^a3b6aa19] [^fd0ca857] |
| Azathioprine | 4–5-fold increase in IBD | Risk increases with duration and in older patients [^6f73122d] [^43462613] |
| Anti-TNF agents | 2–3-fold increase in IBD | Risk higher with combination therapy [^21484749] [^b09fb1fe] |
| Cyclophosphamide | 4–5-fold increase | Dose-dependent; higher with prolonged use [^3f3e9de1] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Counseling**: Inform patients of increased lymphoma risk with immunosuppression, especially in transplant settings [^dfd5dc86].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for new symptoms (e.g. lymphadenopathy, B symptoms) and consider EBV surveillance in high-risk patients [^8c76677b].
- **Individualized risk assessment**: Tailor therapy to disease severity, patient age, and comorbidities [^e95c6455].

---

## Limitations and uncertainties

- **Confounding by indication**: Disease severity and concurrent therapies complicate risk attribution [^0ea67c16].
- **Limited long-term data**: Few studies exceed 3–5 years, limiting precision for long-term risk [^notfound].
- **Variability in reporting**: Differences in definitions and follow-up hinder meta-analytic precision [^29867cec].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

The exact lymphoma risk with long-term mycophenolate is **not precisely quantified** outside transplantation, where PTLD occurs in 0.4–1% of patients [^a3b6aa19]. In autoimmune disease, risk appears low but unquantified; clinicians should individualize counseling, monitor for symptoms, and consider EBV testing in high-risk patients [^dfd5dc86] [^8c76677b].

### Prospective registry-based observational cohort study of the long-term risk of malignancies in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil [^f464f1a2]. American Journal of Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

This large prospectively conducted observational cohort study examined the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in de novo renal transplant recipients. A total of 6751 patients receiving MMF, and an equal number of matched controls receiving non-MMF-based immunosuppression, were identified from two large registries (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) and Collaborative Transplant Study (CTS)) and followed for 3 years. The primary endpoint was development of lymphoma. Secondary endpoints included development of any malignancy. There was no evidence of any increased risk of developing lymphoma or malignancy with MMF. The risk of developing lymphoma with MMF compared with the non-MMF cohort was not higher in either the CTS registry (relative risk (95% confidence interval); 0.4 (0.17–0.94)) or the OPTN/UNOS registry (1.04 (0.61–1.78)). In the MMF group, there was a trend toward a lower risk of malignancy in both registries (OPTN/UNOS 0.86 (0.69–1.07); CTS 0.79 (0.61–1.02)) and a significant increase in time to malignancy in the CTS dataset (p < 0.026). This study has demonstrated that MMF is not associated with an increased risk of lymphoma or other malignancies post-renal transplant, and may even be associated with a lower risk in some populations.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^a3b6aa19]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity

Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^9e87d97f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Recommendations — initial management of PTLD should be individualized by histologic subtype, and RI, if possible, should be a part of the initial treatment approach for all patients. Initial strategies include reduction of calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporin or tacrolimus) by 50% and discontinuation of antimetabolite agents (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil); discontinuation of all non-steroidal immunosuppression should be considered in patients who are critically ill with extensive and life-threatening disease. The response to RI is 20% to 80% in polyclonal or monoclonal subtypes, patients should be closely monitored during RI, graft monitoring is essential to allow for early detection of allograft rejection, and RI should be initiated and managed in coordination with the transplant team to minimize risks for graft rejection.

### Mycophenolic acid [^d3e264b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)].

5.2 Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow up of the patient [see Boxed Warning]

5.3 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.

5.4 Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections and new or reactivated viral infections including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

17.1 Embryofetal Toxicity

Pregnancy loss and malformation

Inform females of reproductive potential and pregnant women that use of MYHIBBIN during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations. Advise that they must use an acceptable form of contraception [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
Encourage pregnant women to enroll in the Pregnancy Exposure Registry. This registry monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to mycophenolate [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Contraception

Discuss pregnancy testing, pregnancy prevention and planning with females of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Females of reproductive potential must use an acceptable form of birth control during the entire MYHIBBIN therapy and for 6 weeks after stopping MYHIBBIN, unless the patient chooses abstinence. MYHIBBIN may reduce effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use of additional barrier contraceptive methods is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
For patients who are considering pregnancy, discuss appropriate alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity. Risks and benefits of MYHIBBIN should be discussed with the patient.
Advise sexually active male patients and/or their partners to use effective contraception during the treatment of the male patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment. This recommendation is based on findings of animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

17.2 Development of Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Inform patients that they are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, due to immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Advise patients to limit exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light by wearing protective clothing and use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with high protection factor.

17.3 Increased Risk of Serious Infections

Inform patients that they are at increased risk of developing a variety of infections due to immunosuppression. Instruct them to contact their physician if they develop any of the signs and symptoms of infection explained in the Medication Guide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Consequences of long-term drug treatment of AIH

Aside from the inconvenience of blood monitoring, and ongoing adverse effects (Section F), these might also include a modestly increased risk of cancer.

In eight studies, the risk of any malignancy after (but not before)a diagnosis of AIH was (median (range) 1.7 (1.4–3.0)-fold increased, compared with population controls. Extrahepatic cancer risk was 1.3–2.7-fold increased, though much less than the 10–40-fold increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer. Risk is increased for some specific cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (2.95 (1.57–28.0)), lymphoproliferative cancer (3.3 (1.7–5.2)) and colorectal cancer (2.1 (1.37–3.1) but not for others, such as breast cancer (0.91 (0.6–1.27)). This argues against an artefactual increase in cancer diagnosis, from regular hospital attendance.

Increased cancer risk is probably, related partly to immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Following solid organ transplant and long-term IST, the risk of NMSC in national database studiesincreased by 14–127-fold and that of other cancers by 2.1–2.4-fold, though again, not of breast cancer. In a large case–control study of liver transplanted patients, an independent association was noted between cancer development (or recurrence) and cumulative tacrolimus dose. In a recent meta-analysis of patients following solid organ transplantation, rates of all cancers, non-melanoma skin cancer and lymphoma were lower in those taking mycophenolate than in those taking azathioprine. A national registry study of AIHfound a weak association between cancer risk in AIH and duration of IST in general, and with duration of azathioprine, but not of prednisolone.

### Primary CNS lymphoma complicating treatment of myasthenia gravis with mycophenolate mofetil [^140ea76f]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MM), an immunosuppressant used after organ transplantation, is also used for treatment of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG). A patient with generalized MG was effectively managed with MM but developed CNS lymphoma after 3 years of treatment. Primary CNS lymphoma regressed on withdrawal of MM. Despite minimal short-term side effects and apparent efficacy, chronic treatment of MG with MM may be associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders.

### Mycophenilic acid (mycophenolic acid) [^1a4a5b51]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]

5.2	Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning].

5.3 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.

5.4	Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

An estimated total of 1557 adult patients received Mycophenolate Mofetil during pivotal clinical trials in the prevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

The data described below primarily derive from five randomized, active-controlled double-blind 12-month trials of Mycophenolate Mofetil in de novo kidney (3) heart (1) and liver (1) transplant patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, and 14.3)].

5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity

Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MYHIBBIN during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including MYHIBBIN, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2	Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CELLCEPT, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CELLCEPT (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Malignancies in renal transplantation: an unmet medical need [^217b42c6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Registry data show that there is an overall 3-5-fold increase in cancer risk in transplant recipients compared with the general population, with skin cancers and lymphoma particularly prevalent. Cancers in transplant recipients are often more aggressive than those in the general population, with poor prognosis, particularly for gastrointestinal tumours and lymphomas. Risk factors for post-transplant malignancy include factors common to the general population, such as increasing age, cigarette smoking and sun exposure. In addition, immunosuppression is an important factor in the development of post-transplantation cancer, although data for individual agents are not definitive. A number of studies have demonstrated that ciclosporin is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, whereas a few studies report no increase in risk of cancer after the introduction of ciclosporin into treatment regimens. Similarly, studies have shown that the mycophenolic acid-based agent mycophenolate mofetil is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, whereas other studies have demonstrated that mycophenolate mofetil is in fact associated with a lower risk. Polyclonal anti-thymocyte antibodies used for induction therapy appear to be related to an increased incidence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, but this effect is not observed with monoclonal anti-interleukin 2 antibodies. Azathioprine has been implicated in the development of skin tumours, possibly as a result of increased photosensitivity to ultraviolet light. The proliferation signal inhibitors appear to be associated with a reduced risk of some malignancies. Further research will elucidate the role of these newer immunosuppressive agents in post-transplantation malignancies.

Approximately 53% of the kidney transplant patients, 65% of the heart transplant patients, and 48% of the liver transplant patients were treated for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the Mycophenolate Mofetil treatment groups are presented below. The safety data of three kidney transplantation studies are pooled together.

In the three de novo kidney studies, patients receiving 2 g/day of Mycophenolate Mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of Mycophenolate Mofetil.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD, pseudolymphoma) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving Mycophenolate Mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients followed for at least 1 year [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in kidney and heart transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, PTLD was observed in 1.35% (2/148) by 12 months post-transplant.

The incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)associated lymphoproliferative disorders has increased with greater use of immunomodulatory therapies. We present a woman who developed subacute cognitive decline and unilateral weakness while taking long-term mycophenolate mofetil for granulomatosis with polyangiitis; her postmortem brain histopathology confirmed an EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorder. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for EBV-driven lymphoma in people taking long-term immunosuppression who develop new neurological problems. We review the role of mycophenolate mofetil in EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders, and discuss checking EBV status in all patients starting immunosuppression and in older people already taking immunosuppression.

### Safety profile of IBD: lymphoma risks [^0ea67c16]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article describes the cancer risks of commonly used inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medications, with an emphasis on hematologic malignancy risks. The increasing use of immunosuppressant therapies in the treatment of IBD has raised this question to an even greater importance. Studies evaluating these medications are complicated due to varying disease severity and concomitant use of other immunosuppressant medication. The potential risks of all therapies must be weighed against the benefits these therapies can offer these patients.

### Abatacept and the risk of malignancy: a meta-analysis across disease indications [^c4dcc54d]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumorigenesis associated with abatacept use could be related to the inhibition of CD28, which reduces T-cell activation and can downregulate T-cell responses through unopposed CTLA-4 activity. As such, CD28-blocking therapeutics could impair tumour immune surveillance, providing a biological rationale for our observations. One must also consider the potential contribution of the underlying immune-mediated inflammatory disease, disease activity and risk factors such as smoking in overall malignancy risk. Immune-modulating treatments used to control disease can reduce the risk of certain malignancies, such as lymphoma, whilst increasing the risk of other cancers; for example, NMSC with the use of mycophenolate mofetil. Taken together, these data highlight the complex interplay between treatment and disease-related factors when trying to elucidate overall malignancy risk with therapies such as abatacept.

The strengths of this study include: (i) the use of the most recent published data from multiple international clinical trials and observational study designs; (ii) combined RCT and LTE data, maximizing the patient-years of exposure and increasing the power to detect differences in rare event, such as cancer; and (iii) the inclusion of data from TNFi and other b/tsDMARD groups, allowed for comparisons between medications characterized by distinct mechanisms of action.

This study also has several limitations. Firstly, the duration of exposure to placebo was relatively short compared with abatacept. Secondly, interpreting the results of trials and observational studies should be done with caution, due to different eligibility criteria used to select populations. Thirdly, heterogeneity is likely to be present between the observational studies, due to differing data collection techniques, reporting standards, processes for reporting events and local prescribing guidelines affecting the order of drug administration. Fourthly, exposure was estimated according to assigned treatment duration when patient-years of exposure was not reported. This approach has been used previously when treatment group exposures were not published; however, there is potential for selection bias. Fifthly, the relatively small number of events by cancer type and inconsistent reporting between studies limited analyses of cancer subtype risk.

In conclusion, abatacept was not associated with a higher incidence of malignancy when compared with placebo or TNFi in RCT/LTE data, as well as when assessed against csDMARDs in observational cohort studies. However, an increased incidence of malignancy was observed with abatacept, when compared with other b/tsDMARDs, in observational data.

### Risk of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine: a meta-analysis [^6f73122d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with increased risk for lymphoma. We estimated the relative risk of lymphoma in patients with IBD exposed to thiopurines and compared relative risk values derived from population-based studies with those from referral center-based studies. We investigated whether active use increased risk compared with past use, and whether sex, age, or duration of use affects risk of lymphoma.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, as well as conference abstracts and international publications, for the terms "6-MP and lymphoma", "6-mercaptopurine and lymphoma", "thiopurines and lymphoma", "azathioprine and cancer and IBD", "azathioprine and malignancy and IBD", "azathioprine and lymphoma", and "lymphoproliferative and thiopurines". Pooled standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. The deviance statistic from Poisson models was used to calculate heterogeneity.

Results

Eighteen studies (among 4383 citations) met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the SIR for lymphoma was 4.92 (95% CI, 3.10–7.78), ranging from 2.80 (95% CI, 1.82–4.32) in 8 population studies to 9.24 (95% CI, 4.69–18.2) in 10 referral studies. Population studies demonstrated an increased risk among current users (SIR = 5.71; 95% CI, 3.72–10.1) but not former users (SIR = 1.42; 95% CI, 0.86–2.34). Level of risk became significant after 1 year of exposure. Men have a greater risk than women (relative risk = 1.98; P < .05); both sexes were at increased risk for lymphoma (SIR for men = 4.50; 95% CI = 3.71–5.40 and SIR for women = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.69–3.05). Patients younger than 30 years had the highest relative risk (SIR = 6.99; 95% CI, 2.99–16.4); younger men had the highest risk. The absolute risk was highest in patients older than 50 years (1:354 cases per patient-year, with a relative risk of 4.78).

Conclusions

Compared with studies from referral centers, population-based studies of IBD patients show a lower but significantly increased risk of lymphoma among patients taking thiopurines. The increased risk does not appear to persist after discontinuation of therapy. Patients over 50 have the highest absolute risk of lymphoma per year on thiopurines, while men under 35 may also be a high risk group. More study is needed to precisely understand groups highest at risk. The risks of lymphoma and potential benefits of therapy should be considered for all patients with IBD.

### Increased risk of lymphoma among inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine [^43462613]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly treated with immunomodulators such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Studies examining lymphoma risk in IBD patients treated with these medications have been underpowered and have yielded conflicting conclusions.

Aims

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to provide a more precise estimate of the relative risk of lymphoma among IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP.

Methods

Studies were included if they were English language, full article, cohort studies specifically designed to evaluate cancer as an adverse outcome of treatment with azathioprine or 6-MP. Pooled standardised incidence ratios were calculated to estimate the relative risk of lymphoma associated with therapy. Heterogeneity was assessed using Poisson regression. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of individual studies on risk estimate and heterogeneity statistics.

Results

Six studies were identified that met our inclusion criteria. When the data were combined across all studies, the pooled relative risk was 4.18 (95% confidence interval 2.07–7.51; 11 observed cases, 2.63 expected). Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of any one study had a relatively small effect on the pooled relative risk estimate (range 3.49–5.21) but excluding either the study with the highest or lowest estimated relative risk eliminated the statistically significant heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Our data suggest an approximate fourfold increased risk of lymphoma in IBD patients treated with azathioprine/6-MP. The increased risk of lymphoma could be a result of the medications, the severity of the underlying disease, or a combination of the two.

Polymorphic PTLD (B-cell type) reduction of immunosuppression (RI) considerations state that response to RI is variable and patients need to be closely monitored; RI should be coordinated with the transplant team. RI includes reduction in calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), discontinuation of antimetabolic agents (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and for critically ill patients all non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression should be discontinued.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with malignancy: commentary [^01668a37]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Cancer risk with thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease — Thiopurine exposure is linked to nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and lymphomas, with age-dependent risks. In a study of 108,579 patients with IBD, thiopurine use was associated with an almost 2-fold increase in the development of NMSC and ongoing use might increase recurrent NMSC; hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is associated with long-term thiopurines use, frequently with combination anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and is often fatal. A meta-analysis reported the standardized incidence ratio of lymphoma among patients with IBD treated with thiopurines ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 compared with unexposed patients, with absolute risk highest among individuals older than age 50 (1/354 PY) and relative risk highest in those younger than 30 years (standardized incidence ratio, 7.0), and those younger than 35 years are also at risk for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Genitourinary malignancy signals include a 2.8-times higher risk of urinary tract cancers with thiopurines, and females with IBD had a 1.3-times higher risk of cervical high-grade dysplasia or cervical cancer; this risk was largely associated with cumulative exposure to immunomodulators and not biologic agents.

### Risk of malignant lymphomas in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based cohort study [^2aacc55d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, we found consistent and statistically significant associations between IBD and malignant lymphomas with little evidence of heterogeneity across different patient and disease characteristics. The absolute risk is too low to warrant screening for lymphoma in patients with IBD and should prompt caretakers to emphasise the low absolute risk to patients in any shared decision-making process concerning choice of treatment for IBD. To strengthen the base for causal inference, future studies need to assess the associations separately for at least the major subtypes of both NHL and HL. They also need to investigate in detail the impact of immunosuppressive therapies, and the potential mutual confounding effect between disease severity and drug treatment; such studies require large numbers of observed cases and long-term follow-up, and more detailed data on disease severity than what is currently available in patient registers. A final challenge is to assess whether an increased risk of malignant lymphomas in IBD is indeed causal or arises due to shared risk factors, perhaps acting through immunological mechanisms or genetic predispositions.

Several immunosuppressive therapies have been approved for the treatment of patients with SSc and such agents might play a role in the development of malignancy, although data are contradictory and often derived from studies on other rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases.

Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent, is the cornerstone of the treatment of SSc, in particular of ILD and skin involvement related to SSc. As above mentioned, long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide is associated with an increased risk of developing transitional cell bladder carcinoma and haematological malignancies. The risk of developing malignancy is dose-dependent, and the benefit from cyclophosphamide treatment must be weighed against the risk of long-term AEs.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to have comparable efficacy to cyclophosphamide with a better toxicity profile particularly in treatment of SSc lung involvement. Cancer risk data related to MMF are mostly derived from transplant patients, with contradictory results on the increased risk of lymphoproliferative and non-melanoma skin cancer. However, no conclusions can be drawn on the risk of cancer-related to the use of MMF, because many of the transplant patients receive multiple immunosuppressive treatments.

Methotrexate is mainly used for forms with widespread skin involvement and in patients with arthritis and it is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, although these data come from a study on patients with RA or psoriasis.

The use of azathioprine appears to be associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, but with conflicting results: a meta-analysis of 5 studies of patients receiving long-term treatment for myasthenia gravis did not show an increased risk of neoplasms. However, no data are available on the risk of cancer for patients with SSc treated with aziathioprine.

A recent study on an Italian cohort of SSc patients treated with immunosuppressants confirmed an increased incidence of neoplasms in SSc patients without finding an association between cancer risk and exposure to immunosuppressive drugs commonly used for the treatment of SSc.

Effective Communication with Patient About the Benefit–Risk Ratio

Even when a physician has weighed the risks and benefits and determined that TCIs are the appropriate therapy for a particular patient, an additional hurdle remains — discussing the boxed warning and medication guide. The 'real' risk of lymphoma with TCIs can be made more understandable to patients and caregivers by using some reassuring language. Suggested talking points include
The risk of lymphoma and other cancers is no higher than what you see in the general population.
TCI molecules are about twice the size of corticosteroids, which makes it more difficult for them to permeate the skin and cause systemic adverse effects.
All drugs, including TCIs and corticosteroids, have risks and benefits.
The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and other professional organizations do not support the boxed warning.
Pharmacists and other healthcare professionals may provide you with information that conflicts with what we have discussed.
As your physician, I have carefully weighed the risks and benefits of prescribing a TCI and feel that this drug is well suited to manage your skin condition.

### The role of mycophenolate mofetil in the therapy of thyroid eye disease [^1aee3c08]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

RTX is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 receptor on B-lymphocytes. By reducing the number of B cells, RTX may help inhibit inflammation and decrease the degree of proptosis. Studies showed that RTX may be effective in improving the CAS and reducing the severity of TED.RTX may cause adverse effects like infusion reactions, and the evidence for its safety compared to steroids or a placebo is uncertain.RTX is currently considered a valid second-line treatment option for patients with TED who are unresponsive to previous interventions or have disease reactivation.

Although data from randomized controlled trials are limited and inconsistent, it is indicated that RTX may be effective in achieving disease inactivation and preventing relapses longer than 1 year, especially in patients with a disease duration of less than 9 months.

MMF is used as a second-line immunosuppressive agent in the treatment of TED, particularly in active conditions and in moderate to sight-threatening cases. Among the patients treated with MMF, the QOL scores improve, and CAS scores decrease. MMF has been shown to reduce inflammation in TED patients, as indicated by a decrease in TRAb and IL-6 levels over time. Long-term studies suggest that MMF can maintain its efficacy over extended periods, with some patients showing sustained improvement even after 72 weeks of treatment.

The MMF is considered a relatively safe drug. The most common side effects are not severe and easily manageable; they include gastrointestinal issues, headaches, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, and rashes. The most serious and concerning side effects are related to the immunosuppressive properties of MMF, which weaken the immune system. This feature may increase the risk of infections and allergic reactions. Moreover, MMF can affect blood cell counts and may lead to side effects such as fatigue or easy bruising. Routine blood tests are recommended to monitor these changes. However, the incidence of serious side effects is low. If it comes to long-term risks, MMF may increase the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a rare and usually fatal brain condition, as well as certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma and skin cancer.

### Risk of malignant lymphomas in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based cohort study [^29867cec]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

An increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been documented in several autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome, coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis. A link between disease severity and lymphoma risk has been established, and although the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be explained, longstanding chronic inflammation with B cell and T cell activation and/or stimulation are likely predisposing factors. Several mechanisms may be ongoing in parallel and the type of immune dysfunction involved in lymphoma development is thought to be disease specific, as different types of lymphoma are associated with the different disease entities. Immunosuppression is generally thought to play less of a role in lymphoma development in most autoimmune diseases, although such drugs may increase the risk of cancer through reduced immunological surveillance.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic inflammation, but, contrasting to other autoimmune diseases, the available evidence on risk of lymphoma is scarce and too inconsistent to allow reliable quantification and guide patient care. Meta-analyses have concluded with both increasedand no increasedrisk of lymphoma in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressants. Limited statistical power, short follow-up, conflation of different haematopoietic malignancies, and lack of detailed data on immunosuppressive therapy are limitations of published studies. With these limitations, overall the available literature points towards a minimally increased risk in untreated patients with IBDand an increased risk among patients with IBD treated with immunomodulators, particularly thiopurine analogues. To what extent the disease activity itself or the use of different immunosuppressants drive an increased risk of lymphoma in IBD is still unclear.

To add to the existing literature on risk of lymphoma in patients with IBD, we undertook a nationwide population study of IBD and lymphoma risk in Norway and Sweden. We took advantage of cross-linkage between numerous high-quality registries to empanel a large patient cohort with complete, long-term follow-up.

### Incidence and long-term risk of de novo malignancies after liver transplantation with implications for prevention and detection [^319be9c4]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was the characterization of long-term cancer risks after liver transplantation (LT) with implications for prevention and detection. Site-specific cancer incidence rates and characteristics were compared retrospectively for 2000 LT patients from a single institution (January 1, 1983 to December 31, 2010) and the general German population with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs); the total follow-up at December 31, 2011 was 14,490 person-years. The cancer incidence rates for the LT recipients were almost twice as high as those for the age- and sex-matched general population (SIR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.63–2.31). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for vulvar carcinoma (SIR = 23.80), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 10.95), renal cell carcinoma (SIR = 2.65), lung cancer (SIR = 1.85), and colorectal cancer (SIR = 1.41). The mean time between transplantation and diagnosis was 6.8 years. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was significantly lower for the cohort versus the general population with similar malignancies [50 years (both sexes) versus 69 and 68 years (males and females), P ≤ 0.006]. Tumors were diagnosed at more advanced stages, and there was a trend of higher grading, which suggested more aggressive tumor growth. Tumor treatment was performed according to accepted guidelines. Surprisingly, 5-year survival was slightly better in the study cohort versus the general population for renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and thyroid cancer. Long-term immunosuppression with different protocols did not lead to significantly different SIRs, although patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil had the lowest SIR for de novo cancers (1.65, 95% CI = 1.2–2.4). Alcoholic liver disease (SIR = 2.30) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (SIR = 3.40) as indications for LT were associated with an increased risk of de novo malignancies. In conclusion, risk-adapted cancer surveillance is proposed. Tumor treatment performed according to accepted guidelines appears adequate. Mycophenolate may lead to lower long-term risks for de novo cancers.

Critical Evaluation of the Evidence

A number of generally confounding factors must be considered when evaluating the strength of the evidence that led to the FDA decision to apply the boxed warning — the difficulty in assessing the risk of rare events, possible confounding effects of disease state and severity, and a consideration of risks and benefits across a number of alternative therapies. Confounding factors specific to this examination include the relative importance of preclinical versus clinical data and the intrinsic properties of each of the compounds.

Inherent Difficulties in Assessing the Risk of Rare Events

Assessing risk based on spontaneous adverse event reports (such as AERS) is complicated because of variable under-reporting, indeterminate population size, and inconsistent data quality, especially for details on drug exposure and underlying diseases. Spontaneous reporting might be especially problematic for adverse events with long latency times. Adverse events are believed to be under-reported to the FDA by a factor of as much as 10 and the reporting rate changes for the same product over time, with new and highly publicized drugs susceptible to increased reporting rates.

Confounding Factors: Disease State and Severity

The interpretation of results of studies examining risk associated with TCI exposure alone may be challenging because of several confounding factors. Namely, that AD like psoriasis (another inflammatory skin disease) may be independently associated with a risk of developing lymphoma, which increases with severity. On the other hand, in some cases, cutaneous T cell lymphoma may be misdiagnosed as AD (and treated as such) owing to similar clinical signs and symptoms. In addition, patients receiving TCIs as second-line therapy or at higher doses may bias the patient population toward more severe disease and greater exposure, thereby also increasing the potential for misleading results.

### Haemophagocytic lymphohisticytosis-an underrecognized hyperinflammatory syndrome [^02d015e9]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rituximab has been used successfully in the treatment of HLH, primarily in the context of B cell lymphomas. Rituximab forms part of the treatment regimen for the underlying malignancy. In the case of active EBV infection, B cell depletion with rituximab has also been used with good effect, as B cells act as a reservoir for the virus. Rituximab has been used successfully in the treatment of HLH in the context of disease triggers that respond to rituximab therapy, such as SLE.

Mycophenolate mofetil is a well-recognized treatment for autoimmune disease, especially SLE. Patients with HLH complicating SLE have been successfully treated with regimens including mycophenolate when other combinations of medications have failed.

Cyclophosphamide has been used in the paediatric population, in the context of stem cell transplantation, for example, post-transplant in haplo-identical transplant. Cyclophosphamide has also been used in the context of HLH triggered by immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as SLE. Again in this context, it is likely that the treatment is targeting both the HLH and the triggering disease.

Anti-IFN-γ antibody therapy (emapalumab) has been used in children with pHLH, with positive results in patients refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy in one pilot study and with trials in adults under way. Promisingly, the treatment has been well tolerated, with few of the toxic side effects of more established regimens.

Treatment of an underlying malignancy highlights a particular issue in terms of side effects and treatment-related toxicity. Cytotoxic medications have the risk of further exacerbating the cytopenia already caused by the disease. Patients are, almost by definition, already frail and critically unwell and will likely have a poor performance status. Chemotherapy given in this context may be associated with adverse outcomes.

Once disease control has been achieved, treatment should be tapered, but there is little consensus as to how to do this safely. It is logical to withdraw the most potentially harmful medications first, assuming there is no compelling evidence that one medication has proven more pivotal in achieving remission than others. The use of anakinra as long-term maintenance therapy in JIA would suggest it may potentially have a prolonged role in HLH. It is reasonable to keep patients on this for the medium to long term, until the treating clinicians are confident the risk of recurrence is acceptably low.

### Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) [^7ef0ee7e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the de novo trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the Myfortic and MMF arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the Myfortic arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0- to 12-month study period was 59% and 60% in the Myfortic and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the Myfortic arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%).

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) associated with the administration of Myfortic were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia, and postoperative pain.

The adverse reactions reported in ≥ 10% of patients in the de novo trial are presented in Table 2 below.

Table 3 summarizes the incidence of opportunistic infections in de novo transplant patients.

Lymphoma developed in 2 de novo patients (1%), (1 diagnosed 9 days after treatment initiation) and in 2 conversion patients (1%) receiving Myfortic with other immunosuppressive agents in the 12-month controlled clinical trials.

Use of azathioprine and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status

About 90% of adults have evidence of prior EBV infection, but only 50–70% of children and adolescents do. As discussed in Section I, immunosuppressive drugs might be associated with increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), this risk has been specifically associated with current use of thiopurines. Most LPDs occur in older EBV-positive patients.

There is also an increased risk of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and other LPDs, associated with primary EBV infection in younger (< 35) previously EBV-naïve patients taking thiopurines. Estimated absolute risk in these patients is 3/1000 patient years. Thus, someIBD guidelines suggest routine testing of EBV status, and advise caution with thiopurine use in EBV-naïve patients.

Few equivalent data are available in AIH. In a recent series of 229 children with AIH or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis(most receiving either azathioprine (168) or mycophenolate (69)), EBV status had been checked at AIH diagnosis in only 10%. Five patients developed symptomatic acute primary EBV infection (four on azathioprine, and one mycophenolate). Liver tests were abnormal in two, and no patients developed LPD pre-transplant. However, of 39 patients who underwent liver transplantation, a further two (who had initially received azathioprine) subsequently developed LPD (EBV-negative patients, EBV-positive donor).

Thiopurines are central to management of AIH and (unlike in IBD) there are limited alternatives (but see Section F below on mycophenolate). Also, lower thiopurine doses are used in AIH than in IBD.

We suggest that testing of EBV status be considered in AIH, and in EBV-negative patients we recommend vigilance for possible detection of primary EBV infection and LPD. We do not think that the available evidence is sufficient to recommend routine avoidance of azathioprine in EBV-negative patients.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^419a6be8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The TCIs were a welcome therapeutic option for the management of AD when they were approved over 10 years ago, and they remain the only approved treatment for long-term use in children 2 years of age and older. Physicians quickly adopted the TCIs as a corticosteroid-sparing adjunct to topical corticosteroids. Despite the utility of TCIs, in January 2006, the FDA implemented a boxed warning regarding the safety of long-term use and a possible risk of lymphoma and limited the indication to "second-line therapy for the short-term and noncontinuous chronic treatment of (mild-to-moderate or moderate-to-severe AD) in nonimmunocompromised adults and children (≥ 2 years of age) who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments for (AD), or when those treatments are not advisable". This had a significant impact on physician prescribing patterns and patient access to these medications, leading to decreased disease control and quality of life for patients and their families. Many members of the medical community criticized the actions of the FDA. They questioned the validity of the boxed warning in large part because no definitive human clinical trial data has demonstrated an increased risk of malignancy with TCI exposure. In addition, several epidemiological studies have shown no association between TCI use and lymphoma risk in clinical practice, and the incidences of malignancy and lymphoma in clinical databases are below that of the general population. In addition, a possible association between AD itself and malignancy further erodes the basis for the warning. In order to provide patients with optimal care, physicians must have strategies for mitigating the impact of the boxed warning on the quality and costs of AD management. These include using TCIs appropriately as corticosteroid-sparing agents and proactively communicating the relative risks and benefits of TCIs to patients and their caregivers.

NCCN Recommendations — initial management of PTLD should be individualized by histologic subtype, and RI, if possible, should be a part of the initial treatment approach for all patients. Initial strategies include reduction of calcineurin inhibition by 50% and discontinuation of antimetabolite agents; discontinuation of all non-steroidal immunosuppression should be considered in critically ill patients. The response to RI is 20% to 80%, patients should be closely monitored with graft monitoring, RI should be coordinated with the transplant team, and restaging should be performed at 2 to 4 weeks in patients receiving RI as the only treatment option.

### Mycophenolate mofetil withdrawal in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^f30950a9]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant commonly used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. It is a known teratogen associated with significant toxicities, including an increased risk of infections and malignancies. Mycophenolate mofetil withdrawal is desirable once disease quiescence is reached, but the timing of when to do so and whether it provides a benefit has not been well-studied. We aimed to determine the effects of mycophenolate mofetil withdrawal on the risk of clinically significant disease reactivation in patients with quiescent SLE on long-term mycophenolate mofetil therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, randomised trial was conducted in 19 centres in the USA. Eligible patients were aged between 18 and 70 years old, met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1997 SLE criteria, and had a clinical SLEDAI score of less than 4 at screening. Mycophenolate mofetil therapy was required to be stable or decreasing for 2 years or more if initiated for renal indications, or for 1 year or more for non-renal indications. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a withdrawal group, who tapered off mycophenolate mofetil over 12 weeks, or a maintenance group who maintained their baseline dose (1-3g per day) for 60 weeks. Adaptive random allocation ensured groups were balanced for study site, renal versus non-renal disease, and baseline mycophenolate mofetil dose (≥ 2 g per day vs < 2 g per day). Clinically significant disease reactivation by week 60 following random allocation, requiring increased doses or new immunosuppressive therapy was the primary endpoint, in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly allocated participants who began study-provided mycophenolate mofetil). Non-inferiority was evaluated using an estimation-based approach. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01946880) and is completed.

Findings

Between Nov 6, 2013, and April 27, 2018, 123 participants were screened, of whom 102 were randomly allocated to the maintenance group (n = 50) or the withdrawal group (n = 52). Of the 100 participants included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (49 maintenance, 51 withdrawal), 84 (84%) were women, 16 (16%) were men, 40 (40%) were White, 41 (41%) were Black, and 76 (76%) had a history of lupus nephritis. The average age was 42 (SD 12.7). By week 60, nine (18%) of 51 participants in the withdrawal group had clinically significant disease reactivation, compared to five (10%) of 49 participants in the maintenance group. The risk of clinically significant disease reactivation was 11% (95% CI 5–24) in the maintenance group and 18% (10–32) in the withdrawal group. The estimated increase in the risk of clinically significant disease reactivation with mycophenolate mofetil withdrawal was 7% (one-sided upper 85% confidence limit 15%). Similar rates of adverse events were observed in the maintenance group (45 [90%] of 50 participants) and the withdrawal group (46 [88%] of 52 participants). Infections were more frequent in the mycophenolate mofetil maintenance group (32 [64%]) compared with the withdrawal group (24 [46%]).

Interpretations

Mycophenolate mofetil withdrawal is not significantly inferior to mycophenolate mofetil maintenance. Estimates for the rates of disease reactivation and increases in risk with withdrawal can assist clinicians in making informed decisions on withdrawing mycophenolate mofetil in patients with stable SLE.

Sufficient Evidence for TCI Boxed Warning?

According to FDA guidance, boxed warnings are ordinarily applied when (a) there is an adverse reaction so serious in proportion to the potential benefit from the drug (e.g. fatal, life-threatening, or permanently disabling) that it is essential that it be considered when assessing the benefit–risk ratio of prescribing the drug; (b) there is a serious adverse reaction that can be prevented or reduced in frequency or severity by appropriate use of the drug (e.g. patient selection, careful monitoring, avoiding use in a specific clinical situation); or (c) the FDA approved the drug with restrictions to ensure safe use. According to the guidance, a boxed warning can also be used to highlight information that is considered especially important to the prescriber (e.g. reduced effectiveness in certain patient populations). Boxed warnings are most often based on observed serious adverse reactions (i.e. clinical data) or, in some cases, based on anticipated adverse reactions [i.e. an expected adverse reaction based on pharmacologic action of the drug (preclinical data)]. Beach et al. found that over 80% of boxed warnings (in the 1995 Physicians' Desk Reference) were based on clinical data including adverse event reports obtained through clinical trials and spontaneous reports. Only 9% of warnings were based on 'other' evidence.

The boxed warning for TCIs was implemented despite the fact that "a causal relationship has not been established". While no specific risks have been identified, the label indicates that "long-term safety of topical calcineurin inhibitors has not been established… [and] rare cases of malignancy (e.g. skin and lymphoma) have been reported in patients treated with [TCIs]". In contrast, the boxed warning for long-acting β-agonists for childhood asthma is based on data from large placebo-controlled trials that showed an increase in asthma-related deaths.

There is some precedent for removing a boxed warning based on differences in systemic exposure between oral and topical formulations and/or new clinical data. Given the inconclusive nature of prior evidence, the clinical value of TCIs, and the negative impact of limiting patients' access to TCIs, significant weight should be given to more recent epidemiological and clinical data when considering the ongoing need for the boxed warning.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^35380d51]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The most common forms of malignancy seen in transplant patients treated with systemic (oral or intravenous) tacrolimus for graph-versus-host prophylaxis are skin carcinomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) associated with Epstein–Barr virus infection, which may regress with treatment discontinuation. In order to determine if systemically administered oral pimecrolimus can act through a similar mechanism, a 39-week oral (gavage) toxicity study was conducted in monkeys. The results of this study, reviewed by the FDA in February 2005, confirmed that oral pimecrolimus, given at doses sufficient to result in systemic immune suppression (~30-fold greater than the maximal exposure in humans with topical application), can elicit lymphomas associated with Epstein–Barr-like primate viruses similar to oral tacrolimus. These results were cited as part of the basis for the boxed warning requirement for topical application despite the fact that administration was oral rather than topical and that evidence of systemic immune suppression was not detected following topical administration.

Other intestinal cancers

Lymphoma

Immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk of cancer. With the increasing use of thiopurines (TP) and biological agents for the treatment of IBD patients, concern arises about the risk of lymphomas. Population-based studies have generally failed to show an overall association between IBD and lymphoma. However, a meta-analysis and the prospective cohort study CESAME have found a 4-to-5-fold risk of lymphoma in IBD patients on TP, and the risk seems to be higher in older patients. Intestinal lymphomas are associated to longstanding, active disease and with Epstein-Barr virus infection, suggesting that besides TP treatment, chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa might also be a risk factor of lymphoproliferative disorders. In daily practice, the benefit of immunosuppressant therapy usually outweighs the risk of lymphoma, as the absolute risk is low (1 case/4357 patient-year in young people and 1/355 patient-year in patients aged over 70 years); however, the risk-benefit should be cautiously considered before long-term use of TP in older patients.

Anti-TNF agents are also associated to an increased risk of lymphoma, having a higher risk when used in combined therapy with TP. Hepatosplenic lymphoma is a rare and usually fatal lymphoma that affects young men, and has been associated to anti-TNF and TP use. A recent systematic review describes that no cases were found in patients with anti-TNF alone, and the risk was higher in patients with combined treatment compared with those treated with TP alone. Therefore, physicians should consider giving TP and anti-TNF agents to young male patients with IBD only in cases in which a clear benefit is expected, such as in early stage disease in untreated patients or possibly in very severe cases.

Pouch neoplasia

In UC patients who undergo restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, long-term complications include chronic pouchitis, cuffitis and CD of the pouch. Recently cases of pouch dysplasia and cancer have been described; with a cumulative incidence that has been estimated in 5.1% at 25 years. The risk factors associated to pouch neoplasia are: a preoperative diagnosis of dysplasia or CRC, histological type C changes, PSC and unremitting pouchitis.

Surveillance in such patients is controversial as data supporting it are scarce; however, current UK guidelines consider it reasonable to perform yearly surveillance in patients with high-risk factors and every 5 years in patients without those factors.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and immunosuppression — Immunosuppressive therapy along with the use of azathioprine and new agents such as belatacept in EBV-negative transplant recipients are associated with increased risks for developing PTLD following solid organ transplant (SOT). The use of ATG solely as rejection therapy prior to PTLD development was an independent prognostic factor for superior overall survival after PTLD diagnosis following SOT. In an analysis of 523 patients who underwent heart transplant, switching from calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression to sirolimus-based immunosuppression was associated with decreased rates of malignancies following heart transplant.

### Graft-vs.-lymphoma effect in various histologies of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^f0f8054a]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2003). Low credibility.

Generally, there is a significantly lower risk of lymphoma relapse following allogeneic than after autologous stem cell transplant. Factors contributing to this lower risk of relapse include an absence of the use of ablative conditioning, with a tumor-free graft, and the generation of a graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) immune response. Allogeneic transplantation, however, has the possibility of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). The use of autologous and conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in follicular lymphoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma is discussed. Due to a 1-year transplant-related mortality of 30–40% and complications caused by GVHD, conventional, myeloablative, allogeneic transplantation is a high-risk option for low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders. Novel applications of allogeneic HSCT are described that take advantage of a GVT effect while reducing the risk of GVHD. Minimally myelotoxic pretransplant conditioning regimens allow host antigen-presenting cells to persist, enabling presentation of host minor histocompatibility antigens to donor T cells, causing a GVT response. Although complications may arise due to GVHD, non-myeloablative HSCT can be offered to patients previously ineligible for conventional high-dose treatment. A protocol developed in Seattle using a low-dose total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen with immunosuppression using mycophenolate mofetil in combination with cyclosporin has been used in a multicenter trial. To overcome the problem of graft rejection fludarabine was later added to the protocol. A second protocol from a smaller trial used a preparative, conventional-dose regimen of fludarabine, given with cyclophosphamide. Rituximab was also given to provide synergistic action with the chemotherapy to enhance tumor control in the early post-transplant period to allow time for the establishment of the GVT effect. Following transplantation, GVHD prophylaxis was given using tacrolimus with methotrexate. A trial of a further variation of allogeneic HSCT, tandem auto/allo transplants, is described. First, high-dose therapy with autologous PBSC rescue was used to cytoreduce the disease. This was followed by a reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative allogeneic graft. This procedure was devised to take advantage of high-dose therapy and allogeneic HSCT. Results for non-myeloablative allogeneic HSCT are particularly promising in low-grade NHL and the GVT effect may augment response and delay or prevent relapse. However, for aggressive disease, non-myeloablative regimens are only indicated for patients with minimal disease, as the non-myeloablative regimens are unable to control the tumor before the generation of a GVT effect, and/or lack the ability to control rapidly proliferating disease. Patients with relapsed disease may require a higher-dose regimen or tandem transplant approach.

### Addition of anti-thymocyte globulin to standard graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis versus standard treatment alone in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing transplantation from unrelated donors: final analysis of a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^674d4f39]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Previous trials testing prevention strategies for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) have measured its cumulative incidence. In this trial of anti-thymocyte globulin, we measured treatment-independence at a long-term timepoint as the primary endpoint.

Methods

This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at ten centres in Canada and one in Australia. Eligible patients had a haematological malignancy (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma), were between 16 and 70 years of age, eligible for transplantation with a Karnofsky score of at least 60, and received an unrelated donor (fully matched or one-locus mismatched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or DRB1 loci) graft following myeloablative or non-myeloablative-reduced intensity conditioning. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anti-thymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg plus standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. The primary endpoint, freedom from immunosuppressive therapy without resumption at 12 months, was previously reported. Here we report on the prespecified 24-month analysis. Analyses were per-protocol, excluding those patients who did not proceed to transplantation. This trial is registered as ISRCTN 29899028 and NCT01217723, status completed.

Findings

Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and randomly assigned 203 eligible patients to receive anti-thymocyte globulin (n = 101) or no additional treatment (n = 102) along with standard GVHD prophylaxis. 7 (3%) patients did not receive a transplant and were excluded from the analysis. 38 (38%) of 99 evaluable patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group were free from immunosuppressive therapy at 24 months compared with 18 (19%) of 97 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.49 [95% CI 1.60–7.60]; p = 0.0016). At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.3% (95% CI 8.9–23.7) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 17.5 (9.9–25.1) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p = 0.73) and non-relapse mortality was 21.2% (95% CI 13.2–29.2) versus 31.3% (21.9–40.7; p = 0.15). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 24 months was 26.3% (95% CI 17.5–35.1) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 41.3% (31.3–51.3) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p = 0.032). Overall survival at 24 months was 70.6% (95% CI 60.6–78.6) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 53.3% (42.8–62.8) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.35–0.90]; p = 0.017). Symptoms of chronic GVHD by the Lee Scale were more prevalent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, with scores of 13.27 (SD 10.94) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group and 20.38 (SD 14.68) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p = 0.040). Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) scores were 10.40 (SD 9.88) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 14.62 (SD 12.26) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p = 0.034). Serious adverse events (CTCAE grade 4 or 5) occurred in 38 (38%) patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and in 49 (51%) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the most common being infection and GVHD. One patient in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group died of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, but no deaths were attributable to anti-thymocyte globulin.

Interpretation

The results of this prespecified 24-month analysis suggest that pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin provides clinically meaningful benefits when added to standard GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing unrelated donor transplantation, including decreases in use of immunosuppressive therapy, chronic GVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improved overall survival. Anti-thymocyte globulin should be included in the preparative regimens of patients with haematological malignancies selected for unrelated donor transplantation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with malignancy: commentary [^21484749]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and malignancy in inflammatory bowel disease — A retrospective insurance-claims analysis found anti-TNF use was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of melanoma compared with unexposed IBD controls, whereas a Danish analysis and a recent meta-analysis showed no increased melanoma risk with anti-TNF/biologic therapy versus nonbiologic therapies. Most, but not all, studies suggest no increased risk of lymphoma with anti-TNF monotherapy, but there is a consistently increased risk of lymphoma when anti-TNF agents are combined with thiopurines; this is particularly true in young Epstein-Barr virus unexposed patients, and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is most concerning, although only a handful of cases are reported in IBD.

### Risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in breast cancer survivors: a nationwide cohort study [^0ed4d584]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematologic malignancy worldwide. The overall 5-year survival rate for people with NHL is 73%. For stage I NHL, the 5-year survival rate is more than 83%. For stage II the 5-year survival rate is close to 76% and for stage III it is more than 70%. For stage IV NHL, the 5-year survival rate is around 63%. These survival rates vary depending on the cancer's stage and subtype. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in identifying the related risk factors to better understand NHL pathogenesis. However, there is no established etiology for NHL as this disease does not constitute a single disorder but rather a group of disorders involving heterogeneous subtypes with variable clinical behaviors and treatment outcomes. Currently, exact causal relationships have only been reported for some subtypes. For example, long-term immune suppression could induce NHL in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents after organ transplantation and those with human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, as these cases account for an extremely small proportion of NHL patients, the identification of people at risk of NHL remains a challenge.

### Disrupting B and T-cell collaboration in autoimmune disease: T-cell engagers versus CAR T-cell therapy? [^1353e258]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on T-cell cytotoxicity in the context of TCE and CAR T cells?

Other important considerations include AID-specific concurrent drug regimens. For example, transplant recipients and patients with AID and transplant recipients receive immunosuppressants to regulate immune response. In the context of T-cell-based therapy, concurrent use of immunosuppressants may inhibit the effector function of the T cells, thereby, compromising the efficiency of CAR T cells and TCEs. For example, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can induce apoptosis in activated human T cells; and in a murine model, mycophenolic acid, the active form of MMF has shown dose-dependent reduction in the generation of cytotoxic T cells. Fig. 6 illustrates the potential impact of immunosuppressants on T-cell cytotoxicity in the context of TCE and CAR T-cell therapies. Therefore withholding immunosuppressants for a period of time to allow for T-cell recovery to enhance performance may be considered in prospective trial design.

In a case series of renal transplant recipients requiring CAR T-cell therapy for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), MMF was discontinued at the time of PTLD diagnosis (with DLBCL), and tacrolimus was stopped 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis for production of CAR T cells. Similarly, a report of CAR T-cell infusion for anti-synthetase syndrome involved tapering azathioprine and steroids 7 days before leukapheresis and starting MMF 35 days after CAR T-cell infusion, which allowed for harvesting of fully functional T cells. This aligns with our proposition of correct sequencing of immunosuppressive treatments including the use of corticosteroids to allow full efficacy of TCE and/or CAR T therapies.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^23a9198f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Justification for a Class Labeling?

The FDA applies pharmacological classes to drugs in order to help prescribers avoid duplicative therapy and drug interactions. In order to maintain consistency, the agency considers applying warnings, contraindications, and boxed warnings to all members of a pharmacological class; however, it does allow for these to be applied to a single member of a class if the benefit–risk ratio is shown to apply to only one member. Low systemic exposure with TCIs and striking differences between pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment in terms of pharmacology and clinical development programs might justify reconsideration of class labeling and/or warnings.

Low Systemic Exposure

Many studies with both pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment have shown systemic exposure to be low after topical treatment in AD patients as young as 3 months of age. In a head-to-head comparison study, the highest blood concentrations detected in adults with moderate-to-severe AD were 1.51 ng/mL in the pimecrolimus cream group and 2.39 ng/mL in the tacrolimus ointment group, both of which are substantially below target trough concentrations for systemic immunosuppression for tacrolimus (5–20 ng/mL) in transplant patients. In infants, blood concentrations are similar to those seen in adults with no evidence of accumulation for up to 1 year. The highest blood concentrations reported for infants with pimecrolimus cream 1% range from 1.8 to 4.14 ng/mL and the average maximum concentration with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% was 3% of that observed in pediatric liver-transplant patients receiving oral tacrolimus.

In vitro skin penetration (into) for each compound is approximately equal, but skin permeation (through) is greater for tacrolimus ointment than pimecrolimus cream. When comparing relative permeation in normal versus inflamed or corticosteroid-pretreated skin, both compounds permeated inflamed and corticosteroid-pretreated skin to a greater extent (up to a factor of 6 times greater than normal skin). Thus, exposure to TCIs is self-limiting — as skin barrier function is restored, exposure decreases. There is also the argument that pediatric patients may have greater systemic exposure because of their greater body surface area to weight ratio. In the head-to-head trial, when blood concentrations after tacrolimus ointment application were analyzed by total body surface area (TBSA) affected by AD, they were detectable in more patients as TBSA affected by AD increased.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) — immunosuppression exposures and outcomes are noted as follows: agents such as belatacept in EBV-negative transplant recipients are associated with increased risks for developing PTLD following SOT; the use of ATG solely as rejection therapy prior to PTLD development was an independent prognostic factor for superior overall survival after PTLD diagnosis following SOT; and in an analysis of 523 patients who underwent heart transplant, switching from calcineurin inhibitor-based to sirolimus-based immunosuppression was associated with decreased rates of malignancies following heart transplant.

### Efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil as a remission induction therapy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody: associated vasculitis-a meta-analysis [^9815439d]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The death rates in patients with AAV were similar between the treatment groups. Infections were the dominant causes of death in this study; 5 out of 7 patients (71%) in the treatment group with MMF and 3 out of 8 (38%) in the treatment group with CYC died of infections. Likewise, infections have been reported as major causes of death (50%) in patients with AAV. The rates of overall and severe infections were similar between the treatment groups. This tendency was also observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treated with either MMF or CYC. The rates of leucopenia were similar between the treatment groups. Both neutropenia and lymphopenia are known risk factors for infection. Therefore, the leucopenia caused by MMF may influence the risk of infection in patients with AAV. On the basis of these results, patients with AAV treated with MMF or CYC should be monitored for infections. However, our results do not lead to the conclusion that the side effects of MMF and CYC are equivalent in every respect, because treatment with CYC has some major problems such as carcinogenesis. In our results, the risks of malignancy were similar between the treatment groups (Supplemental figure 3B). CYC treatment increases the rates of bladder cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma and skin malignancies in a dose/duration-dependent manner, and MMF treatment produces a lower risk of malignancy than other immunosuppressants. The risk of carcinogenesis in patients with AAV treated with MMF should be evaluated during long observation periods and large cohorts in the future.

Although amenorrhea and infertility are important outcomes, especially for women of childbearing age, we were not able to assess them in our meta-analysis. CYC treatment has been reported to diminish the ovarian reserve in women with GPA. Another meta-analysis showed that the use of MMF is related to a significant reduction in the risk of amenorrhea compared with the use of CYC in patients with lupus nephritis. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels, which are sensitive ovarian damage markers, were not decreased in patients with lupus nephritis treated with MMF compared with those in the control population. Although AAV is less likely to occur in young women than SLE, permanent infertility should be a cause for concern when considering CYC treatment for young women with AAV. In such cases, MMF may be an attractive remission-inducing drug alternative.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed recommendations for symptomatic and long-term management [^2f8bec21]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

With this uncertainty and the low recurrence rates in seropositive cases, it is difficult to justify prolonged immunosuppression though in some cases a few to several years of maintenance immunosuppression may be indicated. Decisions regarding long-term immunosuppression should take in consideration published relapse rates for each specific clinical syndrome as well as severity of the initial attack and individual risks related to immunosuppression. Relapse rates and the value of long-term immunosuppression are among the key areas in need for further future research. In the meantime, any decision regarding maintenance immunosuppression in patients with AE should carefully weigh the risks versus potential benefits and incorporate evolving data about relapse risk for each specific clinical syndrome. Patients who experience a definite clinical relapse based on high clinical suspicion and supported by objective evidence of ancillary tests (eg, MRI or EEG) should start long-term immunosuppression after relapse treatment. Although azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have been used in this setting, the use of rituximab may have the added benefit of a potentially faster onset of action (second-line acute therapy) and less carcinogenic potential with prolonged use compared with other agents. Rituximab can be used as both a second-line agent for acute immunosuppression and as a long-term immunosuppressant for recurrent cases. Rituximab, however, does not deplete the antibody-secreting cells which are typically CD20-negative. In these conditions, rituximab may work by deleting the antigen-specific memory B-cell populations and hence preventing the formation of new plasmablasts which secrete the pathogenic antibodies. The use of other B-cell therapies (eg, humanised anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies) may be worth exploring in future research. Overlapping with oral corticosteroids is needed for 3–6 months when using azathioprine or MMF due to their delayed onset of action.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^89eb93da]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.2.1.1 Epstein Barr Virus

There is increasing interest in Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection in IBD patients because of the risk of severe complications, including haemophagocytic syndrome and post-mononucleosis type lymphomas after primary infection and haemophagocytic syndrome and post-transplant type lymphoma during latent infection. A Spanish tertiary care centre studied 1483 patients aged over 17 years between 2006 and 2016. They assessed EBV seroprevalence and seroconversion and documented those who developed complications while on azathioprine. EBV had a role in tumour development in three out of five patients on azathioprine, but only one (in a 66-year-old man) occurred during a primary infection. The authors conclude that the risk of haemophagocytic syndrome and lymphoma on thiopurine therapy is not restricted to young males. This is confirmed in a USA paediatric IBD follow-up cohort, where 3/5 patients with haemophagocytic syndrome (all on thiopurines) were female. There was no association with use of infliximab or methotrexate (although numbers on methotrexate were much smaller). It remains unclear whether screening for EBV status should be done routinely in adults. In paediatric patients who are particularly at risk from primary EBV infection, there may be more justification for screening in order to avoid thiopurine use in those who are seronegative. Routine EBV testing prior to thiopurine therapy remains controversial.

At subsequent meetings held in March 2010 and May 2011, the PAC reviewed post-marketing surveillance (PMS) and epidemiological data for both drugs and found it to be inconclusive with regards to both long-term safety concerns and malignancy risk. At both meetings, the committee requested that the FDA continue to monitor the literature, AERS, and product registries and maintain the boxed warning until conclusive evidence was found. In light of these inconclusive findings, this re-examination of a possible link between TCI use and lymphoma was undertaken.

Response from the Public and the Medical Community

News coverage of the boxed warnings was widespread, with stories appearing in notable publications, including USA Today, Washington Post, BBC News, and Consumer Reports. The resulting patient concerns led some patients and caregivers to dispose of their TCIs and opt for other treatments or forgo treatment altogether. Law firms began posting websites dedicated to soliciting litigations against the makers of TCIs, further adding to the anxiety among patients and caregivers.

Members of the medical community criticized the FDA's action and suggested that an unintended result was to jeopardize the chances of ever clarifying the risks due to decreased participation in clinical trials. Some argued that the FDA did not fairly weigh the data with respect to low systemic exposure seen in humans, lack of cancer adverse events in clinical studies, overall low rate of malignancy reports, and lack of evidence for systemic immune suppression with topical application of market formulations in preclinical studies. Critics also argued that the FDA overlooked the unmet medical need for these agents as an alternative to topical corticosteroids, especially for infants and patients with facial involvement. Furthermore, some members of the medical community questioned the plausibility of a biological link between immunosuppression and the types of cancers observed. On the other hand, the FDA did not rescind either drug's approval or request the termination of any of the ongoing clinical trials for either of these drugs.

### Meta-analysis of risk of malignancy with immunosuppressive drugs in inflammatory bowel disease [^24e16dde]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is a concern as to whether long-term administration of immunosuppressants in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) would increase the risk of malignancy.

Objective

To compare the risks of developing malignancy between patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive agents and patients with IBD not receiving these agents.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted, and a meta-analysis was performed on data retrieved from cohort studies that followed patients with IBD who received immunosuppressive agents for more than a year and documented the incidence of newly developed malignancy. An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), the Cochrane Library (issue 3, 2006), and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina (1981-September 2006). Medical subject headings used in the searches were azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, inflammatory bowel disease, and neoplasms. We imposed no language limitation in the searches. Additionally, a manual search of reference listings from all articles retrieved from the electronic databases was performed. Using data obtained from control groups or population-based studies, the incidence of newly developed malignancy in patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive agents was compared with that of patients with IBD who were not receiving immunosuppressive agents. Statistical analysis for the change in risk of developing malignancy was performed using the weighted mean difference (WMD) normalized to per person-year and its 95% confidence interval.

Results

Nine cohort studies met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. Analysis of these studies showed no discernible difference (WMD -0.3 x 10(-3)/person-year; 95% CI -1.2 x 10(-3) to 0.7 x 10(-3)) in the incidence of any kind of malignancy in patients with IBD who received immunosuppressants compared with those who did not receive immunosuppressants. No significant difference in WMD was observed when the data from patients with either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) were analyzed separately.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the administration of immunosuppressive agents in patients with either CD or UC probably does not confer a significantly increased risk of malignancy compared with patients with IBD who are not receiving these agents.

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 101 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned; 5 patients were excluded from analysis because of change in eligibility or withdrawal of consent before HCT procedure (supplemental Figure 1). The final analysis was based on data from 96 patients who were randomly assigned to receive mini-MTX/MMF (N = 47) or full-MTX (N = 49). The median follow-up period after transplant was 19.9 months (range, 0.5–48 months). Patient, disease, and transplant characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age at the time of transplantation was similar between the 2 groups, 45 years (range, 2–62) and 47 years (range, 5–59) in mini-MTX/MMF and full-MTX groups, respectively (P = 0.47). There was a greater proportion of males (64%) than females (36%) in the mini-MTX/MMF cohort, compared with that of 43% males and 57% females in the full-MTX group (P = 0.04). The majority of patients had an intermediate (1–2) or high (≥ 3) HCT comorbidity index and had undergone transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. Although there were slight differences in distribution of HCT comorbidity index and primary malignancy, these were not statistically significant. The cohorts were otherwise generally well-balanced with regards to disease risk, donor type, conditioning, and graft source. All patients in the mini-MTX/MMF arm received their 3 planned doses of MTX. The median number of days for receiving MMF was 57 days (range, 30–727). In the full-MTX arm, 71% received all 4 doses, 26% received 3 doses, and 1 patient received 2 doses of MTX. No additional immunosuppression was administered for omitted doses of MTX.

Adult liver transplant (LT) immunosuppression — determinants and monitoring are outlined as follows: The choice of immunosuppression depends on indication for transplantation with potential effects on disease recurrence, comorbidities, drug side effects (calcineurin inhibitors [CNIs] may cause renal impairment), likelihood of pregnancy (mycophenolate and mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors such as sirolimus are potential teratogens), history of severe or recurrent rejection, prior experience with immunosuppressive agents, and history of or risk for cancers or infections. There is no reliable marker for determining the effective level of immunosuppression; dosing is guided by clinical, laboratory, and histological response, and CNI dosing is guided by drug levels with target levels after 3 months of 5 to 10 ng/mL for tacrolimus and 100 to 150 ng/mL for cyclosporine (whole blood trough levels), with a target whole blood trough level for sirolimus of 5 ng/mL; the need for therapeutic drug monitoring for mycophenolate is uncertain. Most LT recipients need lifelong immunosuppression to maintain graft function, though a very small number develop operational tolerance and do not require long-term immunosuppression.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^b712543c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Topical tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream have been commercially available for more than a decade and are the first and only drugs approved for chronic treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric patients. These topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) have been a welcomed alternative to topical corticosteroids because their chronic use is not associated with skin barrier compromise or increasing percutaneous absorption. However, in January 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instituted a boxed warning for both TCIs based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (including lymphomas) that sparked an ongoing debate over the safety of these drugs. Since then, despite a number of epidemiological and clinical studies, no clear link between TCI use and lymphoma risk has been established. Yet, the boxed warning remains, leaving many physicians hesitant to prescribe TCIs and countless patients (including infants and children) exposed to other anti-inflammatory agents with proven adverse effects. This review will (1) present a historical overview of the basis for the boxed warning, (2) review and critically evaluate the evidence for lymphoma risk, (3) provide practical clinical and evidence-based advice on using TCIs in the management of AD, and (4) offer advice on addressing obstacles to patient access to these drugs.

Pediatric post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders — cross-cutting management notes — Treatment is based on the unique histology. Rituximab can be used if CD20 is only partially or dimly expressed but is not essential for CD20-negative PTLD, and the status and pattern of CD20 expression by flow cytometry should be reported in all subtypes of PTLD. Response to RIS is variable and patients need to be closely monitored; RIS includes reduction in calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), discontinuation of antimetabolic agents (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and consideration of discontinuation of non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression in patients who are critically ill. Collaboration with a graft transplant specialist is recommended to coordinate immunosuppressive medication assessment, dose modifications, and graft organ function monitoring. Completely resected PTLD without disease elsewhere can be managed without additional therapy with the exception of RIS. EBV viral load cannot be used for response assessment in PTLD. Biopsy should be considered prior to additional therapy. Re-escalation of immunosuppressive therapy should be individualized, taking into account the extent of initial RIS and the nature of the organ allograft. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Pediatric posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) — in children, PTLD accounts for over 90% of neoplasms and therapeutic approaches incorporate reduced immunosuppression, with commonly reduced CNI target trough levels and antiproliferatives held at least for the duration of chemotherapy, mostly for the first year post-treatment; neither MMF nor mTOR inhibitors were found to increase PTLD risk, and although mTOR inhibitors may have potential benefit for patients with or at risk of PTLD, this has not yet been confirmed in clinical studies; complete discontinuation of immunosuppression during chemotherapy has not changed tumor outcomes but has been associated with higher acute rejection versus maintaining baseline monotherapy immunosuppression.

The toxicity of standard triple-therapy immunosuppressive regimens has been identified as a possible factor in the failure to extend long-term renal allograft survival despite a continued decline of acute rejection rates. The result has been increasing focus on the use of mycophenolate mofetil-based, low-toxicity immunosuppressive regimens, which have been shown in randomized studies to have the potential to improve long-term graft survival. This Clinical Update discusses the likely risks and benefits for switching the immunosuppressive regimen in clinical practice.

### Evaluation of immunosuppression levels and risk of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide [^c8849406]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), although optimal therapeutic levels of immunosuppression (IS) therapy combined with PTCy remain contested. Previously, with tacrolimus and methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis, week 1 tacrolimus levels > 12 ng/mL were associated with a decreased incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD). We evaluated if associations between aGVHD and early IS levels were observed amongst patients receiving PTCy. This retrospective single-center study consisted of 349 patients who received PTCy and mycophenolate mofetil, with either tacrolimus (n = 185) or sirolimus (n = 164) from September 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. The median age of patients receiving tacrolimus and sirolimus were 58 and 54 years, respectively. The primary diagnosed diseases for both cohorts were acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoma. While most patients receiving tacrolimus were bone marrow graft sourced (78.4%), the majority of patients receiving sirolimus were peripheral blood sourced (80.5%). All patients were transplanted with FluCyTBI as the conditioning regimen. The primary outcome was grade 2 to 4 aGVHD incidence at 150 days post alloBMT between weekly IS levels < 10 ng/mL versus ≥ 10 ng/mL throughout the 4 weeks post-alloBMT. Secondary endpoints included moderate to severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) incidence, median overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 2 years and the correlation between weekly IS levels < 10 ng/mL versus ≥ 10 ng/mL throughout 4 weeks post-alloBMT. Patients receiving tacrolimus were compared to others in the tacrolimus cohort, and similarly for sirolimus. No correlation was found between IS levels at any individual week and cumulative aGVHD incidence for either tacrolimus or sirolimus. In the sirolimus cohort, no correlation for moderate to severe cGVHD was observed. However, at week 4, patients in the tacrolimus cohort with levels ≥ 10 ng/mL experienced significantly higher incidence of moderate to severe chronic GVHD than patients with weekly levels < 10 ng/mL (20% versus 8%, P < .001). When evaluating survival outcomes, post-alloBMT week 1 tacrolimus levels ≥ 10 ng/mL were associated with decreased OS (HR 3.84, 95% CI [1.16 to 12.67]; P = 0.027), but no correlation was seen in RFS (HR 1.62, 95% CI [0.56 to 4.72]; P = 0.377), or GRFS (HR 1.56, 95% CI [0.89 to 2.74]; P = 0.124). Post-alloBMT week 1 sirolimus ≥ 10 ng/mL levels were associated with decreased OS (HR 2.74, 95% CI [1.37 to 5.48]; P = 0.004) and GRFS (HR 1.93, 95% CI [1.19 to 3.12]; P = 0.007), but not RFS (HR 1.60, 95% CI [0.78 to 3.30]; P = 0.202). Overall, early IS levels in patients receiving PTCy-based GVHD prophylaxis did not correlate with aGVHD incidence, although IS levels ≥ 10 ng/mL were associated with compromised outcomes. Targeting IS levels < 10 ng/mL may be optimal when using PTCy-based GVHD prophylaxis.

Kaposi sarcoma — immunosuppression-related flare risks and concurrent lymphoma management — notes that therapies associated with flares of Kaposi sarcoma include those suppressing B- and T-cell numbers and/or function such as rituximab and cyclosporine, respectively, and that patients with AIDS-related lymphomas who have concurrent Kaposi sarcoma are often able to receive multiagent chemotherapy regimens including glucocorticoids and rituximab without significant flare of Kaposi sarcoma if the regimen also includes agents active against Kaposi sarcoma such as anthracyclines. Careful monitoring of Kaposi sarcoma should be performed during and following conclusion of lymphoma therapy; additional Kaposi sarcoma-directed therapy may be required after completion of lymphoma regimens associated with prolonged immunosuppression (ie, rituximab, nucleoside analogues). Overall, the survival of patients with Kaposi sarcoma has greatly improved, and long-term survival can be the goal for many patients. The goals of therapy for patients with advanced disease are namely reducing or reversing symptoms and mitigating end-organ damage, and complete remissions in this setting are rare, but effective therapy can result in long-term disease control.

Low credibility.

Guidelines

A. In the first year after organ transplantation, recipients are at the greatest risk of developing lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLDs), which are induced most often by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and patients should therefore be screened prior to or at the time of transplantation for EBV antibodies. B. In the rare cases (< 5%) where the recipient is EBV seronegative, he or she has a 95% likelihood of receiving an organ from an EBV-seropositive donor, which translates into a high risk of primary EBV infection with seroconversion soon after transplantation. In such cases, the recipient should receive a prophylactic antiviral treatment with acyclovir, valacyclovir or ganciclovir, starting at the time of transplant and lasting for at least 3 months. The specific recommendations given for CMV prophylaxis could be applicable in this situation. C. The treatment of PTLD should be based on accurate pathology with extensive cell markers and phenotyping. The treatment modalities are as follows. Reduction of basal immunosuppression in all cases (either maintain only steroids, or decrease by at least 50% the anti-calcineurin drugs and stop other immunosuppressive drugs). In the case of EBV-positive B-cell lymphoma, antiviral treatment with acyclovir, valacyclovir or ganciclovir may be initiated for at least 1 month or according to the blood level of EBV replication when available. In the case of rare lymphomas from the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) with positive Helicobacter pylori, full eradication of H. pylori should be carried out with a validated protocol. Subsequent H. pylori prophylaxis should be implemented to avoid relapse. In the case of CD20-positive lymphomas, treatment with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, should be carried out with one i.v. injection per week for 4 weeks. In the case of diffuse lymphomas or improper response to previous treatment, CHOP chemotherapy should be used alone or in combination with rituximab. The CHOP regimen is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine and prednisone. Complete cessation of immunosuppression with or without graft nephrectomy should also be considered.

PML risk factors

The major predisposing factors for PML are reported in table 1, with risk factors categorized by 5-year epoch reported in table 2. HIV infection was the most common risk factor, identified in 49% of the 91 patients. Other frequent risk factors included lymphoma, leukemia, or myelodysplasia, identified in 31% of patients (n = 28), exposure to chemotherapeutic medications (30%, n = 27), and exposure to monoclonal antibody therapies (19%, n = 17). Several patients had exposure to multiple risk factors; for instance, 20 patients with lymphoma, leukemia, or myelodysplasia were also exposed to chemotherapeutic medications, 3 had bone marrow or stem cell transplants, and 1 had comorbid HIV infection. Eight patients had underlying rheumatologic diseases, including sarcoidosis, granulomatous polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. All these patients were treated with disease-modifying therapies, including adalimumab, plaquenil, mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and/or methotrexate. One patient, diagnosed in 2002 and deceased 2 months later, had no known risk factors at the time of PML symptom onset; however, extensive immunologic and hematologic evaluations were not undertaken in this patient.

### Addition of sirolimus to standard cyclosporine plus mycophenolate mofetil-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis for patients after unrelated non-myeloablative haemopoietic stem cell transplantation: a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial [^11d9d2cb]. The Lancet: Haematology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after non-myeloablative human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, unrelated donor, allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding sirolimus to the standard cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil prophylaxis therapy for preventing acute GVHD in this setting.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial took place at nine HSCT centres based in the USA, Denmark, and Germany. Eligible patients were diagnosed with advanced haematological malignancies treatable by allogeneic HSCT, had a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60, were aged older than 50 years, or if they were aged 50 years or younger, were considered at high risk of regimen-related toxicity associated with a high-dose pre-transplantation conditioning regimen. Patients were randomly allocated by an adaptive randomisation scheme stratified by transplantation centre to receive either the standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen (cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil) or the triple-drug combination regimen (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus). Patients and physicians were not masked to treatment. All patients were prepared for HSCT with fludarabine (30 mg/m² per day) 4, 3, and 2 days before receiving 2 or 3 Gy total body irradiation on the day of HSCT (day 0). In both study groups, 5.0 mg/kg of cyclosporine was administered orally twice daily starting 3 days before HSCT, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered from day 96 through to day 150. In the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, 15 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil was given orally three times daily from day 0 until day 30, then twice daily until day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. In the triple-drug group, mycophenolate mofetil doses were the same as in the standard group, but the drug was discontinued on day 40. Sirolimus was started 3 days before HSCT, taken orally at 2 mg once daily and adjusted to maintain trough concentrations between 3–12 ng/mL through to day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of grade 2–4 acute GVHD at day 100 post-transplantation. Secondary endpoints were non-relapse mortality, overall survival, progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of grade 3–4 acute GVHD, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Efficacy and safety analyses were per protocol, including all patients who received conditioning treatment and underwent transplantation. Toxic effects were measured according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The current study was closed prematurely by recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board on July 27, 2016, after 168 patients received the allocated intervention, based on the results of a prespecified interim analysis for futility. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231412.

Findings

Participants were recruited between Nov 1, 2010, and July 27, 2016. Of 180 patients enrolled in the study, 167 received the complete study intervention and were included in safety and efficacy analyses: 77 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group and 90 in the triple-drug group. At the time of analysis, median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 31–60). The cumulative incidence of grade 2–4 acute GVHD at day 100 was lower in the triple-drug group compared with the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (26% [95% CI 17–35] in the triple-drug group vs 52% [41–63] in the standard group; HR 0.45 [95% CI 0.28–0.73]; p = 0.0013). After 1 and 4 years, non-relapse mortality increased to 4% (95% CI 0–9) and 16% (8–24) in the triple-drug group and 16% (8–24) and 32% (21–43) in the standard group (HR 0.48 [0.26–0.90]; p = 0.021). Overall survival at 1 year was 86% (95% CI 78–93) in the triple-drug group and 70% in the standard group (60–80) and at 4 years it was 64% in the triple-drug group (54–75) and 46% in the standard group (34–57%; HR 0.62 [0.40–0.97]; p = 0.035). Progression-free survival at 1 year was 77% (95% CI 68–85) in the triple-drug group and 64% (53–74) in the standard drug group, and at 4 years it was 59% in the triple-drug group (49–70) and 41% in the standard group (30–53%; HR 0.64 [0.42–0.99]; p = 0.045). We observed no difference in the cumulative incidence of grade 3–4 acute GVHD (2% [0–5] in the triple-drug group vs 8% [2–14] in the standard group; HR 0.55 [0.16–1.96]; p = 0.36) and chronic GVHD (49% [39–59] in triple-drug group vs 50% [39–61] in the standard group; HR 0.94 [0.62–1.40]; p = 0.74). In both groups the most common CTCAE grade 4 or higher toxic effects were pulmonary.

Interpretation

Adding sirolimus to cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in a significantly lower proportion of patients developing acute GVHD compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil alone. Based on these results, the combination of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus has become the new standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients treated with non-myeloablative conditioning and HLA-matched unrelated HSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

### The role of combination therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^551df098]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma risk with thiopurines, anti-TNF agents, and combination therapy in inflammatory bowel disease — It is generally believed that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) alone is not a risk factor for lymphoma, but pediatric thiopurine monotherapy showed a rare incidence of lymphoma of 4.5 per 10,000 patient-years, and a meta-analysis describes a 6-fold higher risk in patients actively taking thiopurines that occurred primarily in older patients exposed to thiopurines greater than 1 year and reverted back to baseline upon discontinuation. For anti-TNF monotherapy, a consistent association has not been reported, with the Crohn Therapy, Resource, Evaluation, and Assessment Tool registry showing no association of malignancy risk with infliximab (IFX) alone (HR = 0.59; P = 0.16) and pooled adalimumab randomized controlled trials including 3050 patient-years. With thiopurine plus anti-TNF combination therapy, reported lymphoma incidence rates range from 2.1 to 19.1 per 10,000 patient-years and standardized incidence ratios ranged from 2.0 to 10.2; in summary, it appears that the majority of lymphoma risk in patients on combination therapy is attributable to the thiopurine component, although there may be some degree of increased risk related to the addition of an anti-TNF agent, the extent of which remains unclear.

Cyclophosphamide — malignancy risk signals and neutral findings are reported as follows: Lymphomas, leukemias, skin cancers, and probably other solid organ malignancies are likely increased in frequency in individuals receiving cyclophosphamide, with a retrospective study in granulomatosis with polyangiitis showing increased incidence for squamous cell skin cancer (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 4.4–12), leukemias (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 2.8–13.2), and malignant lymphomas (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 4.2–8.3). Interpretation is complicated by baseline disease risk, and not all studies show excess risk: a Swedish registry study of 246 patients with scleroderma followed for up to 13 years found no increase in malignancy when comparing cyclophosphamide with other medications, and a prospective 15-year evaluation of 726 patients with lung cancer treated with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, or placebo saw no additional malignancies in the cyclophosphamide arm above the placebo rate.

### Mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for prevention of graft-versus-host disease in people receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^2c9752c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is associated with improved outcomes for people with various hematologic diseases; however, the morbidity and mortality resulting from acute and subsequently chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pose a serious challenge to wider applicability of allo-HCT. Intravenous methotrexate in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, is a widely used regimen for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD, but the administration of methotrexate is associated with a number of adverse events. Mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, has been used extensively in people undergoing allo-HCT. Conflicting results regarding various clinical outcomes following allo-HCT have been observed when comparing mycophenolate mofetil-based regimens against methotrexate-based regimens for acute GVHD prophylaxis.

Primary Objective

to assess the effect of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for prevention of acute GVHD in people undergoing allo-HCT.

Secondary Objectives

to evaluate the effect of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for overall survival, prevention of chronic GVHD, incidence of relapse, treatment-related harms, nonrelapse mortality, and quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE from inception to March 2014. We handsearched conference abstracts from the last two meetings (2011 and 2012) of relevant societies in the field. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Novartis clinical trials database (www.novctrd.com), Roche clinical trial protocol registry (www.roche-trials.com), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently reviewed all titles/abstracts and selected full-text articles for inclusion. We included all references that reported results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for the prophylaxis of GVHD among people undergoing allo-HCT in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on outcomes from all studies and compared prior to data entry and analysis. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for time-to-event outcomes. We pooled the individual study effects using the random-effects model. Estimates lower than one indicate that mycophenolate mofetil was favored over methotrexate.

Main Results

We included three trials enrolling 177 participants (174 participants analyzed). All participants in the trials by Keihl et al. and Bolwell et al. received cyclosporine while all participants enrolled in the trial by Perkins et al. received tacrolimus. However, the results did not differ by the type of calcineurin inhibitor employed (cyclosporine versus tacrolimus). There was no evidence for a difference between mycophenolate mofetil versus methotrexate for the outcomes of incidence of acute GVHD (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.75 to 2.09; P value = 0.39, very low quality evidence), overall survival (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.17; P value = 0.19, low-quality evidence), median days to neutrophil engraftment (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.17; P value = 0.23, low-quality evidence), incidence of relapse (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; P value = 0.50, low-quality evidence), non-relapse mortality (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.36; P value = 0.57, low-quality evidence), and incidence of chronic GVHD (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.30; P value = 0.62, low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence that mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate improved platelet engraftment period (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.93; P value < 0.0001, low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence that mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate resulted in decreased incidence of severe mucositis (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.73; P value = 0.0006, low-quality evidence), use of parenteral nutrition (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.91; P value = 0.02, low-quality evidence), and medication for pain control (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; P value = 0.002, low-quality evidence). Overall heterogeneity was not detected in the analysis except for the outcome of neutrophil engraftment. None of the included studies reported any outcomes related to quality of life. Overall quality of evidence was low.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate for primary prevention of GVHD seems to be associated with a more favorable toxicity profile, without an apparent compromise on disease relapse, transplant-associated mortality, or overall survival. The effects on incidence of GVHD between people receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared with people receiving methotrexate were uncertain. There is a need for additional high-quality RCTs to determine the optimal GVHD prevention strategy. Future studies should take into account a comprehensive view of clinical benefit, including measures of morbidity, symptom burden, and healthcare resource utilization associated with interventions.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^508ac7b2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), commercially available since 2000–2001, are the first and only topical medications approved for chronic treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric patients and remain a welcomed alternative to topical corticosteroids. In January 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a boxed warning requirement based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (including lymphoma) with TCI use. However, in the years since, analyses of epidemiologic and clinical data have failed to demonstrate a causal relationship between TCI use and malignancy or lymphoma risk, especially for pimecrolimus cream. In fact, the observed number of malignancies and lymphomas observed both in post-marketing surveillance and reported to the FDA using its adverse events reporting system is much lower among TCI-exposed patients than the expected number for the general population. Furthermore, among children enrolled in post-marketing pediatric registry studies for both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus followed for up to 5.5 years [10,724 patient-years (PY)] or 6.5 years (16,219 PY), respectively, the observed number of malignancies and lymphomas is very low and similar to the number expected for a sample of similar size in the general population. In addition to reporting these comparative malignancy and lymphoma data, this article provides a historical overview of the boxed warning requirement and critically evaluates the preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological evidence that has thus far failed to substantiate a relationship between TCI use and malignancy. The authors also provide practical clinical advice for optimizing AD management and patient care in the context of the boxed warning.

Risk factors for developing PTLD — across transplant settings — include EBV serology mismatch (recipient EBV-negative and donor EBV-positive), organ type with highest risks for multiorgan, bowel, lung, and heart/lung transplants, intensity of induction immunosuppression, and type of immunosuppression; the risk is higher among children compared with adults due to primary EBV infection in EBV-negative organ recipients. In allogeneic HCT, unrelated or HLA-mismatched allografts, use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and T-cell depletion of the allograft are associated with increased risks for PTLD.
