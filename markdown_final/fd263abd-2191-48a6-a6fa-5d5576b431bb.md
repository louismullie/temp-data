## Question

Terbinafine for Kaposi sarcoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbinafine is an appropriate treatment for Kaposi sarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what terbinafine is and what it is FDA-approved to treat. Then, I should verify the standard pathobiology and evidence-based treatments for Kaposi sarcoma across its clinical subtypes. Next, I will check whether there is any clinical or mechanistic rationale for terbinafine in KS, and whether any guidelines or trials support its use. After that, I should consider potential sources of drug confusion and correct any misinterpretations. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical recommendation and point to appropriate, guideline-concordant therapies for KS where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled uses of terbinafine, because if I get that wrong, everything downstream will be off. Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits fungal squalene epoxidase, disrupting ergosterol biosynthesis and leading to fungal cell death, with labeled indications for dermatophyte infections such as onychomycosis and tinea corporis/cruris/pedis; there is no labeled antiviral, antiangiogenic, or antineoplastic indication noted in FDA materials, and no HHV-8 activity described in labeling or standard drug monographs [^113GhdeJ] [^112VL6ed] [^117F8mk1] [^113QkESD].

> Now, I should review what Kaposi sarcoma is and how we treat it when we follow evidence-based oncology and HIV-oncology guidance. KS is an HHV-8–associated, angioproliferative neoplasm with distinct clinical settings (epidemic/HIV-related, classic, endemic, iatrogenic), and management focuses on immune restoration when relevant, local control for limited disease, and systemic therapy for symptomatic, function-limiting, or advanced involvement; guideline-preferred systemic therapies include liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel, with sirolimus emphasized for transplant-associated KS and a range of subsequent options including immunomodulatory agents and checkpoint inhibitors in selected settings [^113Rgwco] [^113LQLDJ] [^113xy9NK] [^114BgCRf].

> Wait, let me verify whether any reputable guideline or trial has ever listed terbinafine for any KS subtype, because an outlier case report could mislead practice. I need to check NCCN and BHIVA guidance and the trial literature overview in our provided set; I see no mention of terbinafine as a KS therapy in NCCN 2019 pathways, in BHIVA malignancy guidance, or in systemic therapy summaries, which instead prioritize anthracycline liposomes, taxanes, mTOR inhibition for post-transplant, immunomodulatory agents, and in selected contexts anti-VEGF or PD-1 blockade, while topical retinoids can be used for cutaneous-only lesions; this absence strongly argues against any role for terbinafine in KS care [^113Rgwco] [^113LQLDJ] [^113xy9NK] [^114BgCRf].

> Hold on, I should confirm mechanistic plausibility, because even if it's not in guidelines, a mechanistic signal could exist; but KS oncobiology is driven by HHV-8 latent and lytic programs, inflammatory cytokine/angiogenic signaling, and pathways like mTOR, while terbinafine's target is a fungal enzyme not present in human or viral cells, so there is no coherent mechanism by which terbinafine would inhibit KS proliferation, angiogenesis, or HHV-8 replication based on established pathogenesis and drug pharmacology [^111VGoJf] [^113GhdeJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could I be conflating terbinafine with another agent used in dermatologic oncology or transplant medicine. Initially, I wondered if terbinafine might share antiangiogenic effects seen with sirolimus in transplant-associated KS or topical approaches like timolol or alitretinoin gel for cutaneous lesions; but let me reconsider and correct that thought, because sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor with anti-KS activity, timolol has been explored as a topical option mechanistically via beta-adrenergic signaling, and alitretinoin gel is a topical retinoid used for cutaneous AIDS-KS, whereas terbinafine is purely an antifungal without these oncologic mechanisms or supporting evidence [^112kMYRn] [^114ApkWC] [^115uF4nn].

> Next, I should review systemic options that might be considered when KS requires more than observation or local therapy, to ensure the recommendation is not just "don't use terbinafine" but also "do use evidence-based alternatives when indicated". For first-line systemic therapy, liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel are recommended, with sirolimus specifically for transplant-associated KS, while subsequent lines can include agents like bortezomib, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and immune checkpoint inhibitors in selected cases, and data also exist for bevacizumab in HIV-KS; none of these frameworks include terbinafine, reinforcing that using it would be inappropriate and potentially delay effective treatment [^113LQLDJ] [^113xy9NK] [^113uVh91] [^112o57Ey].

> I should double-check the HIV-related setting because ART optimization itself can induce regression and is foundational, and any KS-directed therapy must be coordinated with HIV care; NCCN and BHIVA stress initiation or continuation of ART, recognition and management of KS-associated IRIS when present, and timely escalation to systemic KS therapy when disease is symptomatic or function-limiting, again with no role for antifungals like terbinafine in disease control [^113Rgwco] [^115627NE] [^114BgCRf].

> Putting it all together, I need to ensure my final recommendation is precise and clinically actionable. Terbinafine is not indicated and has no plausible mechanistic or evidence-based role in Kaposi sarcoma management, whereas guideline-concordant strategies include ART optimization for HIV-related disease, local therapies or radiation for limited cutaneous disease, and systemic therapy such as liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced or symptomatic disease, with additional lines including mTOR inhibition in transplant-associated KS and selected immunomodulatory or checkpoint approaches; therefore, prescribing terbinafine for KS would be inappropriate and risks delaying effective care [^113GhdeJ] [^113Rgwco] [^113LQLDJ] [^113xy9NK].

---

Terbinafine is not effective for Kaposi sarcoma (KS) because it is an antifungal that targets ergosterol synthesis, a pathway absent in KS [^112VL6ed] [^111VGoJf]. There is no clinical evidence or guideline support for terbinafine in KS, and standard care remains antiretroviral therapy plus liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced disease [^113LQLDJ] [^113Rgwco] [^11222PRL]. Terbinafine should not be used for KS, and patients should receive established therapies [^113LQLDJ].

---

## Mechanism of action of terbinafine

Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase, blocking ergosterol synthesis and causing fungal cell death via squalene accumulation and membrane disruption [^112VL6ed]. This fungal-specific mechanism does not apply to KS, a vascular tumor driven by HHV-8–infected endothelial cells [^111VGoJf].

---

## Pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma

KS is an HHV-8–driven angioproliferative tumor, with lesions driven by viral oncogenes, angiogenesis, and immune dysregulation [^111VGoJf]. Its pathogenesis is **viral and angiogenic**, not fungal; therefore, terbinafine's mechanism is irrelevant [^117F5zWW].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding terbinafine in Kaposi sarcoma

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting terbinafine for KS: no trials or case reports demonstrate efficacy, and no guidelines recommend its use [^113LQLDJ] [^114BgCRf].

---

## Current standard treatments for Kaposi sarcoma

Standard KS care is guided by disease extent, symptoms, and immune status [^113Rgwco]:

- **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)**: Essential for HIV-associated KS; immune restoration alone can induce remission [^114Lgrs4] [^113Rgwco].
- **Systemic chemotherapy**: Liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for advanced or symptomatic disease [^113LQLDJ] [^11222PRL].
- **Local therapies**: Radiation, intralesional vinblastine, or topical agents for limited cutaneous disease [^113eBcuh] [^112Scttn] [^115uF4nn].
- **Immunomodulatory agents**: Sirolimus for transplant-associated KS [^116isKmR]; thalidomide or lenalidomide in select cases [^113xy9NK].

These therapies are **evidence-based** and recommended by NCCN and BHIVA [^113Rgwco] [^114BgCRf].

---

## Safety profile and potential risks of terbinafine

Terbinafine has a well-characterized safety profile, including:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes and rare severe liver injury [^112mSCM4] [^117F8mk1].
- **Hematologic effects**: Rare neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia [^112mSCM4].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare severe reactions, including anaphylaxis [^112mSCM4].

These risks are **unjustified** in KS given the lack of benefit.

---

## Expert opinions and clinical guidelines

There is **no support** from experts or guidelines for terbinafine in KS; NCCN [^113LQLDJ] and BHIVA [^114BgCRf] recommend ART, chemotherapy, and immunomodulators, with no mention of terbinafine [^113Rgwco].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Terbinafine is **not effective** for KS due to its fungal-specific mechanism and lack of evidence. Care should follow established guidelines — ART, chemotherapy, and immunomodulators as appropriate — and avoid terbinafine; patients should receive **evidence-based** therapies [^113Rgwco] [^114BgCRf].

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma as outlined in the NCCN guidelines, particularly for advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal manifestations, the 2019 recommendations emphasize medical optimization. Radiation therapy should be considered for patients not immediately eligible for systemic therapy, while antiretroviral therapy should be continued or initiated for those with HIV. Systemic therapy is preferred over radiation therapy as first-line treatment and for relapsed or refractory disseminated disease whenever feasible.

Although uncommon, performance status and medical comorbidities may sometimes preclude the immediate use of chemotherapy. Reversible medical issues, such as active infections requiring antibiotics or antivirals, and high-level HIV viremia necessitating initiation or modification of antiretroviral therapy, should be addressed to enable prompt delivery of systemic therapy. If poor performance status is attributed to Kaposi sarcoma, systemic therapy may improve these conditions.

Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second most common cancer in HIV-infected patients worldwide. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decline in its incidence; however, Kaposi's sarcoma continues to be diagnosed in HIV-infected patients.

- **Objectives**: To assess the added advantage of chemotherapy plus HAART compared to HAART alone, and the advantages of different chemotherapy regimens in HAART and HAART-naive HIV-infected adults with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, GATEWAY, the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^111y1Uay]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). High credibility.

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. We examine factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in their survival after its diagnosis over calendar time.

- **Methods**: Data were from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV negative to having HIV antibodies detected). Incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was calculated. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to determine survival after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis in three calendar periods: before 1996, 1996–2000, and 2001–2006. Poisson models were used to examine the effect of risk factors such as the nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and age at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma incidence in cART-treated men. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Among the 9473 men, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma in the period 1986–2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis rose statistically significantly during the study period from 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 42%) before 1996 to 84% (95% CI = 76% to 90%) in 1996–2000 and to 81% (95% CI = 70% to 88%) in 2001–2006 (P < .001). Seventy men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART. Current (i.e. within 6 months) CD4 cell count was associated with…

### Quality of life and Kaposi sarcoma: Using preference techniques to value the health gains from treatment [^111vGiho]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The goal of this work was to investigate preference techniques to value potential health gains from treatments of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). The study was designed to take the form of face-to-face interviews with a sample of men with a history of HIV/AIDS (n = 15) or HIV/AIDS and KS (n = 17). The main outcome measure was quality of life (QoL) associated with various KS disease states expressed on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health), obtained through time trade-off (TTO) and rating scale techniques.

For cutaneous lesions only, the mean TTO preference score value was 0.27. In other words, the men were willing to trade a life expectancy of 5 years for a shorter period (1.4 years) in perfect health. More severe KS health states were rated lower (0.07–0.09). The mean rating scale value for cutaneous lesions only was 0.11 and ranged from -0.10 to -0.04 for the more severe conditions; these values were systematically lower than the TTO (P = 0.014).

A large overall potential gain in QoL from treatment (partial response minus stable disease) was found for each condition to be reflected in both the TTO (from 0.31 to 0.55) and the rating scale (from 0.38 to 0.44). Respondents associate KS health states with extremely poor QoL and indicate that large gains are possible through modest treatment effects. While TTO returns higher values than the rating scale, potential gains from treatments were similar. The techniques appear to be suitable for application to QoL and economic evaluation of treatments of KS.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^112o3o5N]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in reducing the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, HIV-infected individuals who have responded to treatment continue to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma. This study examines factors associated with the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma among cART-treated HIV-infected homosexual men and changes in their survival after its diagnosis over time.

- **Methods**: Data were collected from HIV-infected homosexual men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion, defined as the change from being HIV negative to having HIV antibodies detected. The incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was calculated. Kaplan–Meier methods were used to determine survival after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis across three calendar periods: before 1996, 1996–2000, and 2001–2006. Poisson models examined the effects of risk factors such as the nadir CD4 cell count (the lowest ever recorded for a person), duration of infection, and age at diagnosis on the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma in cART-treated men. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Among the 9,473 men studied, 555 were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma between 1986 and 2006, of whom 319 died. The percentage surviving 24 months after Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis increased significantly over the study period, from 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 42%) before 1996 to 84% (95% CI = 76% to 90%) between 1996 and 2000, and to 81% (95% CI = 70% to 88%) between 2001 and 2006 (P < .001). Furthermore, 70 men were diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma after starting cART, and the current (within 6 months) CD4 cell count was associated with outcomes.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117Pqy7M]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the 2019 NCCN guidelines specifically address the management of limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma. Patients with relapsed or progressive disease after first-line therapy should be treated similarly to those with advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma. In cases of progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease, consider performing a biopsy of lesions, as they might be areas of post-inflammatory pigment or mimickers of Kaposi sarcoma. If Kaposi sarcoma is confirmed, evaluate inadequate HIV control as a potential contributing factor to the ineffective management of Kaposi sarcoma and discuss possible changes in antiretroviral therapy with an HIV specialist. If Kaposi sarcoma relapses or progresses after an initial response, consider repeating the use of previously effective therapy, especially if the initial response was durable.

Discussion

Most commonly, iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is seen in solid organ transplant recipients. However, as JAK inhibitors have received approval for a wide range of diseases throughout the past decade, there have been a growing number of KS cases related to their use. JAK inhibitors act by targeting JAKs, which are tyrosine kinases that have a pivotal role in cellular signal transduction for a wide range of systems. JAK inhibitors have quickly revolutionized the management of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatologic disease. Because of their immunosuppressive properties, there are a range of adverse effects seen with these medications.

JAK inhibitors have been demonstrated to increase the risk of herpes zoster, with a recent systematic review looking at 47 randomized controlled trials showing three times higher odds of shingles in those treated with upadacitinib compared to those without treatment. Basic science studies have demonstrated the crucial role of JAK pathways in the proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes for optimal antiviral functions. It is possible that the downregulation of these pathways by JAK inhibitors could cause varicella-zoster virus reactivation and lead to increased herpes zoster incidence. Theoretically, the same could be said about HHV-8 reactivation leading to KS development in patients treated with JAK inhibitors.

This report contributes to a growing number of iatrogenic KS reports. Although there are too few cases to be assessed systematically, there are at least seven other reported cases of KS associated with JAK inhibitors at the time of writing. Interestingly, in three of these KS cases…

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115627NE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend initiating systemic Kaposi sarcoma-directed therapy as soon as possible in all patients with HIV who have symptomatic Kaposi sarcoma, such as edema or oral Kaposi sarcoma, or other manifestations that interfere with normal functions or activities.

In patients with limited cutaneous disease, consider urgent initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy if Kaposi sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is present. Signs of past immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may also indicate the need for earlier initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy. Do not delay or discontinue antiretroviral therapy unless life-threatening immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome develops. Recognize that reconstitution of immune function is important for obtaining and maintaining control or remission of Kaposi sarcoma.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115wCuxf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma, especially those with advanced immunosuppression, closely for opportunistic infections, marrow suppression with neutropenic fever, or thrombocytopenic bleeding. It is crucial to collaborate with an HIV specialist to ensure adequate opportunistic infection prophylaxis appropriate to the CD4+ T-cell count, which may temporarily decrease with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factor support may be needed to facilitate systemic therapy.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^1125ohi3]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

This study was conducted at the Department of Research in Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, a national referral center in Mexico City. Individuals attending our institution frequently have PCP or Mycobacterium tuberculosis pneumonia; therefore, they usually receive antibiotics and glucocorticoids for the treatment of such infections. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with HIV infection and associated Kaposi's sarcoma, who started ART between January 2008 and August 2014 at our institution. The main outcomes of interest were KS-IRIS and Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality. The main exposure of interest was the use of glucocorticoids.

- **Case definitions for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome**: Diagnosis of IRIS was based on the consensus criteria of the International Network for the Study of HIV-Associated IRIS, specified as follows: response to ART by receiving HIV ART and virologic response with more than 1 log 10 copies/ml decrease in HIV RNA; clinical deterioration of an infectious or inflammatory condition temporally related to ART initiation (< 1 year); and inability to explain symptoms by expected clinical course of a previously recognized and successfully treated infection, medication side-effect or toxicity, treatment failure, and complete nonadherence.

- **Procedures**: The retrospective review of medical records included sociodemographic variables such as age, sex, and risk factors for HIV infection. Variables from the clinical domain included…

### Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-1 infected individuals with emphasis on resource poor settings [^11222PRL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

In many countries, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignancy among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) and is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens for the treatment of HIV-associated KS, with a focus on options that may be available in resource-poor settings.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, AIDSDRUGS, AIDSTRIALS, African Index Medicus, physicians data query protocols, United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research Register of Cancer Trials, proceedings, and abstracts from AIDS and cancer conferences. The search was conducted between 1st October 2001 and completed on 14th December 2002. We also contacted experts in the field of cancer.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials of therapy for KS in HIV-infected adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: Five trials involving 915 people were included. Two trials involving 499 people compared pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) to a standard regimen among patients with advanced KS and were analyzed together. There was no difference in mortality between the two regimens (RR 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.91). The response to PLD was superior to that of the control regimen.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma [^112tbfkv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm among people living with HIV today. In Sub-Saharan Africa, it ranks among the most prevalent cancers in men overall. Not only do HIV-positive individuals present with KS, but any immunocompromised person infected with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 is at risk. This includes the elderly, children in KSHV-endemic areas, and transplant recipients.

KS diagnosis is based on the detection of the viral protein latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in the biopsy. However, not all KS cases are identical or respond to the same therapy. Although standard KS therapy has remained unchanged for 20 years, newer treatment modalities are on the horizon and will be discussed.

### Emergence of terbinafine-resistantin Ontario, Canada, 2014–2023 [^115WPVwJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses are superficial mycoses of the skin, hair, and nails caused by several species of keratinophilic fungi, including Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton interdigitale, and other Trichophyton spp., as well as Microsporum spp. and Epidermophyton spp. While not fatal, these infections are highly prevalent, affecting 20%–25% of the global population. They cause severe morbidity due to uncomfortable inflammation, itchy rashes, scaling at superficial body sites, and superinfections. Nevertheless, dermatophytoses have historically been regarded as a relatively low-priority clinical and public health problem, partly because effective treatment with various antifungals is available without prescription in many countries.

Recently, a newly described species, Trichophyton indotineae (previously Trichophyton mentagrophytes VIII), has been reported to cause cases of extensive, recalcitrant tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Over the past decade, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of T. indotineae infections in India such that in a recent survey, the vast majority (78%) of dermatophyte infections in this country were found to be caused by T. indotineae. Now considered endemic to India and Iran, many other countries are reporting imported cases of T. indotineae with possible rare cases of local transmission, signaling the potential for this epidemic to spread to additional countries in the near future. Many cases of T. indotineae dermatophytosis are recalcitrant to both topical and oral preparations of the first-line treatment option terbinafine.

### Phase II study of bevacizumab in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma receiving antiretroviral therapy [^112o57Ey]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Alternatives to cytotoxic agents are desirable for patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) contributes to KS pathogenesis. We evaluated bevacizumab, the humanized anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, in patients with HIV-KS.

Patients with HIV-KS who experienced progression while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least one month, or who did not regress despite HAART for at least four months, were administered bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8, and then every three weeks. The primary objective was to assess antitumor activity using modified AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria for HIV-KS. HIV-uninfected patients were also eligible and observed separately.

Seventeen HIV-infected patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients had been receiving effective HAART for at least six months, with a median duration of one year. Thirteen patients had advanced disease (ACTG T1), thirteen had received prior chemotherapy for KS, and seven had a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL. The median number of cycles was ten (ranging from one to 37 cycles), with a median follow-up of 8.3 months (ranging from three to 36 months). Of the 16 assessable patients, the best tumor responses observed were complete response (CR) in three patients (19%), partial response (PR) in two patients (12%), stable disease in nine patients (56%), and progressive disease in two patients (12%). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 31% (95% CI, 11% to 58.7%). Four of five responders had received prior chemotherapy for KS.

### Leflunomide with low-dose everolimus for treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma in a renal allograft recipient [^116h7rhc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma involves the reduction of immunosuppression with or without the addition of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi). Akt signalling plays a central role in the oncogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma. We describe a case of multifocal Kaposi's sarcoma in a renal allograft recipient, which showed an unsatisfactory early response to immunosuppression reduction along with everolimus therapy but completely resolved after adding leflunomide. mTORi impair Kaposi's sarcoma oncogenesis by inhibiting mTOR downstream from Akt signalling. Leflunomide inhibits Akt phosphorylation. This synergistic effect may be beneficial in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and needs to be explored in trials.

### Terbinafine [^117GtQHB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

- **First toenail trial**: Results assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy) demonstrated a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Additionally, 59% of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

- **Second toenail trial**: In this trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, where nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established, and the clinical significance of this association is unknown.

- **Fingernail trial**: Results assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy) demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines specifically address regimens for systemic therapy (relapsed or refractory). These guidelines emphasize that patients of childbearing potential treated with pomalidomide, lenalidomide, or thalidomide require effective contraception if participating in sexual activity that could result in pregnancy. Refer to the risk evaluation and mitigation program for the specific therapy. The clinical trial for pomalidomide used a dose of 5 mg/day; however, pomalidomide is provided in a 4-mg dose, and the panel believes that this is a sufficient dose.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112S2xEG]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Clinical benefits have been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of Kaposi's sarcoma, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.

- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians to the potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### Pomalyst [^113pu8nf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The clinical trial 12-C-0047 (NCT01495598) was an open-label, single-center, single-arm clinical study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pomalyst in patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS). A total of 28 patients (18 HIV-positive, 10 HIV-negative) received Pomalyst 5 mg orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All HIV-positive patients continued highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The trial excluded patients with symptomatic pulmonary or visceral KS, history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, or procoagulant disorders. Patients received thromboprophylaxis with aspirin 81 mg once daily throughout therapy.

The median age was 52.5 years; all were male, 75% were White, and 14% Black or African American. Seventy-five percent of patients had advanced disease (T1) at the time of enrollment, 11% had ≥ 50 lesions, and 75% had received prior chemotherapy.

The major efficacy outcome measure was the overall response rate (ORR), which included complete response (CR), clinical complete response (cCR), and partial response (PR). Response was assessed by the investigator according to the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee response criteria for KS. The median time to first response was 1.8 months (0.9 to 7.6). Efficacy results are presented in Table 11.

### Kaposi sarcoma of childhood: Inborn or acquired immunodeficiency to oncogenic HHV-8 [^113zNi4E]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the rarity of pediatric Kaposi sarcoma (KS), there is a paucity of literature on treatment and outcome stratification, with most treatment options extracted from literature on adults treated for KS. At the time of writing, there are no established consensus group therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of all four forms — epidemic, endemic, iatrogenic, and classic — of pediatric KS. Antiviral therapy, such as ganciclovir and valganciclovir, can be considered for the prevention of primary HHV‐8 infection and subsequent KS development. Systemic chemotherapy, including liposomal doxorubicin, liposomal daunorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, etoposide, and bleomycin, is utilized in cases of pediatric KS with systemic disease. Intralesional chemotherapy, such as vinblastine and topical retinoic acid, is utilized in cases of localized disease.

As in adults, the control of HIV and the adjustment or reduction of immunosuppression is key to managing epidemic and iatrogenic forms. In cases of epidemic KS, a Cochrane review concluded that chemotherapy combined with HAART is more likely associated with KS remission compared to HAART alone, although data are sparse. Children with endemic (African) KS who are HIV-negative, often in resource-limited settings, have better outcomes than those with HIV undergoing the same chemotherapeutic regimens. Limited cases of pediatric iatrogenic (liver transplant) KS have shown a promising response to the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and paclitaxel chemotherapy.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^112VL6ed]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to increased membrane permeability caused by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene, not due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: *Trichophyton mentagrophytes* and *Trichophyton rubrum*.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory MICs against most strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: *Candida albicans*, *Epidermophyton floccosum*, and *Scopulariopsis brevicaulis*.

### Nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma: A recently proposed category [^1162WbeV]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an indolent angioproliferative tumor thought to be dependent on viral replication, immune modulation, and inflammatory cytokines produced by infected endothelial and immune cells. Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is thought to cause KS and is documented in more than 95% of patients with KS. The skin is the most common site of presentation, although visceral disease, most commonly affecting the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, may also occur. KS typically manifests as violaceous, dark brown, or black macules, papules, and nodules on the lower extremities that are prone to bleeding and ulceration. It has a slow-growing course in immunocompetent individuals. We present the unusual case of an HIV-negative yet high-risk man in whom cutaneous KS lesions developed on the face that exhibited a complete response to topical imiquimod and tretinoin. Our patient represents an additional case of the rare, underrecognized category known as nonepidemic KS.

### Incidence and mortality of non-AIDS-defining cancers among people living with HIV: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jTBC2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

It is well-established that people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a high risk of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer. With the massive introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) worldwide, there has been a rise in incident non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) among PLHIV in both developed and developing countries, and this trend is projected to persist in the future. With potent antiretroviral drugs, PLHIV are living longer, and age-related diseases, including different types of NADCs, are becoming increasingly important health issues in this population. Meanwhile, NADCs are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality among PLHIV worldwide. For example, a study conducted in the US reported that, during 2001 to 2015, 9.2% of deaths in PLHIV were attributable to NADCs, in comparison with 5.0% of deaths attributable to AIDS-defining cancers. During the same time period, the population-attributable fractions of mortality for NADCs rose from 7.2% to 11.8%. Similar findings were also reported by cohort studies from Turkey and China.

The first meta-analysis on this topic was published in 2007 and was based on seven studies. The latest updated meta-analysis, published in 2009, additionally included six studies. Both reviews reported an elevated incidence for the majority of types of NADCs among PLHIV compared with the general population, especially for cancers related to infection and smoking.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, specifically with respect to management of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering a biopsy of lesions in progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease, as they may be areas of post-inflammatory pigment and/or mimickers of Kaposi sarcoma. If Kaposi sarcoma is confirmed, evaluate for inadequate HIV control as a contributing factor to inadequate Kaposi sarcoma control, and address a possible change in antiretroviral therapy in conjunction with an HIV specialist.

### Panretin [^115uF4nn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Panretin® gel is not a systemic therapy; it cannot treat visceral Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) nor prevent the development of new KS lesions where it has not been applied. Visceral KS disease was not monitored in these trials, and the appearance of new KS lesions was not considered part of the response assessment in clinical trials.

Panretin® gel was evaluated in two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the patients' cutaneous KS tumor response rate through 12 weeks of study drug treatment. This was assessed by evaluating from 3 to 8 KS index lesions according to the modified AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) response criteria as applied to topical therapy. Evaluation focused on height and area reductions of the index lesions only; progressive disease in non-index lesions and new lesions was not considered progressive disease. Progressive disease was scored only in the treated index lesions.

- **Global evaluation**: A global evaluation by physicians was also carried out, considering all of the patient's treated lesions (index and other) compared to baseline. Patients with at least a 50% improvement in the KS lesions were considered responders. Photographs of lesions in patients considered responders by the modified ACTG criteria were examined by the FDA for a cosmetically beneficial response, defined as at least a 50% improvement in appearance compared to baseline, taking into account both the KS lesions and overall appearance.

### Insights into the molecular biology and sero-epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma [^111VGoJf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in established market economies has fallen since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it remains the most common tumor in individuals with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, and its role in the subversion of cellular machinery provides an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in immunobiology and carcinogenesis. This review focuses on articles published from August 2001 to August 2002 that provide advances in our knowledge of this process and reviews new data concerning the transmission and identification of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in different populations.

- **Recent findings**: We have an improved understanding of the epidemiologies of classic, endemic, post-transplant, and AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The role of specific genes in tumorigenesis has been further defined, with particular reference to the switch from latent to lytic infection and the involvement of cytokines and angiogenic factors.

- **Summary**: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is widespread in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The study of Kaposi's sarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus represents an important model of the interplay between the immune system and cancer, which may lead to the development of clinically useful therapies, including vaccines.

### Classic Kaposi's sarcoma treated with topical rapamycin [^114gAmCk]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disorder caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Research efforts have focused on studying the relative role of KSHV-encoded genes in Kaposi's sarcomagenesis to identify novel mechanism-based therapies for patients suffering from this tumor. Although several viral genes have potential for KS pathogenesis, compelling data point to the KSHV-encoded G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) as a leading candidate viral gene for the initiation of KS. Interestingly, the oncogenic potential of vGPCR seems to correlate with its capacity to activate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, the prototypical inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathway, has recently emerged as an effective treatment for KS when administered orally. In this case report, we present an immunocompetent patient with KS lesions treated with topical rapamycin, achieving clinical and histologic healing after 16 weeks of treatment. The topical application of rapamycin could be a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of KS.

### Treatment of severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-infected adults [^111s54ET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second most common cancer in HIV-infected patients worldwide. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decline in its incidence. However, Kaposi's sarcoma continues to be diagnosed in HIV-infected patients.

- **Objectives**: To assess the added advantage of chemotherapy plus HAART compared to HAART alone; and the advantages of different chemotherapy regimens in HAART and HAART-naive HIV-infected adults with severe or progressive Kaposi's sarcoma.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, GATEWAY, the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the US National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials and the Aegis archive of HIV/AIDS for conference abstracts. An updated search was conducted in July 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials and observational studies evaluating the effects of any chemotherapeutic regimen in combination with HAART compared to HAART alone, chemotherapy versus HAART, and comparisons between different chemotherapy regimens.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed the studies independently and extracted outcome data. We used the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) as the measure of effect. We did not conduct a meta-analysis as none of the included trials assessed identical chemotherapy regimens.

- **Main results**: We included six randomized trials and three observational studies involving 792 HIV-infected participants.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^112Z2jsA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The symptoms and lesions of iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are similar to those of epidemic KS and often manifest as extensive cutaneous lesions, with frequent lymph node and systemic involvement. Similar to epidemic KS, spontaneous remission after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy is expected, but indolent lesions may persist.

In cases of severe involvement, immunocompromised patients may develop Kaposi sarcoma inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). KICS was initially described in people with HIV (PWH) and, secondarily, in patients with solid organ transplantation. Conversely, it seems to be exceptional in immunocompetent patients, such as those with classical or endemic KS. As KICS was initially described as an "MCD-like syndrome", the clinical features are close to those of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), and diagnosing KICS requires the exclusion of other conditions.

### An unusual series of patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^111YVHXt]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) secondary to treatment-induced immunosuppression typically presents similarly to classical KS. It is quite rare in the West, with an incidence of less than 1% overall but up to 4% in Eastern European countries. The risk of iatrogenic KS correlates with the length of time on immunosuppressive therapy, with a mean onset of lesions at 16 months. Iatrogenic KS will generally resolve completely upon cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, but the benefits of discontinuing therapy must be balanced against risks such as transplant rejection.

AIDS-related epidemic KS affects HIV patients with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 500 cells/mm³. The lesions of epidemic KS can be disfiguringly found on the face and often involve the visceral organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, bones, and lungs. Because of increased visceral involvement with epidemic KS, its prognosis is poor. However, the incidence and severity of epidemic KS have dramatically decreased from a standardized incidence ratio of 22,100 to 3,640 compared with the general population after the advent of antiretroviral therapy.

Non-epidemic KS is a rare, recently identified subtype of KS found in HIV-negative men who engage in sex with other men. This subtype has been hypothesized to be related to the high prevalence of HHV-8 in semen and prostate samples.

Our patients do not clearly fit into any of the existing subtypes of KS. None have HIV, are on immunosuppressive drugs, are from Africa, nor engage in high-risk sexual behavior. They share no risk factors outside the general population.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, particularly in relation to the management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Recognize clinical manifestations**: These may include the development of new lesions, enlargement of existing lesions, worsening lymphadenopathy, or worsening edema. Recognizing these manifestations is crucial as the clinical presentation of IRIS can be challenging to distinguish from the natural progression of the disease.

- **Consultation with a specialist**: If IRIS is suspected, it is advised to consult with an HIV specialist.

### Radiotherapy in the management of classic Kaposi's sarcoma: A single institution experience from Northeast Turkey [^11763DJo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare adult neoplasm, and there has been no certain consensus on standard treatment, whether local or systemic. Radiotherapy is an effective and suitable treatment modality. Between 1996 and 2016, patients diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and referred to our clinic for radiotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Ninety-two patients were examined in total, all diagnosed with non-HIV associated Kaposi's sarcoma. There were 36 (39%) females and 56 (61%) males, with a female to male ratio of 2/3. The median age at presentation was 72 years (range 30–93).

The treatment involved:

- **Radiotherapy dosages**: Sixty-eight patients (77%) were treated with 8 Gy (1 fraction), 15 patients (16%) with 20 Gy (2 Gy/fraction), four patients (4%) with 25 Gy (2.5 Gy/fraction), and five patients (6%) with 30 Gy (3 Gy/fraction).

The median follow-up time was 72 months (range 5–192). The complete response at 5 years was 91.6% with doses greater than 20 Gy and 89.6% with an 8 Gy dose. Radiotherapy remains an effective and suitable treatment modality for Classic Kaposi sarcoma, and it is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects.

### Management of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma [^112r36Th]. The Lancet Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a substantial reduction in the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality associated with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Similarly, concomitant advances in chemotherapy and supportive care protocols have allowed for Kaposi's sarcoma to be managed more effectively compared to the pre-HAART era. Furthermore, developments in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma have identified several molecular targets that can potentially provide new therapeutic strategies. This review discusses the role of conventional chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and summarizes the status and future prospects of novel molecularly targeted agents in the treatment of this disease.

### Clinical outcome features of non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma and the role of wide excision on survival: A retrospective cohort study [^111DuVtf]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Skin lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma typically manifest as painless macules with a purple hue. Non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma is primarily associated with HHV8 infection, particularly in individuals with immunocompromised status. Apart from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–associated Kaposi's sarcoma, other types include classical (sporadic), endemic (African), and iatrogenic (immunosuppression-related) types, which are relatively uncommon in clinical practice.

Regarding treatment protocols outlined in the literature, therapies for HIV-positive cases adhere to standard rules and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Treatment approaches for Kaposi's sarcoma vary based on lesion classification. For asymptomatic limited cutaneous lesions, observation along with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended initially, whereas symptomatic limited cutaneous lesions may require ART combined with topicals, systemic therapy, intralesional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or local excision. Advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal lesions may necessitate ART along with radiotherapy, systemic therapy, or participation in clinical trials. However, no standardized treatment protocol has been established for non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma.

In general, elective surgery becomes an option when localized skin lesions become problematic and surgical intervention is feasible. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the outcomes in patients with non-HIV Kaposi's sarcoma treated surgically to identify meaningful disparities in surgery-related treatment outcomes.

	- When prescribing EMFLAZA Oral Suspension, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources, including EMFLAZA Oral Suspension and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL, while EMFLAZA Tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. At the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day of EMFLAZA Oral Suspension, patients would receive approximately 0.4 mg/kg/day of benzyl alcohol.

- **Thromboembolic events**:
	- Observational studies have shown an increased risk of thromboembolism, including venous thromboembolism, particularly with higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids. It is unclear if the risk differs by daily dose or duration of therapy.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^113LWseq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a malignancy associated with Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV), primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or those receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Immunocompetent individuals may also be affected, illustrating the disease's heterogeneity. KS manifests in different forms — classic, endemic, epidemic, iatrogenic, and in men having sex with men — each with distinct clinical features depending on immune status and geographic area of origin.

Although advances in treatment have improved disease control, effective management remains a challenge. This review focuses on the comprehensive approach to investigating and treating KS. It highlights the role of histology, immunohistochemistry, and staging in diagnosing KS and assessing disease extension, together with other KSHV diseases (multicentric Castelman disease, primary effusion lymphoma, and KS inflammatory cytokine syndrome).

Treatment strategies are discussed, with emphasis on restoring immunity in immunocompromised patients. Conventional local therapies and chemotherapy options like liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel are outlined for aggressive and extensive forms. Promising emerging therapies, including immunomodulatory agents, antiangiogenic therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors, are also explored.

The review emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment based on the patient's underlying condition and KS subtype. It provides an in‐depth look at the pathogenesis, diagnostic methods, and evolving therapeutic approaches, offering valuable insights into the management of KS.

### Topical beta-blockers in dermatologic therapy [^114ApkWC]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an unusual vascular tumor, probably of lymphatic lineage, exhibiting aberrant endothelial and mesenchymal differentiation. At the time of writing, an effective, low-risk treatment for KS has not been found. Topical treatment would be ideal for patients with disease confined to the skin, as it may slow disease progression for several years and pose lower risks of systemic side effects. In fact, some topical agents have been used, including retinoids, imiquimod, rapamycin, and recently timolol maleate solution, with varying results.

Molecular studies have shown that KS lesions are dependent on beta-adrenergic signaling for the reactivation of human herpesvirus-8, which could explain why beta-blockers can reduce KS proliferation by suppressing cAMP and protein kinase A signaling pathways.

At the time of writing, 12 patients with KS treated with topical timolol have been described in the literature. All the patients (except one) responded rapidly to treatment over a period of 5 to 24 weeks. Different timing responses can possibly be related to lesion size.

Of the patients who experienced complete resolution, disease recurrence monitoring was not reported for 4 patients, while no recurrence was reported in the remaining patients at a mean follow-up of 12.3 months. There were no differences in response rate between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.

Most patients have been treated with 0.5% topical timolol, but recently, it has been reported that lower concentrations (0.1% instead of 0.5%) might also be efficacious. The main advantages of…

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following subsequent systemic therapy options for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease in certain circumstances:

- **Albumin-bound paclitaxel**: Administer 100 mg IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle (if paclitaxel intolerant).

- **Etoposide**: Administer 50 mg/day PO for 7 days of each 14-day cycle. After 2 cycles, escalate the dose to 100 mg/day PO for 7 days of each 14-day cycle in patients without partial or complete response and no toxicity greater than Grade 2. The dose can be further escalated to 150 mg/day based on tolerance and response.

- **Imatinib**: Administer 400 mg/day PO.

- **Nivolumab plus ipilimumab**: Administer nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks.

- **Nivolumab alone**: Administer 480 mg IV every 4 weeks.

- **Pembrolizumab**: Administer 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 6 months.

- **Sirolimus (for transplant-associated Kaposi sarcoma)**: Provide a loading dose of 0.15 mg/kg PO followed by 0.04–0.06 mg/kg/day to maintain trough blood levels of 6–10 ng/mL or 2 mg PO daily (adjust to maintain trough levels of 6–10 ng/mL).

- **Thalidomide (for patients with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome)**: Administer 200 mg/day PO (starting dose, titrated to effect and tolerability).

### Exploring the interplay between Kaposi's sarcoma and SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case series and systematic review [^113T7ipu]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angio-proliferative disease with a viral etiology and multifactorial pathogenesis resulting from immune dysfunction. In patients affected by latent viral infections such as herpesviruses, SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to lytic cycle reactivation in host cells. A robust immune system response is crucial for eliminating pathogens and resolving both latent and non-latent viral infections. We report a case series of KS characterized by tumor progression after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We conducted a systematic literature review using the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The keyword terms included "SARS-CoV-2", "HHV-8", "Kaposi's sarcoma", "IL-6", and "COVID-19". An English language restriction was applied, and items not covered by our study were excluded. KS is a complex disease linked to an impaired immune system, and conditions causing temporary or permanent immunodeficiency can trigger viral reactivation or exacerbate an existing disease.

It is feasible that the increase in cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients, coupled with lymphocyte downregulation and treatment that induces herpesvirus lytic reactivation, may contribute to the progression of KS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These observations suggest that patients with KS should be clinically monitored both during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, prospective data should be collected to validate this hypothesis and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the onset or progression of KS.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^11455HXq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The extent of lesions and the severity of the disease are mainly related to the clinical settings of KS and the severity of immunodeficiency. In immunocompetent patients with classic KS, lesions are mostly localized on the lower limbs and present as macules, papules, and often as nodules that may ulcerate. Local aggressiveness can occur, but symptomatic systemic extension is uncommon. Endemic KS often occurs with the same presentation. Nonetheless, it seems to differ from classic KS with more local aggressiveness and more ulcerated nodules. Notably, endemic KS had historically been described in four clinically distinct patterns: benign nodular cutaneous disease, aggressive localized cutaneous disease, florid mucocutaneous and visceral disease, and fulminant lymphadenopathic disease. However, this classification is almost exclusively based on reports published before the 1980s and is likely to be, at least in part, related to misdiagnosis of the HIV‐related form in patients from endemic areas before systematic HIV detection.

In immunodeficiency‐associated KS, the course of the disease may be chronic or rapidly progressive, depending on the alteration of the immune system. KS lesions are more likely to be extensive, associated with painful skin tumors, local skin and mucosal invasion, and systemic involvement. In epidemic KS, cutaneous lesions commonly present as multifocal and symmetric macules that may develop rapidly and evolve to papules and tumors in uncontrolled HIV infection.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^111CSb5S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, where nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established, and the clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

Fourteen HIV-infected patients with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) received Irinotecan at a dosage of 150 mg/m administered intravenously on days 1 and 10. All patients had relapsed or progressed during highly active antiretroviral therapy, which was administered as primary antineoplastic therapy. An objective response, characterized by partial remissions, occurred in 75% of patients. Irinotecan was well tolerated, with severe leukopenia occurring in only 33% of patients. In HIV-infected patients with advanced KS, irinotecan demonstrates activity and is well tolerated.

### Terbinafine [^113GhdeJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene, rather than due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum.

- **In vitro data**: The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:
	- Candida albicans
	- Epidermophyton floccosum

### Kaposi sarcoma of the larynx: A systematic review [^1128M46r]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) of the larynx is a rare disease with few cases reported in the literature. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of laryngeal KS, including patient characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library.

- **Review methods**: A systematic review of the published English literature was conducted. An electronic search and bibliographic examination of articles pertaining to laryngeal KS were performed. Demographic data, tumor site, treatment strategies, follow-up, and outcome were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 77 cases from 50 articles were included in the review. The mean age was 47.6 years (range, 8–81). There was an 8.6:1 male-to-female ratio. The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea (n = 35) and hoarseness (n = 25). Laryngeal KS arose most frequently in the supraglottic region (n = 16). Chemotherapy alone (n = 27) was the most common treatment modality in patients with AIDS-associated KS, and surgical excision alone (n = 7) was most common in patients with other subtypes of KS (e.g. classic, transplant-associated). The average follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 0.75–120). Most patients with AIDS-associated KS died of other causes (n = 25), but most patients with other subtypes of KS were alive with no evidence of disease at follow-up (n = 13).

- **Conclusion**: This review contains the largest pool of laryngeal KS cases at the time of writing. Long-term outcomes were generally unfavorable, often due to advanced HIV disease at the time of diagnosis.

### Modern approach to manage patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^115C6gXN]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Liposomal doxorubicin is considered to be the first-line chemotherapy for advanced Kaposi sarcoma (KS). In the 1990s, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in HIV-related KS demonstrated its superiority over conventional cytotoxic therapies such as bleomycin and vincristine. In epidemic KS, RCTs have shown response rates ranging from 46% to 58%.

Paclitaxel is another chemotherapy that demonstrated efficacy in RCTs conducted in persons with HIV (PWH), with overall response rates ranging from 56% to 71%, either in first-line or second-line treatment after liposomal doxorubicin. In a recent RCT in 2020, paclitaxel was more effective than etoposide monotherapy and the bleomycin and vincristine combination in PWH.

Nonetheless, RCTs comparing systemic treatments in patients with KS are lacking. Moreover, most of the trials evaluating the efficacy of systemic therapies were conducted before the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. In PWH, only one head-to-head RCT compared liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel, reporting similar efficacy with better tolerability for liposomal doxorubicin. Therefore, due to this better tolerance, liposomal doxorubicin is often the first choice in resource-rich settings. Conversely, in resource-limited countries, paclitaxel is often preferred due to its better efficacy compared to other conventional chemotherapies.

After initial treatment and despite initial response, recurrence and subsequently, retreatment is common. In cases of initial effectiveness, the same treatment regimen can be continued.

### Kaposi's sarcoma: Etiology and pathogenesis, inducing factors, causal associations, and treatments: Facts and controversies [^117F5zWW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an angioproliferative disorder, has a viral etiology and a multifactorial pathogenesis rooted in immune dysfunction. The disease is multifocal, exhibiting a course that ranges from indolent skin manifestations to a fulminant stage with extensive visceral involvement. In this view, all forms of KS share a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, with variations resulting from the involvement of various cofactors. HHV-8 infection is considered necessary but not sufficient for KS development, as additional factors — genetic, immunologic, and environmental — are required. The role of cofactors is linked to their interaction with HHV-8, their effects on the immune system, or their action as vasoactive agents.

A comprehensive survey of the state of knowledge on the multiple factors involved in KS pathogenesis is provided, particularly highlighting the facts and controversies surrounding the role of certain drugs, such as quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in the onset of the disease. Based on these assessments, it is hypothesized that the role of cofactors in KS pathogenesis may either favor or inhibit disease onset, depending on the presence of other agents modulating pathogenesis, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient's genetic background.

### PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab in classic or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma: a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study [^117AUyWa]. The Lancet Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Although the treatment of iatrogenic and HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma is well defined and mostly based on restoring immune function, the treatment of classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma is less well established. Chemotherapy or interferon α is used for patients with extensive cutaneous or visceral Kaposi sarcoma, but tolerance might be poor and long-term remission is rare. We aimed to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma with cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, single-arm, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial in adults aged 18 years or older with histologically proven classic or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma with progressive cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1 in three hospitals in France. The patients were treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 months (eight cycles) or until severe toxicity. The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate within the 6-month timeframe, defined by the occurrence of a complete response or partial response and assessed by an investigator using the modified AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria. Three or more responses among a total of 17 patients were needed for the primary endpoint to be met, using a Simon's two-stage optimal design assuming a 30% response rate as desirable. For this final study analysis, all patients were included following the intention-to-treat principle.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112uSf7H]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplant, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor); clinical benefits have been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.

- **Case presentation**: Here we report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living, non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of KS, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.

- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians to the potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### Kaposi's sarcoma in the pediatric population: The critical need for a tissue diagnosis [^114qB3hM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade vascular neoplasm mediated by the human herpesvirus-8. Only one clinical subtype, the endemic/African subtype, commonly affects the pediatric population. Although adults with KS often present with cutaneous findings and generalized lymphadenopathy, African children are more likely to present without classic skin findings. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination from tissue biopsy; however, as pathology resources are scarce in many developing African countries where KS is prominent, appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the condition are challenging. We report the case of a Malawian child who presented with generalized lymphadenopathy and was presumptively treated for lymphoma, with clinical worsening of his lesions. A diagnosis of KS was made after excisional biopsy of a superficial lymph node, with the initiation of appropriate therapy. The literature regarding pediatric KS is reviewed, and recommendations are offered to allow accurate and timely diagnosis of the condition.

The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of terbinafine tablets. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Blood and lymphatic system disorders**: Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.8)].

- **Immune system disorders**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], and serum sickness-like reactions.

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Anxiety and depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Nervous system disorders**: Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Cases of paresthesia have also been reported.
