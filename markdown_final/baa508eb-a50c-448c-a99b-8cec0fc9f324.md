## Question

What is the workup for dizziness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step workup for dizziness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical framework and how to classify presentations. Then, I should verify the immediate safety screen for red flags and non-vestibular causes. Next, I will apply the timing-and-triggers categorization and outline the syndrome-specific diagnostic approach, including when and how to use HINTS, Dix-Hallpike, and gait testing. After that, I need to check imaging indications and timing, including the limits of CT and early MRI. Then, I will consider adjunct testing such as audiometry and vascular imaging in specific syndromes. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, education, and documentation needs, and synthesize key takeaways to close the loop.

> Let me first confirm the overarching clinical framework. Modern evidence-based evaluation shifts away from relying on the quality or "type" of dizziness (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, lightheadedness) and instead prioritizes timing, triggers, and a targeted bedside exam because patients are more consistent in reporting timing and triggers and this better separates benign peripheral from dangerous central causes, including stroke [^112pM8ME] [^114G7oBs]. I should double-check that the ED population is best organized into acute vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, and triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, as these categories map to different differentials and test strategies, which is exactly how GRACE-3 structures its recommendations [^111dAkAH].

> Wait, let me verify the initial safety screen before getting into vestibular algorithms. I need to check immediately for obvious neurologic deficits or signs of a stroke syndrome; if present, I should activate the stroke protocol rather than apply vestibular-specific algorithms, because time-sensitive reperfusion or anticoagulation decisions supersede a vestibular workup [^111CMnfb]. I should also consider non-vestibular medical causes such as arrhythmia, hypovolemia, anemia, or metabolic derangements when suggested by history and vitals, since these account for roughly half of acutely dizzy patients and are prioritized early in the flowchart [^1174MQ9F] [^111YsUis].

> Next, I will apply the timing-and-triggers categorization. I need to ensure I ask: is the dizziness continuous for days, transient with position changes, or spontaneous in recurrent attacks, because this triages me into AVS, t-EVS, or s-EVS, respectively, and each category carries a distinct diagnostic pathway and test set, which GRACE-3 explicitly operationalizes for ED practice [^112pM8ME] [^111dAkAH]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not substituting the old symptom-quality paradigm here; GRACE-3 and the Barany-aligned approach specifically endorse the timing-and-triggers method over symptom "type" given its superior reliability and clinical utility in separating central from peripheral etiologies [^114G7oBs].

> For acute vestibular syndrome, I will now examine the role of bedside neuro-otologic testing. If nystagmus is present, HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) performed by a trained clinician is highly accurate for distinguishing stroke from vestibular neuritis; I should confirm that GRACE-3 recommends routine use of HINTS in AVS with nystagmus and to add bedside hearing testing (finger rub) to improve sensitivity, since new unilateral hearing loss increases the likelihood of a central process [^114ybb7W] [^116espsU]. Hold on, I should verify performance: meta-analytic data show MRI in the first 48–72 hours misses 10–22% of posterior circulation strokes, whereas expert-performed HINTS can identify more than 99% of strokes, reinforcing the primacy of a high-quality bedside exam before imaging when available [^114kd5pa] [^111oCwc9]. But wait, what if there is no nystagmus in AVS; in that case, gait unsteadiness severity helps distinguish central from peripheral causes, so I should not anchor on a single sign and must integrate the full oculomotor and balance exam with HINTS when appropriate [^116LsDdZ] [^111WGnuB].

> Now, I should review imaging decisions in AVS. I need to ensure I do not overuse CT: noncontrast CT has very low sensitivity for acute ischemic stroke in this population and a normal CT does not safely exclude posterior circulation infarction, so routine CT to "rule out stroke" is discouraged; instead, MRI with DWI and MRA is preferred when HINTS is central or equivocal or when a trained examiner is unavailable, acknowledging early MRI can miss small posterior fossa strokes and may require repeat if suspicion remains high [^1158bJLk] [^117F9rXr] [^113FoZLm]. Let me reconsider timing: early MRI within 48 hours can miss 10–22% of strokes, so a negative early MRI does not close the door on cerebrovascular disease if clinical concern persists, and delayed MRI or observation may be warranted [^114kd5pa] [^113FoZLm].

> For spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, I should confirm that the ED priority is focused history and exam to separate vestibular migraine from TIA. Routine CT is not helpful and should be avoided; if TIA is suspected based on vascular risk profile or attack characteristics, then CTA or MRA of the head and neck is reasonable to evaluate posterior circulation vasculature, whereas low-risk patients can be referred for outpatient management and follow-up without emergent imaging [^114iBH3k] [^113C67Qu] [^117QvY3a]. Hold on, I should verify the bedside elements emphasized for s-EVS: careful attention to cranial nerves, visual fields, eye movements, limb coordination, and gait between attacks can reveal central signs that would pivot me toward TIA workup and vascular imaging rather than a peripheral diagnosis [^116y9XcM] [^111yHb5Q].

> For triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, I will now examine positional testing. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the first-line test for posterior canal BPPV, and if horizontal canal involvement is suspected with direction-changing nystagmus, the supine roll test should be performed; I should confirm that GRACE-3 and AAO-HNS recommend against routine imaging when classic positional nystagmus is present and treatment response is adequate, reserving MRI for atypical nystagmus or failure of repositioning maneuvers [^1174mT58] [^114FPKMQ] [^113ScrMk] [^114geH6H]. Let me verify that repeating maneuvers is reasonable; multiple Epley or alternative canal-specific repositioning attempts are appropriate, and persistent symptoms warrant reassessment for incomplete BPPV or an alternative diagnosis, rather than reflexive imaging in typical cases [^116zotJz] [^1157sNni].

> Next, I should review adjunct and targeted testing. Audiometry is indicated when evaluating suspected Ménière's disease to document low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and to distinguish it from vestibular migraine; I need to ensure I also screen for migraine features because vestibular migraine commonly mimics Ménière's and changes management and counseling [^116Fww8E] [^114iWsxt] [^116Ybrdv]. For patients with episodic vertigo and hearing symptoms or suspected perilymphatic fistula, temporal bone CT or MRI of the head and internal auditory canals can be appropriate, whereas routine vestibular testing or ECOG is not recommended to diagnose Ménière's disease in the absence of atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty [^1153TFmo] [^114pKvyv] [^115mFM4w]. But wait, I should verify that persistent vertigo with or without neurologic symptoms merits brain and internal auditory canal MRI to evaluate for central causes and structural lesions of the posterior fossa and CPA, which the ACR supports in selected contexts [^115VcHnj].

> I need to ensure follow-up, safety, and education are addressed. Patients diagnosed with BPPV should be counseled on recurrence risk, home safety, and the importance of follow-up; reassessment within about a month is advised to document resolution or uncover alternative diagnoses if symptoms persist, and patients should be taught canalith repositioning maneuvers when feasible [^115AWuWF] [^111Ar3eC]. For suspected or confirmed vestibular migraine or Ménière's disease, referral to neurology or otolaryngology is appropriate; for high-risk s-EVS patients, vascular risk stratification and expedited TIA follow-up should be arranged even if initial ED imaging is unrevealing, given the narrow window for secondary prevention [^1129khQA] [^117QvY3a].

> Finally, I should synthesize key principles to avoid common errors. I must not base the differential on symptom quality alone; timing and triggers plus a targeted exam are more reliable, and I should avoid applying HINTS to patients without ongoing dizziness and nystagmus or misinterpreting corrective saccades as stroke signs when the overall pattern is peripheral [^114G7oBs] [^113pKEZs]. I should remember that a normal noncontrast CT does not exclude ischemic stroke in acute dizziness and that overuse of CT adds little diagnostic yield while increasing cost and radiation; instead, prioritize expert bedside testing and appropriate MRI when indicated, and consider the economic and safety benefits of bedside video-oculography where available [^113FoZLm] [^112dHkNo] [^115gCqzt]. Let me double-check that these takeaways align with GRACE-3's strongest recommendations and with the evidence on MRI sensitivity over time; they do, reinforcing the need for disciplined, syndrome-based care rather than reflexive imaging or legacy symptom-taxonomy approaches [^111WGnuB] [^114kd5pa].

The workup for dizziness centers on **history, exam, and targeted testing** [^1132xzrG], using the **TiTrATE** framework (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Exam) [^114Jobje] to distinguish peripheral from central causes and guide imaging or labs only when indicated [^112WUPD1]. Most cases are benign and can be diagnosed at the bedside; **reserve MRI for central signs or persistent symptoms** [^1149WYQX] [^117F9rXr] [^115VcHnj], and use CT only when hemorrhage is suspected or MRI is unavailable [^notfound].

---

## Key elements of history (TiTrATE)

- **Timing**: onset, duration, frequency, and time course (seconds, minutes, hours, days) [^1127fetA].
- **Triggers**: positional changes, head movements, trauma, anxiety, medications, or none [^113wqDst].
- **Associated symptoms**: nausea/vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, neurologic deficits, headache, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, anxiety [^115VBww4] [^114sJ54x].
- **Risk factors**: hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, migraine, recent infection, trauma, alcohol use [^notfound].

---

## Essential physical examination

- **Vital signs**: orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements [^112cy6SF].
- **Neurologic exam**: cranial nerves, visual fields, eye movements, limb coordination, gait assessment [^112d3ESn].
- **Oculomotor exam**: nystagmus (spontaneous, gaze-evoked, positional), head impulse test, test of skew (HINTS) [^114ybb7W] [^1149WYQX].
- **Positional testing**: Dix-Hallpike maneuver for BPPV [^114FPKMQ], supine roll test for horizontal canal BPPV [^113ScrMk].
- **Otologic exam**: otoscopy for otitis media, effusion, perforation [^notfound].

---

## Bedside tests and maneuvers

| **Test/maneuver** | **Indication** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Dix-Hallpike | Triggered vertigo | Torsional upbeating nystagmus = posterior canal BPPV [^114FPKMQ] |
| Supine roll test | Triggered vertigo | Direction-changing horizontal nystagmus = horizontal canal BPPV [^112niJrp] |
| Head impulse test | Acute vestibular syndrome | Corrective saccades = peripheral vestibulopathy [^notfound] |
| Test of skew | Acute vestibular syndrome | Vertical misalignment = central lesion [^notfound] |
| Romberg test | Balance assessment | Falls with eyes closed = vestibular or proprioceptive deficit [^112cy6SF] |

---

## Indications for neuroimaging

MRI is indicated for **central signs**, persistent vertigo, or concern for stroke [^115VcHnj] [^117F9rXr]; CT is indicated for suspected hemorrhage or when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^114DCpcC]. Avoid routine imaging in **typical BPPV or vestibular neuritis** [^114QbsN3] [^1158bJLk].

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory testing is **not routinely required**; order CBC, electrolytes, glucose, thyroid function, or toxicology only when clinically indicated by history or exam [^1132xzrG].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Peripheral causes**: BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, perilymphatic fistula, superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^113teZZ9].
- **Central causes**: stroke (posterior circulation), TIA, multiple sclerosis, tumor, vestibular migraine, psychogenic dizziness [^111WGnuB].
- **Non-vestibular causes**: orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias, medication side effects, anxiety, hyperventilation, metabolic disturbances [^112cy6SF].

---

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Common pitfalls include **relying on symptom quality** (vertigo vs dizziness) rather than timing and triggers [^114G7oBs]; misusing HINTS in patients without ongoing dizziness and nystagmus; and assuming a normal CT excludes stroke — especially in posterior circulation events [^113pKEZs] [^113FoZLm]. Avoiding these requires adhering to TiTrATE, applying HINTS only in AVS with nystagmus, and using MRI when central causes are suspected [^112pM8ME] [^114ybb7W] [^117F9rXr].

---

## Follow-up and management

Arrange **vestibular rehabilitation** for persistent dizziness or imbalance, and provide patient education on BPPV recurrence, safety, and when to seek care [^1132xzrG] [^115AWuWF]. Reassess within 1 month if symptoms persist or evolve [^111Ar3eC].

---

The workup for dizziness relies on a **structured history and exam** with selective testing; most cases are benign and diagnosed at the bedside, while imaging is reserved for central signs or persistent symptoms [^111WGnuB].

There are more than four million US ED visits annually for acute vertigo or dizziness at a yearly ED workup cost of over US$4 billion. The roughly one million who have underlying peripheral vestibular causes are generally over-tested, misdiagnosedand undertreated. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on brain imaging trying to 'rule out' dangerous central vestibular causes such as stroke, yet, despite that, one-third of vestibular strokes are missed initially. Misconceptionsdrive ED clinical practice, resulting in inappropriate use of diagnostic tests. Patients with inner ear conditions, such as vestibular neuritis (or labyrinthitis) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are often imaged and admitted unnecessarilyinstead of being diagnosed at the bedside, treated appropriately and discharged; error rates may exceed 80%. Patients with dangerous brainstem or cerebellar strokes (representing about 5% of all dizziness and vertigo presentations in the ED) may be sent home without critical stroke treatments, sometimes resulting in serious harm.

New bedside diagnostic methods to detect strokehave been developed, that are supported by strong evidence, and could be disseminated, but the logical follow-on policy question is, 'Would it be worth pursuing a radical shift in care to try to reduce misdiagnosis?' Decision modelling with economic analysis might help answer this question by comparing several hypothetical diagnostic strategies on patient-centred health outcomes of interest.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dizziness and ataxia: 2023 update [^112WUPD1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of a patient with dizziness or vertigo is complicated by a lack of standardized nomenclature, significant overlap in symptom descriptions, and the subjective nature of the patient's symptoms. Although dizziness is an imprecise term often used by patients to describe a feeling of being off-balance, in many cases dizziness can be subcategorized based on symptomatology as vertigo (false sense of motion or spinning), disequilibrium (imbalance with gait instability), presyncope (nearly fainting or blacking out), or lightheadedness (nonspecific). As such, current diagnostic paradigms focus on timing, triggers, and associated symptoms rather than subjective descriptions of dizziness type. Regardless, these factors complicate the selection of appropriate diagnostic imaging in patients presenting with dizziness or vertigo. This document serves to aid providers in this selection by using a framework of definable clinical variants. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

A significant number of individuals are affected by symptoms of dizziness. It is the most common complaint among patients over 75 years of age. A large number of these patients seek counsel from their physicians. It is imperative for the evaluating physician to obtain a thorough history and perform a complete physical exam. The proper diagnostic studies must also be obtained to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. The physician should never assume that the dizziness is the result of normal aging prior to ruling out pathologic conditions.

Diagnostic safety: diagnostic test use and diagnostic error

Eliminating all diagnostic errors is impossible, since diagnosis occurs under uncertainty. Efforts to reduce uncertainty toward zero result in increasing marginal costs with diminishing marginal returns for patient safety. Nevertheless, potential exists to improve diagnostic safety. In the ED dizziness/vertigo case, an estimated 35% of underlying strokes are missed, despite the fact that relatively simple, non-invasive, bedside physical examination tests have been shown repeatedly to identify more than 99% of strokes.

Estimates of diagnostic error-associated adverse events are 0.1% of primary care visitsand 0.4% of hospital admissions, but the diagnostic error rate is likely much higher, since harm does not invariably occur. Ballpark estimates place the overall diagnostic error rate in the range of 10–15%. Rates appear to vary by specialty (eg, 5% in radiology vs 12% in emergency medicine), by disease (eg, 2% of myocardial infarctions vs 9% of strokes), and especially by clinical presentation (eg, 4% of strokes presenting traditional symptoms vs 64% of strokes presenting non-traditional symptoms), with atypical and non-specific presentations (such as dizziness) increasing the risk of misdiagnosis dramatically.

Misdiagnoses, when they relate to test ordering (∼15% of misdiagnoses), generally result from underuse. For example, this appears to be the case for young patients presenting dizziness to the ED whose strokes may be missed, sometimes with devastating consequences. Test overuse, however, can also result in diagnostic error (eg, false positives) or overdiagnosis (ie, correct but unnecessary diagnoses). Overdiagnosis includes conditions deliberately being sought, but too mild to warrant treatment, and unrelated 'incidentalomas'that may beget further inappropriate testing or treatment. Tests may not be appropriate when the expected probability of disease is too low or too high for the test to resolve diagnostic uncertainty in a way that positively influences clinical decision making. Since overuse often occurs in patients with expected low disease prevalence, the risk of false positives is particularly high. Sometimes blind obedienceto false positive or false negative test results from advanced diagnostic technology can lead to error — this appears to be the case with CT for 'ruling out' stroke in acute dizziness.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

### Diagnostic accuracy of neuroimaging in emergency department patients with acute vertigo or dizziness: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department [^112dHkNo]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute vertigo or dizziness represent a diagnostic challenge. Neuroimaging has variable indications and yield. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy of neuroimaging for patients presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness.

Methods

An electronic search was designed following patient-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) question-(P) adult patients with acute vertigo or dizziness presenting to the ED; (I) neuroimaging including computed tomography (CT), CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and ultrasound (US); (C) MRI/clinical criterion standard; and (O) central causes (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, others) versus peripheral causes of symptoms. Articles were assessed in duplicate. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to assess certainty of evidence in pooled estimates.

Results

We included studies that reported diagnostic test accuracy. From 6309 titles, 460 articles were retrieved, and 12 were included: noncontrast CT scan-six studies, 771 patients, pooled sensitivity 28.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.4%-48.5%, moderate certainty) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 93.4%-99.8%, moderate certainty); MRI-five studies, 943 patients, sensitivity 79.8% (95% CI 71.4%-86.2%, high certainty) and specificity 98.8% (95% CI 96.2%-100%, high certainty); CTA-one study, 153 patients, sensitivity 14.3% (95% CI 1.8%-42.8%) and specificity 97.7% (95% CI 93.8%-99.6%), CT had higher sensitivity than CTA (21.4% and 14.3%) for central etiology; MRA-one study, 24 patients, sensitivity 60.0% (95% CI 26.2%-87.8%) and specificity 92.9% (95% CI 66.1%-99.8%); US-three studies, 258 patients, sensitivity ranged from 30% to 53.6%, specificity from 94.9% to 100%.

Conclusions

Noncontrast CT has very low sensitivity and MRI will miss approximately one in five patients with stroke if imaging is obtained early after symptom onset. The evidence does not support neuroimaging as the only tool for ruling out stroke and other central causes in patients with acute dizziness or vertigo presenting to the ED.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111WGnuB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This third Guideline for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-3) from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is on the topic adult patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department (ED). A multidisciplinary guideline panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding five questions for adult ED patients with acute dizziness of less than 2weeks' duration. The intended population is adults presenting to the ED with acute dizziness or vertigo. The panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on the timing and triggers of the dizziness but recognizes that alternative diagnostic approaches exist, such as the STANDING protocol and nystagmus examination in combination with gait unsteadiness or the presence of vascular risk factors. As an overarching recommendation, (1) emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). To help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with the AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus, (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus, (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus, (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT), (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available, and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In patients with the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome: (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In patients with the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In patients diagnosed with pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. It is clear that as of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, partly due to use in the wrong patients and partly due to issues with its interpretation. Most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS. As such, it is not standard of care, either in the legal sense of that term ("what the average physician would do in similar circumstances") or in the common parlance sense ("the standard action typically used by physicians in routine practice").

GRACE-3 — decision criteria and additional considerations — Consideration of local resources and economic realities may affect the pattern of follow-up, and although patients should be referred back to their primary care physician, referral to a specialist may be valuable for some patients when providers may not be aware of diagnoses such as vestibular migraine. Shared decision making can only be properly done when the important, patient-relevant information is shared with the patient, and clinicians should understand the lack of utility of CT scans in this setting.

### Imaging of dizziness [^116NJ9CR]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^113wqDst]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease executive summary [^115GLUpU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many, and approaches typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Risk of acute brain lesions in dizzy patients presenting to the emergency room: who needs imaging and who does not? [^11773G9b]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Patients presenting with dizziness, vertigo or imbalance to the ED should first be screened for a general medical cause as well as BPPV as a common and easily treatable disorder. Next, thorough history taking should include timing and triggers of dizziness symptoms and clinical examination should focus on central oculomotor signs and focal abnormalities indicating CNS involvement. Patients with any of the latter signs should undergo brain imaging, usually an early CT in the ED and a delayed MRI after admission. In the remaining patients, decision-making on the need, modality and timing of imaging studies can by guided by our proposed clinical pathway which integrates the empiric risk for ABLs into established clinical algorithms for dizzy patients. Using this practical approach could prevent many unnecessary brain imaging studies in dizzy patients without a central cause and assure imaging in those who require it.

### Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency room [^1149WYQX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on diagnostic algorithms for differential diagnosis of acute vertigo and dizziness and swift identification of potentially harmful causes.

Recent Findings

About 25% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness have a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, including stroke in 4–15%. Diagnostic work-up relies on the combination of symptom features (triggers, duration, history of vertigo/dizziness, accompanying symptoms) and a comprehensive vestibular, ocular motor, and balance exam. The latter includes head impulse, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, skew deviation, and Romberg's test. Recent standardized diagnostic algorithms (e.g. HINTS, TriAGe+) suggest the combination of several elements to achieve a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiation of central and peripheral vestibular causes. Neuroimaging with MRI must be applied and interpreted with caution, as small strokes are frequently overlooked, especially in the acute setting (false-negative rate of up to 50%).

Summary

Diagnostic differentiation of acute vertigo and dizziness remains a complex task, which can be tackled by a structured clinical assessment focusing on symptom characteristics and constellations of ocular motor and vestibular findings. Specific challenges arise in cases of transient or atypical vestibular syndromes.

Acute dizziness and vertigo are common emergency department presentations (≈4% of annual visits) and sometimes, a life-threatening diagnosis like stroke is missed. Recent literature reviews the challenges in evaluation of these symptoms and offers guidelines for diagnostic approaches. Strong evidence indicates that when well-trained providers perform a high-quality bedside neurovestibular examination, accurate diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorders and stroke increases. However, it is less clear who can and should be performing these assessments on a routine basis. This article offers a focused debate for and against routine specialty consultation for patients with acute dizziness or vertigo in the emergency department as well as a potential path forward utilizing new portable technologies to quantify eye movements.

### Diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness [^113FFt1r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Using an algorithmic approach to acutely dizzy patients, physicians can often confidently make a specific diagnosis that leads to correct treatment and should reduce the misdiagnosis of cerebrovascular events. Emergency clinicians should try to become familiar with an approach that exploits timing and triggers as well as some basic "rules" of nystagmus. The gait should always be tested in all patients who might be discharged. Computed tomographic scans are unreliable to exclude posterior circulation stroke presenting as dizziness, and early MRI (within the first 72 hours) also misses 10% to 20% of these cases.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^117SLvEN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Ménière's disease: new guidelines, subtypes, imaging, and more [^112yuAwj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews recent developments in Ménière's disease including etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic investigations that have changed the landscape for medical providers. These updates shed light onto the complex nature of Ménière's disease and generate additional means to provide optimal care to patients.

Recent Findings

Given the multifactorial cause of Ménière's disease, five subtypes of Ménière's disease have recently been proposed. A knowledge of these subtypes will aid in the development of an appropriate treatment algorithm. Although newer treatments have not been developed, stepwise treatment algorithms have been proposed and can improve patient care. New MRI modalities and serum testing hold promise as clinical clues and biomarkers.

Summary

As these updated diagnostic criteria are used, Ménière's disease can be identified and treated more precisely. This will in turn allow for future randomized controlled studies to improve the quality of treatment options available. Future imaging, vestibular testing, and the potential for serum biomarkers may illuminate additional diagnostic criteria, only furthering the improvement in clinical care.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — radiographic testing is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging. Recommendation against radiographic imaging based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Reduce unnecessary testing and costs, reduce unnecessary radiation and radiographic contrast exposure (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, affordable quality care). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C based on observational studies for radiographic imaging. Level of confidence in evidence: Medium. Benefits: Facilitate timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses; avoid radiation exposure and adverse reactions to testing. Risks, harms, costs: None. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: The panel placed heavy value in the accuracy of the BPPV diagnosis at the outset in that a diagnosis made by appropriate history and Dix-Hallpike is adequate to proceed with management without further testing. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: Patients who have separate indications for radiographic or vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. Policy level: Recommendation against. Differences of opinion: None. Routine radiographic imaging is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV (Table 6). Radiographic imaging of the CNS should be reserved for patients who present with a clinical history compatible with BPPV but who also demonstrate additional neurologic symptoms atypical for BPPV.

GRACE-3 — summary of evidence for s-EVS in adults: The key differential diagnosis in s-EVS is between TIA (central) and vestibular migraine (benign central) or Ménière disease (peripheral). Over the past 15 years, the definition of a TIA has shifted from a time-based concept in which symptoms resolve in less than 24 h to a tissue-based concept, and since MRI is not usually done in the ED in the first hours of care, clinicians should understand this context. Patients with s-EVS are asymptomatic between episodes, and in vestibular migraine 24% reported a duration of episodes between 4 h and 3 days. The systematic reviews found limited direct evidence for diagnostic accuracy of some history elements and neuroimaging (MRI) in s-EVS, and direct evidence suggests routine neuroimaging in unselected s-EVS patients is unlikely to be cost-effective; focused history-taking is supported, including attention to whether episodes occur over a shorter period of time (< 6 months).

Figure 3
Case example — Improving stroke diagnosis in acute dizziness and vertigo. We modelled cost-effectiveness of a novel eye-movement physiology-based approach, focusing on variable costs and effects related to diagnosis of strokes among ED patients with acute, continuous dizziness. We compared two blanket diagnostic strategies (MRI all, admit all) to current practice and our proposed strategy (bedside video-oculography (VOG)). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from a societal perspective using dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). VOG could save many lives and is highly cost effective (∼US$7735 per QALY) in this subset of patients. Blue (non-dominated). Red (dominated: higher-cost, lower-quality alternatives).

If one also considers, however, the impact of improved diagnosis on patients with benign vestibular disorders, a different cost–benefit picture emerges. This population might initially seem less important to target, since lives are not usually at stake when patients with self-limited inner ear conditions are missed. Nevertheless, these 'benign' conditions do reduce quality of life for patients, and treatments reclaim these losses. More importantly, from an economic perspective, the societal costs of unnecessary diagnostic tests or admission for 'stroke workups' in these patients are enormous. With appropriate reductions in CT, modest increases in MRI, and slight decreases in overall admissions, we have estimated that total healthcare savings for ED dizziness amount to more than US$1 billion annually in the United States alone (additional material online table 1).

Table 1
Current and projected ED and hospital resource utilisation with routine VOG use

This finding suggests that an intervention targeting the broader population of patients at risk for both stroke and vestibular disorders would save lives and money. Thus, our economic analysis points to a different population (all acute dizziness or vertigo) than might initially have been targeted based on commonsense approaches (subset at high stroke risk). Before pursuing a research study to prove and disseminate these techniques, it would be possible to use estimated value of perfect information analysesto measure the expected value to society of any future research efforts to prove and disseminate the new approach.

### The efficient dizziness history and exam [^1127fetA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common complaint in otolaryngology clinics and can present a diagnostic challenge. A thorough history including onset, duration, and exacerbating and alleviating factors, along with physician persistence, can help differentiate between otologic and nonotologic forms of dizziness. An otologic and neurotologic physical examination, including vestibulo-ocular reflex and cranial nerve function evaluation and postural examination, can shed further light on symptom etiology. Otologic forms of dizziness often result in vertigo and may be associated with unilateral symptoms of hearing loss, aural fullness, or tinnitus. Primary causes of dizziness are more often constant and insidious in onset.

Acute dizziness and vertigo — diagnostic challenges and guideline objective are underscored by evidence that emergency clinicians missed over a third of strokes presenting with dizziness (16 of 46 validated stroke or TIA cases were missed in the ED), that emergency clinicians harbor misconceptions about how nystagmus informs the diagnostic process, and that when nystagmus is documented by front-line providers the descriptions are often inconsistent with the recorded diagnoses, with a clinical trial finding that nystagmus descriptions by emergency clinicians frequently did not match eye movements recorded contemporaneously in the ED by portable VOG; accordingly, the objective of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based framework intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about the evaluation and management of adult ED patients with acute dizziness who do not have an obvious central cause with frank neurological findings or an obvious general medical one.

Diagnostic approach to the acutely dizzy patient — adult emergency department patients are triaged through a three-step flowchart with explicit branch actions. Step 1 asks "Initial exam shows obvious neurologic findings?"; if yes, "Initiate local acute STROKE protocol", if no, proceed to Step 2. Step 2 asks "Clinical evaluation suggests a non-neurologic general medical cause?"; a yes branch directs "Evaluate & treat presumed diagnosis or diagnoses", while a no branch proceeds to Step 3. Step 3 asks "Has the dizziness been continuously present & persists at time of evaluation?"; a yes branch (AVS, acute vestibular syndrome) directs "Use physical exam to distinguish vestibular neuritis from stroke". If no, assess "Is the dizziness triggerable?"; a yes branch (t-EVS, transient episodic vestibular syndrome) directs "Use physical exam to distinguish BPPV w/ CPPV & orthostatic hypotension", and a no branch (s-EVS, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome) directs "Use history to distinguish vestibular migraine from TIA".

CT scan in emergency department (ED) dizziness and BPPV — diagnostic yield and guidance: "CT scans are used frequently in ED patients eventually diagnosed as BPPV", yet "Overall, the diagnostic yield of CT for important structural causes in dizzy patients is very low". In one study of admitted patients with typical BPPV nystagmus, "none of the 10 CT scans obtained clinically… revealed clinically important findings", whereas "two of 34 scans" in those with atypical or no nystagmus showed acute brain lesions; accordingly, the otolaryngology guideline "recommends against routine imaging in the presence of typical nystagmus and adequate therapeutic response to repositioning treatments".

### Utility of head CT in the evaluation of vertigo / dizziness in the emergency department [^115MfHmW]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute dizziness (including vertigo) is a common reason to visit the emergency room, and imaging with head CT is often performed initially to exclude a central cause. In this study, consecutive patients presenting with dizziness and undergoing head CT were retrospectively reviewed to determine diagnostic yield. Four hundred forty-eight consecutive head CTs in a representative sample of dizzy emergency room (ER) patients, including patients with other neurological symptoms, were reviewed to identify an acute or subacute cause for acute dizziness along with the frequency and modalities used in follow-up imaging. The diagnostic yield for head CT ordered in the ER for acute dizziness is low (2.2%; 1.6% for emergent findings), but MRI changes the diagnosis up to 16% of the time, acutely in 8% of cases. Consistent with the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria and the literature, this study suggests a low diagnostic yield for CT in the evaluation of acute dizziness but an important role for MRI in appropriately selected cases.

Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) describes sudden onset, severe, continuous dizziness that persists for more than 24 hours. Its wide differential presents a diagnostic challenge. Vestibular neuritis is the most common cause, but stroke, trauma, medication effects, infectious, and inflammatory causes all present similarly. The TiTrATE model (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Exam) is systematic way to evaluate these patients, and the HINTS Plus exam (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew, plus hearing loss) is critical in differentiating central and peripheral causes. The importance of recognizing risk factors for stroke and the role of imaging is also discussed.

### Specificity of early-career general practitioners' problem formulations in patients presenting with dizziness: a cross-sectional analysis [^113QnPGy]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common presentation in general practice. Aetiologies of dizziness include vestibular/peripheral causes, cardiovascular or neurological disease, or psychogenic reasons. There is a lack of consensus in internationally accepted and unified reference standards for the core aetiologies. A focused history is essential, in conjunction with clinical examination findings, in establishing a diagnosis.

Dizziness diagnoses range from benign and self-limiting to severe and potentially life-threatening. The impact of dizziness and vertigo on patients' quality of life can be profound, affecting their physical and mental health and ability to fulfil employment commitments. Specific diagnosis can facilitate measures to attenuate effects on quality of life. Determining the underlying cause can be difficult and complex but is vital. The most serious consequence of failure to establish the specific aetiology of vertigo and dizziness symptom presentations is the failure to manage a central cause of vertigo, such as vertebrobasilar stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Symptom analysis with recognition of accompanying neurological features and physical examination for positional nystagmus remain key aspects of assessment in differentiating central from peripheral vertigo.

Diagnosis and management of vertigo consumes significant medical resources with repeated primary and secondary care presentations, inconsistent prescribing patterns and unnecessary diagnostic procedures. This is compounded by frequently underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed presentations at a primary care level. Despite the inherent difficulties in diagnosis, it is accepted that common presentations of vestibular disturbances can be adequately diagnosed and managed in general practice without specialist referral. The general practitioner's (GP) approach to diagnosis and management, and their role as gate-keeper to secondary care, is important in reducing misdiagnosis and ensuring appropriate resource allocation.

There is limited evidence of vertigo and dizziness management in the general practice setting, with the majority of research conducted in emergency departments. It is recognised, though, that there is a need to improve educational approaches to acute vertigo care. A singular area for focus is early-career GPs' practice, including those in specialist GP training programmes. These are practitioners in the process of establishing practice patterns appropriate to the primary care setting. It is possible these patterns may persist into later practice.

This study aimed to establish the frequency of presentations that included a specific vertigo provisional diagnosis versus a non-specific (symptom) problem formulation in the practice of GP registrars (specialist GP trainees). We also sought to establish associations of specific vertigo provisional diagnoses rather than non-specific problem formulations being made in vertigo/dizziness presentations.

A careful history and thorough physical examination are necessary in patients presenting with acute neurologic dysfunction. Patients presenting with headache should be screened for red-flag criteria that suggest a dangerous secondary cause warranting imaging and further diagnostic workup. Dizziness is a vague complaint; focusing on timing, triggers, and examination findings can help reduce diagnostic error. Most patients presenting with back pain do not require emergent imaging, but those with new neurologic deficits or signs/symptoms concerning for acute infection or cord compression warrant MRI. Delay to diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke is a frequent reason for medical malpractice claims.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

### MRI dedicated to the emergency department for diplopia or dizziness: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114dVVvg]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the costs and organizational benefits of diagnostic workup without and with MRI dedicated to the ED.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational uncontrolled before-after study in one ED of a university hospital in France from July 1, 2018, and January 3, 2020. We included all consecutive patients presenting with dizziness or diplopia. The main outcomes were the clinical decision time of ED physicians and the total costs for each strategy. Outcomes were compared using propensity score with inverse probability weighting in the 2 arms and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.

Results

Among the 199 patients during the "before" period (average age: 60.4 years ± 17.6): 112 men (57%), and 181 during the "after" period (average age, 54.8 years ± 18.5): 107 men (59%), the average costs were €2701 (95% CI 1918; 3704) and €2389 (95% CI: €1627; 3280) per patient, respectively. The average time to clinical decision was 9.8 h (95% CI: 8.9 10.7) in the group "before" and 7.7 h (95% CI: 7.1; 8.4) in the group "after" (ICER: €151 saved for a reduction of 1 h in clinical decision time). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated a 71% chance that the MRI dedicated to ED was dominant (less costly and more effective).

Conclusion

Easy access to MRI in the ED for posterior circulation stroke-like symptoms must be considered a relevant approach to help physicians for an appropriate and rapid diagnostic with reduction of costs.

Trial Registration

NCT03660852 KEY POINTS:
- A dedicated MRI in the ED for diplopia or dizziness may be considered an efficient strategy improving diagnostic performance, reducing physicians' decision time, and decreasing hospital costs.
- This strategy supports clinical decision-making with early treatment and management of patients with posterior circulation-like symptoms in the ED.
- There is 71% chance that the MRI dedicated to ED was dominant (less costly and more effective) compared with a strategy without dedicated MRI.

GRACE-3 Box 4 — Unavailability of a clinician trained in HINTS: For emergency clinicians who are not adequately trained in performance and interpretation of HINTS, either consultation with an appropriately trained specialist should be obtained to perform HINTS testing or neuroimaging by MRI should be used to aid in differentiating stroke from non-stroke cases, assuming the availability of consultants and/or MRI. For emergency clinicians who are not adequately trained in performance and interpretation of HINTS and who also lack routine access to MRI neuroimaging, CT (with or without CTA) is insufficient to "rule out" ischemic stroke. Several options exist to help maximize patient safety including hospital admission for observation, transfer to a facility that has MRI, empirically initiating aspirin or other appropriate prophylaxis if there is a high suspicion for stroke, or arranging an urgent outpatient MRI.

Acute dizziness and vertigo — neuroimaging performance and utilization in the ED — Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used but has poor diagnostic sensitivity for ischemic stroke: in a study of over 5500 ED patients with dizziness, 27% had a CT and 3% had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and CT sensitivity for early-presenting acute ischemic stroke has been shown to be as low as 10%. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) is more sensitive but still misses strokes: a meta-analysis found it missed 6.8% of ischemic strokes within 72 hours and MRI-DWI–negative strokes were five times more common in posterior circulation events; in AVS, early DWI-MRI within 48 hours misses 10%–22% of strokes and 50% of small-volume posterior fossa strokes. For intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), yield in isolated dizziness is low: in 595 ICH cases, only 13 (2.2%) presented with dizziness and a NIHSS of < 2, and a pooled analysis of 126 AVS patients found five (4%) with ICH but only two (1.6%) with isolated dizziness. Reliance on a negative CT is associated with harm: patients discharged after a negative CT were 2.3 times more likely to return with a stroke within 30 days than those without CT.

In adult ED patients with s-EVS, we recommend against routine use of CT to help distinguish between central (TIA) and peripheral (vestibular migraine, Menière disease) diagnoses (strong recommendation, AGAINST). In adult ED patients with s-EVS and concern for TIA, we suggest use of CTA or MRA of the head and neck to rule out posterior circulation vascular pathology (conditional recommendation, FOR).

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management [^113teZZ9]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common yet imprecise symptom. It was traditionally divided into four categories based on the patient's history: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and light-headedness. However, the distinction between these symptoms is of limited clinical usefulness. Patients have difficulty describing the quality of their symptoms but can more consistently identify the timing and triggers. Episodic vertigo triggered by head motion may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vertigo with unilateral hearing loss suggests Meniere disease. Episodic vertigo not associated with any trigger may be a symptom of vestibular neuritis. Evaluation focuses on determining whether the etiology is peripheral or central. Peripheral etiologies are usually benign. Central etiologies often require urgent treatment. The HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies. The physical examination includes orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required and are usually not helpful. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be treated with a canalith repositioning procedure (e.g. Epley maneuver). Treatment of Meniere disease includes salt restriction and diuretics. Symptoms of vestibular neuritis are relieved with vestibular suppressant medications and vestibular rehabilitation.

### Validation of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with acute vertigo and dizziness [^114BTJFq]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Vertigo and dizziness are common complaints in emergency departments and primary care, and pose major diagnostic challenges due to their various underlying etiologies. Most supportive diagnostic algorithms concentrate on either identifying cerebrovascular events (CVEs) or diagnosing specific vestibular disorders or are restricted to specific patient subgroups. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a comprehenisve algorithm for identifying patients with CVE and classifying the most common vestibular disorders.

Methods

The study was conducted within the scope of the "PoiSe" project (Prevention, Online feedback, and Interdisciplinary Therapy of Acute Vestibular Syndromes by e-health). A three-level algorithm was developed according to international guidelines and scientific evidence, addressing both the detection of CVEs and the classification of non-vascular vestibular disorders (unilateral vestibulopathy, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular paroxysmia, Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, functional dizziness). The algorithm was validated in a prospectively collected dataset of 407 patients with acute vertigo and dizziness presenting to the Emergency Department at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.

Results

The algorithm assigned 287 of 407 patients to the correct diagnosis, corresponding to an overall accuracy of 71%. CVEs were identified with high sensitivity of 94%. The six most common vestibular disorders were classified with high specificity, above 95%. Random forest identified presence of a paresis, sensory loss, central ocular motor and vestibular signs (HINTS [head impulse test, nystagmus assessment, and test of skew deviation]), and older age as the most important variables indicating a cerebrovascular event.

Conclusions

The proposed diagnostic algorithm can correctly classify the most common vestibular disorders based on a comprehensive set of key questions and clinical examinations. It is easily applied, not limited to subgroups, and might therefore be transferred to broad clinical settings such as primary healthcare.

GRACE-3 — t-EVS differential and bedside diagnostic features — The key differential diagnosis in t-EVS is between the relatively rare central paroxysmal positional vertigo and the very common BPPV, and patients are usually asymptomatic at rest in the ED but, by definition, their symptoms can be triggered/reproduced at the bedside with positional testing, so physical examination has the potential to make a confident specific diagnosis. Aggregated evidence supports a strong recommendation for use of the Dix–Hallpike test to diagnose pc-BPPV when the triggered and transient upbeat torsional nystagmus is present, whereas it supports a conditional recommendation for use of MRI in cases with atypical nystagmus or lack of response to canalith repositioning treatments. BPPV can sometimes be mistaken for orthostatic hypotension, but symptoms in BPPV usually also occur on reclining or when rolling over in bed, episodes that occur during sleep strongly suggest BPPV, and patients with orthostatic hypotension rarely have nystagmus on positional testing unless the hypotension is profound.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management | AAFP… [^116zotJz]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination Patients with triggered episodic vestibular syndrome can be further evaluated with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and orthostatic vitals. 8, 11 Orthostatic hypotension is a sustained reduction in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure reduction of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing from a supine or sitting position. 12 The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can diagnose benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 1. Transient upbeat-torsional nystagmus during the maneuver suggests benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, especially in the absence of spontaneous or gaze-evoked nystagmus. 2 This examination should be performed only when patients have triggered episodic vestibular syndrome. However, a negative result on the Dix-Hallpike maneuver does not eliminate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo if the timing and triggers are consistent with that diagnosis.

Repositioning maneuvers are more effective when certain canals are affected. Epley maneuvers are effective for posterior canal canaliths; however, other maneuvers are more effective at repositioning stones in the horizontal canal. 14 The success rate for the Epley maneuver is nearly 100%. 19 Some patients, especially those with trauma-related benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, require more repetitions of the repositioning maneuvers. 21 If there is no improvement with repeated maneuvers, or the patient develops atypical nystagmus or nausea, a different cause should be considered.
14. In addition to repositioning, evidence supports vestibular rehabilitation as safe and effective. It includes activities to help patients coordinate their balance, vision, and muscle movements to decrease the impact of dizziness and imbalance. The best long-term outcomes involve a combination of vestibular rehabilitation and repositioning maneuvers.

Positioning maneuvers are ineffective, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver does not usually trigger symptoms. Symptoms resolve after a few days, but some patients experience months of reoccurring symptoms. 19 Some patients develop benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. 25 Attacks initially last one to two days and progressively get shorter until resolved. If this does not occur, a different diagnosis should be considered. 26.

Physical Examination Physicians should pay particular attention to physical findings of the neurologic, head and neck, and cardiovascular systems. 2 Spontaneous horizontal nystagmus with or without rotatory nystagmus is consistent with acute vestibular neuronitis. Patients with peripheral vertigo have impaired balance but are still able to walk, whereas patients with central vertigo have more severe instability and often cannot walk or even stand without falling. 14 Although Romberg's sign is consistent with a vestibular or proprioceptive problem, it is not particularly useful in the diagnosis of vertigo. In one study, 22 it was only 19 percent sensitive for peripheral vestibular disorders and did not correlate with more serious causes of dizziness such as drug-related dizziness, seizure, arrhythmia, or cerebrovascular events. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver.

15 The combination of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a history of vertigo or vomiting suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder. 22 If the maneuver provokes purely vertical or torsional nystagmus without a latent period of at least a few seconds, and does not wane with repeated maneuvers, this suggests a central cause for vertigo such as a posterior fossa tumor or hemorrhage. 14, 15. CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION Orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and pulse in patients with vertigo upon standing may identify problems with dehydration or autonomic dysfunction. 10 Carotid sinus stimulation should not be performed; it has been shown to be not useful diagnostically 22 and potentially is dangerous.

Radiologic Studies Physicians should consider neuroimaging studies in patients with vertigo who have neurologic signs and symptoms, risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, or progressive unilateral hearing loss. 19 In one study, 24 40 percent of patients with dizziness and neurologic signs had relevant abnormalities suggesting central nervous system lesions on magnetic resonance imaging of the head. In patients with isolated vertigo who also were at risk for cerebrovascular disease, 25 percent had caudal cerebellar infarcts. 25 In general, magnetic resonance imaging is more appropriate than computed tomography for diagnosing vertigo because of its superiority in visualizing the posterior fossa, where most central nervous system disease that causes vertigo is found.
