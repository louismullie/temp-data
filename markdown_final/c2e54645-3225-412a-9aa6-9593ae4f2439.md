## Question

Indications corticosteroids in acute back pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when corticosteroids are indicated for acute back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "acute back pain" and distinguish non-radicular from radicular pain. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about systemic corticosteroids for acute low back pain. Next, I will examine the randomized trial evidence for oral and parenteral steroids, including effect sizes and harms. After that, I need to check whether epidural or facet injections have any role in the acute setting. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note any narrow exceptions where steroids might be considered despite weak evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Acute back pain is typically defined as less than 6 weeks' duration, and I should separate non-radicular mechanical low back pain from radicular pain due to nerve root compression, because the pathophysiology and evidence base differ and that will shape whether steroids help at all [^114LrdHM].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before diving into trials. The VA/DoD guideline recommends against systemic corticosteroids for acute low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, concluding that most trials show no significant benefit in pain or function and that any signal is small and low quality, so routine use is not supported [^113hmBqp]. The NASS 2020 guideline similarly advises to avoid offering oral or IV corticosteroids for low back pain, aligning with a "do not use" stance in typical acute presentations [^114k2CX3]. Hold on, I should verify whether any major guideline endorses systemic steroids here; I don't see endorsements from AAFP, ACP, or ACOEM for systemic steroids in acute non-radicular pain, which reinforces the negative recommendation [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine the randomized evidence for systemic steroids in acute non-radicular low back pain. Wait, let me verify the ED trial: a randomized, double-blind study of single-dose intramuscular methylprednisolone in ED patients with non-radicular pain showed no clinically meaningful improvement in pain, disability, or healthcare use at 1 month, supporting a conclusion of no benefit [^113WT7cD]. I should also confirm broader syntheses; the 2017 ACP systematic review found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective for acute low back pain, and a 2023 network meta-analysis of analgesics for acute non-specific low back pain found limited and uncertain evidence for steroids, again suggesting no clear benefit [^1133gQ9t] [^112E25gN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a small functional benefit signal in non-radicular pain, but I should double-check; the Cochrane review suggests systemic steroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain and only slightly better function in non-radicular pain, which does not support routine use given the small, uncertain effects and adverse event burden [^115QHnuC].

> I will now examine radicular pain, where I need to be careful not to over-interpret. The best-quality trial in acute lumbar radiculopathy from herniated disk found that a 15-day taper of oral prednisone improved function modestly at 3 weeks and 1 year but did not improve leg pain at 3 weeks and only showed a tiny, non-significant pain reduction at 1 year, while adverse events were substantially higher with steroids, which tempers any clinical enthusiasm [^113cV1aa]. But wait, what if parenteral steroids help early? A small ED RCT of single-dose IM methylprednisolone in acute radiculopathy was a negative study for the primary pain outcome, though some secondary measures hinted at benefit; given imprecision and risk of bias, this cannot overturn the overall conclusion of no consistent, clinically important pain benefit from systemic steroids in acute radiculopathy [^112EVSmk]. Let me verify the meta-analytic view; a Cochrane review concluded systemic corticosteroids have, at most, small short-term improvements in pain and function in radicular pain, with uncertain clinical significance and no reduction in surgery rates, reinforcing that routine systemic steroid use is not justified [^115QHnuC]. I should also note that an older, small RCT suggested faster improvement in some outcomes with early oral steroids, but the sample was tiny and the findings have not been replicated, so this remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^113RNxTf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about injections; I need to check whether epidural or facet steroids have any role in the acute window. Guidelines generally do not recommend epidural steroid injections for acute non-radicular low back pain, and even for radicular pain, benefits are small and short-term, typically considered after a trial of NSAIDs and a few weeks of conservative care to bridge symptoms while natural history unfolds, not as first-line acute therapy [^114nphBV] [^113pzYwN]. The evidence base shows only modest, short-term improvements in leg pain and disability with epidural steroids for sciatica, with no durable long-term benefit, which argues against early routine use in acute presentations [^1128dqir]. For facet joint injections, randomized data and guidelines indicate no meaningful benefit over placebo in appropriately selected patients, and recommendations are against routine facet steroid injections, so they should not be used for acute axial pain either [^112rUNBT] [^113cd7Fx]. I should confirm safety context too; rare but serious neurologic complications have been reported with epidural steroids, underscoring the need for caution and proper selection if considered at all [^114hs9Yi].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Across populations with acute back pain, systemic corticosteroids show, at best, small and inconsistent benefits limited to short-term function in a subset with radiculopathy, while adverse effects are more common and include hyperglycemia, mood and sleep disturbance, and other glucocorticoid toxicities, which are particularly concerning in patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, infection risk, or psychiatric comorbidity [^113cV1aa] [^115QHnuC]. Given the favorable natural history of acute low back pain and the availability of safer, modestly effective alternatives like NSAIDs and nonpharmacologic care, the net clinical utility of systemic steroids is unfavorable in most scenarios [^116CPVsy].

> I should now translate this into a practical recommendation. For acute non-radicular low back pain, do not prescribe systemic corticosteroids; prioritize education, activity, and NSAIDs if appropriate, with nonpharmacologic options like heat and manual therapy as indicated, because steroids have no proven benefit and carry nontrivial risks [^113hmBqp] [^116CPVsy]. For acute radicular pain, avoid routine systemic steroids; reserve them, if at all, for exceptional cases of severe, incapacitating pain after discussing the small likelihood of functional benefit, the lack of pain relief, and the higher adverse event rate, and consider them only as a short, closely monitored course while continuing conservative management and plans for physical therapy or specialist referral if not improving [^113cV1aa] [^115QHnuC]. Epidural steroid injections are not first-line in the acute period; if considered for persistent radicular pain after a trial of conservative therapy, they may offer short-term symptom relief but should not be repeated without objective response, given limited and transient benefit and procedural risks [^114nphBV] [^1128dqir].

> But wait, what if there are special situations? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. In patients with sickle cell disease, guidelines recommend against corticosteroids for acute pain because of rebound pain and other complications, so steroids should be avoided for that indication even if back pain is part of the vaso-occlusive episode [^1154uzFp] [^113hD2NV]. In older adults, the risk–benefit calculus is even less favorable due to higher rates of hyperglycemia, infection, osteoporosis, and neuropsychiatric effects, so I should be particularly cautious and generally avoid systemic steroids for acute back pain in this group [^114H8MP2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no robust indication for corticosteroids in acute back pain, whether radicular or non-radicular, and multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend against their routine use; any residual consideration is limited to exceptional, short-course use in severe radiculopathy after shared decision-making that acknowledges small, uncertain benefits and meaningful harms, with close monitoring and concurrent conservative care [^113hmBqp] [^114k2CX3] [^113cV1aa] [^115QHnuC].

---

Corticosteroids are **not recommended for routine use** in acute low back pain without radiculopathy, as evidence shows no meaningful benefit and potential harms [^113hmBqp] [^111RERYy]. For acute radicular pain, **short-term oral or intramuscular steroids may offer modest short-term functional gains**, but benefits are small, transient, and not superior to standard care; use should be selective and time-limited [^113cV1aa] [^115QHnuC]. Epidural steroids are not first-line for acute radiculopathy; consider only after conservative therapy fails and with informed consent, given limited short-term benefit and procedural risks [^114nphBV] [^1128dqir]. Overall, corticosteroids should be reserved for carefully selected cases, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

## Clinical evidence for corticosteroids in acute back pain

### Acute non-radicular low back pain

For acute non-radicular low back pain, **systemic corticosteroids are not recommended** because evidence shows no significant benefit in pain, function, or recovery time [^113hmBqp] [^111RERYy]. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of oral prednisone found no improvement in pain or function versus placebo, and systemic steroids were associated with more adverse events [^115Sne14] [^113cV1aa]. Guidelines from the VA/DoD and NASS advise against systemic corticosteroids for acute non-radicular low back pain [^113hmBqp] [^114k2CX3].

---

### Acute radicular pain (sciatica)

For acute radicular pain (sciatica), **short-term oral or intramuscular steroids may yield modest short-term functional improvements**, but pain relief is limited and long-term benefits are lacking [^113cV1aa] [^115QHnuC]. An RCT of a 15-day prednisone taper showed a 6.4-point improvement in disability at 3 weeks but no significant pain reduction, and higher adverse event rates with steroids [^113cV1aa]. Intramuscular methylprednisolone showed a small, non-significant pain improvement at 1 month in ED patients with radicular pain [^112EVSmk]. Guidelines suggest cautious, selective use of systemic steroids for acute radiculopathy, typically for short courses and only after conservative measures [^114H8MP2].

---

## Epidural corticosteroid injections

Epidural corticosteroid injections are **not first-line for acute radiculopathy**; consider only after conservative therapy fails and with informed consent, given limited short-term benefit and procedural risks [^114nphBV] [^1128dqir]. Evidence indicates small, short-term improvements in leg pain and disability (about 2–6 points on 0–100 scales) without long-term benefit, and with rare but serious complications (e.g. infection, neurologic injury) [^1128dqir] [^114hs9Yi]. Guidelines recommend epidural injections only in select cases after NSAID therapy and at least 3 weeks of conservative care, and not for axial pain without radiculopathy [^114nphBV] [^113pzYwN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute non-radicular low back pain | Strongly against systemic corticosteroids | High |
| Acute radicular pain (sciatica) | Conditional recommendation for short-term systemic corticosteroids | Moderate |
| Epidural corticosteroid injections | Conditional recommendation for select cases after conservative therapy | Moderate |

---

Guidelines consistently advise against **routine corticosteroid use** in acute back pain, endorsing selective, time-limited use only in specific radicular cases after conservative measures [^113hmBqp] [^114k2CX3].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Corticosteroids carry **meaningful risks**, particularly with systemic use:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Especially in diabetics [^112gTFPY].
- **Hypertension**: Transient increases in blood pressure.
- **Mood changes**: Insomnia, anxiety, depression [^notfound].
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk [^112gTFPY].
- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Osteoporosis, myopathy, adrenal suppression with repeated or prolonged use [^117EsRxU].

These risks are **amplified in older adults** and those with comorbidities, requiring careful patient selection and monitoring [^114H8MP2].

---

## Patient selection criteria

When considering corticosteroids, **reserve use** for patients with:

- **Severe radicular pain**: Incapacitating pain limiting function despite conservative therapy.
- **Short duration**: Symptoms less than 3 months.
- **No contraindications**: Absence of diabetes, hypertension, infection, or psychiatric disorders.
- **Informed consent**: Understanding limited benefits and potential risks.

---

## Alternative treatments

Preferred first-line treatments for acute back pain include:

- **NSAIDs**: Modest pain and disability benefits [^111o4mKT].
- **Acetaminophen**: Minimal benefit, but low risk [^111RERYy].
- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for severe muscle spasm [^111RERYy].
- **Non-pharmacologic**: Heat, manual therapy, exercise, and patient education [^112E25gN].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Corticosteroids are **not recommended for routine use** in acute non-radicular low back pain because of lack of benefit and potential harms [^113hmBqp]. In acute radicular pain, short-term systemic steroids may offer modest, transient functional gains but no sustained benefit; use should be selective, time-limited, and after conservative therapy [^114H8MP2]. Epidural steroids are not first-line and should be considered only after conservative measures fail, with informed consent regarding limited efficacy and procedural risks [^114nphBV]. Clinicians should prioritize safer, evidence-based alternatives and reserve corticosteroids for carefully selected patients with close monitoring.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — systemic corticosteroids (Recommendation 28): For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, we suggest against systemic corticosteroids (oral or intramuscular injection) (Weak against | Not reviewed, Amended). The discussion notes that systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic LBP with or without radiculopathy are not recommended and that most trials in a systematic review showed no significant improvements in pain or function across dosing regimens. One randomized controlled trial using a 15 day course of oral prednisone (five days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg) versus placebo showed a statistically significant improvement in disability and favored prednisone for the mental health component of an SF-36, with no difference for the physical component; study quality was determined to be low, and there is inconclusive evidence that corticosteroids decrease healthcare utilization.

### Nonsurgical management of acute and chronic low back pain [^112BTsZ6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

A variety of nonsurgical treatment alternatives exists for acute and chronic low back pain. Patients should receive appropriate education about the favorable natural history of low back pain, basic body mechanics, and methods (eg, exercises, activity modification, behavioral modification) that can reduce symptoms. Nonprescription medication is efficacious for mild to moderate pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alone or in combination with muscle relaxants, relieve pain and improve overall symptoms of acute low back pain. Exercise therapy has limited value for acute low back pain, but strong evidence supports exercise therapy in the management of chronic low back pain. Moderately strong evidence supports the use of manipulation in acute back pain. Evidence is weak for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with acute low back pain, strong for short-term relief of chronic low back pain, and limited for long-term relief of chronic low back pain. The use of facet injections in the management of acute low back pain is not supported by evidence, nor is the effectiveness of orthoses, traction, magnets, or acupuncture. Trigger point injections are not indicated for nonspecific acute or chronic low back pain, and sacroiliac joint injections are not indicated in the routine management of low back pain. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

### Low back pain (acute) [^111nWg8w]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point in their lives. Acute low back pain can be self-limiting; however, 1 year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute low back pain has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for acute low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for acute low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for acute low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation, temperature treatments (short-wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

### Use of steroids in spine surgery [^112GFS9z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Steroids are commonly used in spine pathologies. A broad range of providers from different specialties such as primary care, emergency medicine, and spine surgeons use steroids. The indications and controversies of steroid use are discussed in this article. A literature review was conducted on the use of steroids in spine pathologies. Steroids have been successfully used in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to prevent dysphagia, in spinal cord injuries to improve neurological function, in acute back and neck pain for pain control, and in spinal metastasis. Steroid injections have been used for axial as well as radicular pain. Techniques and complications are further discussed. Local and systemic steroids have been successful in preventing dysphagia after anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. Steroids failed to improve the neurologic outcomes after spinal cord injuries, and they were associated with multiple complications. Systemic steroids have not been proven to provide better clinical outcomes for acute low back pain. Steroid injections are more effective in radicular pain rather than axial pain. There are not enough high-quality studies on the use of steroids for metastatic spinal cord compression.

### Medications for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society / American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1133gQ9t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Medications are the most frequently prescribed therapy for low back pain. A challenge in choosing pharmacologic therapy is that each class of medication is associated with a unique balance of risks and benefits.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, tramadol, and systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain).

Data Sources

English-language studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE (through November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts.

Study Selection

Systematic reviews and randomized trials of dual therapy or monotherapy with 1 or more of the preceding medications for acute or chronic low back pain that reported pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, work disability, or patient satisfaction.

Data Extraction

We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To grade methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials.

Data Synthesis

We found good evidence that NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain) are effective for pain relief. The magnitude of benefit was moderate (effect size of 0.5 to 0.8, improvement of 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale, or relative risk of 1.25 to 2.00 for the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant pain relief), except in the case of tricyclic antidepressants (for which the benefit was small to moderate). We also found fair evidence that opioids, tramadol, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin (for radiculopathy) are effective for pain relief. We found good evidence that systemic corticosteroids are ineffective. Adverse events, such as sedation, varied by medication, although reliable data on serious and long-term harms are sparse. Most trials were short term (≤ 4 weeks). Few data address efficacy of dual-medication therapy compared with monotherapy, or beneficial effects on functional outcomes.

Limitations

Our primary source of data was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language trials only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews.

Conclusions

Medications with good evidence of short-term effectiveness for low back pain are NSAIDs, acetaminophen, skeletal muscle relaxants (for acute low back pain), and tricyclic antidepressants (for chronic low back pain). Evidence is insufficient to identify one medication as offering a clear overall net advantage because of complex tradeoffs between benefits and harms. Individual patients are likely to differ in how they weigh potential benefits, harms, and costs of various medications.

### Low back pain (acute) [^113CemdC]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point. Acute low back pain is usually perceived as self-limiting; however, one year later, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. It has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may also increase in severity and duration over time.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 34 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation (in the short term), temperature treatments (short wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115Sne14]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — oral or IV steroids (Grade B) is suggested to be not effective; trials in emergency department (ED) patients found no benefit with prednisone 50 mg (n = 39) versus placebo (n = 40) and no differences with methylprednisolone acetate 160 mg (n = 44) versus placebo (n = 43). Adults aged 18–55 years with LBP intensity ≥ 5 out of 10 on a VAS had no statistically-significant difference in 3‑point verbal rating scale pain at 5 days, and authors concluded oral corticosteroids did not provide a benefit and that oral steroid (prednisone) is no more effective than placebo; in nonradicular LBP, subjects assessed at one week and one month on an 11‑point numerical rating scale (NRS) and 4‑point descriptive scale had no between‑group differences, and authors concluded parenteral corticosteroids did not provide any benefit and that intravenous steroids are not more effective than placebo.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114nphBV]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to epidural injections, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to offer epidural corticosteroid injections in selected circumstances for the treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically after treatment with NSAIDs and waiting at least 3 weeks.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115oPAgu]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses-network meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA) statement for this article. This report is part of a larger project (PROSPERO CRD42019145257) evaluating analgesic medicines for low back pain. The published protocol appears in supplement 1, and protocol updates are in supplement 2a and 2b.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of adults (≥ 18 years) with acute non-specific low back pain. We included randomised controlled trials that compared an analgesic medicine with another analgesic medicine, placebo medicine, or no treatment (including continuation of usual care or being placed on a waitlist). We did not restrict our criteria by language or publication status. We excluded randomised controlled trials with enriched enrolment because this method violates the transitivity assumption.

We included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids from the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system (supplement 2c). Medicines must have had a license for use in humans in 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration, UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, European Medicines Agency, or Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. We included additional licensed medicines in these classes that were identified during the review process. Medicines must have been administered systemically (eg, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular) as a single drug or combination formulations, at any dose. We excluded non-systemic administrations (eg, topical and epidural). Trials that used non-pharmacological co-interventions were included and were considered in the assessment of transitivity.

We only included trials that assessed the effects of medicines that had been administered for a minimum of 24 h or, where single administration was used, outcomes at the end of treatment had to have been measured a minimum of 24 h later. This threshold excluded trials that tested the analgesic effect of medicines on immediate term outcomes only, which typically examined acute emergency care or experimental settings and is different to primary care.

Data sources

We searched five electronic databases and three clinical trial registers (Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform) from database inception until 20 February 2022. Full search strategies appear in supplement 2d. We also searched previous reviews and reference lists of included trials, which returned no additional records.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113pzYwN]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to epidural injections, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer epidural corticosteroid injections for the treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic LBP in the absence of significant radicular symptoms.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114bwFCy]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Indications and frequency limits for injections — the document states these decisions have often relied on non-evidence-based assumptions. Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient's progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for low back pain, more specifically with respect to facet joint injections, ASPN 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering facet corticosteroid injections, preferably image-guided,
in acute cases of facet-mediated pain,
but not as a stand-alone therapy.

### Corticosteroids for pain of spinal origin: epidural and intraarticular administration [^113qVKkN]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Targeted interventional delivery of corticosteroids remains a mainstay of treatment for spinal pain syndromes because this approach has a wider therapeutic index than other approaches. The best evidence for analgesic efficacy is in subacute radicular syndromes associated with new-onset or recurrent lumbar radiculitis. Complications often relate to drug delivery technique as much as actions of the steroid itself and require careful consideration and vigilance by the administering physician. Considerable uncertainty persists concerning which patients with chronic pain are most likely to benefit from corticosteroid injections. Matching this treatment option with specific spinal pain syndromes remains a major challenge.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113ZbBFc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar epidural glucocorticosteroid injections (ESIs) — a total of 18 high-quality and 41 moderate-quality studies were included. Evidence is consistent that ESIs result in up to 6 weeks modest improvement compared with placebo injections. As the main alternative is surgery, this Spine Panel's opinion is that an ESI is Recommended (I), Moderate Confidence for select circumstances as an option for treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically after treatment with NSAID and waiting at least 3 weeks; its purpose is to provide a few weeks of partial pain relief while awaiting spontaneous improvement and remaining as active as practical. Effects of series of injections should be assessed, and there should not be a series of injections (eg, three) ordered. Epidural glucocorticosteroid injections are Moderately Not Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence for treatment of spinal stenosis, and are Not Recommended (D), Evidence (C), High Confidence for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain in the absence of significant radicular symptoms. Fluoroscopic guidance improves placement accuracy, as blind targeting has been shown to be 77% accurate.

### Parenteral corticosteroids for emergency department patients with non-radicular low back pain [^113WT7cD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although not recommended for low back pain, the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids has never been evaluated in a general low back pain population. To test the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids for Emergency Department (ED) patients with low back pain, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of long-acting methylprednisolone was conducted with follow-up assessment 1 month after ED discharge. Patients with non-traumatic low back pain were included if their straight leg raise test was negative. The primary outcome was a comparison of the change in a numerical rating scale (NRS) 1 month after discharge. Of 87 subjects randomized, 86 were successfully followed to the 1-month endpoint. The change in NRS between discharge and 1 month differed between the two groups by 0.6 (95% confidence interval -1.0 to 2.2), a clinically and statistically insignificant difference. Disability, medication use, and healthcare resources utilized were comparable in both groups. Corticosteroids do not seem to benefit patients with acute non-radicular low back pain.

### Systemic pharmacologic therapies for low back pain: a systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111RERYy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A 2007 American College of Physicians guideline addressed pharmacologic options for low back pain. New evidence and medications have now become available.

Purpose

To review the current evidence on systemic pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular or radicular low back pain.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (January 2008 through November 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized trials that reported pain, function, or harms of systemic medications versus placebo or another intervention.

Data Extraction

One investigator abstracted data, and a second verified accuracy; 2 investigators independently assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

The number of trials ranged from 9 (benzodiazepines) to 70 (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). New evidence found that acetaminophen was ineffective for acute low back pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had smaller benefits for chronic low back pain than previously observed, duloxetine was effective for chronic low back pain, and benzodiazepines were ineffective for radiculopathy. For opioids, evidence remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects for chronic low back pain; trials were not designed to assess serious harms. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective for short-term pain relief in acute low back pain but caused sedation. Systemic corticosteroids do not seem to be effective. For effective interventions, pain relief was small to moderate and generally short-term; improvements in function were generally smaller. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of antiseizure medications.

Limitations

Qualitatively synthesized new trials with prior meta-analyses. Only English-language studies were included, many of which had methodological shortcomings. Medications injected for local effects were not addressed.

Conclusion

Several systemic medications for low back pain are associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain. New evidence suggests that acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain, and duloxetine is associated with modest effects for chronic low back pain.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^112E25gN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest NMA to date in the field of low back pain (46 RCTs involving 8765 participants assigned to pharmacological, non-pharmacological or inert treatment). We found that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were more efficacious than inert treatment for reducing pain intensity and disability due to acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP. Overall, the certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, with high certainty of evidence for manual therapy compared with usual care and education.

For reducing pain intensity, the most efficacious interventions at immediate-term follow-up (close to 1 week) were heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise, NSAIDS and opioids, whereas at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month), the most efficacious treatment was manual therapy. For reducing disability, similar findings are found in the subgroup analysis showing that heat wrap, manual therapy, exercise and education for non-pharmacological group and muscle relaxants and NSAIDs for pharmacological group are effective at immediate-term follow-up. Manual therapy confirmed the effects also for decreasing disability at short-term follow-up (closest to 1 month). Limited evidence was found for steroids when compared with NSAIDs (one study) to reduce disability.

The present analysis highlights a potentially minor role for medicines in the management of NS-LBP: initial treatment should be non-pharmacological as confirmed by the SUCRA. However, only a minority of pharmacological interventions are included in the networks. In particular, steroids and opioids are under-represented (only three studies) and their desirable effects should be weighed against side effects. In fact, mild or moderate adverse events were most often recorded for the opioids, the NSAIDs and the steroids arms. This observation is shared by recent systematic reviews that found that at least 50% of people with NS-LBP taking opioids withdrew from the study owing to adverse events or lack of efficacy, with trends noted for higher harm rates and higher percentages of severe harm.

Given that paracetamol offer limited or no benefit, its clinical value might be questionable. This finding is not reflected in all current guidelines, however. A recent Cochrane systematic reviewfound that paracetamol does not result in better outcomes compared to placebo in people with acute low back pain reporting evidence from a large multicentre RCT included in our NMA (1652 randomised people with NS-LBP) that showed no benefit of any dose of paracetamol (until 4000 mg) compared with placebo in people with moderate intensity acute low back pain.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of single-dose IM corticosteroid for radicular low back pain [^112EVSmk]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with radicular low back pain who present to an emergency department (ED) within 1 week of pain onset.

Objective

We hypothesized that a single intramuscular 160 mg dose of methylprednisolone acetate would improve pain and functional outcomes 1 month after ED discharge if the corticosteroid were administered early in disease symptomotology.

Summary Of Background Data

Parenteral corticosteroids are not recommended for acute, radicular low back pain, though their role in this disease process is ill-defined. To date, this medication class has only been studied in a highly selected group of patients requiring hospitalization. METHODS.: Adults between the ages of 21 and 50 who presented to an ED with low back pain and a positive straight leg raise test were enrolled. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity on an 11 point numerical rating scale 1 month after ED visit. Secondary outcomes 1 month after ED discharge included analgesic use, functional disability, and adverse medication effects.

Results

Six hundred thirty-seven patients were approached for participation, 133 were eligible, and 82 were randomized. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The primary outcome, a comparison of the mean improvement in pain intensity, favored methylprednisolone by 1.3 (P = 0.10). Some secondary outcomes favored methylprednisolone, such as use of analgesic medication within the previous 24 hours (22% vs. 43%, 95% CI for difference of 20%: 0%-40%) and functional disability (19% vs. 49%, 95% CI for difference of 29%: 9%-49%). Adverse medication effects 1 week after ED discharge were reported by 32% of methylprednisolone and 24% of placebo patients (95% CI for difference of 9%: -12% to 30%).

Conclusion

This study was a negative study, though there was a suggestion of benefit of methylprednisolone acetate in a population of young adults with acute radicular low back pain. Further work with a larger sample of patients is needed.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for adults with acute non-specific low back pain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114LrdHM]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicialtrialsregister.eu, and World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to 20 February 2022.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Randomised controlled trials of analgesic medicines (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, opioids, anti-convulsant drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, or corticosteroids) compared with another analgesic medicine, placebo, or no treatment. Adults (≥ 18 years) who reported acute non-specific low back pain (for less than six weeks).

Data extraction and synthesis

Primary outcomes were low back pain intensity (0–100 scale) at end of treatment and safety (number of participants who reported any adverse event during treatment). Secondary outcomes were low back specific function, serious adverse events, and discontinuation from treatment. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A random effects network meta-analysis was done and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis method.

Results

98 randomised controlled trials (15 134 participants, 49% women) included 69 different medicines or combinations. Low or very low confidence was noted in evidence for reduced pain intensity after treatment with tolperisone (mean difference −26.1 (95% confidence intervals −34.0 to −18.2)), aceclofenac plus tizanidine (−26.1 (−38.5 to −13.6)), pregabalin (−24.7 (−34.6 to −14.7)), and 14 other medicines compared with placebo. Low or very low confidence was noted for no difference between the effects of several of these medicines. Increased adverse events had moderate to very low confidence with tramadol (risk ratio 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.5)), paracetamol plus sustained release tramadol (2.4 (1.5 to 3.8)), baclofen (2.3 (1.5 to 3.4)), and paracetamol plus tramadol (2.1 (1.3 to 3.4)) compared with placebo. These medicines could increase the risk of adverse events compared with other medicines with moderate to low confidence. Moderate to low confidence was also noted for secondary outcomes and secondary analysis of medicine classes.

Conclusions

The comparative effectiveness and safety of analgesic medicines for acute non-specific low back pain are uncertain. Until higher quality randomised controlled trials of head-to-head comparisons are published, clinicians and patients are recommended to take a cautious approach to manage acute non-specific low back pain with analgesic medicines.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Systemic corticosteroids for radicular and non-radicular low back pain [^115QHnuC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are medications with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. Systemic corticosteroids administered through the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes have been used to treat various types of low back pain, including radicular back pain (not due to spinal stenosis), non-radicular back pain, and spinal stenosis. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid for radicular low back pain, non-radicular low back pain, and symptomatic spinal stenosis in adults.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was September 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials in adults of systematic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The major outcomes were pain, function, need for surgery, serious adverse effect, and presence of hyperglycemia. The minor outcomes were quality of life, successful outcomes, non-serious adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (1047 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain For radicular low back pain, moderate-certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long-term follow-up (MD -7.40, 95% CI -12.55 to -2.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non-radicular low back pain Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non-radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short-term pain or function.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short-term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long-term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non-radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited.

### Oral steroids for acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk: a randomized clinical trial [^113cV1aa]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral steroids are commonly used to treat acute sciatica due to a herniated disk but have not been evaluated in an appropriately powered clinical trial.

Objective

To determine if oral prednisone is more effective than placebo in improving function and pain among patients with acute sciatica.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a large integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Adults (n = 269) with radicular pain for 3 months or less, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 30 or higher (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate greater dysfunction), and a herniated disk confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were eligible.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a tapering 15-day course of oral prednisone (5 days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg; total cumulative dose = 600 mg; n = 181) or matching placebo (n = 88).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was ODI change at 3 weeks; secondary outcomes were ODI change at 1 year, change in lower extremity pain (measured on a 0–10 scale; higher scores indicate more pain), spine surgery, and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (0–100 scale; higher scores better).

Results

Observed baseline and 3-week mean ODI scores were 51.2 and 32.2 for the prednisone group and 51.1 and 37.5 for the placebo group, respectively. The prednisone-treated group showed an adjusted mean 6.4-point (95% CI, 1.9–10.9; p = 0.006) greater improvement in ODI scores at 3 weeks than the placebo group and a mean 7.4-point (95% CI, 2.2–12.5; p = 0.005) greater improvement at 52 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 0.3-point (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.0; p = 0.34) greater reduction in pain at 3 weeks and a mean 0.6-point (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.3; p = 0.15) greater reduction at 52 weeks. The prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 3.3-point (95% CI, 1.3–5.2; p = 0.001) greater improvement in the SF-36 PCS score at 3 weeks, no difference in the SF-36 PCS score at 52 weeks (mean, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.3 to 5.4; p = 0.08), no change in the SF-36 MCS score at 3 weeks (mean, 2.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to 4.8; p = 0.10), and an adjusted 3.6-point (95% CI, 0.6–6.7; p = 0.02) greater improvement in the SF-36 MCS score at 52 weeks. There were no differences in surgery rates at 52-week follow-up. Having 1 or more adverse events at 3-week follow-up was more common in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (49.2% vs 23.9%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk, a short course of oral steroids, compared with placebo, resulted in modestly improved function and no improvement in pain.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^116X2gNp]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Trigger point injections (TPIs) — corticosteroid utility: Corticosteroids in TPIs lack supportive evidence and offer minimal benefit, as stated that "no evidence supports corticosteroid use in TPIs" and that "several studies concluded that corticosteroids have a minimal, if any, benefit on treatment success". The section summary reinforces that "there is no evidence showing benefit, and their use may increase risk of infection in addition to other systemic effects of steroid exposure".

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^1146zDRq]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognize that what may be best for an individual person and justifiable in a clinical trial may not be in the best interest of society, or even for an individual practitioner. For example, interventions that are incredibly costly and time-consuming, but provide only a marginal increase in efficacy may be not be cost-effective on a macrolevel. However, the conduct of early phase clinical trials does not usually reflect clinical practice. Inclusion and exclusion criteria tend to be longer and more rigorous in clinical trials, and the additional costs incurred by being more selective in enrollment and meticulous in performance often pale in comparison to the overall cost of product or drug development.

Patient selection

Similar to all treatments, patient selection for diagnostic facet blocks plays a critical role in determining the likelihood of a positive outcome. There is consensus that failure of at least 3 months of conservative therapy is a reasonable threshold that should be implemented in both clinical trials and practice, although practice guidelines could allow flexibility in cases of extenuating circumstances. The cut-off for clinical trials is similar to what was advocated by an international panel of experts for epidural steroid injection studies, and is predicated on the observation that the natural prognosis is favorable for back pain in individuals with acute pain, even without treatment. There is scant evidence supporting specific physical examination signs or imaging to diagnose facetogenic pain or predict treatment outcomes, so selection should be adapted according to the specific question being addressed.

Patient selection in clinical trials designed to determine efficacy must employ stringent selection criteria to eliminate likely non-responders (eg, individuals with depression, those on high doses of opioids), ensure that participants have the index condition being studied (ie, reduce false-positive rates for MBB), and maximize the chances for technical success even when doing so may not be cost-effective (ie, performing sensory stimulation, creating multiple lesions, utilizing relatively expensive systems that enhance lesion size). However, practitioners on the frontlines treating pain often have different goals. For example, although patients who are depressed and sleep poorly, or are on temporary disability or opioids because of back pain, may not be candidates for a clinical trial aimed at determining efficacy, the upside of treatment in these patients is substantial.

### Injection therapy and denervation procedures for chronic low back pain: a systematic review – clinical value? [^114in86F]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

"Injection therapy and denervation procedures for chronic low back pain: a systematic review" evaluates the effect of two broadly defined treatment options for chronic low back pain. This forms indeed a burden to patients, society and physicians. Lack of knowledge of the causes of chronic pain and poor understanding of patient heterogeneity in pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment response are a major explanation for unsuccessful trials. Clinical research reaches the conclusion that a "mechanism-based" treatment approach in which therapeutic interventions target the specific mechanisms of a patient's pain is recommended.

Low back pain is divided into specific form due to fracture tumor, infection, etc and the aspecific form. We generally differentiate between degenerative diseases of the facet joints or of the intervertebral disc and radicular pain.

The described inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies to be withheld in this systematic review; however, suggest that the research group lacks the input of a clinical experts who can provide information regarding the clinical diagnoses and the potential underlying mechanisms. In contrast, instead of following recent recommendations, pain syndromes with different underlying mechanisms are clearly mixed in the expectation to draw clinically relevant information on a therapeutic intervention. Moreover, also treatments with no indication in a clinical setting are analyzed, which troubles even more the evidence.

Under the heading injection therapy, injections of medication and proteolytic agents are considered and it is for the clinician strange to have epidural and facet joint injections discussed in the same line as local injections in spinal muscles. Moreover, the epidural injections are recommended for the management of subacute low back pain radiating into the leg. This means pain of a duration between 6 weeks and 3 months. Obviously because of the predefined criteria for inclusion of studies on patients with pain of duration of more than 3 months, the authors eliminate the most important trials on this treatment option. Of the three studies that are maintained for further analysis only the trial on targetted steroid placement deals with patients suffering radicular pain. Evidence-based practice guidelines clearly indicate that the only indication for epidural corticosteroid administration is the management of subacute radicular pain. Epidural administration of local anesthetic may be used in surgery and postoperative pain control, but is not recommended for the management of chronic pain, mainly because of the short duration of action of the local anesthetic and the lack of mechanism/cause oriented mode of action.

### Chronic low back pain in adults: evaluation and management [^111izsd2]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.

### Efficacy and safety of steroid use for postoperative pain relief. update and review of the medical literature [^117EsRxU]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of various analgesic regimens, patient surveys have indicated that moderate-to-severe postoperative pain is still poorly managed. The use of corticosteroids for postoperative pain relief, although popular, has yet to gain wider acceptance because of concerns over side effects, in particular adrenal suppression, osteonecrosis, impaired wound-healing, and concerns about efficacy. The medical literature provides evidence that should substantially decrease these concerns with regard to low and short-dose applications. The results of randomized trials have shown low, short-dose corticosteroid regimens to be safe and effective for reducing postoperative pain. There is strong, grade-A evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids in multimodal analgesia protocols to contribute to the postoperative recovery of the patient by minimizing opioid doses and therefore side effects. However, the optimal mode, dose, and timing of administration remain unclear.

### Clinical practice guidelines for pain management in acute musculoskeletal injury [^112hbbFz]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids given orally or IV can decrease the use of opioid analgesics by 50%. Benefits of corticosteroids include a decrease in postoperative nausea, decrease in opioid requirements, decrease in the length of hospital stay, and more complete pain relief. The smallest dose that is effective should be prescribed. Doses ranging from 15 mg of dexamethasone to 0.1 mg/kg have been shown to be effective with no complications.– A meta-analysis of perioperative use corticosteroids concludes that an "intermediate-dose dexamethasone (0.11–0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy after surgical procedures. The preoperative administration of the drug provides a greater effect on postoperative pain". Physicians should consider perioperative dosing of corticosteroids in low-risk patients, especially in patients at risk of dependency.

Managing Acute Pain for Patients on Long-Term Opioids at Presentation

The panel recommends that perioperative analgesia should be managed with a MMA regimen in all opioid-tolerant patients (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
- The panel recommends coordinating with acute pain service (APS) (or addiction medicine or psychiatry depending on resources) when inpatient and the patient's prescriber when outpatient to ensure that there is only 1 prescriber for patients on medication-assisted therapy (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone), patients using illicit opioids, or patients misusing prescription opioids (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Opioid-tolerant patients present a clinical challenge to effective perioperative pain management. These patients have a medical condition and should be treated with the same respect and dignity as a patient with any other presurgical medical condition. Developed nations have observed a large increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients over the last decade. In the United States, a combination of expanding heroin abuse, pain control metrics, and pharmacologic development of long-acting opioids has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of opioid-tolerant patients. Managing perioperative pain in the opioid-tolerant patient is both a medical and a social challenge. Opioid-tolerant patients are at an increased risk of receiving inadequate perioperative analgesia. This risk exists as the result of (1) a social stigmatization of opioid prescription and consumption; (2) concerns for drug-seeking behavioror relapse of recovering addicts, or both; and (3) an incomplete understanding of opioid agonist and opioid replacement therapy pharmacokinetics.

Local anesthetics and steroids in neuraxial blockade — Local anesthetic injection aims to block sensory signals and, while often used diagnostically or for acute pain, when used in chronic pain can provide long-term relief beyond pharmacologic duration due to decreased sensitization and other mechanisms. In practice, steroids are typically combined with local anesthetics to prolong pain relief. The rationale for neuraxial steroids builds on neural blockade benefits that include pain relief lasting hours, days, and sometimes weeks, attributed to postulated effects that alter or interrupt nociceptive input, reflex mechanisms, self-sustaining neuronal activity, and central neuronal patterns.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain: a systematic review [^117QkJFU]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injection of corticosteroids is one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic spinal pain. However, there has been a lack of well-designed randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections. Consequently, debate continues as to the value of epidural steroid injections in managing spinal pain.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of various types of epidural steroid injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), in managing various types of chronic spinal pain (axial and radicular) in the neck and low back regions.

Study Design

A systematic review utilizing the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for evaluation of randomized and non-randomized trials, and criteria of Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group for randomized trials were used.

Methods

Data sources included relevant English literature performed by a librarian experienced in Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), as well as manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles and abstracts from scientific meetings within the last 2 years. Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for the quality of their methods. Subgroup analyses were performed among trials with different control groups, with different techniques of epidural injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), with different injection sites (cervical/thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and with timing of outcome measurement (short- and long-term).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure is pain relief. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, and return to work. Short-term improvement is defined as 6 weeks or less, and long-term relief is defined as 6 weeks or longer.

Results

In managing lumbar radicular pain with interlaminar lumbar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. In managing cervical radiculopathy with cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, the evidence is moderate. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radicular pain is strong for short-term and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections in managing cervical nerve root pain is moderate. The evidence is moderate in managing lumbar radicular pain in post lumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief, in managing chronic pain of lumbar radiculopathy and postlumbar laminectomy syndrome.

Conclusion

There is moderate evidence for interlaminar epidurals in the cervical spine and limited evidence in the lumbar spine for long-term relief. The evidence for cervical and lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term improvement in managing nerve root pain. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections is moderate for long-term relief in managing nerve root pain and chronic low back pain.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114Br2Wg]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) for lumbosacral radicular pain — evidence from systematic reviews indicates variable certainty and outcomes. Benny and Azari examined 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and concluded there was strong evidence for transforaminal injections in the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain for both short-term and long-term relief, and another radiology review concluded there was moderate to strong evidence supporting transforaminal therapeutic epidural injections for lumbar nerve-root compression. Roberts et al concluded there was fair evidence supporting transforaminal epidural injections as superior to placebo for treating radicular symptoms and good evidence that they should be used as a surgery-sparing intervention. Rho and Tang concluded there was strong evidence to support the use of transforaminal injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic in patients with acute to subacute unilateral radicular pain caused by a herniated nucleus pulposus or spinal stenosis, and that a lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection is an effective surgery-sparing procedure that should be a part of conservative care. Quraishi concluded that when appropriately performed, transforaminal epidural steroid injections should result in an improvement in pain, but not disability, and three RCTs followed patients for 3 months with results illustrating no benefit from adding steroids. Manchikanti et al identified 70 studies of which 25 met inclusion criteria, with 15 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies, with 2 duplicate publications and 3 studies failing to meet inclusion criteria; they reported the evidence for lumbar disc herniation is good for transforaminal epidural with local anesthetic and steroids, fair for local anesthetics alone and the ability to prevent surgery, fair for local anesthetic and steroids in spinal stenosis, and poor, inadequate, limited, or unavailable for axial low back pain and post lumbar surgery syndrome. Macvicar et al assessed 39 publications and reported that for disc herniation lumbar transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is not universally effective but benefits a substantial portion of patients and is not a placebo, whereas for other conditions the available evidence was limited and neither compelling nor conclusive. Pinto et al concluded corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, with long-term effects that were positive but smaller and not statistically significant.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^1121cUrZ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Benzodiazepines

Small trials conducted in the 1970s to 1990s report some effect on acute or chronic low back pain (effect size and level of certainty not reported). Other studies indicate that benzodiazepines do not possess meaningful analgesic properties separate from their sedative properties. A 2017 RCT of 114 patients conducted in the US did not find that that adding diazepam to diclofenac in people attending an emergency department improved functional outcomes or pain at one week. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased falls, cognitive impairment, and risk of addiction.

Non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants

This category of medicine is broad and includes a variety of pharmacologically unrelated medications such as cyclobenzaprine, tolperisone, baclofen, and orphenadrine with similar indications. In both acute and chronic low back pain, there is low and very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants might offer small benefits (mean difference −0.8 (−1.2 to −0.3) from 14 RCTs from the US, Finland, UK, Turkey, and India) but increase the risk of harms, primarily sedation.

Oral corticosteroids

Limited evidence suggests they may be not effective for acute or chronic low back pain (mean difference 0.6 (−2.2 to 1.0) from one RCT conducted in the US), and may not cause harm in short courses.

Cannabinoids

A single RCT of oral cannabidiol in 100 patients conducted in Australia found no effect on low back pain compared with placebo (mean difference −0.3 (−1.3 to 0.6)) and no increase in short term harms in a hyperacute, emergency department setting. There are no data for chronic low back pain, and no data on harms associated with long term use in other chronic conditions.

Oral combination medicines

There is low certainty evidence that combining medicines does not produce superior effect sizes and may increase the risk of harms. An example of combination medicines sometimes used to treat low back pain is an opioid plus an NSAID or paracetamol.

Topical preparations

There is some indirect evidence (level of certainty not assessed) that some formulations of NSAIDS and rubefacients may reduce back pain attributed to muscle strains or sprains more than placebo (effect size not reported), which may apply to some cases of acute low back pain, with no increased risk of harms. There are no data on efficacy for chronic low back pain, but indirect evidence from other chronic pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis has shown limited effect.

### Commonly used interventional procedures for non-cancer chronic spine pain: a clinical practice guideline [^11479iko]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness and safety of commonly used interventional procedures (such as spinal injections and ablation procedures) for chronic axial and radicular spine pain that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy?

Current Practice

Chronic spine pain is a common, potentially disabling complaint, for which clinicians often administer interventional procedures. However, clinical practice guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations for their use.

Recommendations

For people living with chronic axial spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: joint radiofrequency ablation with or without joint targeted injection of local anaesthetic plus steroid; epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; joint-targeted injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; and intramuscular injection of local anaesthetic with or without steroids. For people living with chronic radicular spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: dorsal root ganglion radiofrequency with or without epidural injection of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic plus steroids; and epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including four people living with chronic spine pain, 10 clinicians with experience managing chronic spine pain, and eight methodologists, produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provided methodological support. The guideline panel applied an individual patient perspective when formulating recommendations.

The Evidence

These recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials and a systematic review of observational studies, summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of common interventional procedures for axial and radicular, chronic, non-cancer spine pain. Specifically, injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination into the cervical or lumbar facet joint or sacroiliac joint; epidural injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; radiofrequency of dorsal root ganglion; radiofrequency denervation of cervical or lumbar facet joints or the sacroiliac joint; and paravertebral intramuscular injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

Understanding The Recommendations

These recommendations apply to people living with chronic spine pain (≥ 3 months duration) that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy and do not apply to the management of acute spine pain. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future: in particular, whether there are differences in treatment effects based on subtypes of chronic spine pain, establishing the effectiveness of interventional procedures currently supported by low or very low certainty evidence, and effects on poorly reported patient-important outcomes (such as opioid use, return to work, and sleep quality).

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128dqir]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^114Cri3S]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although these studies provide evidence against the use of IA steroids, a small randomized, double-blind study by Ackerman and Ahmadsuggests that individuals with acute, inflammatory pain may benefit from IA steroids. Among 46 patients with clinical symptoms consistent with acute lumbar facet joint pain (mean age 39.3 years, median duration 7.6 weeks) and positive SPECT scans, 61% who received IA facet LA and steroid injections obtained ≥ 50% relief 12 weeks post-treatment vs 26% of those who received therapeutic MBB. Observational studies also suggest intermediate-term relief in individuals with positive SPECT. Two older randomized studies compared MBB with IA injections containing LA and steroid in patients who were not prescreened with facet blocks, finding little difference between groups. Marks et al found only marginally longer relief with IA steroids in 86 patients with axial LBP, with only 7 patients in the IA group and 6 in the MBB group reporting persistent relief at 3 months. In an earlier study by Nash(n = 67), the authors reported that comparable numbers of patients obtained significant relief at 1 month after MBB and IA injections with steroid and LA. In a more recent double-blind randomized study comparing IA and intramuscular steroids in patients with axial LBP who were not prescreened for facetogenic pain (n = 60), Ribeiro et al found that IA steroids were slightly better than intramuscular steroids on some, but not most, outcomes through 6-month follow-up. These studies demonstrating a lack of evidence for IA facet injections in patients with chronic LBP are consistent with evidence-based guidelines, which recommend against the injections. One caveat with placebo-controlled trials that is not commonly appreciated is that the IA injection of saline or LA may itself provide prolonged therapeutic benefit.

### Predictors of opioid prescription among a sample of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia [^115cVHxx]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although multiple non-pharmacologic treatments, such as physiotherapy and acupuncture, are used in the management of musculoskeletal pain, pharmacotherapy (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective COX-2 inhibitors, oral and injectable corticosteroids, and opioids) remains the mainstay of musculoskeletal pain treatment. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed analgesics used in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain. Nearly 90% of patients who visit pain clinics in the United Kingdom are prescribed some forms of opioid analgesics. Although opioids are deemed to be the most effective analgesics in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain, their use is associated with higher risk of abuse, misuse, and serious adverse events. Therefore, the lowest effective dose of opioids should be used for the shortest appropriate period of time whenever needed in the management of musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, it was found that the early use of opioids in the management of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain has been associated poorer clinical outcomes especially in the case of low back pain according to a recently published systematic review of clinical practice guidelines. However, another systematic review and meta-analysis has found that the use of opioids in the management of low back pain is associated with greater pain relief in the short term, but this effect was not observed in the long term.

A number of additional indications were given, including severe joint pain refractory to analgesia (80%, 8/10);, highly inflammatory forms (exhibiting bursitis, severe synovitis, joint swelling or persistently raised inflammatory markers) (30%, 3/10);, disabling arthritis/arthralgia (40%, 4/10), or when NSAIDs are contraindicated (10%, 1/10). Prednisolone was the most commonly recommended (50%, 5/10), but with variations in recommend dosing for adults ranging from 10 mg to 20 mg per day (60%, 3/5) based on clinical judgment, to escalation to 0.5 mg/kg/day (80%, 4/5), for severe cases. Four CMGs (80%, 4/5), provided guidance on the duration, ranging from 5 days (60%, 3/5), to weaning over 10 days to 1–2 months for severe cases (40%, 2/5). Two CMGs (40%, 2/5) recommended that the duration should not exceed one month. Although 80%, (4/5), of CMGs providing corticosteroid guidance, advised on tapering down steroid doses, only one stated the risk of symptom rebound if withdrawn too abruptly. In contrast 43% (12/28), of CMGs advised against steroid use in the acute phase of infection. Only a minority gave justifications for avoidance, stating either a lack of evidence (8%, 1/12), lack of benefit regardless of form of administration (8%, 1/12)or a risk of rebound symptoms (8%, 1/12). One CMG advised use of short-term corticosteroids in the acute phase, for individuals with refractory pain, while also advising against the use in the acute phase.

Facet joint intraarticular corticosteroid injections for low back pain — evidence syntheses report that randomized trials showed no significant advantage over placebo and only moderate evidence overall; specifically, two trials including 210 patients found facet joint injections with corticosteroids were not significantly different from placebo for short-term pain relief and disability. A separate review considered 5 randomized trials and 15 observational studies but concluded none met inclusion criteria with appropriate diagnosis and follow-up. Another analysis using 2 randomized trials and 6 nonrandomized studies showed limited evidence; among the 6 nonrandomized studies meeting inclusion criteria, 5 reported positive results and one negative. A narrative review concluded that intraarticular steroids have no attributable effect for low back pain without a diagnosis of lumbar zygapophysial joint pain and that any benefit is indistinguishable from sham injection. In the only study assessing patients diagnosed with lumbar zygapophysial joint pain, eligibility required at least 50% pain relief with anesthetization of the targeted joint, and the study was judged negative.

Most clinical guidelines do not recommend routine use of epidural steroid injections for the management of chronic low back pain. However, many clinicians do not adhere to these guidelines. This comprehensive evidence overview concluded that off-label epidural steroid injections provide small short-term but not long- term leg-pain relief and improvement in function; injection of steroids is no more effective than injection of local anesthetics alone; post-procedural complications are uncommon, but the risk of contamination and serious infections is very high. The evidence does not support routine use of off-label epidural steroid injections in adults with benign radicular lumbosacral pain.

Abstract

To date, COVID-19 has spread to more than 108 million people globally, with a death toll surpassing 2 1/2 million. With the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two highly effective COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna, we now have a novel approach to contain COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality. Chronic pain care has faced unprecedented challenges for patients and providers in this ever-changing climate. With the approval of COVID-19 vaccines, we now face questions relating to the potential effects of pain treatments utilizing steroids on vaccine efficacy. In this analysis, we address these issues and provide guidance for steroid therapies based on available data and expert recommendations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114eyo8w]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Because of the possibility that benefits of opioid therapy might diminish or that risks might become more prominent over time, clinicians should elicit patients' experiences and preferences and review expected benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients periodically (see Recommendation 7).

Interventional Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain

Office-based interventional approaches, such as arthrocentesis and intra-articular glucocorticoid injection for pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis and subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease, can provide short-term improvement in pain and function to supplement or facilitate exercise, physical therapy, and other conservative approaches. Evidence is insufficient to determine the extent to which repeated glucocorticoid injection increases potential risks such as articular cartilage changes (in osteoarthritis) and sepsis.

Interventional pain management specialists offer additional interventions that can alleviate pain as part of a comprehensive pain management approach for patients with indications including back pain, persistent pain after spinal surgery, neuropathic pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. Certain more common procedures include epidural steroid injections (for lumbar radiculopathy with herniated disc), nerve ablation procedures (e.g. radiofrequency denervation for low back pain), and neurostimulation procedures (e.g. peripheral nerve stimulation and spinal cord stimulation). Descriptions of common interventional procedures are available. Level of evidence for effectiveness and risks varies by procedure, and additional research is needed to establish the clinical benefits as well as risks of specific interventional procedures for specific pain conditions compared with risks of opioid pain medications and other pharmacologic therapies. Rare, serious adverse events have been reported with epidural injection. Interventional procedures should be performed by properly trained clinicians following meticulous infection control protocols. Clinicians can consult with a qualified pain management specialist who is well versed in benefits and risks of diagnostic and therapeutic options to determine potential appropriateness of specific interventional procedures for their patients' indications and clinical circumstances.

### Recommendations and guidance for steroid injection therapy and COVID-19 vaccine administration from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^114meyrM]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary Recommendations

The following are the summary recommendations and guidelines based on the aforementioned data and evidence. We want to acknowledge that the following recommendations are fluid and will be updated based on ongoing data. We would also recommend that physicians determine each individual patient's level of acuity and weigh out specific risks/benefits while applying these broad recommendations set forth.

1) There is no evidence that patients receiving epidural steroid therapy for the management of pain are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 vaccination.

2) There is no evidence that bolus steroids in the epidural space will impact vaccine responsiveness.

3) Neuraxial steroid injections do not need to be deferred when indicated in the context of COVID-19 vaccination.

4) No specific guidance suggests withholding NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatories prior to receiving vaccination.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZDRKK]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Corticosteroids

Three trials in patients with acute sciatica tested the effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo. The individual studies provided imprecise estimates of treatment effect (fig 2). For the immediate term, pooling showed no effect of steroids on leg pain (mean difference −1.8, −11.1 to 7.5; P = 0.71) with a GRADE classification of "moderate quality" of evidence (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3). For the short term, pooling showed a significant effect of steroids on pain (overall and leg pain) (mean difference −12.2, −20.9 to −3.4; P < 0.01) and "moderate quality" of evidence according to the GRADE approach (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3).

Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics

Three trials investigated the efficacy of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics (fig 2). As these were single trials that investigated different classes of drugs or time points of assessment, pooling was not possible. Hence, the quality of evidence for all these medications was considered "low quality" (single studies)or "very low quality" (single study downgraded for limitation of study design)according to the GRADE approach.

Two trials investigated the effect of anticonvulsants in patients with chronic symptoms of sciatica. In one crossover trial, topiramate (50–400 mg/day) showed no better immediate effects than placebo for disability and leg or back pain. In contrast, data from another trialshowed significant overall pain relieving effect with the anticonvulsant gabapentin (900–3600 mg) in the short term (mean difference −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9; P < 0.001) compared with placebo.

One crossover study with four periods investigated the relative efficacy of opioid analgesics (sustained release morphine 15 mg/day), antidepressants (nortriptyline 25 mg/day), and a combination of both and placebo in patients with chronic sciatica. In this trial, antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and a combination of both had no significant effect compared with placebo in the immediate term for disability or leg or back pain.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113do7rm]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain facet joint corticosteroid injection versus saline (Carette et al) — Patients with low back pain for at least 6 months who reported immediate pain relief after a diagnostic injection were randomized to receive 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (n = 49) or isotonic saline (n = 48) under fluoroscopic guidance, with outcomes recorded one, 3 and 6 months after injection. There were no statistically significant differences between groups after one and three months, and although the methylprednisolone group had greater improvements in pain and disability after 6 months, the differences were reduced when concurrent interventions were taken into account; the authors concluded injecting methylprednisolone acetate into the facet joints is of little value, and Level II evidence reported similar pain relief in the steroid and saline groups.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^112qiq8H]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, and four on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest using patient education, different types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. The guidelines recommend against acupuncture, routine use of imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injection, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from international guidelines. The guideline working groups recommend that research efforts in relation to all aspects of management of LBP and LR be intensified.

### Role of epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain: a systematic review of effectiveness and complications [^113vzbrD]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural steroid injections are commonly used for chronic spinal pain. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness, and debate continues as to their value in managing chronic spinal pain.

Objective

To evaluate various types of epidural injections (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal) for managing chronic spinal pain (axial and radicular).

Study Design

A systematic review utilizing the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for evaluation of randomized and non-randomized trials, and criteria of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group for randomized trials.

Methods

Data sources included relevant English literature identified through searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1966 to November 2004), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles and abstracts from scientific meetings within the last 2 years. Three reviewers independently assessed the trials for the quality of their methods. Subgroup analyses were performed for trials with different control groups, with different modes of epidurals (interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal), with different injection sites (cervical/thoracic, lumbar/sacral), and with timing of outcome measurement (short- and long-term).

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief. Other outcome measures were functional improvement, improvement of psychological status, and return to work. Short-term improvement was defined as less than 6 weeks, and long-term improvement was defined as 6 weeks or longer.

Results

For lumbar radicular pain with interlaminar lumbar epidural steroid injections, the level of evidence was strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. For cervical radicular pain with cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, the evidence was moderate. The evidence for lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections for lumbar nerve root pain was strong for short-term and moderate for long term improvement. The evidence for cervical transforaminal epidural steroid injections for cervical nerve root pain was moderate. The evidence was limited for lumbar radicular pain in post lumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. For managing chronic postlumbar laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis the evidence was limited for low back and radicular pain. The evidence was moderate for chronic low back pain.

Conclusion

The evidence for effectiveness of epidural injections in managing chronic spinal pain ranged from limited to strong.

Mechanism of Action of Corticosteroid Injections

Of the pharmacologic treatments available for lower back pain, corticosteroids are commonly recommended to counter inflammatory insults. Corticosteroids are a group of molecules resembling the hormone cortisol that have anti-inflammatory effects, and they can be administered in multiple ways, most commonly orally or through injection. Common corticosteroids used clinically consist of prednisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone, to name a few. Each corticosteroid has different potencies and action duration that should be considered for each patient, depending on the severity of the pathology. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and compression of affected nerves related to lower back pain. At the molecular level, corticosteroids bind to receptors expressed in almost all cell types that act as transcription factors that modulate gene expression, downregulate inflammatory genes, and upregulate anti-inflammatory genes. Some limitations and common adverse events to the use of corticosteroids are hyperglycemia and immune system depression, which would prevent diabetic patients from using these medications and also immunocompromised patients whom would be at an increased risk of infection.

### Oral steroids in initial treatment of acute sciatica [^113RNxTf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Many physicians use prednisone to treat acute sciatica with the hope of speeding recovery. There is little clinical evidence to support this practice. Our objective was to determine whether early administration of oral prednisone affects parameters related to recovery from acute sciatica.

Methods

In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 27 patients were sequentially assigned to receive either a 9-day tapering course of prednisone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 14) within 1 week of developing sciatic symptoms. Patients and investigators were blinded to the drug administered. Follow-up assessment was done weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 5 months.

Results

Prednisone and control groups showed no statistically significant differences in physical findings, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic medications, or rates of patients returning to work at any time interval studied. Compared with controls, patients who received prednisone had more rapid rates of improvement from baseline in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. These changes were subtle but statistically significant. Patients who received prednisone tended to receive fewer epidural injections for pain.

Conclusions

Early administration of oral steroid medication in patients with acute sciatica had no significant effect on most parameters studied. It did, however, lead to slightly more rapid rates of improvement in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. The impact of oral steroids on other outcomes is suggested by this study, but its small sample size limited its statistical power.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^114H8MP2]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For radicular pain, whether from radiculitis or radiculopathy, we only recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as a 6-day methylprednisolone taper) if a patient has incapacitating pain interfering with functioning and/or engaging in physical therapy. For lumbar disc herniation, oral corticosteroids have been shown to offer only modest improvement in function and have not been proven to reduce pain. In older adults, the systemic side effects are often limiting and should not be prescribed without carefully considering the risks and benefits and involving the patient and/or caregiver in the decision-making process.

Another treatment option for patients with incapacitating pain limiting function is fluoroscopically-guided epidural corticosteroid injections. Full discussion of the indications and expected efficacy of these injections is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important to appreciate that these injections must be utilized thoughtfully because in an improperly selected older patient, there is a risk for significant side effects from the procedure itself and from epidural corticosteroid administration, potentially without a high likelihood for clinical improvement. Based on a modified Delphi method, our expert panel believes that best practice is for primary care clinicians who are considering the use of an injection to first refer the patient to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist (such as a physiatrist, anesthesia pain physician, or sports medicine physician), prior to ordering the injection, in order to evaluate for proper patient selection.

Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)

LSS is another common condition in older adults and can cause positional-dependent nerve root irritation due to degenerative changes resulting in narrowing of the spinal canal. The most common presenting symptom of LSS is progressive pain down the leg with continued walking that improves with sitting. In a study by Kalichman et al. up to 20% of 60–69-year-olds had CT-evidence of LSS, and while not everyone with the finding was symptomatic, people with imaging-diagnosed LSS were over three times more likely to have LBP. When symptomatic, 42% of patients with LSS present with lateral thigh pain. The diagnosis of LSS is important to consider when older adults present with lateral hip or thigh pain that improves by functionally increasing the spinal canal area with lumbar flexion. Management of LSS is discussed in Part VI of this series.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111iD1uK]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain represents a major public health problem worldwide,–with chronic pain affecting approximately 27% of the adult population in Europeand more than 100 million adults in the United States. Undertreated acute pain can be associated with an increased risk of deleterious health consequences (eg, delayed wound healing, immune dysfunction, cardiovascular problems related to the stress response, and respiratory problems, such as pneumonia) and the development of chronic pain. In addition, unrelieved chronic severe pain can negatively impact an individual's quality of life, day-to-day functioning, sleep quality, interpersonal relationships, and work productivity, and is associated with a substantial economic burden.

There are two major options for the pharmacological management of pain: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, and opiate/opioid analgesics.NSAIDs, which are among the most widely used medications worldwide, are often preferred because of their low abuse potential, robust efficacy, and long history of clinical use. Guidelines for pain management tend to be specific to medical conditions or settings. Current guidelines for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis generally recommend the use of oral acetaminophen (or topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis) for first-line pain management, with other oral NSAIDs recommended in the first-line or second-line setting depending on the specific guideline; some guidelines also recommend opioids, although typically not as first-line therapy.–It has, however, recently been shown that acetaminophen is not measurably effective in acute low back pain (ie, not more effective than placebo). Other work in patients with osteoarthritis demonstrated that ibuprofen was associated with greater improvements compared with acetaminophen in measures of osteoarthritis pain, function, and quality of life. Acetaminophen and other oral NSAIDs are also recommended for acute pain, such as postoperative pain management.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^113hnj2T]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Steroid mechanisms and evidence limitations in epidural injections — Corticosteroids in neuraxial blockade are postulated to reduce inflammation and have several modes of action including membrane stabilization, inhibition of neural peptide synthesis or action, blockade of phospholipase A2 activity, local anesthetic effect, prolonged suppression of ongoing neuronal discharge, and suppression of dorsal-horn neuron sensitization; they inhibit phospholipase A2 and thereby downstream eicosanoid pathways, and can inhibit ectopic discharges from nerve fibers. Despite extensive use, there is no evidence that steroid injections are disease-modifying agents with a direct effect on pain generation or transmission, except for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and there are no studies demonstrating the anti-inflammatory role of steroids or differentiating inflammatory from noninflammatory radiculopathies. Historically, the first evidence suggesting inflammation in radiculopathy was published in 1981, leading to the classification of 2 categories of radiculopathy, compressive and inflammatory.

Epidural steroid injections — mechanisms, utilization, and experimental effects are outlined: Epidural steroid injections have been widely used in managing lumbar radiculitis, discogenic pain without disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and post surgery syndrome, and the various modes of action of corticosteroids include membrane stabilization, inhibition of neural peptide synthesis or action, blockade of phospholipase A2 activity, prolonged suppression of ongoing neuronal discharge, and suppression of C fiber transmission; in an irritated nerve root model the mechanism of action of epidural steroid injection is inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, a rapid increase in endoneural vascular permeability after epidural application can be partially prevented by pretreatment with high-dose methylprednisolone, and heat hyperalgesia and mechano-allodynia were depressed with the effect remaining during the 11-day test period; recent literature shows no significant difference in outcomes with medial branch blocks and epidural injections with the various or without steroids, and epidural TNF-α inhibitory injections have been utilized to treat lumbar radiculitis rather than epidural steroid injections.

### Randomized trial of epidural injections for spinal stenosis published in the new england journal of medicine: further confusion without clarification [^116z3bzi]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials are considered the hallmark of evidence-based medicine. This conveys the idea that up-to-date evidence applied consistently in clinical practice, in combination with clinicians' individual expertise and patients own preference/expectations are enjoined to achieve the best possible outcome. Since its inception in 1990s, evidence-based medicine has evolved in conjunction with numerous changes in the healthcare environment. However, the benefits of evidence-based medicine have not materialized for spinal pain including surgical interventions. Consequently, the debate continues on the efficacy and medical necessity of multiple interventions provided in managing spinal pain. Friedly et al published a randomized controlled trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis in the July 2014 edition of the highly prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. This was accompanied by an editorial from Andersson. This manuscript provided significant sensationalism for the media and confusion for the spine community. This randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis and accompanying editorial concluded that epidural injections of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine offered minimal or no short-term benefit as compared with epidural injections of lidocaine alone, with the editorial emphasizing proceeding directly to surgical intervention. In addition media statements by the authors also emphasized the idea that exercise or surgery might be better options for patients suffereing from narrowing of the spinal canal. The interventional pain management community believes that there are severe limitations to this study, manuscript, and accompanying editorial. The design, inclusion criteria, outcomes assessment, analysis of data and interpretation, and conclusions of this trial point to the fact that this highly sophisticated and much publicized randomized trial may not be appropriate and lead to misinformation. The design of the trial was inappropriate with failure to include existing randomized trials, with inclusion criteria that did not incorporate conservative management, or caudal epidural injections. Simultaneously, acute pain patients were included, multilevel stenosis and various other factors were not identified. The interventions included lumbar interlaminar and transforaminal epidural injections with highly variable volumes of medication being injected per patient. Outcomes assessment was not optimal with assessment of the patients at 3 and 6 weeks for a procedure which provides on average 3 weeks of relief and utilizing an instrument which is more appropriately utilized in acute and subacute low back pain. Analysis of the data was hampered by inadequate subgroup analysis leading to inappropriate interpretation. Based on the available data epidural local anesthetic with steroids was clearly superior at 3 weeks and potentially at 6 weeks. Further, both treatments were effective considering the baseline to 3 week and 6 week assessment, appropriate subgroup analysis seems to have yielded significant superiority for interlaminar epidural injections compared to transforaminal epidural injections with local anesthetic with or without steroids specifically with proportion of patients achieving greater than 50% improvement at 3 and 6 week levels. This critical assessment shows that this study suffers from a challenging design, was premised on the exclusion of available high-quality literature, and had inadequate duration of follow-up for an interventional technique with poor assessment criteria and reporting. Finally the analysis and interpretation of data has led to inaccurate and inappropriate conclusions which we do not believe is based on scientific evidence.

Current Treatments and Limitations

Lower back pain can have three sources. The first source is axial lumbosacral pain, which arises from the lumbar (L1–5), sacral (S1), and sacrococcygeal junction vertebral regions. The second, radicular pain originates from a dorsal root ganglion irritation and then travels down an extremity following dermatome innervation. The third is referred pain, which is pain that travels to a region distant from the source, it does not follow dermatome innervation. Lower back pain being the leading contributor to disability and workdays lost, many treatments have been established.

In an acute setting, treatments for lower back pain include pharmacological and nonpharmacological options. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are considered the best treatment in an acute setting. Topical patches and creams can also provide some amelioration to the pain. Heat and cold therapy can alleviate symptoms of facet joints syndrome because they increase blood circulation by dilating vessels and relaxing muscles or constricting vessels to reduce inflammation, respectively. Under the guidance of a physical therapist, physical therapy and exercise can also aid in lowering back pain by speeding the healing process. By having good posture and knowing how to stretch the lower extremities, abdomen, and back muscles, a patient can speed the healing process. Another option in an acute setting is a mechanical back brace. By using a brace, it forces the vertebral column to remain upright in orthostasis and orthopneic positions while limiting torsion, bending, and any other movements that may contribute to the pain.

In a chronic setting, the treatment of lower back pain requires more potent pharmacotherapeutics. If pain is severe and unresponsive to conservative medications, patients are prescribed opioids. Opioids are highly addictive and should be given in a time-limited course with constant monitoring of the patient to assess the efficacy of the treatment; they should not be given to patients at risk for addiction or abnormal behavior. For short-term treatment of back pain. An epidural steroid facet injection can also be given to a patient; it is a useful tool to diagnose and treat a patient with facet joint syndrome; the injection typically includes an anesthetic or an anesthetic with a combination of steroids. Another type of injection is a medical branch injection; it is applied near branch nerves and reduces nerve fiber permeability, blood flow to nerves, and pain signals from the nerve to the brain.

Therapeutic lumbar transforaminal epidural injections — among randomized active-controlled trials, 3 of 4 trials (with 46, 17, and 57 patients receiving local anesthetic with steroids) showed positive results for short-term relief, with one trial showing long-term positive results; one randomized trial with 23 patients had negative results for steroids. Among non-randomized studies, 4 showed positive short-term improvement and one showed negative short-term results; for long-term improvement, only one RCT showed positive results, while one randomized and one non-randomized study showed negative results, and some studies did not have results available.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^116CPVsy]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Analgesics have limited effect on low back pain and some, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, have substantial risks
Oral and, less certainly, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have small benefits that may not be outweighed by risks (particularly gastrointestinal) for short term use for low back pain
Acute low back pain typically improves within a few weeks without treatment; for chronic low back pain, the focus of management should be on non-pharmacological treatments to improve function and address the broader determinates of pain

Low back pain is the world's leading cause of disability. At any time, half a billion (9%) adults are affected. Many are prescribed, or use, analgesics for pain relief. In this article, we review what is known about common analgesics for treating non-specific low back pain (defined as pain without an identifiable structural or disease cause). We focus on adults aged 18–60 years. A previous BMJ education paper describes the management of low back pain in people aged 60 and over, in whom the likelihood of there being a specific cause is greater and the risk-benefit balance of analgesics differs. The treatment of radicular low back pain (such as sciatica) has been detailed elsewhereand is not addressed here.
