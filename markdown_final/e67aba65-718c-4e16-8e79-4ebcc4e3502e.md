## Question

Rebound inflammation after stopping steroid eye drops

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rebound inflammation after stopping steroid eye drops, including its definition, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, prevention, and management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how rebound inflammation is defined and distinguished from persistent inflammation. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological basis and why tapering matters. Next, I will examine risk factors and clinical presentations. After that, I need to outline prevention strategies, including tapering principles and alternatives to drops. Finally, I will detail management if rebound occurs and close with a concise clinical takeaway, ensuring each point is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Rebound inflammation is when ocular inflammation initially resolves on steroids but recurs after discontinuation, whereas persistent inflammation never fully resolves in the expected timeframe. This distinction is important for counseling and follow-up planning after cataract surgery and other ocular procedures [^114uyCP2].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology. Abrupt steroid withdrawal can unmask a pro-inflammatory milieu because corticosteroids suppress cytokine signaling and leukocyte trafficking. When steroids are stopped too quickly, the inflammatory cascade can reactivate, leading to recurrence of anterior chamber cell and flare or cystoid macular edema, which is why tapering is emphasized in guidelines and labeling for ocular steroids [^116madJW] [^116R6fh2] [^114uyCP2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who is at risk; I should review the evidence for risk factors. Patients with prior uveitis, herpetic eye disease, retained lens material, or subacute infections like Propionibacterium acnes are at higher risk of persistent or rebound inflammation after cataract surgery, and diabetic patients and those needing pupil expansion devices also have increased risk of postoperative inflammation and CME, which correlates with rebound risk when steroids are withdrawn too quickly [^114uyCP2]. I should also consider that steroid responders may have IOP spikes that complicate tapering, and that poor adherence or rapid tapering increases rebound risk, as suggested by comparative studies of topical drops versus sustained-release steroid delivery systems [^116jqboZ] [^115mi55B] [^111qwN9H].

> Next, I should review how rebound presents clinically. Let me verify the typical timeline and signs: rebound often manifests within days to weeks after steroid cessation with increased conjunctival injection, photophobia, anterior chamber cell and flare, and sometimes pain. In post-cataract patients, recurrence of inflammation or CME after an initial response is a classic pattern, and breakthrough inflammation has been reported with both topical and insert-based regimens, underscoring the need for close monitoring during taper or after discontinuation [^114uyCP2] [^112Titdv] [^116BQk9C].

> I will now examine prevention, starting with tapering principles. Wait, let me verify the labeling language: multiple steroid labels caution against premature discontinuation and recommend gradual reduction in frequency as inflammation subsides, which aligns with ophthalmic practice patterns for postoperative care and chronic anterior uveitis management. For example, fluorometholone and prednisolone acetate labels explicitly advise tapering rather than abrupt cessation, and the cataract PPP notes that slower tapers can prevent reappearance of inflammation or CME after stopping drops [^117CpZba] [^116R6fh2] [^114uyCP2]. I should double-check that taper schedules are individualized to disease severity and duration of therapy, with longer, slower tapers for chronic or recurrent inflammation, consistent with uveitis care principles [^111xu8Md].

> Let me consider alternatives that mitigate rebound by design. Sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone inserts provide a self-tapering, preservative-free delivery over about 30 days, which can reduce rebound risk compared with patient-dependent topical tapers; studies and reviews suggest comparable or acceptable rates of breakthrough inflammation with the insert, and the self-tapering pharmacokinetics may lessen abrupt-withdrawal flares, though clinicians should still monitor for breakthrough and counsel on signs to report [^115mi55B] [^111qwN9H] [^113UFXp6]. But wait, what if the insert underdelivers early? Some analyses note early postoperative anterior chamber cell in a subset, prompting consideration of adjunct topical therapy in higher-risk eyes or when early inflammation is present, which I should keep in mind when planning prophylaxis [^112gLPqU].

> Next, I should review NSAID strategies as steroid-sparing options. NSAIDs can reduce reliance on steroids and may lower rebound risk when used appropriately; for example, after laser peripheral iridotomy, nepafenac was noninferior to prednisolone for inflammation control and had fewer cases of rebound iritis, and NSAIDs are commonly paired with steroids post-cataract to target prostaglandin-mediated inflammation and reduce CME risk, which indirectly lessens the impetus for prolonged steroid exposure and abrupt withdrawal [^114prrKH] [^114TvhuX]. Hold on, I should verify that NSAIDs are not a universal substitute; in significant anterior uveitis, steroids remain essential, so NSAIDs are best viewed as adjuncts or partial substitutes in selected contexts rather than blanket replacements [^111xu8Md].

> If rebound occurs, I need to ensure management is prompt and evidence-aligned. Let me first confirm the basics: restart anti-inflammatory therapy, typically topical corticosteroids, and then taper more slowly once control is re-established. In post-cataract settings, reinstituting drops and extending the taper duration reduces recurrence, and in traumatic iritis, guidelines endorse steroids with a deliberate taper alongside cycloplegia, reinforcing the principle of gradual dose reduction rather than abrupt cessation [^114uyCP2] [^112bcwij]. I should double-check IOP if restarting steroids, especially in known responders, and consider switching to lower-penetration or shorter-half-life agents like loteprednol or fluorometholone if steroid-induced hypertension is a concern, balancing potency against IOP risk during the taper [^116jqboZ] [^114Q7nSc].

> But wait, what if the rebound is actually persistent inflammation from an occult driver? I need to check for retained lens material, malpositioned IOL, or low-grade infection such as Propionibacterium acnes, because these can masquerade as rebound and will not resolve without addressing the underlying cause. Gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy, or endoscopy may be required to identify culprits in the angle or ciliary sulcus, and targeted management of the precipitant is essential before finalizing steroid withdrawal [^114uyCP2].

> I should confirm that patient education and follow-up are integral to prevention and early detection. Counseling on expected inflammatory trajectory, warning signs of recurrence, and strict adherence to the taper schedule reduces rebound events; scheduling checkpoints during the taper to reassess anterior chamber cell, IOP, and symptoms allows timely adjustment, and in higher-risk patients, closer surveillance or more aggressive prophylaxis is reasonable, consistent with post-cataract and uveitis care pathways [^112Titdv] [^114uyCP2] [^111xu8Md].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical takeaway to ensure internal consistency. Rebound inflammation is an iatrogenic phenomenon driven by abrupt steroid withdrawal in an eye with ongoing or easily reactivated inflammatory potential; preventing it hinges on individualized, gradual tapers aligned to disease activity, consideration of sustained-release steroid delivery to bypass adherence pitfalls, judicious NSAID use to reduce steroid burden, and vigilant follow-up to catch and treat recurrence early, with a low threshold to investigate alternative causes if inflammation persists despite appropriate tapering [^114uyCP2] [^115mi55B] [^114prrKH] [^112Titdv].

Rebound inflammation after stopping steroid eye drops is a **recurrence or worsening of ocular inflammation** when corticosteroids are withdrawn too quickly or after prolonged use. It is driven by **withdrawal of steroid suppression** and **reactivation of the inflammatory cascade**, with risk rising with longer steroid courses, higher potency agents, and abrupt cessation [^114uyCP2] [^111HAhU7]. Clinically, it presents with **redness, pain, photophobia, blurred vision, and increased anterior chamber cells/flare**, and can lead to cystoid macular edema or corneal complications if untreated [^114uyCP2]. Prevention requires **slow, individualized tapering** and close monitoring; management involves reinstating or increasing steroids and tapering more gradually, with NSAIDs or steroid-sparing agents as adjuncts when needed [^114uyCP2] [^115yBqSg].

---

## Pathophysiology

Rebound inflammation reflects **loss of steroid suppression** and a **pro-inflammatory rebound** when corticosteroids are withdrawn. Key mechanisms include:

- **Withdrawal of steroid suppression**: Steroids suppress cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and prostaglandins; stopping them removes this brake, allowing inflammation to flare [^114uyCP2].

- **Reactivation of inflammatory pathways**: The complement cascade, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes can reactivate, amplifying inflammation [^116madJW].

- **Immune system overshoot**: Chronic steroid use can blunt endogenous anti-inflammatory signals; withdrawal leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response [^114prrKH].

---

## Clinical presentation

Rebound inflammation typically presents within **days to weeks** after stopping steroids and may include:

- **Redness and irritation**: Conjunctival injection and ocular discomfort [^112Titdv].

- **Pain and photophobia**: Anterior chamber inflammation (cells/flare) and corneal involvement [^112bcwij].

- **Blurred vision**: From corneal edema, anterior uveitis, or cystoid macular edema [^115e6e5f].

- **Increased intraocular pressure**: Steroid response or secondary glaucoma [^116jqboZ].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **rebound inflammation**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Duration of steroid use | Longer courses (> 2–4 weeks) increase risk [^notfound] |
| Potency of steroid | High-potency agents (e.g. prednisolone acetate 1%) have higher risk [^notfound] |
| Abrupt cessation | Rapid taper or sudden stop increases risk [^115mi55B] |
| Underlying ocular conditions | Uveitis, keratitis, or chronic inflammatory diseases [^111HAhU7] |
| Patient-specific factors | Steroid responders, glaucoma, or ocular hypertension [^notfound] |

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing rebound inflammation centers on **careful tapering** and **patient education**:

- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce frequency/dose slowly over weeks to months, tailored to disease severity and duration [^114uyCP2].

- **Monitoring**: Regular IOP checks and slit-lamp exams during taper to detect early rebound [^111w32WZ].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence to the taper and report symptoms promptly [^112Titdv].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider NSAIDs or steroid-sparing agents (e.g. methotrexate, mycophenolate) in chronic or recurrent disease [^115yBqSg].

---

## Management of rebound inflammation

When rebound occurs, **management includes**:

- **Reinstitute or increase steroids**: Restart or escalate to control inflammation, then taper more slowly [^114uyCP2].

- **Alternative therapies**: Use NSAIDs, steroid-sparing immunosuppressants, or sustained-release steroid implants (e.g. dexamethasone intracanalicular insert) [^115mi55B].

- **Address underlying causes**: Treat infections, control systemic disease, or modify surgical plans as needed [^116CYtZF].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated rebound inflammation can cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Corneal complications**: Edema, scarring, or ulceration [^115e6e5f].

- **Glaucoma**: Steroid-induced IOP elevation or optic nerve damage [^116jqboZ].

- **Vision loss**: From persistent inflammation, CME, or retinal involvement [^115zuQSY].

---

Rebound inflammation after stopping steroid eye drops is a predictable, preventable, and treatable phenomenon. It reflects the **loss of steroid suppression** and **reactivation of inflammatory pathways**. Prevention relies on **gradual tapering** and close monitoring, while management centers on reinstating steroids and tapering more slowly, with adjunctive therapies as needed.

Both groups additionally received the same corticosteroid regimen. Previous studies have indicated more intensive treatment for early-phase VKH disease. In this stratified randomized trial, initial doses of prednisone were 30–40 mg per day (0.6–0.8 mg per kilogram per day) in early-phase VKH disease, and 20–30 mg per day (0.4–0.6 mg per kilogram per day) in late-phase disease. Such doses were used for 1–2 weeks and then decreased by 5 mg every 1–2 weeks, with a goal of tapering and holding at 15 mg per day over the remission induction period.

Topical corticosteroid drops combined with cycloplegic and mydriatic agents were used and adjusted according to the condition of anterior segment inflammation. Topical corticosteroids were tapered to discontinuation over four weeks after the anterior segment inflammation subsided. Prohibited therapies included glucocorticosteroid implant, periocular and intravitreal injections.

### Efficacy and safety of an extemporaneous preparation of 2% ganciclovir eye drops in CMV anterior uveitis [^113USscY]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of an extemporaneous preparation of 2% ganciclovir topical eye drops in cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis because many studies have confirmed the benefits of topical ganciclovir in varying concentrations.

Design

The study employed a retrospective cohort design.

Methods

This study enrolled 11 eyes (11 patients) with CMV anterior uveitis. All cases were proved by positive PCR for CMV DNA from aqueous tapping and received topical 2% ganciclovir, applied every 2 hours daily as induction therapy then tapered off and stopped based on clinical response. Outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity, anterior chamber cell, coin-shaped and other keratic precipitates, intraocular pressure (IOP), the number of antiglaucoma drugs used, the frequency of steroid eye drops used daily and side effects over a 12-month follow-up period. Side effects after applying topical 2% ganciclovir were recorded using questionnaires and eye examination.

Results

Mean age was 49.0 ± 17.8 years. IOP, number of antiglaucoma drugs used and keratic precipitates decreased significantly at first week (p < 0.013, p < 0.024 and p < 0.031, respectively) followed by decreased anterior chamber cells and significantly reduced frequency of applying steroid eye drops at 4 weeks (p < 0.034 and p < 0.017, respectively). Visual acuity significantly improved at 5 months continuously. All clinical improvement was maintained to 12 months, and keratic precipitates were eliminated in 90% of all cases. However, in 27% of discontinued medicine cases, inflammation was recurrent. No significance was observed in all factors between recurrent and non-recurrent groups. The most common side effect was eye irritation (27.27%). No severe complications from the medicine was detected.

Conclusion

Extemporaneous preparation topical 2% ganciclovir was effective and safely controlled CMV anterior uveitis. The medication is non-invasive, economical and convenient for hospitals where commercial topical ganciclovir is unavailable.

### Intracameral dexamethasone injection in the treatment of cataract surgery induced inflammation: design, development, and place in therapy [^116XdHug]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide, with nearly 20 million cases annually. Appropriate prophylaxis after cataract surgery can contribute to a safe and quick visual recovery with high patient satisfaction. Despite being the current standard of care, the use of multiple postoperative eye drops can create a significant burden on these patients, contributing to documented and significant non-adherence to the postoperative regimen. Over the past 25 years, there have been a few studies analyzing the use of intracameral dexamethasone (DXM) in controlling inflammation following cataract surgery. This review explores various drug delivery approaches for managing intraocular inflammation after cataract surgery, documenting the strengths and weaknesses of these options and examining the role of intracameral DXM (among these other strategies) in controlling postoperative intraocular inflammation. Intracameral DXM has a particular advantage over topical steroids in possibly decreasing postoperative inflammatory symptoms and objective anterior cell and flare scores. Compared to topical steroids, there may be a slightly less theoretical risk of significant intraocular pressure spikes and systemic absorption. In addition, surveys indicate patients prefer an intraoperative intracameral injection over a self-administered postoperative eye drop regimen. However, there are several adverse effects associated with intracameral DXM delivery that are not seen with the noninvasive topical approach. Although it is unlikely that intracameral DXM will replace topical medications as the standard management for postoperative inflammation, it is seemingly another safe and effective strategy for controlling postoperative inflammation after routine cataract surgery.

### A randomized, controlled, prospective study of the effectiveness and safety of an intracanalicular dexamethasone ophthalmic insert (0.4 Mg) for the treatment of post-operative inflammation in patients undergoing refractive lens exchange (RLE) [^117H8D3R]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

During the study, no evidence of cystoid macular edema was noted via optical coherence tomography at 4–8 weeks post-op. Two subjects did post-operatively manifest an IOP ≥ 10 mmHg from the baseline. The two cases were in different patients and one occurred in a control eye, while the other was in a study eye. In both cases, the subject was started on anti-ocular hypertensive therapy to help lower their IOP. Following rescue therapy, both subjects demonstrated an IOP within the safety limits and were able to stop drop therapy and maintain a normal IOP. In addition, no rebound inflammation was present for any patients in either the control or study eye at 4–8-week post-operation. Furthermore, no patients had an average corneal staining at the 4–8-week post-operation of greater than 1 in either eye. Finally, there was no visually significant Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) in either group that required YAG laser capsulotomy.

### Lifitegrast add-on treatment for dupilumab-induced ocular surface disease (DIOSD): a novel case report [^112eUFKc]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the authors has observed several (> 5) patients with DIOSD. All were referred to ophthalmology and treated with cyclosporine eyedrops, low-to-medium potency steroid eyedrops, or both. In all patients, there was partial improvement with steroids with return to baseline severity when steroids were discontinued and cyclosporine drops were continued, as initially happened in this patient. In contrast, there was rapid, dramatic, sustained improvement of the conjunctivitis in this patient after the addition of the lifitegrast drops.

Hyperosmolarity of the tear film is a recognized and validated marker of dry eye. Hyperosmolarity of the tear film occurs through decreased flow of the bulk aqueous component of the tear film from the lacrimal gland or through increased evaporation and instability of the tear film. Increased osmolarity of the tear film stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines, enhances the rate of cell apoptosis, and results in a decrease in the number of goblet cells. In this patient, the osmolarity was elevated at baseline and improved with treatment with steroid and cyclosporine drops, but this improvement in osmolarity did not correlate with clinical symptoms, showing that the inflammatory reaction in this patient was not purely a result of dry eye.

Lifitegrast is FDA approved for the treatment of chronic dry eye. It binds to lymphocyte function–associated antigen-1 on white blood cells, blocking the interaction of lymphocyte function–associated antigen-1 with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on vascular endothelial cells and thereby preventing white blood cells from trafficking out of the vascular space and into tissue. Unlike steroid drops, it is considered safe for long-term use, largely based on the results of a 1-year long-term extension trial.

Cyclosporine eye drops are also approved for chronic dry eye, but have a different mechanism of action. There are no published comparative trials between cyclosporine and lifitegrast for dry eye, nor are there published reports of the use of cyclosporine drops or lifitegrast drops for the treatment of DIOSD, although in one of the author's experience cyclosporine eye drops have not been effective. Cyclosporine and lifitegrast may be used together for the treatment of dry eye disease. These 2 agents, lifitegrast drops and cyclosporine drops, are considered relatively safe for long-term use with proper monitoring. Steroid drops have numerous potential side effects, but as with topical steroids on the skin, although long-term use is avoided if possible, they can be used safely long term in many patients with close ophthalmologic monitoring.

### Noninfectious outcomes of intravitreal antibiotic steroid injection and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs versus triple drop therapy after cataract surgery [^1114Pp2L]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare noninfectious outcomes of intravitreal antibiotic steroid (IVAS) injection (moxifloxacin-triamcinolone) and postoperative topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with a standard 3-drop therapy (TDT) regimen (topical antibiotic, steroid, and NSAID) in patients after cataract surgery.

Design

Retrospective comparative clinical cohort study.

Methods

In 3 study centers in the United States, a total of 2143 eyes (N = 2143 patients) underwent cataract surgery with IVAS-NSAID or TDT between 2017 and 2022. Preoperative data were included, including patients' age, iris color, medical history, and ocular history. Postoperative data, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and the need for IOP-lowering medications, were recorded at 1-week, 1-month, and 6-month time points. The primary outcome measures were postoperative complications, defined as persistent anterior chamber inflammation, persistent corneal edema (PCE), rebound inflammation, and cystoid macular edema, were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

There were 1079 eyes in the IVAS-NSAID group and 1064 eyes in the TDT group. Best-corrected visual acuity and IOP were similar between IVAS-NSAID and TDT eyes at all time points. A portion (11.6%) of TDT eyes experienced postoperative complications compared with 6.5% in IVAS-NSAID eyes (P < .001). Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was associated with increased rates of PCE in IVAS-NSAID eyes, and eyes with dark irides had a higher incidence of cystoid macular edema, PCE, and rebound inflammation in the IVAS-NSAID group.

Conclusion

The IVAS-NSAID regimen overall had similar postoperative outcomes and fewer complications compared with the TDT regimen. IVAS-NSAID may be considered a safe alternative to topical regimens in non-femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and patients with light irides.

### Long-term topical steroid treatment improves graft survival following normal-risk penetrating keratoplasty [^112NXS9x]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the impact of duration of topical steroid treatment on the incidence of endothelial graft rejection after normal-risk penetrating keratoplasty (PK).

Design

Prospective, institutional, longitudinal, randomized interventional trial including 406 eyes (age 52 ± 19 years; follow-up 42 ± 18 months).

Methods

Postoperative treatment started with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops five times daily and was tapered over the first six months. Patients were then randomized into either short-term (stop topical steroid treatment) or long-term treatment (continue steroids once daily for 12 months).

Results

During follow-up, 29 eyes (7.1%) developed an episode of endothelial graft rejection. Graft rejections were significantly more common in the short-term (19 of 202; 9.1%) compared with the long-term treatment group (10 of 204: 4.9%; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose topical steroid treatment protects against immunologic graft rejections.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^114fzSst]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Intraocular pressure and inflammation management in corneal edema — pressure lowering, avoidance of pro‑inflammatory or endothelial pump–inhibiting agents, and cautious steroid use are emphasized. Lowering the IOP may be helpful when it is elevated or at the upper end of the normal range; prostaglandin analogues have a potentially inflammatory character and should be avoided in patients for whom inflammation is a possible contributing factor; when endothelial dysfunction is a possible contributing factor, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should not be used because of the potential for interference with the endothelial pump; and when inflammation is present, it should be controlled by adding a topical corticosteroid once possible infection has been ruled out or controlled, with follow-up needed to rule out steroid responsiveness and elevated IOP from steroid use.

### Effect of corticosteroid-sparing treatment with mycophenolate mofetil vs methotrexate on inflammation in patients with uveitis: a randomized clinical trial [^115yBqSg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil are commonly used immunomodulatory therapies for achieving corticosteroid-sparing control of noninfectious uveitis, but there is uncertainty about which drug is more effective.

Objective

To compare the effect of methotrexate and mycophenolate for achieving corticosteroid-sparing control of noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The First-line Antimetabolites as Steroid-sparing Treatment (FAST) uveitis trial screened 265 adults with noninfectious uveitis requiring corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy from 9 referral eye centers in India, the United States, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico between August 22, 2013, and August 16, 2017. Follow-up ended on August 20, 2018.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive oral methotrexate, 25 mg weekly (n = 107), or oral mycophenolate mofetil, 3 g daily (n = 109).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was treatment success at 6 months, which was defined as having control of inflammation in both eyes, no more than 7.5 mg prednisone daily and less than or equal to 2 drops of prednisolone acetate 1%, and no treatment failure due to safety or intolerability. Patients underwent follow-up to 12 months while receiving the same treatment or switched to the other antimetabolite, depending on their 6-month outcome.

Results

Among 216 patients who were randomized (median age, 38 years; 135 (62.5%) women), 194 (89.8%) completed follow-up through 6 months. Treatment success occurred in 64 (66.7%) patients in the methotrexate group vs 56 (57.1%) in the mycophenolate group (difference, 9.5% [95% CI, -5.3% to 21.8%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.50 [95% CI, 0.81 to 2.81]; p = 0.20). Among patients with posterior uveitis or panuveitis, treatment success was achieved in 58 (74.4%) in the methotrexate group vs 42 (55.3%) in the mycophenolate group (difference, 19.1% [95% CI, 3.6% to 30.6%]; OR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.16 to 4.90]; p = 0.02); whereas among patients with intermediate uveitis treatment success occurred in 6 (33.3%) in the methotrexate group vs 14 (63.6%) in the mycophenolate group (difference, -30.3% [95% CI, -51.6% to 1.1%]; OR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.08 to 1.05]; p = 0.07; P for interaction = .004). Elevated liver enzymes were the most common nonserious laboratory adverse event, occurring in 14 patients (13.0%) in the methotrexate group and 8 patients (7.4%) in the mycophenolate group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with noninfectious uveitis, the use of mycophenolate mofetil compared with methotrexate as first-line corticosteroid-sparing treatment did not result in superior control of inflammation. Further research is needed to determine if either drug is more effective based on the anatomical subtype of uveitis.

### Long-term efficacy and tolerability of TNF α inhibitors in the treatment of non-infectious ocular inflammation: an 8-year prospective surveillance study [^115M93BM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of anti-TNFα therapy: remission and relapse

Thirty-nine patients (91%) achieved sustained remission (0.5 PPY) at a median time of 1.2 years from starting TNFi (figure 2). Twenty-two (51%) of the cohort had a relapse (0.2 PPY) at 2.9 years (median) (range 0.9–7.2 years) from commencing a TNFi (index). In five patients (12%) a second relapse occurred at 6.6 years (range 2.9–9.2 years) from index. No patient had more than two relapses. Six out of nine (67%) patients who started on adalimumab achieved sustained remission; all six later experienced a relapse (median 2.0 years from index; IQR: 1.6). Thirty-three of the 34 (97%) patients receiving infliximab achieved sustained remission. Relapse occurred in 18 patients (53%) (median 3.4 years from index; IQR: 2.7). Twenty-six patients received a steroid rescue treatment during follow-up (high-dose oral prednisolone [n = 21, intravenous methylprednisolone n = 11, intravitreal triamcinolone n = 7], periocular steroid injection n = 5). The rate of steroid rescue prior to commencing biologic therapy was 0.8 PPY for 33 of 43 patients in whom these data were available; the introduction of TNFi was associated with a reduction in steroid rescue (0.1 PPY; n = 43) to census or cessation of the TNFi.

### Fluorometholone (fluorometholone ophthalmic suspension) [^117CpZba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Shake well before using. Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac two to four times daily. During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosing frequency may be increased to one application every four hours. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely.

If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosing of fluorometholone ophthalmic suspension may be reduced, but care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. In chronic conditions, withdrawal of treatment should be carried out by gradually decreasing the frequency of applications.

### Retrospective study of a sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for treatment of ocular inflammation after cataract and corneal surgery [^115mi55B]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Topical administration of corticosteroids over a post-operative recovery period is the standard method for steroid delivery post cataract or corneal surgery, however long-term topical steroid use is not without its shortcomings. Topical steroids can reduce the immunological competence of the eye, as well as inhibit the corneal absorption of topical antibiotics, which can lead to opportunistic bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Topical steroids have also been found to potentially delay corneal epithelial healing, particularly in the setting of a neurotrophic cornea. In addition, rebound ocular inflammation is always a risk following abrupt discontinuation or rapid tapering of topical steroids. The drawbacks of topical steroids extend beyond the realm of the eyeball itself; complex drop regimens give rise to increased costs and inconveniences to patients, leading to a reduction in patient drop compliance. The department of ophthalmology at McGill University found that 92.6% of the patients in their study showed an improper drop administration technique following cataract surgery. This included patients instilling an incorrect number of drops, missing their eye with the drops, contaminating the bottle tip, or failing to wash their hands before administering the drops.

To help relieve patients of the burdens associated with the aforementioned corticosteroid delivery systems, we explored a sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert (Dextenza, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.), which is placed in the punctum of the eye lid, and is designed to deliver preservative free dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to thirty days. Dextenza has been shown to safely decrease ocular inflammation and pain post operatively, and could provide a more consistent, reliable method for corticosteroid delivery to ocular structures. This strategy could simplify the complex drop regimens, potentially improving patient compliance, increasing both patient comfort and safety following surgery. Many surgeons may not feel comfortable abandoning the anti-inflammatory topical drop regimens without a safe and effective alternative. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Dextenza as a corticosteroid delivery mechanism in combination with a shortened topical drop regimen following cataract or corneal surgery.

### PREDNISOLONE ACETATE ophthalmic suspension, USP… [^112p6tYV]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1% is indicated for the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe. Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1% is contraindicated in acute untreated purulent ocular infections, in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure should be checked frequently. Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning.

Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye. Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended. As fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate.

Advise patients that if eye inflammation or pain persists longer than 48 hours or becomes aggravated, they should consult a physician. Adverse reactions include elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing. The development of secondary ocular infection has occurred. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion should be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.

### Current aspects on the management of viral uveitis in immunocompetent individuals [^111HAhU7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus

The treatment of HSV keratitis has been well studied, but these studies were not powered to evaluate the role of acyclovir (ACV) in the treatment of anterior uveitis. However, the data suggest that the duration of anterior uveitis may be shortened by the prompt use of therapeutic doses of antiviral therapy and that maintenance therapy may be effective in decreasing disease recurrence. Most cases of HSV anterior uveitis are controlled with topical corticosteroids to reduce the anterior segment inflammation, cycloplegics such as cyclopentolate 1% bid to reduce pain and prevent posterior synechiae, and oral ACV 400 mg five times daily in ~4 weeks. In severe or recurrent disease, maintenance therapy of ACV 400 mg bid is effective in preventing relapse. Alternatively, valacyclovir (Val), which is a prodrug with improved bioavailability, may be used at a dose of 500 mg three times a day (tds) for treatment and 500 mg bid for maintenance. Systemic antiviral therapy should be combined with low-dose corticosteroid drops for years, if not for life, to prevent relapse. In eyes with raised IOP, antiglaucoma medications are given topically such as timolol maleate 0.5%. Eyes with severe elevation of IOP require oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and filtration surgery may be indicated in medically uncontrolled glaucoma with optic neuropathy.

When preparing the eye for surgery, such as cataract removal, the eye should be quiescent and prophylactic oral antiviral and topical corticosteroids may be beneficial.

Varicella-zoster virus

When treating acute VZV infection, ACV 800 mg five times daily for 10 days given within 72 hours of onset of skin lesions reduces incidence and severity of episcleritis, dendritiform keratopathy, stromal keratitis, and anterior uveitis. However, the duration of treatment for chronic VZV anterior uveitis should be for at least 4 weeks or longer, especially if the patient is immunocompromised. The maintenance dose of ACV 400 mg tds may be beneficial to prevent relapse. Alternatively, Val 1 g tds or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily may be used. Topical steroids given to control the inflammation must be tapered very slowly to avoid rebound inflammation.

### Short-term therapeutic effects of topical corticosteroids on refractory dry eye disease: clinical usefulness of matrix metalloproteinase 9 testing as a response prediction marker [^111FVcXC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface, characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film that is accompanied by ocular symptoms.DED is frequently associated with the instability and hyperosmolarity of tear films, inflammation of the ocular surface, and neurosensory abnormalities.DED is one of the most prevalent ocular diseases worldwide, and significantly reduces the quality of life.

The inflammation of the ocular surface is a key component of the pathophysiology of DED. Owing to the role of inflammation in DED, numerous novel therapeutic agents have been investigated for inhibiting various inflammatory cascades. To date, the most well-known anti-inflammatory agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of DED include cyclosporin A (CsA), lifitegrast (LG), corticosteroid.corticosteroids are widely used for the treatment of both acute and chronic inflammation, and topical corticosteroids are generally indicated for the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases.corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, stabilize macrophages and neutrophils, and repress the key enzymes involved in the initiation or maintenance of the inflammatory response. Therefore, corticosteroids are generally thought to be more potent than other therapeutic agents for DED, including CsA, LG, and diquafosol, owing to acting on the multiple mechanisms by which corticosteroids inhibit inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are also effective in controlling the signs and symptoms of chronic, severe DED associated with the Sjogren syndrome, and in the treatment of moderate and severe meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Additionally, short-term induction therapy before long-term treatment with CsA, or combined therapy with corticosteroids and CsA, shows greater symptomatic relief and faster recovery from the signs of DED, compared to monotherapy with CsA.

Recommendation

Autologous or allogeneic serum eye drops may be offered to individuals with ongoing symptoms despite maximal management with conventional eye drops (1, A) (SOA 91.9%).

Note that in the UK serum eye drops are only available via specialized centres in line with published NHS policy.

Topical steroid eye drops

A Cochrane review of topical CS for dry-eye disease identified 22 RCTs (4169 participants) conducted worldwide. Overall, they found a small to moderate improvement in patient reported symptoms as compared with lubricants alone; a small to moderate improvement in corneal staining score; a slight increase in TBUT but no change in tear osmolality. They concluded that for dry eye requiring anti-inflammatory control, topical steroids provided a small to moderate degree of symptom relief beyond lubricants.

A review of 16 studies looking at loteprednol etabonate (LE) steroid eye drops (14 prospective, 2 retrospective) found that treatment with LE reduced signs of inflammation without clinically significant intra-ocular pressure elevation. Additionally, pre-treatment with LE reduced stinging upon subsequent ciclosporin instillation.

A randomized clinical trial of topical fluorometholone 0.1% eyedrops vs ciclosporin 0.05% eye drops in 40 individuals with SD-associated dry eye found that both treatments reduced corneal fluorescein staining, patient-reported OSDI and increased conjunctival goblet cell density after 8 weeks of therapy. Onset of action was faster in the fluorometholone group with benefit at 4 weeks but no significant difference between the groups at 8 weeks.

Recommendation

Topical steroid eye drops, under ophthalmic supervision, may be offered short term to individuals with ongoing persistent inflammation despite maximal management with conventional eye drops (1, A) (SOA 94.9%).

### Dry eye: why artificial tears are not always the answer [^112S7j3S]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammation

Inflammation can be both a cause and result of tear film instability. Increased osmolarity can induce ocular surface inflammation, and the inflammatory cytokines can subsequently lead to a decrease in goblet cells and disrupt the corneal barrier. In order to stop this inflammatory cycle, inflammation must be targeted. As mentioned above, some ATs have been found to decrease ocular surface inflammation; however, some individuals with DED may require stronger anti-inflammatory treatment such as with short-term corticosteroids, tetracyclines, CsA or lifitegrast.

Both corticosteroids and tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline) have been found to decrease inflammatory markers in DED. One study randomly assigned 32 patients with moderate-to-severe ADDE to topical AT alone (Refresh, four times a day), AT (4–8 times a day) plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drops (NSAID, Ocufen, four times a day) or AT (4–8 times a day) plus topical corticosteroid drops (fluorometholone, four times a day) for 30 days. The ADDE was defined by the presence of symptoms, Schirmer ≤ 7 mm and corneal punctate fluorescein score of ≥ 1. After 30 days of treatment, individuals who received AT+steroid had significantly lower symptom severity scores than the other two groups. They also had significantly lower rose bengal staining, whereas there were no significant differences between day 0 and 30 for the AT alone group or AT+NSAID group. Lastly, the AT+steroid group demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of HLA-DR on conjunctival cells (14→10%, p = 0.04), whereas the other groups did not have a significant decrease in HLA-DR expression. These data highlight that corticosteroids reduce ocular surface inflammation to a greater degree than a combination of NSAIDs and AT or AT alone in individuals with ADDE.

### Intraocular pressure changes following topical ocular hypotensive medications washout [^116uZFoz]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To review the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) following topical hypotensive medications washout in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), ocular hypertension (OHT) and uveitic glaucoma (UG)/OHT.

Methods

The study included 120 patients with POAG, OHT and UG recruited from prospective clinical trials between February 2013 and July 2017. We excluded 20 eyes with IOP of ≤ 21mm Hg, 11 eyes with previous incisional surgery and 17 eyes with incomplete data. UG eyes with active inflammation and on steroid treatment were excluded. Participants underwent a 1-month washout period from topical ocular hypotensive medications before IOP phasing. Comparisons were made between pre/post-washout IOP, and highest-recorded (peak) and post-washout IOP.

Results

A total of 110 eyes with POAG, 33 eyes with OHT and 43 eyes with UG were included for analysis. The mean pre-washout IOP was 18.1 ± 3.3mm Hg in POAG, 18.8 ± 3.3mm Hg in OHT and 17.9 ± 8.8mm Hg in UG; the mean post-washout IOP was 26.6 ± 4.8mm Hg, 26.4 ± 3.9mm Hg, 23.1 ± 10.1mm Hg in POAG, OHT and UG, respectively. The mean increase in IOP after washout was significantly lower in UG compared with POAG and OHT eyes (p = 0.01). The percentage of eyes with post-washout IOP < 22mm Hg was 12.7% in POAG, 6.1% in OHT and 51.2% in UG.

Conclusion

Active inflammation and steroid treatment contributes to elevated IOP in uveitis. Therefore, IOP may revert to normal once inflammation subsides. We recommend ocular hypotensive treatment washout to be considered in UG eyes that have IOP under control in the absence of recurrence of uveitis.

Review

Topical and subconjunctival therapy for ocular inflammatory disease

Topical corticosteroids have provided the mainstay of treatment for anterior uveitis since the 1950s, but do not penetrate far enough into the eye to control intermediate or posterior disease. Their side-effects include cataract formation and raised intraocular pressure, in common with all corticosteroids, and are related to the strength of the corticosteroid and ocular penetration.

Corticosteroids

Dexamethasone sodium 0.1% and prednisolone acetate 1% are widely used and are broadly equivalent; difluprednate 0.05% has recently been introduced to the US and is considered more potent. Rimexolone is a topical corticosteroid that was specifically engineered to generate less of an intraocular pressure rise by the elimination of a hydroxyl group. Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) suggest that it probably does induce less of a rise in intraocular pressure than either dexamethasone sodium 0.1% or prednisolone acetate 1% (the differences did not reach statistical significance), but it is a weaker corticosteroid that is most useful in controlling chronic anterior uveitis in patients with established glaucoma or who are corticosteroid responders. Similarly, loteprednol etabonate 0.5% is associated with less of an intraocular pressure rise than prednisolone acetate 1%, but also has a reduced ability to control anterior chamber inflammation.

Subconjunctival corticosteroids in the form of dexamethasone or betamethasone may also be useful in the short-term treatment of severe anterior uveitis, and triamcinolone has recently been shown to be effective in the management of anterior scleritis without inducing necrotising disease, having a longer duration of effect than dexamethasone and betamethasone.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Cyclooxygenase is a critical enzyme in the inflammatory process and catalyzes the biosynthesis of prostaglandins that disrupt the blood-ocular barrier, increase vasodilation, and facilitate leukocyte migration. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potent inhibitors of cyclooxygenase enzymes and can be administered topically for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and macular oedema, either with or without concurrent corticosteroid administration.

Other agents

There are no other topical anti-inflammatory agents in widespread use for the treatment of uveitis. Topical Cyclosporine A was examined in several studies from the 1980s, but was shown to be ineffective in human disease. A study of the subconjunctival administration of sirolimus for intermediate or posterior uveitis was recently reported in which it was found to be safe and well tolerated (see Section "Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α agents" below); the results of a Phase 3 trial are awaited.

### Corneal thickness and anterior chamber flare after cataract surgery: a randomized controlled trial comparing five regimens for anti-inflammatory prophylaxis [^114TvhuX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Post-operative inflammation is controlled by prescription of anti-inflammatory eye drops, either steroids or NSAID or a combination of the two. We found that post-operative CCT was comparable between groups at all time points except for a thinner CCT three days after surgery in group C compared to group A. Our findings are supported by two studies that compared the effect of steroid-NSAID combination treatment and NSAID monotherapy on post-operative CCT. These findings suggest that NSAID monotherapy is as effective as steroid and NSAID combination therapy in the prophylaxis of post-operative corneal thickening.

An oft-cited concern for preferring steroids to NSAIDs in post-operative anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is the rare occurrence of corneal melts associated with topical application of NSAID eye drops. Two randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of NSAID eye drops found no cases of corneal melts, although these have been observed in a number of case reports. The prevalence of corneal melts associated with NSAID eye drops is reputedly very low, plausibly making the absence of observations in clinical trials a question of sample size. In our study, although we only examined the CCT, we did not find that NSAID eye drops caused a corneal thinning effect compared to drop-less surgery (group E) or that the number of daily eye drops had an effect on CCT when the direct effect of inflammation was accounted for. In other words, we found no indication of an increased prevalence of corneal thinning among participants treated with NSAID eye drops compared to participants receiving drop-less surgery. While our findings do not negate the perceived rare risk of corneal melts, they do substantiate that more often than not NSAID eye drop application is not associated with corneal thinning: fear of post-operative corneal thinning should therefore not be used as an argument against the use of NSAID monotherapy post-operatively.

Discussion

Although there is some literature reporting the efficacy of IVTA in the treatment of uveitic cataract, there have been no previous controlled trial comparisons. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate visual outcomes and postoperative complications after phacoemulsification combined with IVTA injection for uveitic cataract in the real world.

The lower age limit of 18 years was adopted to exclude juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, because IOL implantation in these cases may lead to more severe postoperative inflammation than other patients, in addition comprehensive treatment was applied into the postoperative management. We reviewed characteristics of 99 patients of uveitis complicated with cataract who underwent cataract surgery alone, and the mean age of which was older, and quiescent time of ocular inflammation was longer than that of IVTA group. PSM has been increasingly used as a statistical tool in observational studies. Clinical and demographic patient characteristics can be balanced between groups. Potential confounding factors of this study, including age, gender, type of uveitis, duration of active inflammation, unilateral or bilateral sequential surgery and quiescent time of ocular inflammation were well-adjusted to mimic randomised controlled trial design. Patients in the IVTA group was well-matched after PSM, and the potential component of senile cataract was reduced.

In order to compare the visual outcome between two groups without regard to fundus disease, BCVA was analysed in anterior uveitis patients and panuveitis patients respectively. The BCVA improved significantly after phacoemulsification in the anterior uveitis patients, with 89.3% of patients in the IVTA group achieving 0.3 LogMAR or better visual acuity at 3 months. These results are comparable to those in previous studies showing visual acuity outcome better than 0.3 LogMAR in 67–82% cases. In panuveitis patients, postoperative BCVA mildly improved in two groups, and sequelae of chronic posterior inflammation was found to be the most important factor for determining the improvement of visual acuity. The trend of postoperative BCVA improvement indicated that the application of TA resulted in early recovery in patients, which can also be appreciated on Kaplan-Meier curve. As tapering and withdrawal of corticosteroids were individually prescribed according to following examinations, short time of corticosteroids administration indicated rapid recovery. The intravitreal injection of TA inhibited the potential complications and rebound of inflammation during the postoperative visits, so patients in the IVTA group recovered quickly in the IVTA group as compared to the control group.

### A very early steroid responder after cataract surgery: a case report [^114mHzBC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

On the second postoperative day, I diagnosed the elevated IOP as a side effect of steroids and took early steps to lower the IOP by discontinuing steroid eye drops, but on reflection it must be noted that glaucomatous visual field defects with optic disc haemorrhage were observed one week postoperatively. However, it is not possible to determine whether the papillary haemorrhage and visual field defects were due to glaucoma or decompressive retinopathy since peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer analysis with optical coherence tomography was not performed at the time of visual field examination. On the other hand, patients at risk of elevated IOP may be allowed to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug eye drops alone to calm postoperative inflammation as many uneventful cataract surgeries can be controlled by this treatment alone.

In this case, although I present some evidence that the IOP was not elevated due to retained OVD, this may be difficult to fully exclude, because the small pupil would make the risk of retained OVD more likely. Additionally, because of PXF, a compromised trabecular meshwork is likely. Steroids increase IOP by depositing extracellular matrix in the trabecular meshwork. Therefore, it is possible that steroid, OVD, and exfoliative debris retention were imbalanced, thus leading to an increased IOP. If a flare metre had been in place at the clinic, a more detailed analysis might have been possible.

This case report indicates that elevated IOP can occur even immediately after the initiation of treatment with steroid eye drops.

### Safety and efficacy of topical vs intracanalicular corticosteroids for the prevention of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery [^117V1aUZ]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

One hundred twenty-six of 131 eyes in each group presented for final follow-up. There were 2 cases of IOP elevation greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg in the drops group and 1 in the insert group. There was no difference in the mean change in IOP compared with baseline between groups (Table 3). Nine eyes (6.9%) in the drops group and 12 eyes (9.2%) in the insert group experienced breakthrough inflammation (P = 0.50). Among patients who received drops and experienced breakthrough inflammation, 4 admitted to poor compliance. In 1 additional case, the patient expressed extreme anxiety about touching her eyes, and the physician questioned the efficacy of drop administration. This patient experienced increasing photosensitivity and inflammation in the first week after surgery and eventually received a tap and inject to empirically cover for endophthalmitis. The culture was positive for Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation slowly improved over the ensuing month. Of the 12 eyes in the insert group that experienced breakthrough inflammation, the insert could not be visualized in 2 cases. Twelve eyes (9.2%) in the drops group and 8 eyes (6.1%) in the insert group developed clinically significant CME (P = 0.35). There were no significant differences in pain, conjunctival injection, or anterior chamber reaction between the groups. Table 3 shows more detailed analysis comparing groups at the final visit. There were no cases of other severe adverse events such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage or retinal detachment in either group. There was also no statistically significant difference in breakthrough inflammation (P = 0.38), mean change in IOP (P = 0.93), CME (P = 0.39), pain (P = 0.37), conjunctival injection (P > .99), or anterior chamber cell (P = 0.91) between groups after eyes with diabetic retinopathy were excluded in subgroup analysis.

Table 3.
Final postoperative visit

Among all eyes included in the study, patient demographics, diagnosis of systemic medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and autoimmune disease, and diagnosis of other ocular conditions were not significantly associated with breakthrough inflammation (Table 4). Change in IOP, anterior chamber cell, and presence of conjunctival injection and pain at week 1 were significantly associated with breakthrough inflammation. Analysis of any factors associated with IOP elevation was deferred because of the very low incidence of this event in both study groups.

### Prescription patterns in DMEK: European survey [^111ntVPV]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Steroids were typically tapered to once daily over more than 6 months postoperatively (46%) and continued for at least 1 year after DMEK (90%). The optimal dosing and tapering regimen remains unclear. Some recommend using topical steroid for 1 year after DMEK, while others suggest extending treatment for up to 2 years or even indefinitely. –, A prospective study reported a 6% rejection rate after stopping steroids at 1 year, with most cases being reversible. However, patient involvement in the decision to stop steroids, introduced biased, and treatment background during the first year was heterogeneous.

There was no consensus on defining or managing high-risk DMEK. About 15% of surgeons considered DMEK to be intrinsically low risk for rejection, regardless of risk factors. However, limited research indicates higher rejection rates in DMEK for eyes with corneal neovascularization (4%) and repeat transplantation (7% to 28%), as well as higher graft failure rates in eyes with herpetic eye disease (18%).– High-risk DMEK was managed with additional immunosuppressive therapy, either topical (30%) or systemic (24%). Topical agents were mainly cyclosporine (85%) and tacrolimus (19%), while systemic therapy commonly involved mycophenolate (44%). However, studies show no advantage in adding topical cyclosporine, whereas topical tacrolimus and systemic mycophenolate have been proven to be effective. Other valid options are systemic prednisolone (39%) and systemic tacrolimus (6%), although these were less often reported.HLA matching was mainly practiced in the Netherlands, with 1 report in the United Kingdom. However, this practice is no longer used in the United Kingdom according to expert opinion.

### Sympathetic ophthalmia: where Do we currently stand on treatment strategies? [^117CRPch]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Immunomodulators

Earlier indications of immunomodulators in SO included the cases where there is a contraindication for steroid use, the occurrence of significant steroid-induced side effects, flare-ups on tapering or stopping of steroid therapy, or cases who do not respond adequately to steroid therapy. A large multicenter retrospective case series noted that 70.7% of 130 SO patients needed immunosuppressive therapy.

However, many authors recommend that SO is one of the few indications in which early initiation of immunomodulators should be considered. This would enable achieving an adequate effect of immunomodulators before the steroids are tapered to low levels. Owing to the significant toxicities of these agents, close monitoring is necessary preferably in consultation with a rheumatologist or internist.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^112GfQHg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are well known for their potent anti-inflammatory effects and have been used to treat uveitis since 1950. Their anti-inflammatory mechanism is complex, and only partly understood:key components appear to include: direct binding of the glucocorticoid/receptor complex to genes involved in the inflammatory cascade; indirect effects on other transcription factors such as activating protein-1 or nuclear factor-kappa B; inhibitory effects on many inflammation-associated molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and adhesion molecules; and upregulation of many anti-inflammatory mediators.

Whilst this diverse mechanism of action drives an excellent anti-inflammatory response, it also causes significant unwanted side effects. Ocular side effects (more common with topical or local administration) include accelerated cataract formation and increase in intraocular pressure. Systemic side effects (more common with systemic administration) include hypertension, diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, and disorders of sleep, mood, and appetite.

Corticosteroids continue to have a vital role in terms of "rescue" therapy, but their use as a maintenance therapy is limited by their associated side effects. The American Uveitis Society expert consensus recommendations suggest a maintenance dose of no more than 10 mg oral prednisolone equivalent per day, and this is broadly in line with guidelines from other inflammatory diseases. However, in a survey study among physicians who manage patients with uveitis, it was learned that such guidelines are not always followed.

There is thus a desire to develop treatments with similar anti-inflammatory effects to corticosteroids, but with fewer side effects; this concept of "steroid-sparing agents" describes any anti-inflammatory medication/IMT agent which may be used in place of corticosteroids, or which may allow reduction of corticosteroid dose and attenuation of steroid-induced side effects.

### Incidence and risk factors of ocular hypertension / glaucoma after descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty [^116MUPaR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results agreed with Ozeki et alfinding that combined surgery was not associated with OHT after DSAEK, although there was a significant difference between pseudophakic and phakic eyes in IOP elevation after DSAEK (p = 0.024). On the other hand, another significant risk factor in this study was preoperative IOP > 16mmHg (p = 0.003), which had 5.27 times risk of developing OHT after DSAEK. With respect to the time of onset of OHT after DSAEK, we found the average time period of postoperative 6.5 months, comparable to reported literature.

There are a few proposed causes of increased IOP after DSAEK, including the use of topical steroids, retained viscoelastics, inflammation, peripheral anterior synechiae, iatrogenic damage to trabecular meshwork and distortion of the angle. These causes are responsible for IOP elevation at different postoperative time periods; and this study excluded any cases with immediate postoperative IOP elevation, such as pupillary block glaucoma after DSAEK.

In steroid-induced OHT, Francois reported the time of onset was dependent on the potency of corticosteroid drops. We found that all eyes with steroid-induced IOP elevation were on the highest potency of steroid drop, Dexamethasone 0.1%, and the earliest onset of IOP elevation was seen within a week. Steroid-induced IOP elevation could normally be controlled by tapering steroids, changing steroids or glaucoma medication, where all steroid-induced OHT eyes were controlled medically on average of 6.5 months in our work.

Recent studies reported that Loteprednol is less likely to cause IOP elevation than Prednisolone acetate in steroid responders.

The management of steroid-induced OHT can be complicated; it is vital to achieve a balance treatment between inflammation and the use of steroid drops in steroid responders, as inflammation itself is also a risk factor for corneal graft failure. There is some evidence which shows that the cessation of steroid drops will help return IOP to normal or baseline level within four weeks' time. Loteprednol have been used as an alternative rather than tapering steroid to manage IOP elevation in steroid responders. It has also been suggested that Loteprednol possesses adequate anti-inflammatory effects when it is used as a second-line therapy for prophylaxis of graft rejection. However, the long-term effects of Loteprednol still remain unknown.

### Risk factors and clinical signs of severekeratitis [^1153AZcK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Severe cases tended to use betamethasone eye drops, and mild cases tended to use fluorometholone eye drops before diagnosis, but there was no significant difference. Betamethasone use may have triggered a bad prognosis. On the contrary, strong inflammation in the severe group may have prompted the physician to prescribe betamethasone eye drops. Because there was no delay in diagnosis of the severe group, we believe that strong inflammation was the reason for betamethasone use.

Keratoprecipitates were found in all severe group eyes and one eye of the mild group (P = 0.01). Keratoprecipitates are signs of deep infiltration of Acanthamoeba associated with inflammation in the anterior chamber. Keratoprecipitates may be associated with the use of betamethasone in the severe group because of strong inflammation. The reasons for deep amoeba infiltration may be due to: 1) immune suppression by using steroid eye drops; 2) patients with comorbidities such as age, diabetes, and mixed infection. We examined the relationship of keratoprecipitates presentation and steroid eye drop use. Two eyes in the severe group and one eye in the mild group showed keratoprecipitates 3–21 days after stopping steroid eye drops. This is most likely due to the fact that steroid eye drops masked keratoprecipitates appearance or suppressed immune reaction. Interestingly, another two eyes in severe group had keratoprecipitates regardless of using steroid eye drops (betamethasone: one eye, fluorometholone: one eye). The presence of keratoprecipitates while using steroid eye drops may be a sign of very severe Acanthamoeba infection.

The resistant bacteria in case S-2 may have been a nutrient source for Acanthamoeba. Acanthamoeba may proliferate by consuming bacteria. In this case, coinfection of bacteria may have been one reason of the severity of AK. This particular case in the severe group was interesting because the presence of bacteria in AK was reported to be a requirement for the development of AK.

### Treating chronic noninfectious posterior segment uveitis: the impact of cumulative damage. proceedings of an expert panel roundtable discussion [^115zuQSY]. Retina (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic noninfectious posterior segment uveitis refers to inflammation of the retina, choroid, vitreous, or optic nerve, and may result in permanent vision loss. The inflammation can be constant, or characterized by periodic exacerbations on an underlying baseline of inflammation. Recent studies indicate that this vision loss often results from cumulative damage over multiple recurrences of inflammation, rather than from a single initiating event. Most forms of local therapy provide only transient suppression of inflammation, and the use of systemic agents may be limited by serious side effects. The course of uveitis may, therefore, be marked by recurrent episodes of inflammation, each contributing to progressive and permanent loss of visual acuity. The goal of uveitis treatment should not only be to suppress inflammation when it recurs but also to attain complete remission of inflammation, and thus prevent complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and permanent cumulative damage. The RETISERT intravitreal implant offers sustained local control of inflammation without the systemic side effects that limit standard immunosuppressive and oral corticosteroid therapies. The recommendation of the expert panel was that RETISERT is a useful addition to the armamentarium for the treatment of chronic noninfectious posterior segment uveitis and may help to prevent cumulative damage from repeated occurrences of inflammation, especially when vision can be improved rather than only stabilized.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1116ruNn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Uveitis or iritis with ICPI therapy — grade-based management is as follows: For G1 anterior uveitis with trace cells, Continue ICPI, Prompt referral to ophthalmology (usually within 1 week), and Artificial tears. For G2 anterior uveitis with 1+ or 2+ cells, Hold ICPI temporarily until after ophthalmology consult and obtain Urgent ophthalmology referral; start Topical corticosteroids (eg, 1% prednisolone acetate suspension), cycloplegic agents (eg, atropine), and systemic corticosteroids; May resume ICPI treatment once off systemic steroids if patient has only ocular irAE, once corticosteroids are reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalent; Continued topical or ocular steroids are permitted when resuming therapy to manage and minimize local toxicity; and Retreat after return to ≤ G1. For G3 anterior uveitis with 3+ or greater cells; intermediate posterior or pan-uveitis, Permanently discontinue ICPI with Urgent ophthalmology referral and Systemic corticosteroids and intravitreal or periocular/ or topical corticosteroids; Methotrexate may be used in patients who respond poorly to systemic corticosteroids or those with severe sight-threatening inflammation. For G4, defined as Best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the affected eye, Permanently discontinue ICPI, obtain Emergent ophthalmology referral, and give Systemic corticosteroids — prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 0.8–1.6 mg/kg/d and intravitreal or periocular or topical corticosteroids per ophthalmologist opinion. Additional considerations: Consider use of infliximab, other TNFα blockers, or IVIG in cases that are severe and refractory to standard treatment.

### Systemic therapies for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future [^117Unbf5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

These are exciting times with an ever-expanding range of immunosuppressants on the FDA-approved list. But the question remains: how much progress have we actually made? Put another way, when faced with a patient with sight-threatening inflammatory eye disease, do we actually know which drug to use?

Most of the immunosuppressants used in ocular inflammatory disease were originally developed for use in transplant medicine, rheumatic disease or other systemic inflammatory diseases. Very few have high level evidence for their use in ocular inflammation, and almost all are used off-label. A recent study which surveyed uveitis experts' approach to a number of clinical scenarios, found that whilst there was a general consensus on the overall approach to immunosuppression (i.e. starting with corticosteroids first line, and subsequent initiation of a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant) there was considerable variation in which second line agent to use and at what dose. This is perhaps unsurprising since the study also reported that these experts suggested the evidence underlying their decisions was either absent or relatively weak (evidence levels III or IV based on the evidential hierarchy described by the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research), and that in most cases personal experience was a key factor in their decision-making. In this regard we should not under-estimate recent progress which has seen an increasing number of prospective studies on standard and novel therapies, and larger standardized retrospective studies. A balanced approach is needed. Our current shortage of large-scale randomized controlled trials should not lead to us ignore the evidence that is already available for therapeutic efficacy and safety. Conversely we must recognize the 'evidence-gap' that remains and identify strategies that will enable us to bridge it.

There are a number of reasons we lag behind other specialties, notably our small target population, heterogeneous disease groups, poorly defined phenotypes, uncertain pathogenesis, diagnostic inconsistency, subjective outcome measures, visual acuity issues, and until recently little commercial interest and a non-trial culture. These are some of the factors that need to be addressed if we are to conduct the trials and build the evidence base which will enable us to make informed therapeutic decisions in the future.

### Intracanalicular dexamethasone insert or topical prednisolone following iStent and hydrus surgery for glaucoma [^111qwN9H]. Journal of Glaucoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study did not include MIGS which promote increased aqueous outflow through the excision of tissue-like gonioscopy assisted transluminal trabeculotomy, OMNI surgical system (Sight Sciences Inc. Menlo Park, CA) or Kahook Dual Blade goniotomy (New World Medical, Rancho Cucamonga, CA), which can be associated with hyphema and increased postoperative inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine the utility of the dexamethasone insert in comparison with topical prednisolone for postoperative inflammation control in these patients.

There was a statistically significant difference in postoperative inflammation on postoperative day 1 with the dexamethasone insert group having less inflammation (Table 3). We believe these findings are a result of the immediate and constant delivery of corticosteroids to the ocular surface with the dexamethasone insert in contrast to topical prednisolone where only 1–2 drops may be instilled before the postoperative visit on day 1. Compared with topical corticosteroid use, the sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert has a number of key similarities and differences. Most obviously, corticosteroids delivered to the ocular surface, whether topically or via insert form, work to rapidly control inflammation and ocular pain. In the event of an adverse reaction, both treatment modalities are reversible; topical drop administration might be stopped while the insert can be removed from the canaliculus. However, key differences in the dexamethasone insert include the self-tapering nature of the insert, the constant low-dose drug load on the ocular surface, the absence of preservatives, improved bioavailability, and most importantly, the elimination of the risk for poor patient compliance. With a self-tapered sustained drug release, the treatment burden of a complex postoperative regimen of topical eye drops on cataract surgery with MIGS patients is alleviated, and the potential risk for ocular rebound inflammation with improper (ie, too rapid) corticosteroid tapering is mitigated. In addition, the insert provides a fraction of the total dose of corticosteroid given via a typical monthly taper of corticosteroids, but there is still sufficient therapy to control inflammation due to the proximity of the insert to the ocular surface. This allows the insert to control postoperative inflammation while also decreasing the risk of unintended side effects like increased IOP. The intracanalicular insert is formulated preservative-free, eliminating the risk for preservative-induced toxicity and ocular surface damage.

Traumatic iritis — acute inflammation of the anterior uveal tract that can occur after trauma — is diagnosed in the wilderness from a history of pain and photophobia that is often consensual; management notes that this condition is often self-limited, and topical steroids (such as prednisolone acetate 1%, 1 drop every 2 hours while awake for the first week and then tapered slowly) as well as NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours) can reduce inflammation, while cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours) can make the patient more comfortable until the inflammation is resolved, and evacuation should commence in a nonemergent manner if treatment is not available; recommendation grades are: NSAIDs: 1B; Oral steroids: 1B; Topical steroids: 1B; Cycloplegics: 1B; Nonemergent evacuation: 1C.

Patients with planned intraocular surgery should have a follow-up visit after initiating treatment to reassess control of eyelid inflammation prior to surgery. The follow-up visit should include interval history, measurement of visual acuity, external examination, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and if corticosteroid therapy is prescribed, patients should be re-evaluated within a few weeks to determine response, measure intraocular pressure, and assess treatment compliance.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to inciting agents of mechanical, chemical or immunological nature. No generally accepted explanation of this steroid property has been advanced. Corticosteroids cause a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) in susceptible individuals. In a small study, FLAREX (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% demonstrated a significantly longer average time to produce a rise in IOP than did dexamethasone phosphate; however, the ultimate magnitude of the rise was equivalent for both drugs and in a small percentage of individuals a significant rise in IOP occurred within three days.

### Glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension and glaucoma [^116jqboZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods of GC Administration

All methods of GC administration are associated with GIOHT/GIG, but the incident rate of each method is different (see Table 1). Common methods of GC administration include ocular, extraocular, and systemic administrations.

Ocular administration includes topical, intraocular, and periocular routes. Extraocular administration includes inhaled and intranasal GC delivery. Systemic administration includes oral, intravenous, percutaneous, and excessive endogenous production. Studies show that GIOHT/GIG tends to occur more quickly with ocular administration, usually within weeks to months compared to systemic administration, which may occur after months or years of GC use.

It is also important to understand that drug formulation may affect the risk of developing GIOHT/GIG as well. Hydrophilic compounds, such as GC phosphates, do not penetrate the cornea as well as lipophilic compounds, such as GC acetates. This may account for some of the differences in GC potency and the risk of IOP elevation.

Topical Application

Topical GC use is more likely to lead to GIOHT/GIG than systemic use. Sihota et al found that 73.5% of GIG cases were caused by topical GC administration. Topical GC treatment is often used for various ocular diseases and as a post-operative/post-procedural regimen for ophthalmologic surgeries and laser treatments. Chronic GC users, most of whom have ocular inflammation such as uveitis and allergic conjunctivitis, are at high risk of developing GIOHT. Cessation of GC eye drops usually leads to pressure normalization within a few weeks, but some could last up to 18 months. As previously discussed, newer GCs may provide a better option in treating inflammation with decreased risk of IOP elevation compared to older GCs.

However, in very few cases, GIOHT persists even after GC cessation. We hypothesize that these patients may be at the preclinical stage of POAG (no IOP elevation), and there have already been pathological changes in their TM. The use of GCs accelerates these irreversible damages in the TM and brings these patients from preclinical POAG to clinical POAG with OHT.

### Dexamethasone sodium phosphate ophthalmic solution, USP 0.1… [^116aafsF]. FDA (DailyMed) (2022). Medium credibility.

DEXAMETHASONE SODIUM PHOSPHATE- dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution/ drops Bausch & Lomb Incorporated ----------. Preservatives: sodium bisulfite 0. 1%, phenylethyl alcohol
0. 25%, benzalkonium chloride 0. 02%. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate suppresses the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and it probably delays or slows healing. No generally accepted explanation of these steroid properties has been advanced. For the treatment of the following conditions: Ophthalmic: Steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitis when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation; corneal injury from chemical or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies.

In acute purulent conditions of the eye or ear, corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If these products are used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex other than epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, in which it is contraindicated, requires great caution; periodic slit-lamp microscopy is essential. Topically applied steroids are absorbed systemically. Therefore, because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from dexamethasone sodium phosphate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, perforation of the globe. The duration of treatment will vary with the type of lesion and may extend from a few days to several weeks, according to therapeutic response. Relapses, more common in chronic active lesions than in self-limited conditions, usually respond to treatment. Eye: Instill one or two drops of solution into the conjunctival sac every hour during the day and every two hours during the night as initial therapy. When a favorable response is observed, reduce dosage to one drop every four hours. Later, further reduction in dosage to one drop three or four times daily may suffice to control symptoms.

### Consensus disease definitions for ophthalmic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115hVQNZ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

ICI-associated autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) was not included in our disease definitions and guidelines given the paucity of these cases. Cases of new onset or worsening retinopathy with positive antiretinal antibodies following initiation of ICI (either ipilimumab, nivolumab, or combination of both) have been reported. As use of ICI increases and more cases of ICI-associated AIR are identified, this topic can be revisited.

While the panels broadly discussed the degree of vision loss (eg, severe or not) and pattern of vision loss (acute or other), specific thresholds of visual acuity loss in terms of severity and duration were not discussed in the panels. In clinical practice, vision-threatening disease is often a subjective assessment based on the current rate of decline in vision and the severity of the ocular pathology. Medical oncologists on the panel stated that if vision-threatening disease is present, then systemic corticosteroids may be used especially in acute settings. Use of systemic corticosteroids has been supported in irAEs involving other organ systems. Higher doses of systemic corticosteroids with rapid taper are preferred to prolonged use of lower doses (10 mg or less daily). The timing of when to initiate systemic corticosteroids remains an area of controversy that requires additional research and discussion. Some panelists thought that the phrase "as a last resort" to indicate when steroid or IMT initiation and holding ICI treatment should occur was overly conservative. Some felt these should happen earlier than "as a last resort" if there were severe symptoms or uncontrolled inflammation after less aggressive therapies. The panelists did not discuss any absolute ophthalmic indications for stopping ICI treatment and felt that this decision would always require a multidisciplinary discussion among the oncologist and ophthalmologist, considering the totality of the patient's clinical situation. Panelists revealed that IMT may be considered in conjunction with close multidisciplinary follow-up. There is limited data on outcomes with second-line immunosuppression for refractory irAEs and it was not explored with this expert panel.

In conclusion, developing consensus irAE definitions for ophthalmic conditions not only helps the field but also promises to streamline patient care, foster research collaboration, and provide a robust framework for accurate diagnosis and treatment across diverse ophthalmic conditions, serving as a crucial resource for multi-disciplinary patient care.

### Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension, USP, 1%… [^116madJW]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure.

Steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation; corneal injury from chemical, radiation, or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye. Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended.

Corticosteroids are not effective in mustard gas keratitis and Sjogren's keratoconjunctivitis. No studies have been conducted in animals or in humans to evaluate the potential of these effects. Prednisolone has been shown to be teratogenic in mice when given in doses 1–10 times the human dose. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients. Adverse reactions include, in decreasing order of frequency, elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing. Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.

### Prospective, randomized, fellow eye-controlled study of postoperative pain and inflammation control with an intracanalicular dexamethasone 0.4 mg ophthalmic insert following small incision lenticule extraction [^116L5hxW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Visual outcomes were comparable between treatment groups in this study and were excellent as evidenced at 3 months (Figures 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10). No eyes lost any lines of CDVA. At 3 months, 82.4% of eyes in both groups achieved UDVA of 20/20 or better with 88.2% of eyes with MRSE within ± 0.5 D. These outcomes are consistent with prior studies of SMILE.

Figure 10
Stability of spherical equivalent refraction after small incision lenticule extraction in the (A) Dextenza and (B) Drops groups.

IOP elevations occurred in 3 eyes at 1 month and were presumed related to steroid response. Two eyes were treated with topical IOP-lowering therapy that quickly restored IOP control, while the third eye's IOP normalized without therapy. In phase 3 studies of DEX for control of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery, IOP elevations were reported in 4.4–7.4% of dexamethasone eyes. Steroid responses may be more common in myopic eyes. A statistically significant difference in mean IOP between groups was seen at 1 month, but this was attributable to a reduction in mean IOP in the PRED group and not a rise in mean IOP in the DEX group. Future applications of the DEX insert in conjunction with SMILE could decrease the dose to reduce steroid response.

This study demonstrates that postoperative inflammation and pain following SMILE can be controlled without the need for patient-administered topical corticosteroid eye drop therapy. The DEX insert can eliminate the risk of nonadherence with topical steroid therapy. Half of patients administer fewer than half of their postoperative antibiotic and steroid eye drops after cataract surgery. Even though SMILE patients are still responsible for administering topical antibiotics, there is a benefit to simplifying the postoperative medical regimen by eliminating the steroid taper. Regimen complexity is associated with poorer adherence, which increases the risk of inflammation, pain, delayed visual recovery, and patient dissatisfaction. Minimizing the frequency of eye drop instillation also reduces hand-face contact, an important consideration in the COVID-19 era, particularly given that about 30% of patients report not washing hands when instilling postoperative eye drops after anterior segment surgery.

### Clinical utility of cyclosporine (CsA) ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% for symptomatic relief in people with chronic dry eye: a review of the literature [^115DPhP4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammation in dry eye

Dry eye is a complex disorder of the tears and ocular surface that leads to symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, tear film instability, and potential damage to the ocular surface. Increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface are integral to the disease.

Inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland can occur as both the instigator and product of DED. The understanding of inflammation as a key factor in DED supports the use of topical corticosteroids and topical CsA. This was a therapeutic turning point; the underlying mechanism of pathology was targeted rather than mollifying symptoms with the conventional strategy of lubrication.

Management of dry eye

An arsenal of treatment options exists for DED. They include the following:
Lubricants, including artificial tears, gels, ointments, inserts.
Anti-inflammatory agents, such as topical CsA, corticosteroids, lifitegrast, essential fatty acids, and oral tetracyclines.
Environmental and behavioral modifications, such as the use of humidifer, purposeful blinking, and computer screen adjustment.
Cessation of systemic medications linked to DED, such as antihistamines and other anticholinergic agents.
Others including punctal occlusion, oral secretogogues, pulse corticosteroids, autologous serum, mucolytic therapy, moisture chamber spectacles, management of eyelids, contact lens (CL) therapy, and acupuncture.

While topical corticosteroids are effective in breaking the cycle of inflammation, their known side effects, such as ocular hypertension, cataract, decreased wound healing, and predisposition to infection limit chronic use. Alternatively, topical CsA has a favorable risk–benefit profile for chronic use. Blood levels of CsA are barely detectable at a maximum level of 0.16 ng/mL, and the most common side effect of CsA is ocular burning. Other side effects of CsA include blurred vision, ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, foreign body sensation, and stinging.

CsA is a lipophilic, neutral cyclic undecapeptide consisting of 11 amino acids. It acts as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting T-cell-mediated inflammation and cytokines in the conjunctiva, stimulates natural tear production, and increases goblet cell density. Topical CsA enhances ocular surface health.

### Retrospective study of a sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for treatment of ocular inflammation after cataract and corneal surgery [^115e6e5f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adherence to treatment regimens after ocular surgery can be complicated by patient compliance and difficulty administering topical drops. It is particularly important to address ocular inflammation after surgical procedures such as cataract surgery and corneal transplantation to decrease the likelihood of anterior chamber inflammation, macular edema, and corneal edema/rejection. Surgical technique and postoperative treatments are both geared towards minimizing postoperative inflammation. Minimally invasive surgical techniques and technological advances have led to smaller surgical incisions, resulting in reduced trauma to ocular structures. Despite the novel advances to cataract surgery, postoperative inflammation remains ever-present. Surgical trauma induced breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier leads to an increased incidence of observed cells and flare in the anterior chamber of the eye. The inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical trauma can lead to the development of retinal cysts known as cystoid macular edema (CME) or Irvine-Gass syndrome, which can lead to reduced visual acuity post cataract surgery.

The postoperative medication regimen is critical towards inhibiting the potentially destructive effects of the inflammatory cascade. Corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the main tools in the ophthalmic surgeon's arsenal to combat non-infectious ocular inflammation, CME, and corneal graft rejection. An ocular side effect of corticosteroid use, regardless of the delivery mechanism is increased intraocular pressure (IOP) which can lead to optic neuropathy and steroid-induced glaucoma. Moderate steroid responders (6 to 15-mmHg IOP baseline increase) constitute 33% of the non-glaucomatous population, whereas 4–6% are considered high responders with IOP increases above 15-mmHg. The most common methods for the local delivery of corticosteroids to ocular structures include: topical, subconjunctival, periocular, and intravitreal administration. Although the ophthalmic community is moving towards a dropless or "less drop" environment, topical therapy remains the standard of care in many cases.

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^115RTQoy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Our perspective

Uveitis constitutes a sight-threatening disease that should be managed according to the severity. Given our current understanding of the immune mechanisms of uveitis, IMT drugs can greatly reduce inflammation and minimize the use of topical and systemic steroids. There are a number of IMT options available that have improved outcomes of uveitic patients when used in specific situations. These IMT orphan drugs serve as the foundation to modern corticosteroid-sparing therapy.

Conventional IMT agents are the first steroid-sparing options for uveitic patients with refractive active inflammation and/or sight-threatening complications. Using IMTs in treating autoimmune uveitis follows one of the following scenarios: 1) as a steroid-sparing agent; 2) when corticosteroids fail to control the inflammation: persistent, recurrent, or progressing in the same eye or bilaterally; 3) when uveitis is associated with autoimmune systemic diseases, IMTs are used to control both; and 4) with frequent recurrences and/or the development of ocular or steroid-induced nonophthalmic complications.

Previous experience indicates that an alternative and/or combined IMT regimen is the best treatment choice in cases of worsening inflammation. In these worsening patients, a physician can either change or add other conventional IMT drugs and/or a biologic agent. Medications in the same group can be replaced with each other from more aggressive treatments, such as infusions to less aggressive ones such as subcutaneous injections. Moreover, the failure of a biologic response modifier in a group does not necessarily mean that similar agents in the same group will also be ineffective. Corticosteroids are usually modulated with IMT drugs according to the degree of intraocular inflammation and the possible occurrence of complications and/or relapses. In cases of ocular inflammation improvement, corticosteroids should be gradually tapered until final withdrawal, together with a subsequent reduction and/or withdrawal of the use of IMT drugs.

Inflammation and pain are two prevalent findings after ocular surgery. Corticosteroids are widely administrated as a core treatment to control post-surgical inflammation and pain. Improper patient adherence to post-operative eye drop regimens, limited bioavailability of topical eye drops, and the negative impact of preservatives used in many of these eye drops, has made a strong case for novel therapies in the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation.

### Impact of dexamethasone intraocular suspension 9% on intraocular pressure after routine cataract surgery: post hoc analysis [^114AEtTq]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Whether the timing of corticosteroid response to intraocular corticosteroids differs from topically delivered corticosteroids is not known. Although IOP-lowering medication might in theory mask (ie, prevent) a second IOP spike, this is unlikely given the early onset and brevity of IOP-lowering treatments detailed earlier.

There were several limitations to this analysis. Patients with glaucoma, recent ocular surgery, history of intravitreal injection or implant, history of uveitis or other inflammatory disorder, corneal abnormality, and recent exposure to topical NSAID or corticosteroid were excluded from these trials. Thus, the results reported here might not apply to all patients who are at risk for corticosteroid-related adverse events. The study population was also mostly of White ethnicity; thus, caution must be used in interpreting our results in non-White populations.

In study 1, a subset of dexamethasone intraocular suspension–treated subjects received rescue antiinflammatory medication (Table 4), which increased total corticosteroid exposure and might or might not have impacted mean postoperative IOP in the dexamethasone-treated arm. At the time of rescue medication administration, a minority of patients in either treatment group met the prespecified criteria of ACC and/or ACF grade 3 on examination. Given the blinded, placebo-controlled trial design, it is not surprising that some investigators would deviate from protocol and administer topical antiinflammatory drops because they could not know whether a given patient had received any corticosteroid. In practice, however, surgeons might be less concerned about mild ocular inflammation and less inclined to add topical drops to a sustained-release intraocular corticosteroid that they knowingly instilled.

### Safety and efficacy of topical vs intracanalicular corticosteroids for the prevention of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery [^112Titdv]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Like all therapeutic interventions, proper counseling on what to expect is essential. In the case of the intracanalicular insert, patients should be advised that they may note an increase of epiphora in the short term while the insert is resorbing. Although not specifically analyzed in this study, investigators have noted anecdotally that some patients reported increased tearing in the postoperative period. Most importantly, they should be counseled up front on the signs and symptoms of breakthrough inflammation, which include increased conjunctival hyperemia and photosensitivity. We found that this conversation was best presented on the day after cataract surgery. If done in this way, patients are educated on what to look for and when to call, and instances of breakthrough inflammation are less likely to result in after-hours or urgent encounters. Another point of counseling for patients is the potential financial burden of the intracanalicular insert compared with topical drops. The cost of the intracanalicular insert is approximately $500 to 600 USD, whereas the cost of a bottle of 1% prednisolone acetate or 0.05% difluprednate is $20 to 60 and $200 to 250 USD, respectively (price estimates from, retrieved April 15, 22). In the present study, only patients whose insurance covered the insert were included in either group to minimize the possibility that differences in patients' insurance status indirectly led to other differences between the cohorts. It was noted during the data collection process that Medicare and most commercial insurance carriers covered the cost of the insert, whereas Medicaid did not. It is important that both patients who prefer the convenience of dropless cataract surgery, as well as those who have medically indicated difficulties with application of topical drops, be made aware of their individual insurance plans' coverage and the potential financial burden in the case of noncoverage.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^116rrhJm]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern — topical corticosteroid and cyclosporine guidance emphasizes limited use, tapering, and safety counseling. A brief course of topical corticosteroids may be helpful for eyelid or ocular surface inflammation, and corticosteroid eye drops or ointments can be considered initially for the control of symptoms, then tapered and discontinued and used intermittently to maintain comfort. The minimal effective dose should be used, long-term therapy should be avoided if possible, and patients should be informed of risks including increased intraocular pressure and cataract; these risks may be minimized by site-specific or limited-penetration agents such as loteprednol etabonate and fluorometholone phosphate. Guidelines for maintenance therapy should be discussed, and topical cyclosporine may be helpful in some patients with posterior blepharitis.

Steroids

Topical steroids such as loteprednol etabonate (LE), dexamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, fluorometholone, and hydrocortisone are effective in breaking the inflammatory cycle in DED. Topical steroids can be used to rapidly decrease DED signs and symptoms, and in severe cases requiring ophthalmic cyclosporine, they can also help improve tolerance to cyclosporine. Topical steroids may be prescribed for a short-term course to treat disease flares, but long-term use of topical corticosteroids is not recommended due to the risk of steroid-related side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP), severe steroid-induced glaucoma, and cataract formation. Steroids with more favorable safety profiles, such as LE, may offer better therapeutic options, with the potential for fewer steroid-related side effects.

Dexamethasone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone can pass through the cornea into the anterior chamber. These molecules are very effective in reducing DED signs and symptoms but are associated with high rates of steroid-induced ocular side effects. For this reason, their use should be restricted to controlling severe disease, in patients with a low steroid response or steroid nonresponders; even in these cases, only short-term therapy should be prescribed.

LE is a steroid therapy developed via retrometabolic drug design, modifying an inactive metabolite of prednisolone acetate, with the goals of preserving prednisolone acetate's anti-inflammatory effects while enabling rapid metabolism of inactive metabolites, thereby reducing the potential for steroid-related adverse events (AEs). LE effectively reduces the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe DED: In a prospective, double-masked, multicenter RCT, 0.5% LE started 2 weeks before beginning long-term topical 0.05% cyclosporine provided more rapid improvements in Schirmer scores, ocular surface staining, and DED symptoms compared with topical cyclosporine or TSs alone. Additionally, LE induction therapy significantly improved topical cyclosporine tolerance and decreased the risk of having to stop cyclosporine therapy. Additionally, LE therapy seemed to have a lower incidence of AEs such as increased IOP, steroid-induced glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and cataract formation. For these reasons, LE is the only steroid formulation that can be used for extended periods of time.

Fluorometholone can reduce ocular surface signs in patients with DED and prevent worsening DED due to desiccating stress.

Hydrocortisone at a low concentration (0.001%) does not reach the aqueous humorand is effective at reducing the signs and symptoms of DED, with a very good safety profile.

### Local irritating effect caused by topical use of steroids in the eye… [^112TDPCh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

About a half a decade has elapsed since the introduction of the therapeutic use of corticosteroids. Experience has been accumulated as to their effectiveness in various ophthalmic diseases by systemic as well as by topical administration. The splendid therapeutic responses have over-shadowed the local irritating effects of such topical preparations. Reports of such undesirable local side-effects are very brief, rare, and contradictory. Previous Reports The following citations from the literature will illustrate this point. A.

### Steroid side effects… [^111XgmX7]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Grennan D, Wang S. Steroid Side Effects. JAMA. 2019; 322:

282. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.8506 Steroid medications, which are prescribed in many different forms for many different conditions, have a multitude of side effects. Corticosteroid medications — often just called steroids by clinicians and patients — are used to reduce inflammation and inhibit the immune system. They are also associated with many side effects. Corticosteroid medications are synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands. These are different from the synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone testosterone used by some athletes or the synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone estrogen used by some women after menopause. Steroids can be taken as a tablet for simple rashes or mild asthma attacks or given intravenously for flares of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.

To minimize the side effects of oral or intravenous steroids, steroid treatments that act locally were developed. Examples include Topical application to the skin for conditions like eczema or psoriasis. Nasal inhalation for allergy symptoms Inhalation into the lungs to control asthma symptoms Injection into joints to reduce pain and inflammation Eye drops to reduce swelling after eye surgery Some patients find taking steroids to be difficult because of side effects; other patients like how steroids make them feel. Side effects are most common with oral or intravenous steroids, but sometimes enough locally directed steroid is absorbed systemically to cause side effects. Life-threatening side effects include. Infection: Steroids are effective in treating autoimmune diseases because they reduce the ability of the immune system to function. Patients taking steroids are not only more susceptible to infections but more likely to have severe or unusual infections.

These patients should be aware of their increased risk of infection, and their physicians may recommend additional anti-infective medications. Health care practitioners are cautious in prescribing steroids because of the side effects. They prescribe them only when necessary and for as short a time as possible. Local rather than systemic therapy is preferable and prescribed when possible. If a patient needs to stop taking a systemic steroid after taking it for a long time, they are prescribed a gradually reduced dose to give the adrenal glands time to "wake up" and start producing cortisol again. When longer courses of higher-dose systemic steroids are necessary, as in some autoimmune conditions, the patient is monitored closely for side effects.

### High long-term drug-free remission rate for acute vogt-koyanagi-harada disease with an appropriate immunosuppressive regimen [^111ZVWqP]. Retina (2023). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic protocol used in this study aimed to eradicate inflammation and cure VKH disease. Systemic corticosteroids were used as the first-line therapy, and immunomodulatory agents were added only as clinically indicated. The core concept of this regimen includes the following: 1) initiation of a full dose of oral corticosteroids at the onset to completely eliminate intraocular inflammation and restore the normal structure of the retina rapidly; 2) reduction of corticosteroids with diminishing tapering speed to prevent inflammation recurrence; 3) close follow-up to adjust the dosage or tapering speed of oral medicine promptly once any slight signs of inflammation emerge; 4) addition of immunosuppressants if necessary; and 5) maintenance of no signs of ocular inflammation, specifically zero cells in the AC, for ≥ 3 months before drug withdrawal. In most patients, this schedule maintains zero ocular inflammatory cells until the end of therapy after initial inflammation control. In cases with inflammation recurrence during treatment, timely therapeutic regimen adjustment usually ensures the elimination of the inflammation in most cases. A high long-term drug-free remission rate (95%) in VKH disease was achieved using this regimen, with a median time of 11 months. At a sufficiently long follow-up (≥ 12 months) after medication cessation, no patients experienced ocular inflammation relapse. Yang et alalso reported a low recurrence rate of acute VKH disease using 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg/day prednisone combined with other immunosuppressive agents, which were slowly tapered off after ≥ 12 months. This study and the results from the study by Yang suggest that acute VKH disease is curable with an appropriate immunosuppressive regimen. Moreover, the tapering speed after remission of acute inflammation might be essential for the long-term prognosis of initial onset VKH.

### SALT trial: steroids after laser trabeculoplasty: impact of short-term anti-inflammatory treatment on selective laser trabeculoplasty efficacy [^1177mbxR]. Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study examined whether short-term use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or steroid therapy affected the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT).

Design

Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, dual-center, multisurgeon trial.

Participants

Patients older than 18 years with intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 18 mmHg for whom the clinician decided SLT was the appropriately indicated therapy were randomized to 1 of 3 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1 as follows: ketorolac 0.5%, prednisolone 1%, or saline tears.

Methods

After SLT, patients randomized into each group were instructed to use an unmarked drop 4 times daily starting the day of SLT and continuing for 4 additional days. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for continuous variables when comparing 2 or 3 treatment groups, respectively. The Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome of this study was IOP at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included IOP at 1 and 6 weeks, patient-reported pain, and detectable anterior chamber inflammation.

Results

Ninety-six eyes of 85 patients fit inclusion criteria and were enrolled between the 2 sites. The NSAID, steroid, and placebo groups were similar in baseline demographics and baseline IOP (mean, 23.3 ± 3.9 mmHg; P = 0.57). There was no statistically significant difference in IOP decrease among groups at week 6. Both the NSAID and steroid groups showed a statistically significantly greater decrease in IOP at week 12 compared with the placebo group (mean, -6.2 ± 3.1 mmHg, -5.2 ± 2.7 mmHg, and -3 ± 4.3 mmHg, respectively; P = 0.02 [analysis of variance] and P = 0.002 [t test] for NSAID vs. placebo groups; P = 0.02 for steroid vs. placebo groups).

Conclusions

Significantly better IOP reduction at 12 weeks was measured in eyes treated with steroid or NSAID drops after SLT. Short-term postoperative use of NSAID or steroid drops may improve IOP reduction after SLT. Longer-term follow-up studies are indicated.

### Comparison of subconjunctival triamcinolone with topical prednisolone for routine anti-inflammatory prophylaxis in manual small incision cataract surgery: a single-center, randomized controlled trial pilot protocol [^115KqkBS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

AC Inflammation

A participant with an inflammation score of 5 or more (cell + flare) at any visit is examined by the unmasked evaluating ophthalmologist who determines the allocation group. Participants in group 1 are treated by doubling the frequency of PA administration based on the current dosing at the time of presentation. For example, if a participant presents during week 2 with pain and blurred vision and has score of 5 (cell + flare), the PA dose would be increased from three times daily to six times daily. Tapering would proceed by 1 drop per week. Follow ups are scheduled weekly until drops are discontinued. Participants in group 2 are started initially on PA four times daily, tapering 1 drop per week for a total of 4 weeks. Follow up is scheduled weekly until drops are discontinued. In all cases, persistence of the same level or greater inflammation from one visit to the next are addressed by the PI. In cases of persistence of an inflammation score of 5 or more for 1 week, the PI will determine additional treatment and submit an adverse event report to the Ethics Committee.

Corneal Edema

A participant with grade 3 corneal edema is examined by the unmasked evaluating ophthalmologist who determines the allocation group. Treatment and reporting follow the protocol for AC inflammation above but with a threshold of grade 3 corneal edema for more than one visit and for more than one week requiring follow up by the PI and reporting to the Ethics Committee.

Clinical Macular Edema

ME is suspected in a participant with a CDVA of 20/40 or worse at the 6- or 12-week visit or with a subjective perception of visual impairment at any time during the study. Upon presentation, the unmasked evaluating ophthalmologist will obtain SD-OCT. Confirmation of clinical ME is a CDVA of 20/40 or worse and central cystic spaces or central subfield thickness of 320 µm on SD-OCT. Confirmed ME is treated with topical bromfenac 0.09% (Ocuflam MedPharma, Guatemala) twice daily for 4 weeks. Follow up is scheduled 4 weeks following presentation for ophthalmic exam and repeat SD-OCT. Persistent ME at the subsequent visit is treated with 1.0 mL of peribulbar TA 40 mg/mL (4 mg) and a follow up is scheduled for 4 weeks. Persistent ME at that second follow up visit is treated at the discretion of the consulting clinical retinal specialist. The PI will submit an adverse event report to the Ethics Committee for persistent ME for more than 6 consecutive months.

### Hydrocortisone concentration influences time to clinically significant healing of acute inflammation of the ocular surface and adnexa-results from a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111WWnRD]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The CSS total score comprised 6 objective signs (conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, watering eyes, chemosis, red eyelids, swollen eyelids) and 4 subjective symptoms (foreign body sensation, itching, ocular pain, and dry-eye sensation) assessed at each trial visit (0–3 points per signs/symptoms, the higher the worse, maximum 30 points) (see Table 1). Objective signs were assessed by the investigator on the basis of a slit lamp examination of the eye with the highest CSS total score at baseline (if the score was equal for both eyes at baseline, one of the eyes was chosen deliberately) and subjective symptoms were assessed by interviewing the subjects.

Table 1
Grading of parameters to evaluate efficacy

As secondary efficacy variables the difference to baseline in CSS total score, the CSS subscores signs and symptoms, the time to first occurrence of at least 50% reduction in each CSS subscore, remitter (CSS = 0) rates at study end, the scores of individual CSS items at each trial visit, and the treatment duration until complete remission (CSS = 0) were analysed.

Safety parameters consisted of visual acuity test, IOP measurement (measured by tonometry) at visits V0, V4 and V5; adverse events (AEs); and global rating of tolerability (V4 and V5).

The data from subjects randomized and exposed were analysed (intent to treat [ITT] population). The time to first occurrence of at least 50% reduction in CSS total score was used to hierarchically test three hypotheses (H 1: HC-ac 2.5% ≥ HC-ac 0.5%, H 2: HC-ac 1% ≥ HC-ac 0.5%, and H 3: HC-ac 2.5% ≥ HC-ac 1%) using Kaplan-Meier statistics and comparing each of the treatment groups pair-wise with the Cox-variant of the Log-Rank test. If ≥ 50% reduction was not reached during the time under treatment exposure, the subject was censored at the time of the last observation. The study followed a 2-stage adaptive design with sample-size adjustment after the planned interim analysis. For the final hypotheses testing, the p-values of the 2 parts of the study were calculated separately and then combined using Fisher's combination rule (p✱ = p1 × p2) and adjusted for type I error probability c α ≤ 0.0038.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116CYtZF]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative management of uveitis — quiescence and corticosteroids: Ideally, inflammation should be inactive or controlled as much as possible before surgery, and many uveitis specialists advocate 3 months or more of quiescence before surgery as this reduces the risk of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME); even if a patient is on chronic anti-inflammatory therapy, additional topical and/or oral corticosteroids are often recommended before surgery to pre-empt severe postoperative exacerbations, and in one study, preoperative treatment with oral corticosteroids seemed to decrease the risk of postoperative CME. The medical regimen should be individualized based on the severity and sequelae of past episodes and prior control, and surgical procedures may need to be modified to manage pre-existing posterior synechiae, pupillary membranes, zonular compromise, and fibrotic scarring of the pupillary margin.

### Safety and efficacy of topical vs intracanalicular corticosteroids for the prevention of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery [^112gLPqU]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In a post hoc analysis, several additional factors were identified that trended toward being predictive of breakthrough inflammation (Table 4). Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and/or autoimmune disorders and eyes with poor vision at baseline may benefit from closer monitoring for breakthrough inflammation. Clinicians might consider more aggressive inflammatory prophylaxis such as a combination of the intracanalicular insert with either topical steroid drops, topical NSAID drops, both, or a longer duration of anti-inflammatory therapy. Furthermore, eyes with anterior chamber cell, conjunctival injection, or reported pain at 1 week may benefit from more aggressive inflammatory prophylaxis as well (all P < .03; Table 4). Despite the correlation of anterior chamber cell at 1 week and breakthrough inflammation, it is interesting that the insert group had greater incidence of anterior chamber cell at 1 week, but this did not correlate with a significantly higher proportion of eyes having breakthrough inflammation in the insert group. This may be due to the insufficient number of eyes to power this post hoc analysis of risk factors associated with breakthrough. However, it may also indicate that the insert is associated with a mild amount of anterior chamber inflammation at 1 week but not to the extent that it becomes clinically significant. Another possibility is that not enough drug is released in the first few days after surgery in some patients, and if anterior chamber reaction is identified on examination at 1 week, additional anti-inflammatory agents are indicated — which would warrant further study. These data demonstrate that personalized approaches to prevention of breakthrough inflammation after cataract surgery may lead to improved safety and efficacy outcomes.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^115N4ftS]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis — management — Nonpharmacologic measures include that "Recommendations often include wearing sunglasses as a barrier to airborne allergens, cold compresses, refrigerated artificial tears, avoiding eye rubbing, and avoiding allergens", with additional measures such as "Hypoallergenic bedding, eyelid cleansers to remove allergens, frequent clothes washing, and bathing/showering before bedtime may also be helpful". Pharmacologic therapy notes that "Mild allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with an over-the-counter topical antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or with more effective second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists", many drops "can be stored in the refrigerator" for symptomatic relief, and chronic vasoconstrictor use "can be associated with rebound vasodilation once the agent is stopped". For recurrent or persistent disease, "mast-cell stabilizers can be used", and "Many new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties and can be used for either acute or chronic disease". Related comorbidity relief is described: "The use of topical mast-cell inhibitors can also be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis", including nasal spray or aerosols, while as a general precaution, "Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided because antibiotics can induce toxicity, and corticosteroids can potentially prolong adenoviral infections and worsen HSV infections".

### Chronic tarsal conjunctivitis [^114WcMpi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Response to treatment

The first 15 patients in this series were given olopatadine (Opatanol) anti-histamine and nedocromil (Rapitil) for several months, with no response. Clinical symptoms of epiphora typically settled within a week or two of starting topical steroid drops, either dexamethasone 0.1% (Maxidex) or prednisolone 0.5% (Predsol), but the clinical signs of chronic tarsal inflammation usually remained for many months despite continuous topical steroid use. As the frequency of the topical steroid drops was reduced over months and the strength was reduced to fluorometholone, the symptom of epiphora and the signs of chronic tarsal inflammation tended to recur. This pattern of response to topical steroid and recurrence on stopping steroid persisted until the summer of 2014 when a contact sensitivity response was suspected. At this point all patients were advised to refrain (or at least be minimalist) about application of facial products and to refrain from using facial wipes. Since this approach was taken in 83.6% (46/55) cases it is known that the condition is completely resolved, with all patients in this series discharged by April 2015. One of this series of patients developed raised intraocular pressure requiring cessation of steroid treatment. The reasons for loss to follow up, 16.3% (9/55), is unknown. As access to the PCO service by self-referral is relatively straight forward, one reason for non-attendance might be complete resolution of symptoms.

In the initial stages, 8 patients were referred into the local Hospital Eye Service. Some of these patients subsequently returned to the Primary Care Ophthalmology service for continuity of care. Additional file 2: Table S2 describes the outcomes for these patients.

### Evaluation of same-day versus next-day implantation of intracanalicular dexamethasone for the control of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery [^115qdZ2H]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Adherence to topical medication regimens is a complex issue impacted by a multitude of factors. Factors such as inexperience, age, finance and complexity of medication regimens are all important considerations when starting a patient on a topical medication regimen. Postoperative medication regimens following cataract surgery, in particular corticosteroids, can add a layer of complexity for the patient owing to the tapering schedule and difference in dosing schedules between the eyes. Moreover, many patients who undergo cataract surgery are on existing medications and having to wait > 5 minutes prior to drop instillation for each medication which creates a sizable burden. These challenges have prompted the development of nontopical medication options such as the sustained-release intracanalicular insert evaluated in this present study.

There are considerations unique to corticosteroids as it relates to nontopical and/or sustained drug-delivery medication options. The sustained-release insert described herein offers attributes that overcome the potential side effects and challenges of topical corticosteroid use. Topical agents, which are instilled intermittently, inevitably lead to variability in drug concentration owing to the poor bioavailability of the agent. The insert's intracanalicular location, with proximity to the ocular surface, purports to offer a superior bioavailability profile with improved consistency of drug concentration in contrast to topical administration. The tapered delivery of drug from the insert over the course of 30 days minimizes the risk for rebound inflammation, which can occur with abrupt discontinuation of topical steroids. In addition, the preservative-free composition of the insert circumvents issues with preservatives and ocular surface toxicity, a well-recognized problem with long-term use of topical drops.

This study is not without limitations. The sample size was modest in size and was performed at a single site. There was no control arm of patients using topical medications for comparison. The subjective method of pain assessment employed in this study is not standardized and is an acknowledged drawback of this study. Despite these limitations, the results of this contralateral eye study are compelling as the results are sourced from a real-world clinical population without strict inclusion criteria. The real-world study design provides results that are possibly generalizable to other practicing clinicians and supports the use of the insert in an office setting for control of postoperative inflammation.

### A very early steroid responder after cataract surgery: a case report [^11472L8D]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid eye drops are routinely prescribed to treat and control postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery. A well-known side effect of steroid eye drops is an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), particularly in "steroid responders". However, increases in IOP due to steroid-related side effects usually occur several weeks after the start of eye drop administration. In addition, the immediate postoperative IOP elevation is multifactorial, and it is unlikely for a steroid response to be the primary cause. Herein, I report a case in which IOP was strongly suspected to have increased due to an immediate postoperative steroid response.

### Cyclosporine for ocular inflammatory diseases [^112eRncs]. Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical outcomes of cyclosporine treatment for noninfectious ocular inflammation.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 373 patients with noninfectious ocular inflammation managed at 4 tertiary ocular inflammation clinics in the United States observed to use cyclosporine as a single noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agent to their treatment regimen, between 1979 and 2007 inclusive.

Methods

Participants were identified from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases Cohort Study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including dosage of cyclosporine and main outcome measures, were obtained for every eye of every patient at every visit via medical record review by trained expert reviewers.

Main Outcome Measures

Control of inflammation, sustained control after reducing corticosteroid dosages, and discontinuation of therapy because of toxicity.

Results

Of the 373 patients (681 eyes) initiating cyclosporine monotherapy, 33.4% by 6 months and 51.9% by 1 year gained sustained, complete control of inflammation over at least 2 visits spanning at least 28 days. Approximately 25% more improved to a level of slight inflammatory activity by each of these time points. Corticosteroid-sparing success (completely controlled inflammation for at least 28 days with prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day) was achieved by 22.1% by 6 months and 36.1% within 1 year. Toxicity led to discontinuation of therapy within 1 year by 10.7% of the population. Patients aged more than 55 years were more than 3-fold more likely to discontinue therapy because of toxicity than patients aged 18 to 39 years. Doses of 151 to 250 mg/day tended to be more successful than lower doses and were not associated with a higher discontinuation for toxicity rate; higher doses did not seem to offer a therapeutic advantage.

Conclusions

Cyclosporine, with corticosteroid therapy as indicated, was modestly effective for controlling ocular inflammation. Our data support a preference for cyclosporine adult dosing between 151 and 250 mg/day. Although cyclosporine was tolerated by the majority of patients, toxicity was more frequent with increasing age; alternative agents may be preferred for patients aged more than 55 years.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^114uyCP2]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery — definitions, contributors, evaluation, and management are described: Prolonged inflammation, or iritis, is defined as inflammation that does not resolve within a few weeks of cataract surgery, in contrast to rebound inflammation, which resolves in the usual time frame but then recurs. Persistent iritis has been associated with herpetic eye disease, retained lens fragments, previous uveitis, and subacute infection with Propionibacterium acnes; gonioscopy may be necessary to see small lens fragments in the inferior angle, and ultrasound biomicroscopy, long-wavelength optical coherence tomography (OCT), or endoscopy may be needed to identify lens fragments trapped in the ciliary sulcus. Malposition or misplacement of intraocular lenses (IOLs) of specific design may lead to persistent intraocular inflammation, and the surgeon should ensure proper orientation of IOLs to prevent corneal complications; insufficient postoperative anti-inflammatory medication may also be a contributory cause. Diabetic patients and those requiring a pupil expansion device at surgery are at increased risk of persistent postoperative inflammation and are also at increased risk for developing cystoid macular edema (CME), up to 29.5% in one study, although long-term outcomes are still equivalent to patients without prolonged inflammation. Discontinuation of corticosteroid eye drops after cataract surgery may be followed by a recurrence of inflammation with increased cell and flare or CME; reinstituting anti-inflammatory eye drops will decrease the inflammation and may require a slower taper to prevent reappearance.

In the acute setting, MS relapses and sight-threatening inflammation in IU are both managed with corticosteroids. Oral or IV methylprednisolone will shorten the duration of an MS relapse, but does not have any meaningful impact on long-term neurodisability. Systemic steroids are used to treat acute relapses of IU; but unlike MS, intraocular inflammation is amenable to local therapy. Topical steroid drops do not penetrate the posterior segment of the eye, but periocular steroid injections or intravitreal injection of steroid implant are viable alternatives, which avoid the side effects of systemic corticosteroids. Moreover, the effects of intravitreal steroid implants can last up to 6 months.

Important considerations are the possible complications of corticosteroid treatment and how they may be distinguished from relapses of MS or IU. Corticosteroids can cause systemic symptoms that may be confused with progressive neurodisability from MS. Likewise, frequent or chronic treatment with local or systemic corticosteroids can cause sight-threatening complications, like cataract, glaucoma and, central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).

Cataracts cause progressive reduction in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, night vision, and color perception, which might be confused with optic neuropathy. Nevertheless, cataracts are not a contraindication to steroid treatment, and cataract surgery will restore vision. Glaucoma also causes insidious visual loss that is largely asymptomatic until advanced. It is a progressive optic neuropathy that is distinguished from demyelinating optic neuropathy based on characteristic optic nerve cupping. However, glaucoma can be treated medically and/or surgically to prevent permanent visual loss and represents a relative contraindication to local steroid treatment. Importantly, cataracts and glaucoma are also common sight-threatening complications of IU.

CSCR is another complication of local/systemic steroid treatment. The population incidence of CSCR is 9.9 per 100,000 in men and 1.7 per 100,000 in women, but among patients on long-term steroids, the prevalence is as high as 1%–6%.CSCR causes symptoms of visual distortion and central visual loss, and OCT imaging shows subretinal fluid in the central macular region (figure 3F). The condition is generally reversible following steroid withdrawal, but represents a relative contraindication to steroid treatment because chronic CSCR can lead to permanent visual loss. Without OCT imaging, the condition may be confused with macular edema associated with active inflammation in IU or the side effect of certain disease modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS, e.g. fingolimod (figure 3E, section Immunomodulatory drugs for MS and IU).

### Intracanalicular dexamethasone insert or topical prednisolone following iStent and hydrus surgery for glaucoma [^113MmBF9]. Journal of Glaucoma (2022). Medium credibility.

There was a difference in the number of patients who were still using topical steroids at postoperative month 3 or required the use of additional topical steroids between the 2 groups with more patients in the topical prednisolone group requiring supplemental corticosteroid therapy. This difference was not statistically significant. Each patient who required additional topical steroids was previously diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma. Two of these events in the topical prednisolone group can be directly attributed to patient confusion with their postoperative drop regimen, which is removed by using the dexamethasone insert. The first patient ran out of their topical eye drops abruptly around postoperative week 3 visit and was restarted on a prednisolone taper at his postoperative month 1 visit (2 drops daily for 1 wk, 1 drop daily for 1 wk, and then stop). The second patient continued taking their postoperative steroid drop daily until the postoperative month 3 visit. The other 5 events required additional topical steroids due to presence of anterior chamber cell at postoperative month 1. Three patients were started on a topical prednisolone taper at 3 times daily and the other 2 patients were started on a topical prednisolone taper at twice daily. Each patient had resolution of their anterior chamber inflammation after this additional treatment. In the dexamethasone group, the need for additional topical steroids was due to the dexamethasone insert falling out in 1 case and the presence of anterior chamber cell at postoperative month 1 in the other 2 cases. The first case was treated by starting the patient on a typical topical prednisolone taper at 4 times daily. For the other 2 patients, one was started on a prednisolone taper at 3 times daily and the other at 4 times daily. Each patient had resolution of their anterior chamber inflammation after this additional treatment. There has not been a previous literature report on rates of the dexamethasone insert falling out after insertion. Walters and colleagues reported that the insert was well visualized at day 30 after implantation in 96.6% of patients (28 of 29). They did not specify if the one insert that was not visualized was due to the insert falling out, faster resorption, or further distal placement into the canaliculus.

### Evaluation of same-day versus next-day implantation of intracanalicular dexamethasone for the control of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery [^117W6hW6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

In the same-day group, all eyes had presence of inflammation at the 1-day postoperative visit ranging from 1 to 2+ AC cell. By 1 week, 52% (n = 16) of the eyes achieved complete resolution of inflammation; at 1 month, 100% of the eyes were absent of inflammation. One subject exhibited rebound inflammation 5 weeks after surgery that responded to a 3-week taper of topical loteprednol.

In the same-day group, 1 (3%) subject had evidence of IOP elevation > 10 mmHg at the 1-week visit from 14 (baseline) mmHg to 26 mmHg. This subject was started on timolol once daily for 3 weeks and IOP was 16 mmHg at 1 month. The mean IOP at 1 week and 1 month was 15.9 ± 4.9 mmHg and 12.6 ± 3.5 mmHg, respectively. In this group, 100% of the subjects reported an absence of pain at the 1-week and 1-month time points.

In the POD1 group, all of the eyes included in the group had evidence of inflammation ranging from 1 to 2+ AC cells at 1 day postoperative. At 1 week, 58% (n = 18) of eyes included in the series had complete resolution of inflammation. At 1 month, 97% (n = 30) showed complete resolution of inflammation; there was 1 subject with evidence of 0.5+ AC cells at the 1-month visit. No eyes required additional or adjunct therapy for control of inflammation. There was no significant difference in the degree of inflammation between the POD1 and the same-day group at 1 day (p = 0.17), 1 week (p = 0.27) or 1 month (p = 0.32). Table 2 compares the presence of anterior chamber inflammation at each time point.

Table 2
Summary of the Presence of Anterior Chamber Inflammation at Each Time Point

In the POD1 group, at 1 week, there were no instances of IOP elevation > 10 mmHg above baseline. No eyes were treated with additional IOP-lowering medication. The mean IOP at 1 week and 1 month was 14.3 ± 4.4 mmHg and 13.1 ± 4.1 mmHg, respectively. In this cohort, at 1 week and 1 month, 100% of the subjects reported complete absence of pain.

There were no canalicular-related complications or adverse events related to implantation of the depot in either group. No patients in either the POD1 or same-day group required removal of the insert.

### Retrospective study of a sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for treatment of ocular inflammation after cataract and corneal surgery [^112HQHg8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Inflammation management is a vital part of an eye surgeon's post-surgery recovery plan for patients undergoing cataract or corneal surgeries. Topical administration of corticosteroids has long been the standard method for combating inflammation following eye surgery; however, it is not without its drawbacks. Topical steroid administration has been found to potentially delay corneal epithelial healing, as well as reduce the immunological competence of the eye. In addition, many patients struggle to adhere to the complex topical steroid regimens, preventing them from realizing the full recovery potential that the regimens were designed to deliver. Dextenza is an alternative method for corticosteroid delivery to ocular tissues post cataract or corneal surgery. This intracanalicular insert is designed to deliver preservative free dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to thirty days, mitigating the effects of volatile patient compliance. Previous studies exploring the safety and efficacy of Dextenza, by monitoring adverse events, ocular pain and inflammation found significant reductions in inflammation and ocular pain in study groups that received Dextenza. This study differs from the previous studies exploring Dextenza, by assessing its safety and effectiveness in patients who have undergone corneal transplantation surgeries.

The Dextenza insert was evaluated for both its effectiveness and safety as a corticosteroid delivery system in the post-operative recovery regimens of 18 patients who underwent cataract extraction, and 6 patients who underwent corneal surgeries. The goal was to evaluate this therapy as adjunctive to topical therapy in order to decrease the total drop burden experienced by patients. Dextenza was found to be effective in reducing AC inflammation following cataract or corneal surgery. In the cataract surgery arm, 17 of the 18 patients who underwent cataract extraction had AC cell grades equal to 0 between 2 and 6 weeks post-cataract surgery, indicating that no AC cells were visualized in those patients. One of the patients had an AC cell grade of 0.5+ (less than five cells visualized in the AC),3-months post-cataract surgery. In the corneal surgery arm, all examined patients had AC cell grades equal to 0 at the 1 week post-corneal surgery time point. None of the patients in the cataract or corneal surgery arms showed evidence of AC flare from the first post-surgery day, and none of the patients experienced rebound inflammation.

### Treatment outcomes in birdshot chorioretinitis: corticosteroid sparing, corticosteroid discontinuation, remission, and relapse [^114efehL]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe treatment-related outcomes among patients with birdshot chorioretinitis (BSCR).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

Patients diagnosed with BSCR at 2 tertiary care academic medical centers.

Methods

Clinical and treatment-related data were collected for all patients with BSCR diagnosed between 2003 and 2017 at the 2 centers and for each eye at each clinical visit.

Main Outcome Measures

Four outcomes were considered: (1) corticosteroid-sparing success, defined as inactive disease and prednisone dose of ≤ 7.5 mg/day; (2) corticosteroid-discontinuation success, defined as inactive disease and discontinuation of prednisone; (3) sustained drug-free remission, defined as inactive disease off all medications for ≥ 3 months; and (4) relapse of BSCR after remission.

Results

A total of 107 patients with BSCR were identified, of whom 94 had follow-up data. Corticosteroid-sparing success was achieved in 95.4% of the oral corticosteroid-treated patients at a rate of 0.60 successes per person-year (PY) (95% CI: 0.50/PY, 0.70/PY). The median time to corticosteroid-sparing success was 12 months. Corticosteroids were discontinued successfully in 76.5% of oral corticosteroid-treated patients (rate = 0.28/PY; 95% CI: 0.21/PY, 0.35/PY). The median time to successful corticosteroid discontinuation was 2.0 years. A sustained drug-free remission was achieved in 24 patients (rate = 0.06/PY; 95% CI: 0.04/PY, 0.09/PY), with approximately 25% of patients achieving remission by 4 years of follow-up. Relapse of inflammation in patients after achieving a sustained, drug-free remission occurred at a rate of 0.24/PY (95% CI: 0.14/PY, 0.37/PY).

Conclusions

Successful corticosteroid sparing and discontinuation was achieved in the majority of patients with BSCR. Remission occurred less often, but data were limited by the time needed to induce a remission (4 years) and the amount of follow-up (median, 4.6 years). The relapse rate after a remission was 0.24/PY.

### A very early steroid responder after cataract surgery: a case report [^114gDdaS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

According to Pohjalainen et al. transient IOP peaks the day after cataract surgery are common in nonglaucomatous PXF eyes. The fact that the surgery was performed with a pupil dilation ring in this case may have contributed to an even greater release of inflammatory mediators in the eye with PXF. However, if PXF was the only cause of the early elevation of IOP in this case, the IOP should not have increased after the paracentesis procedure the day after surgery. The absence of IOP elevation after surgery in the left eye, for which the perioperative care was identical apart from the exclusion of steroid eye drops in the postoperative eye drops, proved that this patient was a steroid responder. Although IOP was not monitored, patient reports of blurred vision and eye pain appearing shortly after administration of the eye drops also support this claim. The IOP was 65 mmHg the day after surgery, 53 mmHg the following day, and 37 mmHg on the fourth postoperative day, suggesting that steroid side effects and PXF were the main causes of the increased IOP on the day after surgery and the following day, while the increase on the fourth postoperative day was due to the steroid response. The lower IOP on postoperative Day 4 may be due to the reduction in inflammatory mediators in the eye due to the paracentesis.

### Safety and efficacy of 0.1% nepafenac versus 1% prednisolone acetate eye drops after laser peripheral iridotomy: a prospective, randomized trial [^114prrKH]. Ophthalmology: Glaucoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare 0.1% nepafenac, a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drop, with 1% prednisolone acetate in controlling inflammation after neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in primary angle-closure suspects (PACS).

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Participants

One hundred fifty-two PACS undergoing bilateral LPI.

Methods

Patients were randomized to 0.1% nepafenac or 1% prednisolone acetate eye drops in both eyes. Medications were given 4 times daily for 7 days, then twice daily for additional 7 days. Investigators were masked to the type of medication. Right eyes in patients with bilateral PACS and the PACS eye in asymmetrical disease (primary angle closure in fellow eye) were analyzed.

Main Outcome Measures

Noninferior control of inflammation, defined as absence of cell in the anterior chamber at 2 weeks and absence of rebound iritis with medication discontinuation, was the primary outcome, whereas difference in the rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) was a secondary outcome.

Results

Both groups were comparable in baseline characteristics, including IOP and total laser energy. Nepafenac was noninferior to prednisolone with regard to inflammation control, with 1 nepafenac-treated eye (1.3%) not meeting the primary end point because of 1+ anterior chamber cell at 2 weeks and 4 prednisolone-treated eyes (5.4%) failing to meet the primary end point because of rebound iritis (P < 0.001). A greater increase in IOP from baseline to 2 weeks was observed in the prednisolone group compared with the nepafenac group (+2.6 mmHg vs. +0.6 mmHg; P = 0.004), although at 4 weeks, IOP was not significantly different than baseline in either group (P > 0.05 for both). Two weeks after LPI, 3 nepafenac-treated eyes and 10 prednisolone-treated eyes demonstrated a 6- to 15-mmHg IOP elevation from baseline (P = 0.10), whereas 2 prednisolone-treated eyes and no nepafenac-treated eyes showed IOP elevation of more than 15 mmHg (P = 0.20). Four weeks after LPI, more prednisolone-treated eyes showed IOP elevation of 6 to 15 mmHg as compared with nepafenac-treated eyes (6 eyes vs. 1 eye; P = 0.04); no eyes showed IOP elevation of more than 15 mmHg.

Conclusions

Nepafenac was noninferior to prednisolone in controlling inflammation after LPI in PACS.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^111xu8Md]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Extent and severity of uveitis and associated inflammation

In general, isolated uncomplicated anterior uveitis (whether unilateral or bilateral) can often be managed by topical therapy alone; frequent topical corticosteroids are used for rescue treatment, and then titrated down to complete cessation (in acute disease) or to a low frequency maintenance regimen (chronic disease or frequent recurrences); a mydriatic is commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of posterior synechiae.

In cases of posterior segment uveitis (intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis), the topical route provides inadequate penetration to the inflamed tissue, although topical therapies may still have an adjunctive role. For these cases, the choice of treatment will depend on whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is isolated or is a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory process. Unilateral and, increasingly, bilateral disease may be treated by local therapies (peribulbar, sub-Tenon's, or intravitreal routes); corticosteroids are the most common drugs given by these routes although the role of other agents (see "Update on drugs currently in development stages for uveitis treatment" section for further details) are also being assessed. Local therapy may be sufficient to control the disease, but in more severe inflammation, or in the presence of systemic disease, systemic therapy is likely to be necessary. In addition, there may be contraindications to the use of local therapies in some cases.

Recognition and treatment of any associated systemic disease is a priority. Therapy initiated for coexistent systemic inflammatory disease may ameliorate any active uveitis, reducing the need for direct ophthalmic intervention. Once again, rescue therapy is traditionally performed with corticosteroids (either intravenous or oral), with maintenance therapy comprising either a lower dose of corticosteroid or a steroid-sparing IMT agent. The range of steroid-sparing IMT agents available (including biologics) is steadily increasing, although the evidence of their efficacy and safety in uveitis is often lacking. Current options include antimetabolites (such as methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil), T-cell inhibitors (such as cyclosporine), and alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide). More recently, biological therapies (such as infliximab) have been utilized in the management of severe and refractory uveitis.–A brief discussion of such agents is included in the next section.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1161wQSg]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis follow-up and corticosteroid management — Patients with severe disease who have corneal epithelial ulceration or membranous conjunctivitis should be re-evaluated within 1 week, and patients prescribed prolonged topical corticosteroids should be monitored by periodically measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupillary dilation to evaluate for glaucoma and cataract; topical corticosteroids should be tapered once inflammation is controlled. Patients who are not treated with topical corticosteroids should return for follow-up if symptoms persist after 2 to 3 weeks, and the follow-up visit should include an interval history, measurement of visual acuity, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. During follow-up, evaluate for corneal subepithelial infiltrates, which typically occur 1 or more weeks after the onset of conjunctivitis; in mild cases observation is sufficient, while in cases with blurring, photophobia, and decreased vision, topical corticosteroids at the minimum effective dose may be considered, and cyclosporine drops ranging from commercially available concentrations of 0.05% to higher compounded dosages of 1% have been found to be a helpful alternative in reducing subepithelial infiltrates. Patients being treated with topical corticosteroids should have the dosage slowly tapered to the minimum effective dose; corticosteroids with poor ocular penetration including fluorometholone or site-specific corticosteroids such as loteprednol may be less likely to result in elevated IOP or cataract formation; follow-up examinations should be conducted regularly and should include interval history, visual acuity, IOP, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, noting that recurrence of subepithelial infiltrates has been reported in patients with a history of adenoviral infection who have undergone photorefractive keratectomy or LASIK.

### Dexamethasone intracanalicular insert versus standard topical steroids for the prophylaxis of inflammation after cataract surgery [^116BQk9C]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of an intracanalicular dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DII) to a topical prednisolone acetate 1% taper for preventing breakthrough inflammation (iritis or cystoid macular edema [CME]) during the first postoperative month (POM1) after cataract surgery.

Design

Retrospective, nonrandomized comparative interventional study.

Methods

Patients received either DII or topical prednisolone acetate 1% eyedrops (control) during POM1. Exclusion criteria included history of iritis, glaucoma, intraoperative posterior capsular rupture or vitreous prolapse, immediate postoperative anterior chamber inflammation requiring treatment, or less than 1 month follow-up postoperatively. Outcomes included development of breakthrough inflammation after > 3 days postoperatively necessitating additional antiinflammatory drops, CME, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) at POM1.

Results

A total of 266 eyes of 174 patients were included in the DII group and 258 eyes of 167 patients in the control group. Demographics, comorbidities, and baseline IOP were comparable between groups. The breakthrough inflammation rate was significantly higher in the DII group compared to control (9.0% vs 3.1%; P < .01); CME rates were similar between groups (4.9% vs 4.3%; p = 0.75). There were no cases of increased IOP > 10 mm Hg at POM1 compared to baseline in either group.

Conclusions

After cataract surgery, DII demonstrated a higher rate of breakthrough inflammation than a standard topical steroid regimen with no significant differences in CME rate or IOP increase; however, overall, the rate of postoperative complications was low. DII can be a safe and effective alternative to topical corticosteroid therapy after cataract surgery.

### A very early steroid responder after cataract surgery: a case report [^1151NvQr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

After completion of the surgery, the patient was placed in a sitting position in the operating room and the nurse administered the first postoperative eye drops. The postoperative drops consisted of betamethasone sodium phosphate (steroid), moxifloxacin hydrochloride (antibiotic), and nepafenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). The drops were administered at 5-minute intervals. The patient was told to self-administer the drops before bedtime and the next morning before visiting the clinic. After a short rest in the recovery room, the patient was allowed to return home.

The morning after surgery, the patient was examined at 9 am. The IOP in the right eye was 65 mmHg with corneal oedema (Fig. 1). Although it was difficult to identify due to corneal oedema, and convection of the anterior chamber aqueous humour was also observed. The patient reported right ocular pain. Although lowering IOP with topical and/or systemic pharmacotherapy has also been used, the posterior lip of the main incision made during surgery was pushed down with a fine needle to drain the anterior chamber aqueous humour, which is the recommended paracentesis procedure when the postoperative IOP is 28 mmHg or higher. The leaking fluid was aqueous and did not appear to be residual OVD. After the procedure, the IOP dropped to 9 mmHg. After confirming that there was no leakage of aqueous humour, from the wound by slit-lamp examination, the patient was instructed to continue eye drop treatment and to visit the doctor the next morning. When the patient was seen the next morning, the IOP was 53 mmHg and corneal oedema was again observed. The patient reported that he had begun to notice blurred vision and ocular pain after the eye drops were applied the previous afternoon. The same treatment as the previous day was performed, and the IOP was reduced to 8 mmHg. As the increase in IOP was suspected to result from a steroid response, the patient was instructed to discontinue steroid eye drops only. When he visited the clinic the next morning, his IOP was 12 mmHg and no corneal oedema was observed. As the postoperative inflammation was also reduced and appeared to be under control, the patient was instructed to return to the clinic four days later, which was the scheduled surgery date for the left eye. However, the next day, the patient came to the clinic with a main complaint of blurred vision and eye pain. The night before, the patient had mistakenly put steroid drops in his right eye, and the symptoms reappeared thereafter. The corneal oedema was mild, but the IOP was 37 mmHg. At his request, the paracentesis procedure was performed. Three days later, the patient was seen for surgery on the left eye, and the IOP of the right eye was 14 mmHg (Fig. 2). Fundus examination revealed the appearance of an optic disc haemorrhage, which was not observed preoperatively (Fig. 3). A visual field examination revealed a visual field defect (Fig. 4). The same day, left eye surgery was performed as scheduled, using the same technique as for the right eye. No surgical complications occurred. No postoperative steroid eye drops were administered, and no increase in IOP was observed in either eye after the next day. At the 1-week postoperative visit, the corrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, and the IOP was 12 mmHg in the right eye and 16 mmHg in the left eye. By that time, the postoperative inflammation had largely subsided. No visual field defects were observed in the left eye on visual field examination. The patient was then followed up for one month after surgery.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116qPLBs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV — HSV stromal keratitis management — topical steroid regimen with systemic antiviral prophylaxis, avoidance of prolonged topical antivirals, and ophthalmology oversight. For patients who also have stromal keratitis, largely due to inflammation rather than replicating virus, topical steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Prednisolone 1% eye drops (1 drop to affected eye 6–8 times a day) is given for at least 10 weeks, followed by a slow taper. Steroids should be given in conjunction with acyclovir 400 mg twice daily (AII) or valacyclovir 500 mg daily (AIII) for at least one year to decrease the risk of recurrent stromal inflammation. Topical antivirals should not be used for extended durations to prevent recurrence, as this can cause toxicity to the eye that can be confused with persistent infection. As HSV keratitis exists along a continuum between epithelial viral replication and stromal inflammation, all cases should be managed by an ophthalmologist (AIII).

### Evaluation of same-day versus next-day implantation of intracanalicular dexamethasone for the control of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery [^112dCLtM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sustained-release intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for postoperative inflammation and pain implanted in a clinical setting preoperatively or on postoperative day 1.

Methods

Single-site, retrospective, contralateral eye study of patients undergoing cataract surgery. Included were subjects with a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert implanted in the clinic immediately prior to surgery in one eye (same-day) and on postoperative day 1 (POD1) in the contralateral eye. The primary outcome measure was the resolution of anterior chamber inflammation at 1 week postoperative. Secondary outcome measures included proportion of eyes requiring additional therapy for pain and inflammation through 1 month as well as the number of eyes with IOP spikes above baseline. Safety measures included adverse events through 1 month postoperative.

Results

Sixty-two eyes of 31 subjects were included in the case series. At 1 week postoperative, 52% of the eyes (n = 16) achieved complete resolution of inflammation in the same-day group and 58% (n = 18) met this endpoint at 1 week in the POD1 group. One subject in the same-day group required additional therapy for rebound inflammation and no eyes required additional therapy in the POD1 group. There were no reports of pain at 1 week or 1 month in either group. There were no implant-related adverse events in either group.

Conclusion

The favorable results of this study indicate that the sustained-release dexamethasone insert can be safely implanted in the clinic either preoperatively on the day of surgery or on postoperative day 1 for the control of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.
