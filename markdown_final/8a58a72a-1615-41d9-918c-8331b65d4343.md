## Question

For a 3-year-old child who fell and has a closed both bone fracture, what pertinent history should be obtained?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pertinent history to obtain in a 3-year-old with a closed both-bone fracture after a fall, with emphasis on plausibility of mechanism and the threshold for an abuse evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical context and priorities in a pediatric trauma presentation. Then, I should verify the injury mechanism details and biomechanical plausibility. Next, I will review witness accounts, timing, and story consistency. After that, I need to check for prior trauma, medical conditions affecting bone integrity, and developmental status. I will then assess social and environmental context. Subsequently, I should synthesize red flags and decide about further workup, including imaging aligned with child abuse protocols. Finally, I will outline key documentation points, safety planning, and follow-up, integrating evidence-based thresholds for action.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and immediate priorities. A "both-bone" fracture in a 3-year-old typically means radius and ulna or tibia and fibula; at this age, forearm fractures from low-height falls are common, but I need to ensure the initial trauma evaluation addresses airway, breathing, and circulation while simultaneously keeping a high index of suspicion for inflicted injury when red flags are present. I should confirm that the child's developmental abilities make the reported mechanism plausible and that early analgesia and immobilization are provided while the history is gathered in parallel with the secondary survey [^115HHLdK] [^112111j8].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic history in detail; wait, let me verify exactly what elements improve plausibility assessment. I need to document the child's activity at the time, the precise height of the fall, the surface characteristics, the limb position at impact, and the first point of contact, because a fall onto an outstretched hand commonly produces distal radius and ulna fractures in children. I should be specific about heights and surfaces, distinguishing a couch onto carpet versus playground equipment onto concrete, and note whether an outstretched hand versus direct blow was described, as these details align injury patterns with expected biomechanics in pediatric forearm trauma [^112HCqvh] [^112aX5hU].

> Hold on, I should verify biomechanical compatibility rather than assume it. A fall onto an outstretched hand is consistent with a both-bone forearm fracture in active toddlers, but I must confirm the described mechanism matches the fracture type, location, and displacement, and that the energy transfer is reasonable for the stated height and surface. Initially, I thought "short falls rarely cause severe fractures", but wait, I should double-check that; the cited literature shows mortality from short falls under 1.5 meters is extremely rare, which does not exclude extremity fractures from low-height falls, so I should correct my wording to "short falls are rarely fatal, but can produce extremity fractures like distal radius and ulna in children", and then reassess whether this specific pattern is concordant with the account provided [^114aJ2MV] [^112aX5hU] [^112HCqvh].

> I need to ensure the witness status and timing are carefully documented; let me think about red flags tied to these features. I should confirm whether the event was witnessed and by whom, reconcile independent accounts, record the exact time of injury, and calculate the time to presentation, because significant unexplained delays or conflicting stories heighten concern. If the event was unwitnessed, I should document the reason for the child being unsupervised and for how long, noting that delayed presentation and inconsistent narratives are commonly categorized as suspicious features in plausibility assessments for abuse and are overrepresented in abused pediatric major trauma cohorts [^117QmKer] [^112111j8] [^1119KMvt].

> Next, I should review prior injuries and medical history; hold on, I should verify risk factors that meaningfully increase suspicion. I will ask about previous fractures, head injuries, bruising, or emergency visits, and look for physical or radiographic evidence of prior trauma, because prior injury significantly increases the risk of maltreatment recurrence. I should also screen for bone fragility conditions and medication exposures, and confirm developmental milestones to ensure the mechanism is consistent with the child's motor abilities, as underlying bone disease and non-ambulatory status alter the probability of accidental fracture plausibility [^1134Csj3] [^11148DSN] [^112HCqvh].

> I will now examine the social and environmental context; wait, I need to check for hazards and social stressors linked with injury patterns. I should document the caregiving arrangement and supervision at the time of injury, environmental hazards such as stairs and windows, safety measures in the home, and socioeconomic stresses or prior child protective services involvement, because fall mechanisms and injury severity in infants and toddlers correlate with age, environment, and socioeconomic factors, and prior CPS interaction is associated with recurrence risk [^111dEWtJ] [^117SE2aZ] [^115N7513].

> Let me synthesize abuse red flags systematically before deciding next steps. Major red flags include a mechanism inconsistent with the child's developmental ability or the fracture pattern, unwitnessed events without a plausible explanation, unexplained delays in seeking care, conflicting histories, evidence of prior unexplained injuries, or associated injuries such as rib, head, or abdominal trauma suggesting polytrauma. Minor red flags include vague or evasive answers or caregiver responses focused on avoiding reporting. I should confirm that the presence of these findings lowers the threshold for initiating a multidisciplinary child protection workup in accordance with pediatric abuse imaging and clinical guidance [^112111j8] [^112Norxs] [^114ENhH5].

> Now, I need to check evidence-based guidance for imaging when abuse is suspected, and I should verify whether a skeletal survey is indicated at this age. For children with concerning features, recommended protocols emphasize a standardized skeletal survey and targeted neuroimaging, though the yield of skeletal survey diminishes after age 2 and should be individualized in older toddlers; if red flags are present, a skeletal survey may still be appropriate, whereas if the mechanism is clear and plausible, dedicated imaging of the injured extremity is sufficient. I should ensure alignment with contemporary ESR and ACR practice recommendations while considering the child's age and specific clinical findings [^113p6bc3] [^113JC24Y] [^113JC24Y].

> For this 3-year-old with a suspected both-bone forearm fracture and a developmentally plausible, well-corroborated mechanism, I should confirm that dedicated forearm radiographs are typically adequate, reserving broader imaging for cases with red flags or additional injuries. If the story is consistent and the exam localizes to the forearm without other concerning findings, further whole-skeleton imaging is usually unnecessary, whereas discordant findings should prompt expansion of the imaging scope and multidisciplinary consultation [^111GRPPr] [^113p6bc3].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision threshold for routine abuse evaluation in this specific scenario. The EAST/PTS/REHS guidance emphasizes routine abuse evaluation in children under 18 months with humeral or femoral fractures, and in children under 3 years with rib fractures, absent an independently verified incident; for a 3-year-old with a both-bone forearm fracture, routine abuse evaluation is not automatic if the event is plausible and verified, but any red flags should lower the threshold for a full workup. If uncertainty persists, I should consult a child abuse pediatrician and consider structured risk stratification models derived for specific fracture types to frame decision-making, recognizing these models are best validated in younger ages and specific long-bone sites like the femur [^112111j8] [^111yZqF2].

> I should double-check my documentation approach to ensure medicolegal adequacy. I will record verbatim caregiver quotes, explicitly note inconsistencies, describe demeanor objectively, and diagram injury locations. If a skeletal survey is undertaken, I should ensure adherence to standardized protocols and high-quality image acquisition, recognizing prior variability and the demonstrated improvements in content and quality after guideline implementation, which supports reliable second-opinion review and reduces missed occult injuries [^1154vDSE] [^116Bg9TD].

> Next, I should review safety planning and follow-up, because even when initial concerns are low, recurrent injury risk exists and may escalate. I will provide anticipatory guidance on supervision and environmental modifications, arrange timely clinical follow-up, and maintain a low threshold for re-evaluation if new concerns arise, given the documented recurrence patterns and the potential for increasing severity over time in children with repeated suspected maltreatment events [^111Rr1XW] [^113qoF8v].

> Finally, I need to ensure my history-taking remains comprehensive and focused. I will ask the caregiver to walk me through the event step by step, clarify who witnessed it and what each person saw, specify the exact timing and any reasons for delay in seeking care, and review prior injuries, medical history affecting bone health, and social stressors that might impact supervision. I should confirm that my synthesis ties the mechanism, developmental ability, fracture pattern, and contextual factors together, and that my plan aligns with pediatric fracture and child abuse clinical recommendations [^112HCqvh] [^112111j8].

For a 3-year-old with a closed both-bone forearm fracture following a fall, the pertinent history must establish mechanism plausibility and screen for non-accidental trauma [^113p6bc3] [^112HCqvh]. Key elements include the exact mechanism; height; surface; object involved; whether the fall was witnessed and by whom; timing of injury and any delay in seeking care [^117QmKer]; prior injuries or fractures [^114ENhH5]; and any inconsistencies in the caregiver's account [^117QmKer]. Additionally, document the child's developmental level and ambulatory status, and assess for underlying bone disease or metabolic conditions [^11148DSN]. A detailed, consistent, and plausible history is essential to guide management and safeguard the child [^112111j8].

---

## Mechanism of injury

- **Exact mechanism**: Obtain a detailed description of how the fall occurred, including the child's activity at the time, the height of the fall, the surface landed on, and any objects involved [^112aX5hU].

- Witnessed vs. unwitnessed: Determine whether the fall was witnessed, and if so, by whom. Unwitnessed injuries or inconsistent caregiver accounts [^114nipRa] raise suspicion for non-accidental trauma (NAT).

- **Plausibility of mechanism**: Assess whether the described mechanism is consistent with the injury pattern [^111yZqF2]. Implausible mechanisms or inconsistent histories are red flags for abuse [^114ENhH5].

---

## Timing and delay in presentation

Document the exact time of injury and any delay in seeking care between the injury and presentation [^111yZqF2]; an unexplained delay is suspicious for abuse [^1119KMvt].

---

## Prior injuries and medical history

- **Previous fractures or injuries**: Inquire about any prior fractures or injuries, including their circumstances and explanations provided [^114ENhH5].

- **Underlying medical conditions**: Assess for medical conditions that predispose to fractures, such as osteogenesis imperfecta or metabolic bone disease [^11148DSN].

- **Developmental history**: Document the child's developmental milestones, ambulatory status, and ability to perform activities consistent with the described mechanism [^111dEWtJ].

---

## Social and environmental factors

Assess social and environmental factors by evaluating the consistency of caregiver accounts; inconsistent or evolving explanations increase suspicion for abuse [^114nipRa]. Also review the household environment, including supervision, presence of hazards, and socioeconomic contributors to injury risk [^111dEWtJ]. Document any prior involvement with child protective services and any history of domestic violence [^115N7513].

---

## Red flags for non-accidental trauma (NAT)

- **Inconsistent or implausible history**: Discrepancies between caregiver accounts or mechanisms inconsistent with injury patterns [^114nipRa].

- **Delayed presentation**: Unexplained delays in seeking medical care [^1119KMvt] [^111yZqF2].

- **Multiple or prior injuries**: History of multiple fractures or injuries, especially in non-ambulatory children [^114ENhH5].

- **Caregiver behavior**: Defensive, evasive, or inconsistent caregiver behavior [^117QmKer].

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^117QmKer]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Data parameters collected from the patients' medical records included age at the time of injury, gender, insurance status, presence of polytrauma (another long bone, clavicle, or axial skeletal fracture, or other body system injury that would require hospitalization), and physical and/or radiographic evidence of prior trauma. Furthermore, one of the authors, who was blinded to the SCAN status of patients, examined the paper and electronic medical records of the children and briefly described the history of each patient. Subsequently, this author categorized in a separate list the plausibility of each patient's history as either suspicious for abuse (unwitnessed accident, witnessed abuse, delayed presentation greater than 48 hours, a mechanism that would not normally cause a fracture, or different stories provided by different witnesses) or consistent with accidental trauma in cases where these criteria were not fulfilled. The list was then transferred to the database.

Two other authors reviewed the patient histories to determine if they were consistent with accidental trauma or suspicious for abuse. An intraclass correlation coefficient was generated based on average measures (ICC 0.902, p value < 0.001), indicating agreement. Since many of the original radiographs for patients were no longer available, we examined radiology reports to determine the location of the femur fracture in all patients. The fractures were classified as "proximal", "diaphyseal", or "distal" (each representing roughly one-third of the length of the femur).

### The initial approach to the multisystem pediatric trauma patient [^115HHLdK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022).

Trauma remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and youth aged 1 to 19 years in the United States. Providing timely care with a systematic approach is essential for emergently addressing life-threatening injuries and ongoing assessment. The primary survey focuses on identifying and managing life-threatening injuries, while the secondary survey is concerned with identifying and managing other significant injuries.

Over the past decade, important advances have been made in the evidence supporting the management of multisystem trauma in pediatric patients by emergency medicine clinicians. Additionally, the emergence of diagnostics, such as point-of-care ultrasound, aids decision-making in evaluating and managing pediatric trauma patients. The purpose of this article is to review the initial systematic diagnostic approach and the emergent management of multisystem injuries from blunt force trauma in children in the emergency department and provide insight into the aspects of care that are still evolving.

### Risk factors for recurrent injuries in victims of suspected non-accidental trauma: A retrospective cohort study [^1134Csj3]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

This study used enrollment data and facility and professional claims data from January 2007 to December 2011 for children born during this time period. We identified all children with a birth record claim who also had at least one claim indicating a diagnosis of abuse (physical, emotional, or neglect) or a skeletal survey at a non-birth-related episode of care. Suspected non-accidental trauma (NAT) events were defined as episodes of care in which a claim contained either (a) an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnosis code specific for child abuse, (b) a Procedural Terminology (CPT) coded skeletal survey, or (c) ICD-9 coded injuries suspicious for abuse; these events could be the event that brought the child into the study cohort, or they could occur either before or after that event.

We excluded events that had an ICD-9 E-code for a trauma mechanism that could explain the injury or an ICD-9 code for an underlying medical illness that could explain the injury or need for a skeletal survey. Episodes of care coded as follow-up care were excluded. Episodes of care with only a diagnosis of minor cutaneous injury from a specific mechanism and no other codes indicative of suspected NAT were also excluded.

In order to include all claims for care related to a single incident of suspected NAT, an episode of care encompassed all claims for service provided concurrently or within two days of the care documented in the claim. In order to minimize the risk of defining claims for follow-up care as new events…

### Predictors of increasing injury severity across suspected recurrent episodes of non-accidental trauma: A retrospective cohort study [^113qoF8v]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study used administrative claims data from a pediatric Medicaid accountable care organization to identify factors associated with escalating severity of injury in children with multiple events of suspected non-accidental trauma (NAT). Factors associated with escalating severity in this study include living in a rural area and having "minor" injuries such as an open wound or superficial injury. Conversely, having more injuries is associated with a decreased risk for more severe subsequent events. These findings identify potential biases and/or resource issues in the response of the medical and child welfare systems to children who present with less severe injuries and suggest that these systems need to better identify potential victims of abuse presenting with minor injuries to prevent subsequent, more severe episodes of potential NAT.

Future steps may require increased resources but could include raising awareness through education that when treating minor injuries in young children, abuse should always be considered because of the risk for recurrent events with worse injuries. In addition, a systematized process to screen for abuse in injured young children (e.g. a screening tool) should be considered by all providers treating children.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^111Xebc8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Raw data from the databases were pooled, and means, standard deviations (SDs), and/or percentages were calculated for variables including age at time of injury, gender, insurance status, presence of polytrauma, and evidence of prior trauma (physical and/or radiographic). They also considered history plausibility (consistent with accidental trauma or suspicious for abuse) and the radiographic location of the femur fracture (proximal, diaphyseal, distal).

The age data were skewed, leading to the use of the Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples to determine if there was a difference in age at the time of injury between the child abuse cases and accidental trauma patients. The chi-square test with Yates' correction for independence or the Fisher's exact test, where chi-square assumptions were violated, was used to determine differences in binary variables. Binary logistic regression was applied to calculate adjusted odds ratios for a femur fracture representing abuse as opposed to accidental trauma. The risk factors considered included age at time of injury, gender, insurance status, presence of polytrauma, physical and/or radiographic evidence of prior trauma, history plausibility, and femur fracture location. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated for proportions, and interquartile ranges were used for median values.

### Non-accidental trauma: The role of radiology [^112Norxs]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Non-accidental trauma is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. Given the vulnerable state of the child, the radiologist can often provide valuable diagnostic information in the setting of suspected abuse. This review focuses on common findings of abusive trauma and serves as a guide to aid in clinical decision-making for providers of emergency medicine and pediatrics. Amid this discussion is an assessment of modern controversies regarding reported mimicking pathologies, recapitulation of the state of evidence with respect to radiologic findings of abuse, and examination of the contribution that spine imaging may add to the diagnosis of possible abusive head trauma in the acutely injured child. Recommendations for avoiding pitfalls regarding the dating of intracranial injuries are discussed, and illustrated depictions of perpetrator-induced pathology are provided to aid in the understanding of these injuries. Through the use of the appropriate approach to imaging and evidence-based guidelines regarding radiologic findings, the role of radiology is to provide fundamental clues to diagnose and prevent recurrence of abusive injury in patients who cannot speak for themselves.

### Major trauma from suspected child abuse: A profile of the patient pathway [^1119KMvt]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Networked organized systems of care for patients with major trauma now exist in many countries, designed around the needs of the majority of patients (90% adults). Non-accidental injury is a significant cause of pediatric major trauma and has a different injury and age profile from accidental injury (AI). This paper compares the prehospital and in-hospital phases of the patient pathway for children with suspected abuse with those accidentally injured.

- **Methods**: The pediatric database of the national trauma registry of England as well as Wales, Trauma Audit and Research Network, was interrogated from April 2012 (the launch of the major trauma networks) to June 2015, comparing the patient pathway for cases of suspected child abuse (SCA) with AI.

- **Results**: In the study population of 7,825 children, 7,344 (94%) were classified as AI, and 481 (6%) as SCA. SCA cases were younger (median 0.4 years vs. 7 years for AI), had a higher Injury Severity Score (median 16 vs. 9 for AI), and had nearly three times higher mortality (5.7% vs. 2.2% for AI). Other differences included presentation to hospital evenly throughout the day and year, arrival by non-ambulance means to hospital (74%), and delayed presentation to hospital from the time of injury (median 8 hours vs. 1.8 hours for AI). Despite more severe injuries, these infants were less likely to receive key interventions in a timely manner. Only 20% arrived at a designated pediatric-capable major trauma center. Secondary transfer to specialist care, if needed, took a median of 21.6 hours from injury (vs. 13.8 hours for AI).

### Validating scoring systems for fracture healing in infants and young children: Pilot study [^1144ZGdj]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Child abuse is estimated to affect 55 million children each year in Europe, with skeletal injuries being a common finding. Radiologic imaging is, therefore, key in diagnosis. Radiologists must interpret radiographs to identify fracture location and type, which, in turn, suggest the possible mechanism of injury. In cases of suspected child abuse, histories are often inaccurate or absent, and injuries unwitnessed. Therefore, it may be difficult to accurately define when a fracture has occurred, in which situation radiologic dating is required to either confirm or refute the account of when the injury occurred and thus identify or eliminate potential perpetrators.

It is accepted that time frames for stages of fracture healing change with age. There are only a few studies that analyze fractures in children younger than 3 years old, despite the fact that children in this age range are the most likely to be victims of physical abuse. Dating in this age group is largely based on the personal experience of the reporting radiologist or authors of textbooks in which some guidance on dating is given based on very little primary research. Aiming to avoid pitfalls such as uncertainty over the true fracture date and obscuration of radiologic features by the presence of a plaster cast, recent works from Walters et al. and Fadell et al. analyzed radiographs of birth-related clavicular fractures to identify time frames for stages of fracture healing that could then be applied to the dating of any shaft fractures in cases of suspected child abuse.

### Age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors impacting infant and toddler fall-related trauma [^111dEWtJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize trauma-related falls in infants and toddlers aged 0 to 3 years over a 4-year period and develop a risk stratification model for causes of fall injuries.

- **Methods**: Data on falls among children aged 0 to 3 years from 2009 to 2012 were identified from a Jerusalem tertiary hospital trauma registry (N = 422) and the National Trauma Registry of Israel (N = 4,131).

- **Results**: Almost half of the falls occurred during the first year of life, and 57% of the children were Jewish. The majority of the children lived in low socioeconomic environments, both in the Jewish (59.2%) and Arab (97.6%) samples. Most (74%) of the falls resulted in head injury. A classification and regression tree analysis indicated that falls from furniture were the leading cause of injury in children aged 0 to 12 months (estimated probability of 37.9%), whereas slipping was the leading cause in those aged 13 to 36 months (estimated probability of 38.4%). Age and ethnicity emerged as the leading predictors of the nature of a fall; Injury Severity Score and the child's sex were secondary. Compared with national data, Jerusalem children had a higher incidence of falls from buildings (9.3% vs. 2.4%), a higher moderate-severe Injury Severity Score (> 16), a higher incidence of traumatic brain injury, and a longer hospital length of stay [P < 0.001].

- **Conclusions**: The leading determinants of fall injuries in children below the age of 3 years are age, ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status. Future community outreach interventions should target these risk groups and be tailored to their defining characteristics.

### Annual risk of death resulting from short falls among young children: Less than 1 in 1 million [^114aJ2MV]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of the work was to develop an estimate of the risk of death resulting from short falls of less than 1.5 meters in vertical height, affecting infants and young children between birth and their fifth birthday.

A review of published materials was conducted, including 5 book chapters, 2 medical society statements, 7 major literature reviews, 3 public injury databases, and 177 peer-reviewed articles indexed in the National Library of Medicine.

The California Epidemiology and Prevention for Injury Control Branch injury database yielded 6 possible fall-related fatalities of young children in a population of 2.5 million over a 5-year period. Other databases and literature reviews produced no data indicating a higher short-fall mortality rate. Most publications discussing the risk of death from short falls indicate such deaths are rare. No fall-related deaths have been reliably reported from day care centers.

The best estimate of the mortality rate for short falls affecting infants and young children is less than 0.48 deaths per 1 million young children per year. Additional research is suggested.

### Controversial aspects of imaging in child abuse: A second roundtable discussion from the ESPR child abuse taskforce [^115LEaEu]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Should 'experts' attempt at the time of writing fractures?

An expert witness is appointed to assist the Court in providing advice on matters outside of its knowledge and can be defined as a person whose level of specialized knowledge or skill in a particular field qualifies them to present their opinion about the facts of a case.

In the context of suspected physical abuse, the proceedings aim to determine the facts and to assist the Court in its decision-making concerning the safety and welfare of the child. Regarding the timing or 'dating' of a fracture in these cases, experts appointed by the court may be requested to provide the most likely timeframe for any fracture identified. This opinion is expected to be based upon scientific evidence and not solely on individual clinical experience or knowledge. However, in practice, experts provide their opinion from reporting accidental fractures in children whereby the timing of the injury is known, in addition to a broad knowledge of the published literature. Most experts have a wealth of personal experience in reporting radiographs in children, with the typical radiologist reporting between 2,500 to 6,000 radiographs per annum, amounting to approximately 50,000 to 100,000 radiographs over a 20-year career.

Clinical experience, although helpful, is not accepted by the courts as sufficient; any opinion must be supported by robust published evidence. Yet, as outlined above, the literature on fracture dating is limited, with only seven studies analyzing the rate of fracture healing in the age of children most at risk of physical abuse.

### Observational study of skeletal surveys in suspected non-accidental injury [^1154vDSE]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to document variability in the standard of skeletal surveys received for a second opinion in suspected non-accidental injury (NAI).

- **Materials and methods**: The skeletal surveys of 50 consecutive infants and children under 2 years of age were reviewed. A simple scoring system was developed based on the fulfillment of specific parameters, and each radiograph was assigned a score reflecting its overall clinical quality.

- **Results**: There was an average of 10 radiographs per skeletal survey (ranging from 2 to 13). Of the 50 surveys assessed, there were 37 different combinations, including five babygrams. No survey complied with the draft guidelines of the British Society of Paediatric Radiologists (BSPR).

- **Conclusions**: There is significant variability in skeletal surveys referred for a second opinion in suspected NAI. Standardization of projections and improvement in the quality of radiographs obtained for this indication is required. The study highlights the need for the development and dissemination of definitive national guidelines.

### A national analysis of pediatric falls from a building [^117SE2aZ]. Injury (2021). Low credibility.

Falls remain the leading cause of unintentional pediatric trauma in the United States. Identifying risk factors for pediatric building falls would influence public health policy. We hypothesized that building falls disproportionately affect low-income communities.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Kids' Inpatient Database for the years 2006, 2009, and 2012. We identified cases (age < 12 years) of falls from a building using external cause of injury codes. Patient characteristics and injuries were analyzed using ICD-9 codes. National estimates were obtained using case weighting. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders.

- **Results**: There were 2,294 hospitalizations nationally for pediatric falls from a building. The victims were predominantly male, in early childhood, non-Hispanic White, in the lowest income quartile, resided in urban settings, and these incidents occurred during summer. The mean age was 3.76 years. Logistic regression revealed males were 33% more likely than females, and as compared to non-Hispanic White youth, Black (33%) and Asian or Pacific Islanders (65%) were more likely to experience a fall from a building. Toddlers and those in early childhood were at significantly increased odds compared to those younger than one year old. Children in the highest income quartile were 29% more likely to experience a building fall.

- **Conclusions**: Building falls are a common cause of injury in the U.S. for children under 12 years old. Injury prevention strategies focused on the parents of children aged 1–5 years have the potential to mitigate this risk.

### Evaluating young children with fractures for child abuse: Clinical report [^112HCqvh]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Fractures are common injuries in childhood and can be caused by unintentional injury, medical conditions, and child abuse. Although the consequences of failing to diagnose an abusive injury in a child can be grave, the consequences of incorrectly diagnosing child abuse in a child whose fractures have another etiology are also significant. This report aims to review recent advances in the understanding of fracture specificity, fracture mechanisms, and other medical conditions that predispose infants and children to fracture. This clinical report will aid pediatricians and pediatric care providers in developing an evidence-based differential diagnosis and performing appropriate evaluations when assessing a child with fractures.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^115SV1Gb]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric femoral shaft fractures, specifically concerning harness and casting, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend considering early spica casting or traction followed by delayed spica casting for pediatric patients aged between 6 months and 5 years with diaphyseal femur fractures exhibiting less than 2 cm of shortening.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: Systematic review [^114ENhH5]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal fractures are diagnosed in up to a third of children who have been investigated for physical abuse. The fractures are often occult, and they occur in infants and toddlers who cannot give a causal explanation. Children who have been physically abused represent a small proportion of the total number of childhood fractures. Most children sustain fractures from falls, motor vehicle crashes, or other non-abusive trauma. In addition, a small group of children are more susceptible to fractures due to underlying conditions that contribute to bone fragility. All health professionals who see children should be able to recognize the characteristics of fractures resulting from abuse and initiate child protection investigations where necessary to prevent further injury that could be fatal. In reality, the possibility of child abuse is often overlooked in clinical practice.

We systematically reviewed the published world literature to answer the question, "What features differentiate fractures resulting from abuse from those sustained from other causes?" We aimed to identify indicators that can help clinicians identify cases of suspected child abuse when a child presents with a fracture for which the cause cannot be confirmed. We explore the strengths and limitations of the evidence base and make recommendations for future research in this field. We anticipate that this review will enable the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines. It will also contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the scientific evidence that expert medical professionals rely on.

### Risk factors for recurrent injuries in victims of suspected non-accidental trauma: A retrospective cohort study [^111Rr1XW]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, more than a quarter of children had a recurrent event within just one year of their first event. Risk factors for a recurrent event included having fewer injuries (≤ 2 injuries) or having a dislocation, open wound, or superficial injury at the previous event. These data potentially identify a bias in either the diagnosis of abuse and/or the variable response of child protective services to children based on the number and severity of physically evident injuries. Children with fewer or less severe injuries may not be reported to child protective services or are not removed from the unsafe environment, leading to subsequent events. Identification of these more minor injuries as potential targets for additional screening or referral to child abuse specialists warrants further prospective study.

The study also found that the median length of time between the first and second suspected non-accidental trauma (NAT) events was 191 days (IQR 69, 389). This is important to note because the average length of child protective services involvement with a family may be significantly shorter. In addition, the risk of having a subsequent event increased with each event; 26% of children who experienced a first event proceeded to experience a second event within a year, whereas 60% of children who experienced a fourth event proceeded to experience a fifth event within a year. Understanding both the prolonged length of time between a first and second event, as well as the increasing risks with recurrent events, may inform secondary prevention strategies for both medical and child welfare staff.

### Prevalence of inflicted and neglectful femur shaft fractures in young children in national level I trauma centers [^1111BJN8]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Consider a 14-month-old child admitted to the emergency department with a painful lower extremity. As a physician, you question the caregiver, examine the child, and order the diagnostic tests. The radiograph reveals a diaphyseal femur fracture, prompting an evaluation of whether this fracture was caused by inflicted trauma (including neglect) or accidental trauma. In daily practice, the cause of fracture might not be clear, and physicians have to decide if further investigations are warranted to help differentiate between accidental and inflicted trauma.

To estimate the risk of inflicted trauma, one must possess knowledge of relevant clinical features and the prevalence of inflicted trauma. Physicians must be aware of which indicators increase or decrease the likelihood of inflicted trauma. The prevalence of inflicted or neglectful femur fractures in children varies (1.5–35.2%), with the highest incidence in infants under 12 months old. However, this prevalence is based on a systematic review of small retrospective studies with high heterogeneity.

In our experience, children with a femur fracture are commonly referred for evaluation by the hospital-based Child Abuse and Neglect team. Although a femur fracture can be caused by a low-velocity accident, most physicians refer for a suspected inflicted trauma evaluation, irrespective of the child's ambulatory status. Mitchell et al. recommended a trauma evaluation for children younger than 18 months, while Son-Hing et al. showed little justification for a trauma evaluation in children older than 12 months.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^113RmyKT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. First, our prediction rule was generated from an urban Level I pediatric trauma center. It is unclear if the prediction rule would be different for pediatric patients presenting to lower-level pediatric trauma centers in nonurban environments and/or in different countries. However, our tertiary referral status allows us to say we attract patients from a broad catchment area, hence enhancing our external validity.

Second, it can be argued our assessment of history status (consistent versus suspicious) is subjective. Specifically, arguments for mitigating individual circumstances such as unwitnessed injury could be due to a momentary lapse in supervision; delay in seeking care could be due to lack of health insurance or a child who is not expressing substantial discomfort. However, our criteria for suspicion are consistent with previous reports.

In addition, although our "blinded" rater was instructed to look at only the history and physical records to determine the patient history without viewing other aspects of the medical record, she was not strictly "blind" to the SCAN status of the patient because she had access to the medical record. The use of corroborating investigators with a high intraclass correlation coefficient somewhat mitigates this risk.

Third, as a result of the fact that child abuse is largely a social diagnosis, there exists no test that can confirm the presence or absence of child abuse with a high level of specificity or sensitivity. Yet, we believe evaluation by independent specialists constitutes the best method for assessing such cases.

### Prevalence and relevance of pediatric spinal fractures in suspected child abuse [^116BbFxd]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Spinal fractures are uncommon manifestations of child abuse, and the elimination of the lateral views of the spine from the initial skeletal survey protocol has been recommended.

- **Objective**: To establish the prevalence of spinal fractures detected on skeletal surveys performed for suspected child abuse and their association with intracranial injury (ICI).

- **Materials and methods**: The ACR standardized skeletal surveys and neuroimaging studies of 751 children (ages 0–4 years) were reviewed. A positive skeletal survey was defined as having one or more clinically unsuspected fractures.

- **Results**: Fourteen children had a total of 22 definite spinal fractures. This constituted 1.9% (14/751) of the total cohort, and 9.7% (14/145) of children with a positive skeletal survey. Advanced imaging confirmed the fractures in 13 of the 14 children and demonstrated 12 additional spinal fractures. In five cases, spinal fractures were the only positive skeletal findings. In 71% (10/14) of the children, the spinal fractures were accompanied by ICI. Children with spinal fractures were at significantly greater risk for ICI than those without spinal injury (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Spinal fractures are not rare in children with positive skeletal surveys performed for suspected abuse, and they may be the only indication of skeletal trauma. There is an association between spinal fractures and ICI.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^111yZqF2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse represents a serious threat to the health and well-being of the pediatric population. Orthopaedic specialists often become involved when child abuse is suspected due to the presence of bony injury. Distinguishing abuse from accidental trauma can be difficult and is often based on clinical suspicion.

- **Questions/purposes**: We sought to determine whether accidental femur fractures in pediatric patients younger than age 4 could be distinguished from child abuse using a combination of presumed risk factors from the history, physical examination findings, radiographic findings, and age.

- **Methods**: We searched our institution's SCAN (Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect) and trauma databases. We identified 70 patients whose femur fracture etiology was abuse and compared that group with 139 patients whose femur fracture etiology was accidental trauma.

- **Results**: A history suspicious for abuse, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months were risk factors for abuse. Patients with no risk factors had a 4% chance, patients with one risk factor had a 29% chance, patients with two risk factors had an 87% chance, and patients with all three risk factors had a 92% chance of their femur fracture being a result of abuse.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians can use this predictive model to guide judgment and referral to social services when seeing femur fractures in very young children in the emergency room.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III, diagnostic study. See guidelines for authors for a complete description.

### Avoiding skull radiographs in infants with suspected inflicted injury who also undergo head CT: "a no-brainer?" [^111c962t]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) is defined as an injury to the skull or intracranial contents resulting from blunt impact or violent shaking in children under 2 years of age; injuries from accidental trauma are not included. AHT is a significant concern, with an approximate incidence of nearly 40 cases per 100,000 children. It can have serious consequences, as it is the most common cause of death in inflicted injuries, comprising 80% of deaths from all head trauma in young children. The prognosis is poor for survivors, with abnormal follow-up outcomes observed in 68% of affected children. The outcome is correlated with the severity of the injury, and 40% of survivors suffer from severe neurological deficits. Diagnosis is often missed initially because the presentation of signs and symptoms of an underlying head injury may be delayed.

In 2017, the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) and the Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR) published revised guidelines, endorsed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), titled 'The radiological investigation of suspected physical abuse in children'. The European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) has endorsed the previous, current, and all future versions of this document as the European standard in investigating suspected physical abuse (SPA) in infants and young children. The updated guidelines state that all children under the age of 1 year should have multi-slice computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head, in addition to anteroposterior (AP) and lateral skull radiographs (SXR) performed as part of the initial skeletal survey.

### ESR essentials: Imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European Society of Paediatric Radiology [^112yG1Ko]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a worldwide occurrence that impacts the well-being of millions across the globe. The youngest children are at the highest risk, with severe physical abuse being 120 times more common in infants compared to children over 5 years of age. The abused child is often non-verbal and may present with diffuse and non-specific symptoms of occult injury, particularly in cases of head and abdominal trauma. Consequently, imaging is central to the diagnosis.

This is a challenging area for the general radiologist, not least because it is known to be an area with serious child and family consequences of over- and under-diagnosis, and high litigation rates. Thus, up-to-date evidence and guidelines are essential to ensure uniformly high-quality care based on currently available literature and to enable confident, competent clinical practice. This article provides concise and clinically relevant practice recommendations for the general radiologist to guide the investigation of a child presenting with suspected physical abuse.

### A profile of suspected child abuse as a subgroup of major trauma patients [^114dkj7y]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). High credibility.

Children account for approximately 10% of major trauma cases in developed countries and are known to present differently in the major trauma system compared to adults. Over the past five years, the establishment of Major Trauma Networks has significantly altered the delivery of trauma care in the UK. Preliminary data suggest these changes have led to improved patient outcomes. However, these modifications were based on evidence of improved outcomes in adults, with limited data available regarding the impact of organized trauma systems on pediatric major trauma outcomes.

Within the UK, the national trauma audit is conducted by the Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN), which collects data from 96% of acute hospitals in England as well as Wales, funded through individual hospital membership subscriptions. The TARN report "Severe Injury in Children 2012" identified non-accidental injury (NAI) as a significant cause of injury in children under two years old. This revelation prompted an investigation into whether abused children constitute a distinct subset with different characteristics compared to children injured accidentally.

Research on children who suffer severe injuries due to abuse is limited. The published literature on child abuse often focuses on minor injuries, aiming for early detection of NAI before major injury occurs. In contrast, media reports and national inquiries tend to concentrate on fatalities, leaving non-fatal major injuries relatively under-researched. There has been no prior national overview of severe injuries resulting from non-accidental injury. We sought to address this gap by characterizing these injuries comprehensively.

### Abusive head trauma: Past, present, and future [^111LgzLZ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Abusive head trauma has a robust and interesting scientific history. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed a change in terminology to a term that more generally describes the vast array of abusive mechanisms resulting in pediatric head injury. Simply defined, abusive head trauma is "child physical abuse that results in injury to the head or brain". It is a relatively common cause of childhood neurotrauma, with an estimated incidence of 16 to 33 cases per 100,000 children per year in the first two years of life.

Clinical findings are variable; abusive head trauma should be considered in all children with neurologic signs and symptoms, especially if no or only mild trauma is described. Subdural and retinal hemorrhages are the most common findings. The best evidence-based literature has identified some features — apnea and severe retinal hemorrhages — that reliably discriminate abusive from accidental injury.

Longitudinal studies of outcomes in abusive head trauma patients demonstrate that approximately one-third of the children are severely disabled, one-third are moderately disabled, and one-third have no or only mild symptoms. Abusive head trauma cases are complex and require a rigorous, multidisciplinary team approach. Clinicians can establish this diagnosis with confidence if they maintain a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis, possess knowledge of the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of abusive head trauma, and reasonably exclude other etiologies in the differential diagnosis.

### Improving national standards of child protection skeletal surveys: The value of College guidance [^116Bg9TD]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to reassess the content and quality of skeletal surveys performed in the investigation of non-accidental injury. This reassessment followed the publication of nationally agreed-upon guidelines, produced jointly by the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in 2008.

- **Materials and methods**: One hundred consecutive skeletal surveys performed in England, which were sent to a tertiary paediatric hospital for a second opinion, were reviewed for their content and quality. The number and type of views were assessed with reference to the 21 recommended views as per the College guidance. The quality of each view was assessed and given a score up to a maximum of 10.

- **Results**: A total of 2,294 radiographic views were acquired, with an average of 22.9 views per survey (range: 12–21). Fifty-one of the surveys contained all 21 recommended views, up from a previous rate of 15%. The average quality score per view was 9.7/10 (97%), compared to a previous score of 9.7/11 (88%). The most common cause of reduced quality was the presence of an artefact on the image.

- **Conclusion**: There has been an improvement in the content of skeletal surveys performed in England. This improvement may be, in part, due to the publication of the national joint Royal College guidance. However, there remain areas for continued development to further improve practice.

### Predictors of increasing injury severity across suspected recurrent episodes of non-accidental trauma: A retrospective cohort study [^114hXGFL]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Characterization of recidivism

Among those children with multiple events during the study period, the median time between the first and second events was 191 days (IQR 71, 393). The median NISS was, on average, 1.6 times higher at the first event than at subsequent events (p < .0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated that 34.8% of the children had ≥ 1 recurrence within 1 year of their initial event, and 52.8% had ≥ 1 recurrence within 2 years of their initial event. Of the children who had ≥ 1 recurrence, 33.9% had a subsequent recurrence within 1 year of their first recurrence.

When re-episodes of suspected non-accidental trauma (NAT) were examined based on changes in severity between events (escalating NISS or non-escalating NISS), recurrent events of non-escalating injury severity were found to occur at much higher rates than events of escalating injury severity (p < 0.05). In addition, recurrent events of escalating injury severity occurred at similar rates across all recurring events (p = 0.69), but recurring events of non-escalating injury severity occurred at a significantly greater rate with an increasing number of events (p = 0.01).

Kaplan-Meier curves for the cumulative incidence of recurring events of (a) non-escalating injury severity and (b) escalating injury severity illustrate the proportion of at-risk patients having a recurrence over time since their previous event. Recurring events occurred at a significantly greater rate with increasing event numbers in episodes of non-escalating injury severity.

### The likelihood of an occult fracture in skeletal surveys obtained in children more than 2 years old with concerns of physical abuse [^1121EGQC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Skeletal surveys are necessary in the evaluation for physical abuse in children less than 2 years old, but when to obtain a skeletal survey in older children is less clear.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study of patients older than 2 years who underwent skeletal surveys over a 3-year period after the implementation of an electronic health record physical abuse order set was conducted. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and compared with data from a cohort before order set implementation. The radiation dose of a skeletal survey in a 5-year-old was calculated using a previously published technique.

- **Results**: There were 325 skeletal surveys, a marked increase in the rate of skeletal surveys compared with before order set implementation. Less than 2% (6/325) of skeletal surveys demonstrated an occult fracture. Of the 6 patients with occult fractures, 4 were physically abused; in each case, the diagnosis of abuse was evident before the skeletal survey. The other 2 patients fell from windows. The radiation exposure was 0.34 mSv.

- **Conclusions**: The rate of occult fractures on skeletal survey is significantly lower than previously reported. This is likely because our population included all children who underwent skeletal survey and not the subset referred to a child abuse pediatrician. Additionally, our data demonstrate that in children older than 2 years, skeletal surveys are unlikely to assist in making a diagnosis of physical abuse. The radiation exposure in a 5-year-old is 70% greater than in an infant, but still a dose, which represents a negligible health risk.

### Scandinavian guidelines for initial management of minimal, mild and moderate head injuries in adults: an evidence and consensus-based update [^114FfrgS]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In order to address the clinical questions, we performed two separate systematic reviews of the literature in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Both reviews utilized broad searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, covering the period from 1985 until January 2010, and were then complemented to July 2012 using prespecified Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords specified by the task force. The MeSH terms were pretested for validity through the identification of several key articles. It was deemed unlikely that studies conducted prior to 1985 would be useful, considering the widescale introduction of CT scanning around this period. We did not apply any other limitations to the search.

- **Search strategy**: For the first clinical question, the MeSH terms and keywords were: ((head trauma) OR (brain injury) OR (head injury) OR (traumatic head injury) OR (traumatic brain injury)) AND (minimal OR mild OR minor OR moderate) AND (management OR predictors OR predictor).
For the second clinical question, we used: ((head trauma) OR (brain injury) OR (head injury) OR (traumatic head injury) OR (traumatic brain injury)) AND (minimal OR mild OR minor OR moderate) AND (hospitalization OR hospitalisation OR observation OR admission OR discharge OR delayed OR ((normal OR negative OR repeat OR multiple OR serial OR follow-up) AND (CT OR CCT OR computed tomography)).

Additional papers were identified by hand-searching the bibliographies of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria and study eligibility**: Titles were examined by one author (JU), and borderline titles were examined further for eligibility.

### Predictors of increasing injury severity across suspected recurrent episodes of non-accidental trauma: a retrospective cohort study [^115SVgfX]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The study population consisted of children with suspected non-accidental trauma (NAT) episodes identified in the PFK database. Children included had birth claims and at least one non-birth related claim indicating a diagnosis of NAT or a skeletal survey from 2007 to 2011 (Fig. 1).

Suspected NAT events were defined as episodes of care in which a claim contained: (a) an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnosis code specific for child abuse, (b) a Procedural Terminology (CPT) coded skeletal survey, or (c) ICD-9 coded injuries suspicious for abuse. These events could be the event that brought the child into the study cohort, or they could occur either before or after that event.

Events that had an ICD-9 E-code for a trauma mechanism that could explain the injury or an ICD-9 code for an underlying medical illness that could explain the injury or need for a skeletal survey were excluded. We also excluded episodes of care with only a diagnosis of minor cutaneous injury from a specific mechanism, those coded as follow-up care, those with death at the first event, and those without a valid new injury severity score. An episode of care was defined as encompassing all claims for services provided concurrently or within two days of the care documented in the claim, in order to include all claims related to a single incident of suspected NAT.

To minimize the risk of defining claims for follow-up care as new events, only episodes of care for encounters in the emergency department and urgent care were considered.

### Predictors of increasing injury severity across suspected recurrent episodes of non-accidental trauma: a retrospective cohort study [^116tF3pA]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Non-accidental trauma (NAT) is a leading cause of injury and death throughout early childhood. In 2011, an estimated 686,000 (9.2 per 1000 children in the population) children across the United States were found to have substantiated or indicated cases of child maltreatment. An estimated 1,640 of these children died at a rate of 2.2 per 100,000 children in the population. Many children who are victims of NAT may be repeatedly evaluated for injuries related to maltreatment. Past analysis of data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System found that approximately one-third of children who are the subjects of first maltreatment reports are re-reported within 5 years. Of these children, nearly 17% had one additional report and 11% of children had multiple reports.

Children who are victims of recurrent non-accidental trauma (reNAT) are at increased risk for mortality with each subsequent evaluation. Several studies have demonstrated significantly higher mortality rates in abused children presenting with a recurrent episode of NAT compared to children presenting with an initial episode of NAT. Previously reported risk factors associated with injury in victims of suspected reNAT include younger age of the victim (< 30 months) and initial presentation with "minor" injuries, such as dislocations, open wounds, and superficial cutaneous injuries. Despite these identified factors associated with recurrent episodes of NAT, little is known about how the severity of injury changes from event to event in children who survive recurrent events of suspected NAT, and whether particular factors contribute to this change.

### Patterns of injury associated with routine childhood falls [^112aX5hU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to identify the pattern of injuries associated with routine childhood falls.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of patients at most 12 years presenting to a children's hospital emergency department with a complaint of a fall. Patients were classified into three age groups (< 2, 2–4, and 5–12 years) and analyzed for the type of fall and diagnosis.

- **Results**: Seven hundred eighty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 5.7 years, and 56% were boys. The types of falls reported were categorized as a fall down steps, from the patient's own height, from an object, and other. In all three groups, the most common fall was from an object (50%, 50%, and 48%, respectively). There were 91 (12%) patients in the younger-than-2-year-old age group and 235 (30%) in the 2- to 4-year-old age group. Both groups commonly fell from a bed/chair (35% and 25%, respectively). In the youngest group, the most frequent diagnosis was head injury (41%; odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0–8.1). Children aged 5 to 12 years numbered 461 (58%) and most commonly fell from playground equipment (26%), sustaining a fracture (65%; OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.3–4.3). Of these, 77% were in the upper extremity (arm fracture; OR, 41; 95% CI, 22–79).

- **Conclusions**: In children who presented to a children's hospital emergency department with a fall, falling from an object was the most common type. Those younger than 2 years most commonly fell from a bed/chair and sustained a head injury. Children aged 5 to 12 years were likely to fall from playground equipment and fracture their arm.

### Radiologic assessment of skull fracture healing in young children [^111Gp2cp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

These results are particularly valuable because there are no published studies on the "healing" of skull fractures. Dating of skull fractures has been limited to the presence or absence of scalp swelling indicating a more recent injury, whereas the absence of scalp swelling is not helpful in timing. It is notable that there is high variability in the presentation of skull fractures, with both simple and complex skull fractures (e.g. bilateral skull fractures) occurring in falls of less than 3 feet in this study population. The small number of complex skull fractures in this series limits further analysis. However, in a case-control study of the biomechanical characteristics of falls in children, no association was seen between fall height and the presence of simple or complex skull fractures.

Although it is difficult at the time of writing on head injuries and fractures in children, determining a window of injury may be helpful in cases where the history is unclear, the history includes multiple falls or injury events, or when multiple fractures are present. This study provides some initial data to aid in that process. Although most children in this case series had scalp swelling at the time of presentation supporting a recent injury, soft tissue swelling was not present in all children. There were children without fracture resolution at follow-up visits between 9 and 18 weeks after injury. In those children that did demonstrate healing, fracture resolution largely occurred 10 or more weeks after injury. Therefore, a skull fracture that presents without soft tissue swelling may be a.

### Head injury in children: Has a change in circumstances caused an increase in treatment numbers [^112TQgzG]? Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The number of hospitalizations for head injuries in children is rising. The exact causes remain unclear. We analyzed data of children aged between 0 and 18 years who sustained a head injury between 2010 and 2011. The analysis focused on data related to demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical course, results of imaging scans, concomitant injuries, and outcome. A total of 794 inpatient cases of head injury were treated. The leading mechanism of injury was a fall (at home) primarily at the age of 1 to 4 years (46.5%), with the majority of the children sustaining a mild brain injury (764, 96.2%). Neurosurgery was performed in 21 (2.64%) cases; the average hospital stay was 2.9 days (range: 0–68 days). This study is not able to confirm that children are increasingly being brought to the hospital by their parents because of new trauma mechanisms or parents' uncertainty, nor can we confirm that the number of nonaccidental injuries is rising.

### Distal radius fractures [^116bjLch]. The Journal of Hand Surgery, European Volume (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal radius fracture:

- **Definition**: A distal radius fracture (DRF) refers to a fracture of the radius near the wrist, typically within 2–3 cm of the distal end.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common mechanism of injury for DRFs is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension. When the wrist is in dorsiflexion during the fall, it can lead to a Colles fracture, characterized by dorsal displacement of the distal fragment. Other mechanisms include a fall onto a flexed wrist, resulting in a Smith's fracture, characterized by volar displacement of the distal fragment, and a Barton's fracture, characterized by intra-articular involvement. High-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries, and low-energy falls in older adults can also result in DRFs.

- **Epidemiology**: DRFs are among the most common fractures in the US, with an estimated incidence of 643,000 cases per year.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DRFs include advanced age, osteoporosis, and participation in high-impact activities or sports.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with a DRF typically present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the wrist area, along with a limited range of motion. In some cases, an obvious deformity may be present if the fracture is severe or displaced. Patients may also develop nerve complications, such as ulnar nerve palsy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for a DRF largely depends on the severity of the fracture and the patient's overall health. Generally, these fractures heal within a few months.

### Unexplained fractures: child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^11148DSN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

We searched the Medline and EMBASE computerized literature databases from January 1950 to June 2009. Articles were identified using an electronic search of keyword terms and their respective combinations. The search was guided by our institution's research librarian on August 22, 2009. A total of 104 unique references were identified with this search. Reference lists from the articles retrieved were further scrutinized to identify any additional studies of interest. All studies from the mentioned searches were then reviewed.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Studies were included in this systematic review if they matched the following criteria:
	1. They were in the English language.
	2. They had a Level I, II, III, or IV study design by "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery" criteria (levels).
	3. They had a minimum of 10 patients in their series with bony injury.
	4. Both patients with child abuse (CAN) or a condition that results in a bone disease with a propensity for fracture with minimal trauma were present in the study, or patients were included who were diagnosed with CAN that subsequent investigation revealed to be bone disease.
	5. The patients were younger than 18 years old, or older patients could not be distinguished from younger ones in the body of the text or tables.

We excluded review articles, case reports, or studies in which the inclusion criteria were not explicit. Two authors performed the initial search, and then three of the authors independently reviewed the 104 references and selected the appropriate studies based on these criteria.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European Society of Paediatric Radiology [^113JC24Y]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

In acute cases of suspected child abuse, the imaging protocol for children younger than 1 year of age should include a skeletal survey and an unenhanced CT brain with 3-D reformats. If the CT scan is normal but there are abnormal neurological findings or a high clinical suspicion of physical abuse, a brain and whole spine MRI should be performed within 2 to 5 days; see flowchart. A limited follow-up skeletal survey, omitting the axial skeleton and the pelvis, is recommended after 11 to 14 days. A CT chest can be considered for those with a negative skeletal survey yet a high clinical suspicion of child abuse or when the diagnosis of rib fractures is indeterminate. Children with suspected abdominal injuries should undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan.

For children aged 1 to 2 years, the initial and follow-up skeletal surveys, as well as CT chest and abdomen protocols, are the same as for those under 1 year old.

For children above 2 years of age with a history of falls or unexplained findings such as bruising, a CT brain is typically performed due to its sensitivity for detecting fractures. In cases of vague history and less specific symptoms, an MRI within 2 to 5 days may be prioritized for neuroaxis assessment. A skeletal survey is generally of less value for children above 2 years and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Risk factors for recurrent injuries in victims of suspected non-accidental trauma: a retrospective cohort study [^115N7513]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Non-accidental trauma (NAT) is a leading cause of injury and death throughout early childhood. Repeated evaluations in the medical setting for traumatic injuries should raise concerns that these injuries may be caused by either negligent behavior on the part of the caretaker or intentional mechanisms.

Rates of recurrent non-accidental traumatic injuries have been reported to be as high as 30–50% and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previously reported predictors of recurrent NAT include:

- **Prior factors**: Prior child protective services involvement and history of domestic violence.
- **Chronic conditions**: Chronicity of maltreatment.
- **Child-specific factors**: Child's age.
- **Parental background**: Parental history of maltreatment during their own childhood, as well as parental substance abuse, criminal record, and mental health issues, or after specific injuries.

These previous studies are limited in that they either do not assess risk factors specifically related to trauma, such as sentinel traumatic events, or they do not address recurrence of maltreatment. The purpose of this study was to identify patterns of injuries and factors associated with suspected episodes of recurrent NAT in a cohort of young children enrolled in a Medicaid managed care program who had at least one highly suspicious encounter for NAT.

### Histological ageing of fractures in infants: A practical algorithm for assessing infants suspected of accidental or non-accidental injury [^1176GKSu]. Histopathology (2019). Low credibility.

Data were tabulated to show the time prior to death at which each feature was seen and the proportion of fractures from each time-point showing the feature. The time-points were largely self-selecting by the number of fractures, with each time-point having at least four fractures from at least two infants.

After 1998, all data, including new cases added during the period, were summated every two years. An audit was performed comparing the 'new database' with that of two years earlier. While this led to changes in consecutive databases, most of the changes resulted from the increasing number of samples, which led to increased numbers of time-points. However, from the 2011 audit (cases to December 2010), no changes were made to the database despite adding further cases. As per the original protocol, the study was terminated after three successive unchanged biannual audits at the end of 2016.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acutely limping child up to age 5 [^116t52em]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pediatric femoral shaft fracture, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI of the lower extremity area of interest (excluding pelvis or hip) without and with IV contrast, or an MRI of the lower extremity area of interest (excluding pelvis or hip) without IV contrast as the initial imaging in pediatric patients up to age 5. This recommendation is for those with an acute limp, symptoms localized to the lower extremity (excluding pelvis or hips), and concern for infection.

### A case of penetrating neck trauma in a child [^116zUEzH]. Pediatric emergency care (2012). Low credibility.

Penetrating injuries to the neck are potentially devastating, and recommendations concerning their evaluation have generated extensive discussion over the years. In this article, we present the case of a 9-year-old girl who narrowly missed a serious vascular injury when she fell on a pencil. We also discuss the most current recommendations concerning the management of zone II injuries to the neck of a pediatric patient.

### Delayed presentation and conservative management of an odontoid basilar synchondrosis fracture in a child. Case report [^115MHfAc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The authors report the case of a 3-year-old boy who presented with neck pain after falling from a low height and who was discharged from the emergency department after imaging studies were noted to be normal. He presented again 2 months later with continued neck pain, and repeated imaging demonstrated a fracture of the odontoid basilar synchondrosis that had not been shown on the initial studies. Based on the normal alignment of his spine and evidence of early bone fusion at the time of his second presentation, he underwent cervical orthosis therapy only. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of an odontoid synchondrosis fracture in which computed tomography scans were normal at presentation.

### How to explore and report children with suspected non-accidental trauma [^112JxuSN]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a controversial problem of special concern. Recent reports have focused on the broad variability of reporting to child protection services. Radiologists play a key role in the early diagnosis and imaging of suspected inflicted injury. Imaging must be performed and then interpreted with rigour.

The aims of this review are as follows:

- **Review recent recommended guidelines**: These guidelines focus on imaging in cases of suspected abuse. A highly detailed and complete skeletal survey with centered views is necessary, while brain CT and/or MRI are mandatory in children younger than 2 years. The use of abdominal imaging is debatable if the child has no symptoms. Moreover, all siblings younger than 2 years should be assessed similarly while the diagnosis of abuse is investigated. Body MRI represents an interesting modality that remains a "work-in-progress".

- **Highlight the imprecision in dating brain and skeletal injuries**: The primary focus is to determine if the pattern shows "age-different" lesions. This approach not only provides a robust argument for the diagnosis of abuse but also indicates repetitive violence, presenting a high risk for further injury and death.

- **Emphasize the medical responsibility to protect the child**: Radiologists must communicate clearly the suspicion of abuse and the degree of certainty to clinicians. This aids in reporting or hospitalization.

By adhering to these guidelines, radiologists can significantly contribute to the protection and welfare of the child.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, their family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. Additionally, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services, and the potential wrongful removal of custody, underscores the impact of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures being the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopaedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse. Rib fractures, skull fractures, and humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". The authors included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination. Despite these assertions, there remain challenges in differentiating these conditions.

### WHO are we missing? Too few skeletal surveys for children with humeral and femoral fractures [^1116h4r8]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the potential shortfall in skeletal survey referral for children presenting with an acute non-supracondylar humeral or femoral fracture, plain radiograph reports were reviewed retrospectively. Data was collected using the radiology information system database over a 5-year study period (May 2008–2013) for children under 18 months of age who presented with an acute fracture. Subsequent skeletal survey referral was used as a surrogate marker for further investigation of child abuse. A robust meta-analysis was applied to derive probability data regarding the likelihood of child abuse as a cause of non-supracondylar humeral or femoral fracture. An estimation of the expected number of cases of abuse, alongside the shortfall in skeletal survey referrals, was then calculated.

The study identified 288 fractures in 281 children, with three children presenting with multiple fractures and considered separately. The mean patient age was 10.5 months. Nine (3%) non-supracondylar humeral fractures were identified, of which four cases may have been due to non-accidental injury (NAI). One (11%) of these patients was referred for a skeletal survey, indicating a potential shortfall of three referrals. Twenty-five (9%) femoral fractures were identified, of which 13 cases may have been due to NAI, with six (24%) referrals for skeletal surveys generated. This points to a potential shortfall of seven referrals.

The present study serves as an analysis of practice within a tertiary paediatric referral centre, highlighting a potential under-referral in cases of suspected child abuse.

Recognizing the skeletal manifestations of inflicted injury (II) in infants and young children is of crucial importance. There are specific fracture patterns which are highly suspicious of II, in addition to common differential diagnoses with which radiologists should be familiar. Our objective is to provide a non-exhaustive review of the important factors relevant to the imaging and reporting of II as a platform for further learning. Part 1 encompasses important initial considerations and fracture patterns of the appendicular skeleton.

### A profile of suspected child abuse as a subgroup of major trauma patients [^112UrfB9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This study describes suspected child abuse (SCA) over a decade of major trauma data in the UK. It builds on previous TARN information, which examined severe pediatric trauma in a calendar year, and the new data show that cases of injury from SCA have a different demography than those of accidentally injured children. Children suffering from SCA are more likely to sustain a significant head injury, have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15, and are more likely to die than those suffering from accidental trauma.

The majority of SCA cases (76.3%) were under 1 year of age. This age distribution is similar to that found in an 8-year analysis of the trauma registry of the state of Victoria, Australia. In the age group 0–14 years, the incidence of abuse was 3%, with virtually all cases in the age group of 0–4 years. The TARN 2012 data showed a bimodal age distribution of severe injury (all causes) in children, with one peak at age under 1, but the majority of cases occurring between 6 and 15 years of age. An American study of children under 5 years old with blunt trauma revealed a median age of 12.8 months in the abused population. A study of traumatic brain injury (TBI) indicated that TBI secondary to abuse had a median age of 1 year compared to 8 years in accidental TBI. A review of the Israeli National Trauma Registry in 2009 also identified a peak incidence of severe injury in newborn infants. This suggests a distinct pattern whereby older children are much less likely to sustain severe injury from abuse than infants. While child abuse is not absent in the age group of 11–15 years in the UK, the TARN major trauma data contained only two cases.

### Early complete bone union after condylar fracture in a child [^114QEA9r]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old boy experienced a unilateral intracapsular condylar fracture due to a fall. A short duration of immobilization using a facial band was implemented for 5 days without any surgical intervention. The patient achieved full recovery in mouth opening with no deviation or asymmetry of the mandible. Six weeks post-trauma, the patient's computed tomogram revealed complete reduction of the fracture, and bone union had occurred. In cases of condylar fractures in children, treatment protocols that involve a short duration of immobilization followed by early active exercise can lead to complete bone union, contrary to the previously described deformity or remodeling process.

### Expert consensus on predictive parameters for the occurrence of a fall and a contralateral hip fracture 1 and 3 years after hip fracture: A Delphi survey [^115VkPGy]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Early identification of people at risk for a contralateral hip fracture is desirable to favorably influence patients' prognosis. A recent systematic review failed to depict stringent patterns of risk parameters to be used for decision-making in clinical practice.

- **Objective**: To perform a consensus study using the Delphi method to reach an expert consensus on predictive parameters for the occurrence of a fall and a contralateral hip fracture 1 and 3 years following a hip fracture.

- **Methods**: A list of potential members of the expert panel was identified based on the authors' list of a recently conducted systematic review. Participating experts were asked to name parameters determining the probability of a fall and a contralateral hip fracture 1 and 3 years after an occurred hip fracture, separately. Additionally, experts were asked how those stated parameters should be measured. All mentioned parameters were compiled and sent back to the experts, asking them to weight each parameter by assigning a number between 1 (not important) and 10 (very important). The survey was conducted online using the REDCap software package. Expert agreement was defined if the interquartile range of attributed weights for a parameter was ≤ 2. A relevant parameter had at least a median weight of 8.

- **Results**: Twelve experts from seven countries completed the survey. The presence of fall history and mental and general health status were considered relevant irrespective of the outcome. For falling within 1 and 3 years, the number of medications and residential status were considered relevant, while the remainder of the text is not provided.

### Femur fractures resulting from stair falls among children: An injury plausibility model [^114nipRa]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Stair falls are common among young children and are also common false histories in cases of child abuse. When a child presents with a femur fracture and a stair-fall history, a judgment of plausibility must be made. A lack of objective injury and biomechanical data makes plausibility determination more difficult. Our objective was to characterize key features associated with femur fractures from reported stair falls to develop a model for assessing injury plausibility (IP).

- **Methods**: Children 2 to 36 months of age who presented with a femur fracture from a reported stair fall were studied prospectively. Detailed history recording, examinations, fracture characterization, and injury scene analyses were conducted, and biomechanical measures associated with injury prediction were calculated. With our proposed IP model, all cases were then scored for the detail of history, biomechanical compatibility of fracture morphologic features, time to seeking care, and presence of other injuries.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine children were diagnosed with a femur fracture resulting from a reported stair fall. The IP model made a clear distinction between two groups, designated plausible and suspicious. Significant differences were observed for the detail of history, biomechanical compatibility of fracture, time to seeking care, presence of other injuries, and total IP scores. In the plausible group, the minimal linear momentum associated with a transverse fracture was almost 10-fold greater than that for spiral or buckle fracture types.

- **Conclusions**: This study adds new information to the understanding of femur fractures resulting from stair falls in young children.
