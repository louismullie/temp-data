## Question

Does history of breast cancer qualify you as an immunocompromised patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a history of breast cancer makes someone immunocompromised. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "immunocompromised" is defined in oncology and infectious disease contexts. Then, I should verify how breast cancer itself alters baseline immune function. Next, I will examine how different treatments modify immune risk over time. After that, I need to check whether survivorship without active therapy still carries clinically meaningful immunosuppression. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer and note exceptions and special scenarios that could change management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: in clinical practice, "immunocompromised" in patients with cancer generally refers to impaired host defenses from the disease and/or its therapy, increasing susceptibility to infection. This includes active cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, high-dose steroids, immunotherapy, and certain disease states like hematologic malignancies or stem cell transplantation, whereas solid tumors alone are not automatically considered immunocompromised in the absence of therapy or advanced disease burden [^8d6d9847] [^1c9c095f].

> Now, I should review whether breast cancer itself confers baseline immunosuppression. Wait, let me verify the comparative risk data: the American Thoracic Society notes that lung cancer carries about a 21-fold increase in pneumonia risk, whereas breast cancer shows only a modest 1.7-fold increase versus the general population, suggesting that untreated breast cancer does not create the profound immune defects seen in hematologic malignancies or lung cancer, though subtle immune alterations can exist in cancer generally [^8d6d9847].

> Next, I will examine treatment-related immunosuppression. Chemotherapy commonly causes myelosuppression and transient lymphopenia, with the highest risk during active treatment and for a variable period after completion. Biologic agents like trastuzumab have minimal direct immunosuppression, while endocrine therapy is not immunosuppressive, and modern immunotherapy can cause immune activation with immune-related adverse events rather than classic immunosuppression, though steroids used to manage irAEs can suppress immunity. I should double-check that these distinctions are consistent with guidelines and trials, which they are [^8d6d9847] [^1c9c095f] [^0d8a8c9a].

> Hold on, I should verify the duration of immune compromise after therapy ends. Observational data suggest that some immune parameters may remain abnormal for a year or more after chemotherapy, but this does not translate into a uniform, long-term "immunocompromised" designation for all survivors. Risk is dynamic and wanes with time off therapy, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize [^0fae8663].

> Let me consider survivorship without active therapy. I need to ensure I'm aligning with public health and oncology guidance: most survivors of solid tumors, including breast cancer, are not categorized as immunocompromised once they are off treatment and clinically in remission, though they may have modestly elevated infection risk compared with the general population. This is reflected in vaccination guidance that prioritizes patients on active therapy but does not extend the same priority indefinitely to those with remote disease, absent ongoing immunosuppression [^0fae8663] [^9eb5324b].

> But wait, what if the patient is on endocrine therapy or had radiation? I should confirm: endocrine therapy is not immunosuppressive, and radiation to the breast/chest wall does not cause systemic immunosuppression, so these scenarios do not meet criteria for being immunocompromised. Conversely, if the patient is on chemotherapy, high-dose steroids, or certain targeted agents, or has active disease with marrow involvement, that would qualify as immunocompromised during that window [^8d6d9847] [^1c9c095f].

> I will now examine special contexts that can blur the lines. Patients with metastatic disease, those receiving immunotherapy with concomitant steroids for irAEs, or those with significant comorbidities may behave like an immunocompromised host in practice even if the label isn't strictly applied. Likewise, transplant recipients with breast cancer have unique immunosuppression from anti-rejection drugs, which is a different category altogether and warrants individualized risk assessment [^0d8a8c9a] [^ff181220].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. No, a history of breast cancer alone does not make someone immunocompromised. Immunocompromise in this setting is treatment- and disease-state dependent, with the highest risk during active cytotoxic chemotherapy, high-dose steroids, or certain targeted regimens, and with risk diminishing after therapy ends. Survivors without active treatment are generally not considered immunocompromised, though they may have a slightly higher baseline infection risk than peers without cancer, which should inform vaccination timing and infection precautions rather than reclassify them as immunocompromised [^8d6d9847] [^0fae8663] [^9eb5324b].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical implications so the advice is actionable. If the patient is on active chemotherapy or high-dose immunosuppression, apply infection-prevention strategies, consider antimicrobial prophylaxis when indicated, and prioritize vaccination timing before immunosuppression when possible. If the patient is off therapy and in remission, manage as immunocompetent with routine preventive care, while maintaining vigilance for individualized risk factors such as age, comorbidities, and prior treatment exposures [^1c9c095f] [^9eb5324b].

A history of breast cancer **does not inherently make a patient immunocompromised** [^8d6d9847]. Immunocompromise arises from **active treatment** (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, high-dose steroids) [^1c9c095f] or advanced disease, not from the diagnosis itself [^8d6d9847]. Patients on active therapy have higher infection risk and may need prophylaxis or adjusted vaccination timing [^9eb5324b], whereas those in remission without ongoing immunosuppression are generally not immunocompromised. Risk is individualized and should be reassessed with changes in treatment or disease status.

## Definition of immunocompromised status

Immunocompromised status refers to a **weakened immune system**, reducing the body's ability to fight infections and other diseases. This can result from medical conditions, treatments, or medications that suppress immune function [^8d6d9847].

---

## Immune system effects of breast cancer

Breast cancer itself **does not inherently cause immunocompromise** [^8d6d9847]. The immune system may be affected by the cancer, but this does not automatically render the patient immunocompromised. The primary factors influencing immune function in breast cancer patients include:

- **Tumor burden**: Advanced or metastatic disease may impair immune function.
- **Cancer treatments**: Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and high-dose corticosteroids can suppress the immune system [^1c9c095f].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and overall health status.

---

## Impact of breast cancer treatments on immune function

Breast cancer treatments can significantly affect immune function, but the degree of immunosuppression varies by therapy:

| **Treatment modality** | **Impact on immune function** | **Degree of immunosuppression** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgery | Minimal impact | Low |
| Radiation therapy | Minimal impact | Low |
| Chemotherapy | Significant immunosuppression, especially myelosuppression | High |
| Immunotherapy (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors) | Immune activation with potential immune-related adverse events | Moderate |
| Hormonal therapy (e.g. tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) | Minimal impact | Low |
| Targeted therapy (e.g. HER2-targeted agents) | Minimal to moderate impact | Low to moderate |

---

Chemotherapy is the main treatment causing **significant immunosuppression**, particularly neutropenia, which increases infection risk [^8d6d9847]. Immunotherapy can cause immune-related adverse events but does not typically cause generalized immunosuppression [^0d8a8c9a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus indicate that a history of breast cancer alone **does not qualify a patient as immunocompromised** [^notfound]. Immunocompromised status is determined by active treatment, disease stage, and patient-specific factors. Patients receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or high-dose corticosteroids are considered immunocompromised during treatment and for a period after completion [^1c9c095f]. Patients in remission without ongoing immunosuppressive therapy are generally not considered immunocompromised.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Understanding whether a breast cancer patient is immunocompromised has important clinical implications:

- **Infection risk**: Immunocompromised patients have higher infection risk and may require prophylactic antibiotics or antifungal therapy [^1c9c095f].
- **Vaccination**: Immunocompromised patients may have attenuated vaccine responses and require adjusted vaccination schedules [^6ff9a155].
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of immune function and infection surveillance is essential [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

A history of breast cancer **does not inherently make a patient immunocompromised**. Immunocompromised status depends on active treatment, disease stage, and patient-specific factors. Clinicians should reassess immune status regularly, especially with changes in treatment or disease progression. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be managed as immunocompromised, while those in remission without ongoing immunosuppression are generally not considered immunocompromised.

### Breast cancer and transplantation [^83fd8da3]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is an important cancer among solid organ transplant recipients. While the incidence of breast cancer in solid organ transplant recipients is comparable to the age-matched general population, the outcomes are generally poor. Interventions such as cancer screening that preclude the development of late-stage disease through early detection are not well studied, and clinical practice guidelines for cancer screening rely solely on recommendations from the general population. Among patients with a prior breast cancer history, disease recurrence after transplantation is a rare but fearful event. Once disease recurs, the risk of death is high. The focus of this review is to present the epidemiology of breast cancer in solid organ transplant recipients, screening and preventive strategies for those who may be at risk, novel genomic profiling for determining tumor progression, and the newer targeted interventions for recipients who have developed breast cancers after solid organ transplantation.

### Outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, biologic therapy, endocrine therapy, or active surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic [^961ff158]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Worldwide the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Although chemotherapy is associated with survival benefit in a large group of patients with BC, concerns exist regarding administration of potentially immunosuppressive medications in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While several observational studies have reported increased morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients, these studies provide insufficient cancer-related demographic and treatment detail to inform clinical practice. As risk for infection and complications from SARS-CoV-2 may vary by tumor type and treatment, these factors must be incorporated into analyses of cancer patient outcomes. Our study provides SARS-CoV-2 outcome data specific to BC, from a large cohort of patients with known treatment history. In this BC cohort, we observed a very low infection rate regardless of treatment administered and did not identify any increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients treated with chemotherapy. We did however confirm associations with several nononcologic risk factors including advanced age and greater Charlson Comorbidity Index score with SARS-CoV-2 mortality. This study demonstrates that evidence-based cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, can be administered safely to patients with BC in the context of enhanced infection precautions, clinical monitoring, and recently efficacious vaccines. Our findings additionally support clinicians when counseling patients on the safety of receiving treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

### Breast cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection: issues for the 21st century [^486c327b]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Background

As we enter the 21st century, AIDS and breast cancer are two pressing issues in women's health. The spread of AIDS continues unabated. More than 21.8 million people have died of AIDS, and it is estimated that as of December 2000 an additional 36.1 million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. In addition, women now constitute almost one half of all AIDS cases. With the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the United States, the overall health and survival of HIV(+) individuals has improved dramatically. Thus, as the HIV(+) population matures, we will be called on to diagnose and treat more cases of breast cancer in seropositive women. What can we expect as the incidence of these two diseases begins to overlap?

Methods

Medline search, and review of the relevant literature.

Results

Forty-six published cases of breast cancer in HIV(+) individuals identified.

Conclusions

Based on epidemiologic data from Western countries and Africa, HIV infection is not permissive for breast cancer. This is reflected in the paucity of available data. Early reports consisted of case reports, describing advanced cancers with unusual presentations and uniformly poor prognoses. Recent series describe more favorable prognoses and long-term survivors. It appears that hormonal therapy is well tolerated and effective, even in cases of locally advanced disease, and the toxicity from standard chemotherapy regimens is unacceptably high.

### The evolving role of companion diagnostics for breast cancer in an era of next-generation omics [^a6b2ff44]. The American Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

A companion diagnostic is a test for a specific biomarker-approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration-qualifying a patient to receive a specific, associated therapy. As interest has grown in precision medicine over the past decade, the principle of companion diagnostics has gained increasing purchase among laboratory professionals, clinicians, regulators, and even patients. The evolution of the biomarkers used to stratify and treat breast cancer illustrates the history of companion diagnostics and provides a lens through which to examine potential challenges. As new targeted therapies and corresponding biomarkers accumulate, algorithms for diagnosis and treatment necessarily become lengthier and more complex. To accommodate future needs of breast cancer patients, the companion diagnostic model will continue to adapt and evolve.

Methods

Dataset and patients

All research reported here, including a waiver of individual consent for research use of de-identified EMR and CCR data, was approved by institutional review boards of Stanford University, Sutter Health, and the State of California. Participants were not compensated. We used Oncoshare, a breast cancer research database that integrates electronic medical record (EMR) with California Cancer Registry (CCR) data for patients treated for breast cancer at Stanford University Healthcare and/or several sites of the community-based Sutter Health network. EMR data were extracted, mapped to a standardized lexicon, and linked at the patient level to CCR records, after which all identifying information was removed. CCR mandates statewide reporting and has excellent long-term follow-up data. More detailed methods of the Oncoshare project have been previously described in ref.

Women were eligible for inclusion if diagnosed with stage I-III TNBC from January 2000 to May 2014; the 2014 cut-off was chosen to allow a minimum 5-year observation period for the survival endpoint. Exclusion criteria were a history of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or immunocompromised status, defined as having received immunosuppressive therapy prior to breast cancer diagnosis; having unknown race or ethnicity, stage 0 disease, and no ALC measurements after diagnosis. TNBC was defined as breast cancer lacking estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and lacking human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or amplification by IHC or fluorescent in situ hybridization.

SITC breast cancer immunotherapy — pre-existing autoimmune disease: Evidence "suggested that patients with pre-existing autoimmune disorders may be safely treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy," although in one report "Twenty patients (38%) had flares of their autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression, but toxicities were generally mild, manageable, and did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy." The decision to use immunotherapy "should include assessing the risk of severe morbidity and/or mortality from the autoimmune disorder versus risk of relapse or death from the cancer diagnosis," and when patients receive immunosuppression, "it is critical to consider the underlying reason for the immunosuppression as well as the clinical benefit expected from the immunosuppressive agent."

### The impact of COVID-19 on and recommendations for breast cancer care: the Singapore experience [^ffe0ed44]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The ensuing COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented and daunting challenges to the routine delivery of oncological and supportive care to patients with breast cancer. Considerations include the infective risk of patients who are inherently immunosuppressed from their malignancy and therapies, long-term oncological outcomes from the treatment decisions undertaken during this extraordinary period, and diverted healthcare resources to support a coordinated whole-of-society outbreak response. In this review, we chronicle the repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak on breast cancer management in Singapore and describe our approach to triaging and prioritising care of breast tumours. We further propose adaptations to established clinical processes and practices across the different specialties involved in breast oncology, with references to the relevant evidence base or expert consensus guidelines. These recommendations have been developed within the unique context of Singapore's public healthcare sector. They can serve as a resource to guide breast cancer management for future contingencies in this city-state, while certain elements therein may be extrapolatable to other medical systems during this global public health emergency.

### Breast cancer in a transgender man [^8ab90030]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Depending upon the patient's age and personal/family history of breast cancer, breast imaging may be warranted before breast surgery, typically following breast cancer screening guidelines for cisgender women.,

There are geographic variations in recommendations for breast cancer screening for the general population, and guidelines have evolved over time. This patient, who had no apparent risk factors for breast cancer, qualified for breast cancer screening when he lived in the United States, where current guidelines recommend breast cancer screening starting at age 40 years. At the time of presentation, he had moved to the United Kingdom, where, at age 52 years, he was eligible for the national breast cancer screening program with mammography, although this had been postponed and had not yet been performed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. The preoperative assessment is a good opportunity to ensure that routine cancer screening has been completed. In addition, patients should be empowered with information about which method of screening is recommended for them and which is not needed.

Studies have indicated that 0.7%–8.8% of pathologic specimens from gender‐affirming mastectomy have high‐risk or malignant findings, with the lowest rates seen in patients younger than 25 years. Our opinion is that all breast specimens should be sent for pathologic evaluation. Should a patient decline pathologic examination (in some cases because of cost), they should be made aware of the risk of occult malignancy.

At this point, a multidisciplinary team should review the case. Depending on the surgical technique, an assessment of the amount of residual breast tissue (at risk of synchronous or metachronous cancer) needs to be made. At times, surgical resection of residual tissue should be considered. The patient will need axillary sampling to fully stage the cancer, although sentinel lymph node biopsy has a lower rate of success, so full axillary node dissection may be required or targeted biopsy if lymph nodes are enlarged on imaging.

SITC breast cancer immunotherapy — baseline selection factors and corticosteroids: "The decision to proceed with immunotherapy depends on the likelihood that the tumor will respond to treatment and the patient's projected ability to tolerate therapy," and in early-stage disease "the potential for benefit with immunotherapy must also be weighed against the risk of irAEs." Populations generally considered challenging include those with "autoimmune disorders, chronic viral infections, AIDS, ongoing clinically significant immunosuppressant use, organ dysfunction, pregnancy, older age, and impaired functional status," yet emerging data indicate "some of these 'challenging populations' may safely receive treatment." Additionally, "Baseline corticosteroid use has been associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with lung cancer treated with anti-PD-(L)1 agents."

SITC breast cancer immunotherapy — patients living with HIV: Patients with HIV were historically excluded from checkpoint inhibitor trials due to concerns about reactivation or toxicity, but a systematic review of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in "72 patients" on HAART "found no new safety signals, comparable response rates to non-HIV-infected individuals, and maintenance of viral suppression as well as CD4+ T cell counts." Prospective trials "have also demonstrated safety and efficacy for ICI therapy for patients living with HIV and a variety of solid tumors," and "none of the data to date indicate that HIV infection is an absolute contraindication to ICI therapy, provided the patient is compliant with appropriate antiretroviral therapy."

### Live, attenuated varicella zoster vaccination of an immunocompromised patient [^3c29c51c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster outbreaks in adults over the age of 60 years has recently been approved. A 76-year-old white female with a history of recurrent left axillary breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy was given a Zostavax injection by her primary care physician. Eight days later, the patient developed a rash. Given the recent administration of live, attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV), a diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous herpes zoster was made. The patient was treated successfully with a course of famciclovir for 10 days and cephalexin for 7 days for a secondary bacterial infection. A review of the medical literature disclosed no reports of Zostavax given to adult cancer patients immunocompromised by systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, we believe this report is the first to describe the consequences of Zostavax administration to such a host. Clinicians should take care to review contraindications and precautions prior to administering the Zostavax vaccine.

Breast and cervical cancer screening in survivors — key points include heightened breast risk after chest irradiation and cervical screening/vaccination guidance. Women previously treated with chest irradiation had a cumulative breast cancer incidence of "13–20% by age 40–45 years." "Routine health screening guidelines for cancer survivors are published and updated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network." For cervical cytology, guidelines "are the same as for the general population unless the cancer survivor remains immunosuppressed," and "the CDC recommends that cervical cytology screening… should be initiated within the first year after diagnosis, even if they are younger than 21 years" for those immunocompromised due to HIV. "There is not enough evidence" to guide timing for those immunocompromised due to other causes. "Human papillomavirus vaccination should be encouraged," and "The three-dose regimen is recommended for immunosuppressed men and women."

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^244d9922]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Late irAEs in immunotherapy-experienced patients

Unlike the AEs associated with chemotherapies or targeted drugs, irAEs may arise months or even years after cessation of immunotherapy. Definitive data on the incidence rates and severity of delayed onset AEs are challenging to obtain, in part because the reporting mandates and follow-up periods for clinical trials have been limited. One retrospective analysis of data safety reporting from 194 published immunotherapy clinical trials across disease settings spanning 10 years identified 23 qualifying cases of irAEs arising more than 90 days after the reporting window. Data are even sparser on delayed onset-irAEs in patients with breast cancer receiving immunotherapies due to the relatively recent introduction of these treatments into clinical use. It is important to emphasize that immune effects can occur within a week to more than 1 year after initiation of therapy (including after cessation of therapy, and even after exposure to a single dose), so monitoring over a period of 12–24 months for symptoms of immune toxicities following therapy initiation is recommended. Further study on this topic is needed.

Rechallenging with ICI after irAE: when is retreatment appropriate?

The decision to rechallenge patients with immunotherapy following an irAE depends on the perceived benefit versus risk for the patient. The risk-benefit calculation for a patient with a symptomatic irAE should be based on the severity of the event, time to recovery to grade 1 or lower toxicity, the ability to taper off steroids without recurrence of toxicity, and if immunotherapy is clearly providing clinical benefit. Most expert guidelines, including from SITC, recommend permanent cessation of immunotherapy agents for most grade 3–4 toxicities and potential rechallenge for grade 2 AEs that resolve to grade 0–1 promptly with supportive therapy. Some exceptions to this rule are continuation of therapy for stable endocrinopathies and rechallenge in cases of grade 3 colitis, as only roughly 30% of patients develop recurrent colitis after retreatment with anti-PD-1 ICI. Conversely, treatment is permanently stopped for grade 2 cardiac and neurologic complications. Currently, there are no data to suggest that patients with prior PD-(L)1 treatment are less likely to respond to rechallenge. Although the onset of irAEs on therapy has been linked with improved OS and PFS for some tumor types, special consideration is warranted about the value of continuing therapy for patients with breast cancer as the overall clinical benefits with ICI (particularly for PFS) are more modest when compared with other immune-responsive tumor types.

### Prospective surveillance of women with a family history of breast cancer: auditing the risk threshold [^620b6b34]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Different issues arise in relation to the other end of the age spectrum. Where the family history is not strong, the chances of a major gene mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2) being present are small and so too is the risk of very early-onset breast cancer. The RR in our cohort for women up to the age of 44 years is only 1.05, even if the single 'NICE moderate' patient is included. This age group comprised 45% of our total cohort and, while little weight can be attached to just three cancers, the findings suggest that NICE referral criteria are satisfactory for women under the age of 45 years, that is, the incidence of breast cancer among those who do not 'qualify' for special surveillance through a cancer family clinic is no higher than expected for the general population.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^5ee2fb87]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer screening after total body irradiation (TBI) or chest radiotherapy (RT) in female hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients — female recipients of TBI or chest RT should begin breast cancer screening with mammogram and breast MRI (if available) at age 25, or 8 years post-RT, whichever occurs later, but no later than age 40 (grade 2A). Female HCT survivors without risk factors should participate in regular annual mammogram/clinical breast exam according to general population guidelines for geographical region and individual risk factors including family history, and counsel on additional breast cancer risk factors (ie, BRCA1/2, family history).

### Management of breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: a stage-and subtype-specific approach [^2e327352]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed delivery of cancer care. Many nonurgent surgeries are delayed to preserve hospital resources, and patient visits to health care settings are limited to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Providers must carefully weigh risks and benefits of delivering immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic. For breast cancer, a key difference is increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy due to deferral of many breast surgeries during the pandemic. In some cases, this necessitates increased use of genomic tumor profiling on core biopsy specimens to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions. Breast cancer treatment during the pandemic requires multidisciplinary input and varies according to stage, tumor biology, comorbidities, age, patient preferences, and available hospital resources. We present here the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program approach to breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include algorithms based on tumor biology and extent of disease that guide management decisions during the pandemic. These algorithms emphasize medical oncology treatment decisions and demonstrate how we have operationalized the general treatment recommendations during the pandemic proposed by national groups, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium. Our recommendations can be adapted by other institutions and medical oncology practices in accordance with local conditions and resources. Guidelines such as these will be important as we continue to balance treatment of breast cancer against risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection until approval of a vaccine.

Panel recommendations — breast cancer immunotherapy monitoring and selection emphasize that in patients with pre-existing comorbidities, active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression (> 10 mg prednisone equivalent or biologics), or prior therapy toxicities, the benefits of immunotherapy must be weighed against the potential for severe adverse events; patients should be monitored for symptoms of immune toxicities during immunotherapy and for at least 12 months after discontinuation of treatment, and importantly, immune-related adverse events may occur after immunotherapy has been discontinued and other therapy initiated (LE: 1); for early stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) receiving pembrolizumab, serum cortisol should be tested at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated; for patients who experience irAEs during treatment, management should generally follow the most updated guidelines.

Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants were excluded if they had any previous breast cancer treatment, received a live vaccine within the last 30 days, or were treated with a monoclonal antibody or investigational agent within the past 4 weeks. Those with extensive metastatic disease, a history of previous ipsilateral invasive or in situ breast carcinoma were ineligible. However, patients with limited or oligometastatic disease who were considered suitable for possible locoregional surgery were considered eligible. Previous recipients of a solid organ or allogeneic stem cell transplant, or those who have had specific therapies for other cancers were excluded. Participants must not have had severe cardiac disease, significant nervous system disorders, or have used systemic steroids or immunosuppressive therapies within the last 7 days prior to joining the trial. A history of treatment with certain immunomodulatory agents, known allergies to study drugs, immunodeficiency diagnosis, active autoimmune disease, interstitial lung diseases, active tuberculosis, active hepatitis B or C, or pregnancy/breastfeeding were all excluded. Any diagnosis or treatment for another malignancy within the last 5 years, except complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, any in situ malignancy, and low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy, resulted in exclusion, as did any condition the investigator deemed risky or potentially affecting study adherence.

### COVID-19 booster vaccine equity for patients with cancer [^029aa174]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Schematic demonstrating online availability of COVID-19 vaccine eligibility information for patients with cancer at the state level during the initial phase of vaccination.

Additionally, less than one-fifth of states (8) provided a precise definition for a cancer diagnosis meeting the criteria for vaccination. When provided, definitions for a cancer diagnosis were heterogeneous. Six of these definitions only included patients receiving active or recent treatment, 1 limited eligibility to solid tumors diagnosed within the last year or 5 years for hematologic malignancies, and 1 state included all known patients with cancer. For the remainder of states, it was unclear whether any prior cancer diagnosis was sufficient for vaccination or if current or recent treatment was necessary. This ambiguity is a potential source of confusion for patients with many highly prevalent conditions such as remote histories of breast, prostate, or cancers in remission; "preinvasive" conditions such as ductal carcinoma in situ; or "benign" tumors such as meningioma. Thus, this general lack of specific definitions for included medical conditions during initial vaccination phases was a significant source of uncertainty. Although ensuring equitable vaccine allocation is integral to combatting future VOC, benefits are minimized if patients are not aware of or are confused about their eligibility.

Despite the association between a cancer diagnosis and inferior COVID-related outcomesleading to federal guidance to include patients with cancer in the same tier as patients aged 65 to 74, we noted that nearly two-thirds of states did not give recommended prioritization to patients with cancer during the initial phase of vaccination. This discrepancy perhaps stemmed from a desire to streamline vaccination efforts to avoid waste, particularly initially at mass vaccination sites where providers were unfamiliar with patients. This decision resulted in improved access for elderly patients, including those without the tech savvy to compete online for hotly contested vaccination slots. This approach may have also been a response to the broadness of the definition of high-risk medical conditions. Patients living with a past or present cancer diagnosis are a large, heterogeneous population (over 17 million in the United States)but are just a fraction of the 81 million unique, medically high-risk patients, a category that includes even common conditions such as obesity. Vague definitions for common conditions such as body mass index > 30 led to an overwhelmingly large number of eligible patients, which likely encouraged states to de-emphasize the entire high-risk category to avoid crowding out elderly patients.

### Impact of COVID-19 disease in early breast cancer management: a summary of the current evidence [^0cac5f91]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that patients who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment should defer vaccination for at least 90 days as stated by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention recommendations. After the final dose is received, an individual is considered fully vaccinated after a minimum of 2 weeks. If the patient is asymptomatic and has not been in close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 14 days, the panel deemed it safe to conduct a surgical procedure. Patients with cancer and surgical patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy or with chemotherapy planned within 8 weeks, are confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and might have a negative outcome. A prospective cohort demonstrated that 30-day adjusted mortality was higher in patients with preoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection who had surgery 0–2 weeks, 3–4 weeks, and 5–6 weeks after the diagnosis of the infection (odds ratio [95% CI], 4.1 [3.3 to 4.8]; 3.9 [2.6 to 5.1], and 3.6 [2.0 to 5.2], respectively) compared with the mortality rate in patients without preoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.5% (95% CI, 1.4 to 1.5).

Estimate of the Risk of Infection

Although some general recommendations on the management of patients with cancer during the COVID‐19 outbreak already exist, further efforts should be made to precisely estimate the actual risk of COVID‐19 infection and the possible related health consequences. This quantitative risk estimate has to be considered as every other competitive risk in the decision‐making process, as oncologists are already used to doing for comorbidities. The risk of infection depends on a combination of general and individual factors.

First, the general risk may vary according to the epidemiological phase of the pandemic in relation to the geographic location of the hospital as well as the area where patients live.

Moreover, the risk of infection depends on factors related to the capability of the institution to establish specific interventions to mitigate this risk, such as the realization of separated and independent accesses and paths for COVID‐19‐positive and ‐negative patients, the environment sanitation, and the optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by both health care providers and patients.

Individual factors are patient related and include the observance of optimal social distancing outside the hospital, the possible cohabitation with individuals at higher risk of infection, the need of using public transportation, the number and duration of planned accesses to the hospital, and the type of possible invasive procedures.

The individual risk of developing severe and life‐threatening consequences from COVID‐19 infection seems overall increased in patients with cancer [2], probably owing to the disease‐related comorbidity and immunosuppressive treatments. Age is the most relevant risk factor, followed by comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes [3]. Moreover, it should be considered that women have a significantly lower risk of developing a critical illness from the infection compared with men [3], and this observation has obvious implications for patients with breast cancer. For explicative purposes, Table 1 proposes a possible evaluation to estimate the individual risk of developing a potential critical illness from COVID‐19 infection, taking into account general and individual factors. This is an empiric, nonquantifiable risk stratification, based on epidemiologic data and on a large cohort of cases admitted in intensive care units in Lombardy [3, 4]. Although arbitrary, it represents our attempt to provide a pragmatic and operative definition of the risk.

### Impact of COVID-19 disease in early breast cancer management: a summary of the current evidence [^07652340]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Five cases of COVID-19 vaccine–related axillary lymphadenopathy that mimicked metastasis in a vulnerable oncologic patient group have been described. Because of widescale vaccination, axillary lymphadenopathy because of COVID-19 vaccination is likely to be encountered in screening or diagnostic mammography. A recent retrospective study reported a vaccine axillary adenopathy incidence rate of 3% among women who underwent mammography after at least one vaccine dose. This study included data from 750 women, and most women with lymph nodes had received two vaccine doses (18 out 23 patients). Despite these findings, experts do not recommend postponing either vaccination or mammography but ideally performing mammography before vaccination.

Few recommendations have been made to obtain supplementary information specific to the COVID-19 vaccine on the patient anamnesis, such as vaccination status date(s) of vaccination(s), type of vaccine, injection site (left or right arm), and any history of palpable axillary adenopathy. Radiologists and oncologists should be aware of this secondary effect of vaccination to avoid false-positive results and unnecessary changes in management, patient emotional stress, or biopsy.

What Is the Role of Postvaccine Antibody Quantification Tests in Patients With eBC?

The current evidence supports that seroconversion rates among patients with cancer are similar to those without the disease, particularly in solid tumors like BC. Vaccine-wise, serologic tests can often be misinterpreted as they might not distinguish between past infection and postvaccination immunologic response. Furthermore, serologic testing does not evaluate cellular immune response. When performed against nucleocapsid protein, these tests will not detect immune responses resulting from vaccination and are unsuitable for vaccine decision making. Most experts do not see a clinical application for these tests.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^f67991fb]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Some studies have suggested that patients with pre-existing autoimmune disorders may be safely treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies. In one study, 52 patients with melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune disorders were treated with either pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Twenty patients (38%) had flares of their autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression, but toxicities were generally mild, manageable, and did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy. The decision to proceed with immunotherapy in a patient with pre-existing autoimmune conditions should include assessing the risk of severe morbidity and/or mortality from the underlying disorder versus risk of relapse or death from the cancer diagnosis. Similarly, if considering using immunotherapy to treat patients with breast cancer receiving immunosuppressive therapy for an underlying autoimmune disorder, it is critical to consider the underlying reason for the immunosuppression as well as the clinical benefit expected from the immunosuppressive agent.

Analyses of outcomes among older patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trialsand real-world settingssuggest that the toxicity profiles and response rates for immunotherapy in the elderly do not differ markedly from those in the general population. Those results must be interpreted with a note of caution, however, as the older patients that were included were all relatively fit (ie, good baseline performance status). Geriatric assessments for elderly individuals may be useful to evaluate the potential safety of more intense therapeutic regimens including immunotherapy.

Baseline corticosteroid use has been associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with lung cancer treated with anti-PD-(L)1 agents. The interpretation of these findings is complicated however, because patients receiving corticosteroids for palliative indications may also have significant comorbidities at baseline. One study that analyzed outcomes stratified by reason for corticosteroid administration found that median PFS and OS were significantly shorter among patients who received ≥ 10 mg prednisone for palliative indications associated with their underlying malignancy compared with those who received ≥ 10 mg prednisone for non-cancer related reasons and compared with patients receiving 0 to < 10 mg of prednisone. The role of glucocorticoids in breast cancer is complex and further complicated due to natural variability in endogenous hormone levels throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. Glucocorticoid receptor signaling has been linked to the emergence of chemoresistance in breast cancer. Although scant data are available on the impact of steroid administration on immunotherapy efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer, a meta-analysis including 16 studies of patients with lung cancer demonstrated no adverse effects on survival outcomes when corticosteroids were used for the management of irAEs.

### Influence of family history on penetrance of hereditary cancers in a population setting [^e472a158]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes is offered to affected individuals based on various qualifying criteria. For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing is offered to individuals with breast or ovarian cancer and/or a known history of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC)in many countries, including the UK and USA, although there have been suggestions that this should be expanded to all women diagnosed with breast cancer. Similarly, patients presenting with colorectal cancer are routinely offered screening for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome). If a causal pathogenic variant is identified, chemoprevention or prophylactic mastectomy/oophorectomy may be advised for HBOC, or regular colonoscopies or prophylactic surgery for Lynch syndrome. However, if no causal variant is found, individuals with a family history of breast or colorectal cancer still have a higher cancer risk relative to the wider population, indicating as yet unknown variants, genes or further risk factors are involved.

Assessment and diagnosis.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of patients with eBC has become more complex, as SARS-CoV-2 infection can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. A summary of the recommendations discussed in the sections below is presented in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Summary of Specialist Panel Recommendations

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be established on the basis of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for symptomatic or asymptomatic patients exposed within 5–10 days to SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals. An RT-PCR should be performed, when available, 24–48 hours before the surgery and 14 days after self-isolation. Considering that RT-PCR has a false-negative rate of 20%-30%, < 10% of COVID-19–infected patients will inadvertently undergo surgery during the incubation period with this approach.

Serologic tests can be used for screening symptomatic patients after day 10 of symptoms as an alternative method to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis (gold standard). However, serologic tests alone are not recommended because they are less sensitive before 10 days of symptom onset and given the possibility of false positives.

Another practical approach is to assess eBC management in those cases with SARS-CoV-2 test results available (positive or negative) and a more controversial clinical scenario (Table 2). The risk of overall postoperative mortality is increased up to 6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, longer delays could negatively affect disease progression and patient outcome. This delay should be considered when deciding whether to postpone elective and nonurgent eBC surgeries in patients with preoperative positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

TABLE 2
SARS-CoV-2 Test Results in Specific eBC Clinical Scenarios

In addition, the decision to defer a surgical operation because of COVID-19 disease should be based on positive RT-PCR results (or antigen point-of-care [POC] tests when RT-PCR is unavailable) and clinical symptoms. Serologic testing results should not guide decision making, considering increased seroconversion of the population as vaccination progresses and other issues related to antibody tests discussed below.

### Prevalence of COVID-19-related risk factors and risk of severe influenza outcomes in cancer survivors: a matched cohort study using linked english electronic health records data [^0fae8663]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

As of 7 July 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been diagnosed in over 11.6 million individuals with more than 539,000 deaths reported worldwide. Around 20% of individuals contracting the virus are estimated to develop severe disease requiring hospitalisation, with a high risk of mortality. A key aspect of managing the impacts of the pandemic is understanding who is vulnerable to experiencing severe outcomes, so that mitigation strategies can be targeted at those most in need. Those under current treatment for cancer were recognised early on as being a high risk group, but the extent to which the much larger population of medium- to long-term cancer survivors might be considered vulnerable is unknown. In England alone, this group includes over 1.8 million people.

Current guidance on who should be considered vulnerable has been largely based on policies developed for previous epidemic respiratory viruses, notably influenza. For example, vaccination against influenza is only recommend for individuals under active treatment for cancer and for up two years following some treatments and haematological cancers, while longer-term cancer survivors with no recent immunosuppressing treatment are not considered high-risk in vaccination guidance from Public Health England or the American Cancer Society. Yet medium- to long-term cancer survivors could plausibly be at raised risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Studies amongst women with breast cancer have found chemotherapy to be associated with changes in immune parameters that did not return to pre-treatment levels a year or more after end of treatment, raising the possibility of a long-term weakened immune system in cancer survivors. In addition, cancer survivors have known raised risks of heart disease, which is itself an emerging risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. One large UK study identified raised risks of COVID-19 mortality in survivors of haematological malignancies even several years after cancer diagnosis, but there is little other evidence to date to inform policy around managing COVID-19 related risks in cancer survivors.

We therefore aimed to investigate whether cancer survivors are likely to be a high-risk group for severe outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic in two ways: first, by comparing the prevalence of risk factors currently used to guide COVID-19 policy between site-specific cancers survivors and cancer free controls; second, by comparing the risk of influenza hospitalisation or death between cancer survivors and cancer free controls, as a way of exploring susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses.

COVID-19 vaccines and breast cancer.

According to the panel, patients with BC should receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available since benefits are likely to outweigh the risks of adverse effects from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Society for Medical Oncology recently reinforced this position. It is essential to point out that limited clinical data support COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer. A multicenter, observational, prospective study has shown that SARS-CoV-2–specific immunoglobulin G antibody response after natural infection does not differ in patients with cancer and healthy control patients. Two prospective observational studies have demonstrated that oncologic patients develop poor SARS-CoV-2 spike protein seroconversion after one dose of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) vaccine, but remarkably increased after the second dose, highlighting the importance of completing the vaccination scheme. However, it is uncertain whether long-term protection can be achieved in the oncologic population, as these studies rely on immunogenicity data alone, and real-world data on the long-term protection of vaccinated cancer patients against COVID-19 disease are limited. In the same vein, data from influenza vaccinations indicate the development of a protective immune response in patients with cancer, and, although potentially not the same level as the general population, it is generally safe.- Again, there are long-term uncertainties, and the protection may vary depending on antineoplastic therapies, administration timing, disease stage, and comorbidities.

Revised recommendations

Eight of the ten recommendations provided in August 2021 are still valid today, while two (recommendations n. 3 and n. 7) need to be revised according to new information. All recommendations are again presented below, and a brief discussion is proposed for those that have been revised.
In patients with previous history of breast cancer, vaccine injection (both doses for two-doses vaccines) should be performed in the contralateral arm or in the anterolateral thigh.

This recommendation has not been revised.
2 COVID-19 vaccination data (vaccination status, date, dose, injection site) of all patients presenting for breast imaging with any modality should be collected and made available to radiologists, including the cases of breast imaging performed for cancer staging and of follow-up imaging examinations.

This recommendation has not been revised.
3 Revised as:

Breast examinations should not be delayed because of COVID-19 vaccination.

The previous recommendation was in favour of rescheduling breast examinations (before the vaccination or at least 12 weeks after the last injection). However, current evidence points towards a near-zero risk of subsequent malignant findings in asymptomatic patients who have unilateral lymphadenopathy and no suspicious breast findings (no cancer cases in the largest series published to date). Moreover, predictive models developed based on data from the first pandemic waves revealed that delayed or missed screening tests have a negative effect on morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the potential temporal overlap of COVID-19 vaccinations in combination or staggered with other vaccines known to cause transient lymphadenopathy should no longer be considered a reason to reschedule periodic breast examinations, either in spontaneous or organized screening programs.
4 In patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, all necessary breast imaging examinations with any modality must be performed without any delay due to vaccination, taking into consideration the risk of false positive lymph node findings.

### GEICAM guidelines for the management of patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain [^394971f0]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

A multidisciplinary group of cancer experts, working under the umbrella of the GEICAM Spanish Breast Cancer Group, developed the following clinical practice‐ and evidence‐based guidelines. Because of the sudden and unexpected pandemic situation, the evidence related to COVID‐19 infection and its implications in the care of patients with breast cancer is scarce. Thus, these recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion, medical organizations' and societies' recommendations, and published evidence. First, we produced a number of general recommendations for patient management but also for hospitals and health care personnel (HCP). Second, we organized specific guidelines by stage of disease and BC subtypes. Third, we described SARS‐CoV‐2 testing procedures and patients to be tested. Finally, we included intensive care unit (ICU) admission criteria relevant to patients with BC.

### The challenge of staging breast cancer with PET / CT in the era of COVID vaccination [^cf29feb6]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We report a case series of biopsy-proven reactive axillary lymph nodes, which were avid on FDG PET/CT in breast cancer patients post COVID-19 vaccination. With 4 cases presenting in a consecutive 10-day period, it became apparent that metabolically active axillary lymphadenopathy is an adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccines, currently being deployed worldwide. This may lead to patients undergoing unnecessary biopsy. We have started taking a COVID-19 vaccine status history before PET/CT. If enlarged/metabolically active axillary nodes are identified in the ipsilateral vaccinated arm, then axillary ultrasound at 4 weeks is suggested.

4 Results

Between 2001 and 2011, there were 396,240 cases of primary female breast cancer. After applying our selection criteria, we retained 164,080 cases (Fig. 1), and identified 176 women with a diagnosis of HIV infection. As seen from Table 1, on average, HIV-infected breast cancer patients were younger compared with HIV-uninfected patients (60.7 ± 12.8 years vs. 75.4 ± 9.0 years, p value < 0.0001, t- test). The HIV-infected group had higher proportion of African Americans (49% vs. 9%, p value < 0.0001, chisq.), those unmarried (74% vs. 60%, p value = 0.0002, chisq.), with at least one comorbidity (48% vs. 35%, p value < 0.0001, chisq), with regional or distant cancer stage (43% vs. 35%, p value = 0.0257, chisq) and those with SSDI disability status (65% vs. 14%, p value < 0.0001, chisq.), compared to the HIV-uninfected patients. The treatment also differed between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected groups. For HIV infected group, 93% of the women had surgery, either alone or with chemo and/or radiation. This proportion was 75% among HIV-uninfected women. The proportion of those receiving surgery alone, or surgery with radiation was only marginally different between the groups. However, the proportion of HIV-infected women who received surgery with chemo ± radiation was higher that among HIV-uninfected women. Finally, only a small proportion of women from both group received radiation alone, chemo alone or radiation with chemo. About 24% of the HIV-uninfected group did not receive treatment, whereas this number was very small for the HIV-infected women. Within HIV-infected group, treatment differed by eligibility status. Lower proportion of SSDI disabled patients received surgery only, or surgery with radiation, and higher proportion received surgery with chemo, compared to the non-disabled patients (20% vs. 42%; 24% vs. 31%, and 21% vs. ≤ 5%, receptively). Among HIV-uninfected patients, lower proportion of disabled patients received surgery (alone or with chemo/radiation), and a higher proportion received no treatment, compared to non-disabled patients (32% vs. 79%, and 67% vs. 17%, p < .0001; data not shown). All-cause mortality was 47% in the HIV-infected patients, compared to 42% in the HIV-uninfected patients. Among HIV-infected patients, 55% of the mortality was due to breast cancer, compared to 32% among HIV-uninfected patients (Table 1). Average number of surviving years was 0.95 ± 0.17, 5.05 ± 3.29 and 0.92 ± 0.16 for HIV-infected group, and 0.96 ± 0.14, 4.96 ± 3.13 and 0.90 ± 0.23 for HIV-uninfected group, for initial phase, interim phase and terminal phase, respectively.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^8d6d9847]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Cancer and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients — pneumonia risk varies by malignancy type and immune defects, with patients with lung cancer having a 21-fold increase in pneumonia compared with a 1.7-fold increase in those with breast cancer compared with the general population. The most readily quantifiable immune defect in clinical practice for patients with cancer and receiving HCT is neutropenia, and the period of neutropenia for most patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy is brief, often less than 7 days, whereas patients with acute leukemias and pre-engraftment HCT recipients frequently have more than 10 days of neutropenia, placing them at substantial risk for immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP). Although the use of absolute lymphocyte count to stratify infection risk is not well defined, it may be used to guide the need for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis or indicate the likelihood of viral pneumonia. Novel therapies further shape risk: in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy the initial neutropenia of conditioning is brief whereas off-tumor hypogammaglobulinemia can be chronic with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and anti-CD20 therapies such as rituximab are associated with notably poor B-cell response to vaccination even more than 12 months after receipt of therapy.

### GEICAM guidelines for the management of patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain [^4cdc6d95]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in Spain. During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, patients with BC still require timely treatment and follow-up; however, hospitals are overwhelmed with infected patients and, if exposed, patients with BC are at higher risk for infection and serious complications if infected. Thus, health care providers need to evaluate each BC treatment and in-hospital visit to minimize pandemic-associated risks while maintaining adequate treatment efficacy. Here we present a set of guidelines regarding available options for BC patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the lack of evidence about COVID-19 infection, these recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion, medical organizations' and societies' recommendations, and some published evidence. We consider this a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in this health crisis situation we are facing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This work presents a set of guidelines regarding available options for breast cancer (BC) patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the suddenness of this health crisis, specialists have to make decisions with little evidence at hand. Thus, these expert guidelines may be a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in the context of a worldwide pandemic with no resources to spare.

Methods

The institutional review boards of each participating university (Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of Miami Miller Health System, Abramson Cancer Center of Penn Medicine, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center of Columbia University) approved this study and issued waivers of consent for the collection of retrospective, deidentified patient data. Shared data were fully deidentified and used within the scope of negotiated data sharing agreements. This report followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Sites and Participants

Study participant data were drawn from 3 urban, academic cancer systems: the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of Miami Miller Health System, including women treated at Jackson Memorial Hospital, in Miami, Florida; the Abramson Cancer Center of Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center of Columbia University in New York City.

The electronic medical record systems at each site were queried for records containing at least 1 respective International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision code that pertained to each case of breast cancer (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) and to HIV (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). The list of potential participants identified through this process was manually reviewed by the investigators to identify individuals meeting the following eligibility criteria: (1) female sex; (2) aged 18 years or older; (3) histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer first diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2018; (4) breast cancer stage between I and III at presentation; and (5) confirmed HIV infection diagnosed no later than 90 days after the initial breast cancer diagnosis. HIV infection was deemed confirmed for inclusion in this study by the presence of a positive serology test result, a quantifiable HIV viral load, or a clinician note clearly referencing an HIV infection. Eligibility did not require patients to have received all their care at the study site, but those without available data on the timing of cancer diagnosis or treatment initiation were excluded, as were women whose first cancer therapy occurred as part of a clinical trial. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and comprised the WLHIV group.

Active Anticancer Therapy for Cancer Patients with Infection or at risk of Infection

During a pandemic, the potential for benefit with chemotherapy would be unchanged, but the risk of harm would be increased to a degree that cannot be readily quantified. Patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery in the month before diagnosis with COVID‐19 had a numerically higher risk (three of four patients) of clinically severe events than did those not receiving chemotherapy or surgery (six of 14 patients) 7.

During a pandemic, the consent process may change because the risk and benefit ratio may alter. For example, cancer patients need to know that anticancer therapy could carry greater risk during a pandemic. In addition, access to hospital beds will be limited both by increased demand and by potential staff shortage. In this circumstance, patients may well make an informed choice for a potentially less efficacious but less myelosuppressive treatment 9. Additionally, the risk of surgery may carry the risk of nosocomial infection with the pandemic pathogen.

Delaying curative adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered within the accepted duration for each disease site 7 (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer can be safely delayed up to 8 weeks, but more than 12 weeks of delay is not recommended) 50. Recommendations for prioritization, treatment, and triage of patients with breast cancer during the COVID‐19 pandemic has been recently published 51.

During a pandemic, cancer patients will be classified as either confirmed infection or at high risk for COVID‐19. Patients who have confirmed COVID‐19 infection should be assessed for holding anticancer therapy until they are deemed medically clear as per the clinical guidance found on the WHO and CDC websites 35, 52. Cancer patients who are on active anticancer therapy continue to be high risk and should remain vigilant for COVID‐19 symptoms. (Fig. 1).

### Axillary lymphadenopathy at the time of COVID-19 vaccination: ten recommendations from the European society of breast imaging (EUSOBI) [^6911a1c1]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Since worldwide mass vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 are currently underway, breast radiologists should be aware of reactive axillary lymphadenopathy as a possible side effect of vaccination, to limit patients' anxiety and avoid unnecessary diagnostic imaging and invasive procedures. We carefully considered the Recommendations for the Management of Axillary Adenopathy in Patients with Recent COVID-19 Vaccination issued by the Society of Breast Imaging, the statements by Becker et al. Edmonds et al. and Lehman et al.

EUSOBI provides the following recommendations regarding general issues (number 1, 2), asymptomatic subjects, including women attending screening programs (number 3), cases with symptoms or imaging-detected findings (number 4–9), and complex cases (number 10).
In patients with previous history of breast cancer, vaccine injection (both doses for two-doses vaccines) should be performed in the contralateral arm or in the anterolateral thigh.
COVID-19 vaccination data (vaccination status, date, dose, injection site) of all patients presenting for breast imaging with any modality should be collected and made available to radiologists, including the cases of breast imaging performed for cancer staging and of follow-up imaging examinations.
Breast examinations should be preferentially performed before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or at least 12 weeks after the injection. For vaccines with a two-dose schedule, the 12-weeks rule applies from the day of the second injection.
In patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, all necessary breast imaging examinations with any modality must be performed without any delay due to vaccination, taking into consideration the risk of false positive lymph node findings.
The contralateral axilla and both breasts should be clinically examined using appropriate imaging to exclude malignancy in all patients with axillary symptoms and in all cases of imaging-detected unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy before vaccination or at least 12 weeks after.
In patients with or without previous breast cancer history, imaging-detected suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy contralateral to the vaccination side should be managed according to standard work-up protocols, including, when necessary, tissue sampling.
In patients without breast cancer history and no suspicious breast imaging findings, imaging-detected unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side of recent COVID-19 vaccination (i.e. within 12 weeks) should be managed according to the clinical setting (Table 2). In asymptomatic patients it should be classified as a benign finding (BI-RADS 2) and no further work-up should be pursued. In case of patients reporting symptoms of axillary lymphadenopathy more than 12 weeks after vaccination, ultrasound examination of the axilla is recommended. In patients with axillary symptoms, incidental unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the vaccination side without any suspicious finding in the breast should be classified as a probably benign finding (BI-RADS 3), requiring a 12-week follow-up. In case of persistent suspicion at this 12-week follow-up, ACR BI-RADS recommendations for the management of axillary lymphadenopathy should be followed, with further work-up including, when necessary, tissue sampling.
In patients without breast cancer history, incidental unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination coupled with ipsilateral suspicious findings in the breast at any imaging modality should be managed according to clinical practice, including biopsy when appropriate.
In patients with personal breast cancer history, lymphadenopathy after vaccination should be interpreted considering the time since vaccination and overall nodal metastatic risk (cancer type, location, stage, etc.). For patients at low risk of axillary or supraclavicular nodal metastases in whom the lymphadenopathy is overwhelmingly more likely due to the vaccination than to the underlying neoplasm (considering time frame, pain, type, and location of cancer), a cautious management strategy without default follow-up imaging is appropriate. Short-interval follow-up imaging with ultrasonography (with at least a 12-week delay) may be performed in patients with higher risk of metastatic lymphadenopathy (e.g. breast cancer, head and neck cancer, upper extremity/trunk melanoma or lymphoma). Node biopsy should be considered in the setting of high nodal metastatic risk when immediate histopathologic confirmation is necessary for timely patient management.
All complex or unclear cases (e.g. axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the cancer and the side of vaccination within 12 weeks after vaccination in patients with previous bilateral breast cancer; vaccinations performed on different sides) should follow a personalised management, considering the risk of malignant lymphadenopathy, opting for tissue sampling when appropriate after multidisciplinary team discussion.

Per NCCN guidance, the patient qualifies for a more comprehensive multi-gene panel analysis because she was age 38 at first breast cancer, had bilateral breast cancer, and has a family history of breast and other cancers.

### Mitigating the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccinations on patients undergoing breast imaging examinations: a pragmatic approach [^947e0f8f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Reports of patients with axillary adenopathy identified on breast imaging after coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are rising. We propose a pragmatic management approach based on clinical presentation, vaccination delivery, and imaging findings. In the settings of screening mammography, screening MRI, and diagnostic imaging workup of breast symptoms, with no imaging findings beyond unilateral axillary adenopathy ipsilateral to recent (within the past 6 weeks) vaccination, we report the adenopathy as benign with no further imaging indicated if no nodes are palpable 6 weeks after the last dose. For patients with palpable axillary adenopathy in the setting of ipsilateral recent vaccination, clinical follow-up of the axilla is recommended. In all these scenarios, axillary ultrasound is recommended if clinical concern persists 6 weeks after vaccination. In patients with a recent breast cancer diagnosis in the pre- or peritreatment setting, prompt recommended imaging is encouraged as well as vaccination (in the thigh or contralateral arm). Our recommendations align with the ACR BI-RADS Atlas and aim to reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs of unnecessary evaluation of enlarged nodes in the setting of recent vaccinations and, also, to avoid further delays in vaccinations and breast cancer screening during the pandemic.

### Evaluation of seropositivity after standard doses of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant treatment [^7a50bec9]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This article presents rare data on the homogeneous population of patients with early breast cancer under active anti-cancer treatments. The patients showed adequate serologic responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus after standard doses of vaccination without serious adverse events in concurrence with active adjuvant anti-cancer therapy. The patients receiving concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy, however, have significantly lower serum anti-spike antibody titers than those under non-cytotoxic anti-cancer treatments or without treatments. Selection of the COVID-19 vaccines should be based on personalized risk stratification considering the use of concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy and the patient's medical circumstances. Booster doses of vaccination could be considered for the vulnerable population, such as the elderly with comorbidities, and the single standard dose of vaccination.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^387b7c7f]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

### Impact of COVID-19 disease in early breast cancer management: a summary of the current evidence [^a9623940]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerations on POC antigen and antibody testing as a replacement for RT-PCR.

Antigen detection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using POC tests provides a workable solution that could enable patients to self-isolate earlier and reduce the spread of infection, representing an option accessible to most outbreak areas compared with standard nucleic acid amplification tests, such as RT-PCR assays. However, the trade-off is a loss of sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification tests, particularly among asymptomatic patients. Trained professionals should carry out these tests.

The POC antigen test is a viable approach when RT-PCR is unavailable in the following scenarios:
Patients presenting with 5- to 7-day onset of symptoms;
Positive results need confirmation by RT-PCR assays (ideally);
Outbreak areas and remote settings, where POC testing constitutes an alternative to RT-PCR.

On the other hand, serology tests have limited application diagnosis-wise, particularly in the acute phase, as most patients will develop an antibody response within 1–3 weeks after infection. Crucial windows of opportunity for clinical intervention and isolation measures might have already been missed.

There is also a possibility of cross-reaction with other pathogens, such as other human coronaviruses, increasing the odds for false positives. There was no consensus among the experts regarding the clinical utility of POC antibody tests. Some authors agreed that this technology could be considered in some situations, despite its limitations in
determining the extent of infection in patients not diagnosed using RT-PCR,
determining infection fatality rate, and
supporting the development of vaccines.

When patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants were diagnosed before age 40 years, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer reached nearly 50% in the ensuing 25 years. Patients who have breast cancer will undergo bilateral mammography at the time of diagnosis to rule out synchronous disease. To detect either recurrence in the ipsilateral breast in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery or a second primary cancer in the contralateral breast, patients will continue to have regular breast physical examinations and mammograms. In the node-negative population, the designated risk groups are as follows:

- **Recurrence score ≤ 11**: low risk. Chemotherapy is not indicated for this group.
- **Recurrence score > 11 and ≤ 25**: intermediate risk.

Chemotherapy decision-making is complex and personalized for this group. Patient age, clinicopathological features, patient preference, and more are incorporated into this decision.
- Recurrence score > 25: high risk. Chemotherapy is indicated for this group. In the postmenopausal node-positive population, the designated risk groups are as follows:

Patients and providers "should be educated about potential irAEs, including the expected timing of symptom onset and management of toxicity with immunotherapies, rationale for holding doses as opposed to dose reductions, and detailed parameters for when to contact their care team." For patients being treated with immunotherapy, education "should include the importance of early recognition and management of irAEs, emphasizing that some of the more common toxicities have vague symptoms and therefore any change from baseline health should be reported," and patients "should be encouraged to inform all their current and future healthcare providers that they have been treated with immunotherapy."

### Evaluation of seropositivity following BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing treatment for cancer [^6ff9a155]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

As patients with cancer were shown to have higher risk of COVID-19 death, they are considered a high-priority subgroup for COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple organizations in the US have urged the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prioritize such patients for COVID-19 vaccination. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) COVID-19 Vaccination Advisory Committee has released preliminary recommendations that support vaccination in all patients with cancer, including those who are receiving active therapy. In their article, the NCCN states that the data that suggest that vaccines may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections are limited; therefore, even if vaccinated, patients and their close contacts should continue wearing masks and maintaining social distancing guidelines. Our results provide serology data that strongly support the NCCN recommendations.

In this study's cohort, most patients with cancer, regardless of type or treatment, demonstrated seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG. Notably, immunosuppression has been shown to attenuate the immune response in other vaccine studies, mainly in hematological cancers. For example, patients with lung or breast cancer exhibited a response to influenza vaccines that was similar to that seen in immunocompetent controls, whereas patients with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy had poorer responses. Antibody responses to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine were shown to be impaired in patients with hematological cancers, but not in patients with solid tumors. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends to vaccinate patients with cancer at the time of lowest immunosuppression (eg, to complete the vaccination series before immunosuppression), and clearly states that vaccines administered during chemotherapy should not be considered valid doses unless a protective antibody level is demonstrated.

Surgical Consideration for Cancer Patients at Risk of Infection

As mentioned earlier, patients who receive surgery in the month before contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 are likely to be at higher risk of clinically severe events than those who did not have surgery 7. During an infectious disease pandemic, patients may face difficulties, including access to hospitalization and deferred surgeries. Currently, there are no published international guidelines for decisions regarding special considerations for surgical intervention in cancer patients during an infectious disease pandemic.

Delaying elective surgical intervention may be more appropriate for select patients (e.g. early asymptomatic small breast cancer tumors detected on routine screening mammograms). These can be followed until the infectious disease pandemic is more controlled or over. Sixty‐day delays in surgical intervention in clinical stage I or stage II breast cancer were not associated with worse oncological outcomes 53. One of the challenges of delaying the elective surgery is the uncertainty regarding the ending of the infectious pandemic. The concept of delaying elective surgery is complex when considered across different disease sites, as each site has a unique oncological multidisciplinary approach. The suggested approach to solid tumor diagnosis and treatment decisions during an infectious disease pandemic, including oncological surgical consideration, is shown in Figure 2. The American College of Surgeons recently published guidance for triage of nonemergent surgical procedures during the COVID‐19 pandemic, based on the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (ESAS) 54.

### Axillary lymph node characteristics in breast cancer patients versus post-COVID-19 vaccination: overview of current evidence per imaging modality [^6d8b507f]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Axillary lymph node characteristics on axillary ultrasound (US), breast MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT are relevant at breast cancer diagnosis. Axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination has been frequently reported. This may cause a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in the ipsilateral axilla in women who have a either a recent diagnosis of breast cancer or a history of breast cancer. This review provides an overview of the current evidence regarding axillary lymph node characteristics at breast cancer diagnosis versus "post-COVID-19 vaccination".

Methods

A non-systematic narrative review was performed. Studies describing axillary lymph node characteristics per imaging modality (axillary US, breast MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT) in breast cancer patients versus post-COVID-19 vaccination were selected and used for the current study.

Results

The morphologic characteristics and distribution of abnormal nodes on US may differ from the appearance of metastatic adenopathy since diffuse cortical thickening of the lymph nodes is the most observed characteristic after vaccination, whereas metastases show as most suspicious characteristics focal cortical thickening and effacement of the fatty hilum. Current evidence on MRI and 18F-FDG on morphologic characteristics of axillary lymphadenopathy is missing, although it was suggested that vaccine related lymphadenopathy is more likely to be present in level 2 and 3 nodes than metastatic nodes. Reported frequencies of lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination range from 49% to 85% (US), 29% (breast MRI) and 14.5% to 53.9% (18F-FDG PET/CT). Several factors may impact the presence or extent of lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination: injection site, type of vaccine (i.e., mRNA versus vector), time interval (days) between vaccination and imaging, previous history of COVID-19 pneumonia, and first versus second vaccine dose.

Conclusion

Although lymph node characteristics differ at breast cancer diagnosis versus post-COVID-19 vaccination, clinical information regarding injection site, vaccine type and vaccination date needs to be documented to improve the interpretation and guide treatment towards the next steps of action.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^b53dec87]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Other general concerns for patients with breast cancer treated with immunotherapy

Curative locoregional therapy including definitive surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy have been used sequentially or concurrently with anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in the I-SPY2, KEYNOTE-522, and IMpassion031studies. Of note, for immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting, monitoring for irAEs may be challenging if patients transfer to another healthcare provider. For example, if a patient receives adjuvant therapy at a tertiary care center, but then transfers care to a local oncologist, it is essential there is exchange of information among providers regarding the risk of toxicity and need for ongoing vigilance for irAEs. In published trials, there has not been an increased incidence of perioperative complications with immunotherapy. While rare with PD-(L)1 agents, adrenal insufficiency is associated with ICIs, and therefore obtaining a preoperative cortisol level is recommended for patients who have received neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors.

Pneumonitis is associated with receipt of prior thoracic or chest wall/breast radiation, and checkpoint inhibitor therapy may increase risk for pulmonary toxicities. Patients with breast cancer undergoing post-mastectomy or regional nodal irradiation are exposed to some level of radiation dose to the lungs, but the rates of pneumonitis did not appear significantly higher in the patients receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab concurrent with adjuvant radiation in KEYNOTE-522. Additional data are required to better understand how different radiation techniques (eg, protons, intensity modulated radiation therapy, volumetric arc therapy, and dose and fractionation regimen) may affect the risk of pneumonitis over time when radiation is delivered concurrently or in close proximity with ICIs. No data exist regarding the specific impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on breast reconstruction outcomes or cosmesis, including in patients who received radiation. Radiation techniques may be relevant in terms of potential impact on the risk of developing lymphopenia, particularly when radiation therapy is given with immunotherapy to large target volumes.

Finally, patients with cancer are at increased risk for severe complications with influenza infection. Several retrospective analyses have demonstrated that inactivated influenza vaccines are safe and effective in patients being treated with ICIs. Vaccination with clinically indicated vaccines (eg, seasonal influenza, COVID-19) should be encouraged. Currently, data are lacking on the safety of live-attenuated vaccines in the context of checkpoint blockade specifically, but current recommendations for patients with cancer undergoing immunosuppressive therapy state that live-attenuated vaccines should be administered ≥ 4 weeks prior to onset or ≥ 3 months after immune restoration.

### Personalized risk-benefit ratio adaptation of breast cancer care at the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak [^016326b4]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Upcoming Scenarios

At the moment, the ultimate course of COVID‐19 spread is still uncertain. Hopefully, the stringent measures of social distancing adopted in all developed countries will lower the number of new daily diagnosed cases of infection to none or few. However, without an efficacious vaccine, the risk of a new outbreak of COVID‐19 infection will remain consistently high, thus requiring maintaining risk‐reducing precautions for a long period. This means that, even in the best desirable scenario of having only a low level of local circulation of the virus corresponding to an individual low risk of infection, many of the measures currently adopted should be maintained. For instance, careful triage of patients before being admitted to the oncology department should be continued. In addition, an increase and optimized use of telemedicine resources should be adopted not only to reduce unnecessary accesses to the hospitals during the COVID‐19 epidemic but also as an occasion to rethink the way to provide a more convenient, efficient, and effective health care service for patients with cancer.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^915875c1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) incidence and management — across published trials — has been estimated to be up to 75% for anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monotherapy (ipilimumab) and up to 30% for anti-PD-(L)1 agents. In general, immunotherapy may be continued in the setting of grade 1–2 immune toxicity that can be managed with topical or systemic low-dose steroids, whereas grade ≥ 3 toxicity, or symptomatic grade 2 toxicity necessitates at least temporary discontinuation of therapy and referral to or consultation with appropriate specialists; referral to appropriate specialists for persistent autoimmunity is recommended.

### Importance of a personal history of breast cancer as a risk factor for the development of subsequent breast cancer: results from screening breast MRI [^f1f50a24]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to assess the importance of a personal history of breast cancer as a risk factor for patients referred for screening breast MRI and to evaluate the importance of this risk factor compared with family history.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of screening breast MRI performed from 2004 to 2012 included a total of 702 patients, 465 of whom had undergone annual MRI and 237 of whom had undergone MRI every 6 months as part of a research protocol.

Results

Of the patients screened, 208 had a personal history of breast cancer, and 345 had a family history as the sole risk factor. An additional 97 patients had both risk factors. The absolute risk for detection of breast cancer at screening MRI among patients with a personal history of cancer was 2.8% (95% CI, 0.6–5.2%). The absolute risk for patients with a strong family history of cancer was 2.0% (95% CI, 0.5–3.5%). The relative risk for detection of breast cancer given a personal history was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.48–4.17) compared with family history. The relative risk when both risk factors were present compared with having only a family history was 3.04 (95% CI, 1.05–8.86).

Conclusion

A personal history of breast cancer is an important risk factor for the development of subsequent breast cancer. Given the results, consideration should be given to MRI screening of patients with a personal history of breast cancer.

### Clinical portrait of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in European cancer patients [^196e6542]. Cancer Discovery (2020). Medium credibility.

The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic significantly impacted on oncology practice across the globe. There is uncertainty as to the contribution of patients' demographics and oncological features on severity and mortality from Covid-19 and little guidance as to the role of anti-cancer and anti-Covid-19 therapy in this population. In a multi-center study of 890 cancer patients with confirmed Covid-19 we demonstrated a worsening gradient of mortality from breast cancer to haematological malignancies and showed that male gender, older age, and number of co-morbidities identifies a subset of patients with significantly worse mortality rates from Covid-19. Provision of chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy did not worsen mortality. Exposure to antimalarials was associated with improved mortality rates independent of baseline prognostic factors. This study highlights the clinical utility of demographic factors for individualized risk-stratification of patients and support further research into emerging anti-Covid-19 therapeutics in SARS-Cov-2 infected cancer patients.

### Patient… [^14afe539]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy to the breast or chest to treat a previous cancer increases the risk of breast cancer. Anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Not every child with one or more risk factors will develop childhood breast cancer, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk for breast cancer. Risk factors for breast cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults include the following:

- Past treatment with radiation therapy to the breast or chest for another cancer, such as Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Having a personal history of a type of cancer that may spread to the breast, such as leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or lymphoma.
- A family history of breast cancer in a mother, father, sister, or brother.
- Inherited changes in the BRCA1or BRCA2gene or in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.

Genetic counseling may be done for patients with breast cancer and a family history of breast cancer. It is not always clear from the family medical history whether a condition is inherited. Certain families may benefit from genetic counseling and genetic testing. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can help parents understand the following:

- Their family medical history.
- Their options for genetic testing for the. Clinical breast exam: An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breast and under the arm for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Mammogram: An x-ray of the breast. When treatment for another cancer included radiation therapy to the breast or chest, it is important to have a mammogram and MRI of the breast to check for breast cancer. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor.

For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer.
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for childhood breast cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

### Screening and follow-up of the patient at high risk for breast cancer [^5e9fb036]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Accurately defining a patient's risk of developing breast cancer is a challenging endeavor. Many factors have been implicated in the causation of breast cancer and quantifying them is difficult. Risk stratification is performed using population models, such as the Gail model, as well as the patient's personal and family history and genetic testing. The clinician who is facile with these components will not only be able to identify those patients at highest risk for whom heightened surveillance is recommended, but also to allay the fears of the average-risk patient and provide them reassurance. Patients who are at very high risk of developing breast cancer are BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers, those with a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ with associated family history, those who have undergone therapeutic or similarly significant radiation exposure, and those with a history of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in the family of an untested individual. Patients with an elevated risk, but not in the very high risk category, are those with a family history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, significantly dense breast tissue, hormone replacement therapy longer than 10 years, and a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ without family history of breast cancer. Risk-reducing strategies include chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene and surgical prophylaxis with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. A high-risk surveillance regimen includes annual mammography, annual magnetic resonance imaging in selected individuals, and semiannual clinical breast exams.

### Updated guidelines on when to consider germline testing for patients with breast cancer [^1fe452fd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Other professional society guidance and ASCO-SSO age threshold are summarized as follows: In 2019, the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) issued a statement recommending that germline genetic testing be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer regardless of age at diagnosis. The 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines advocates testing for all patients age 50 years and younger with breast cancer, those age 65 years and younger with a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and multiple other subgroups suggestive of a hereditary predisposition. The Cancer Care Ontario presents similar guidance, recommending testing for all patients age 45 years and younger, age 50 years and younger with a significant family history of breast cancer, or age 60 years and younger with TNBC. The ASCO-SSO expert panel concluded that the ideal balance of sensitivity and specificity was reached at an age-testing threshold of 65 years regardless of tumor characteristics or other factors, and this recommendation is likely due to the higher prevalence of PVs in this age cohort.

### Pandemic phase-adjusted analysis of COVID-19 outcomes reveals reduced intrinsic vulnerability and substantial vaccine protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in patients with breast cancer [^ea577db3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although representing the majority of newly diagnosed cancers, patients with breast cancer appear less vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality compared with other malignancies. In the absence of patients on active cancer therapy included in vaccination trials, a contemporary real-world evaluation of outcomes during the various pandemic phases, as well as of the impact of vaccination, is needed to better inform clinical practice.

Methods

We compared COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among patients with breast cancer across prevaccination (February 27, 2020-November 30, 2020), Alpha-Delta (December 1, 2020-December 14, 2021), and Omicron (December 15, 2021-January 31, 2022) phases using OnCovid registry participants (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04393974). Twenty-eight-day case fatality rate (CFR 28) and COVID-19 severity were compared in unvaccinated versus double-dosed/boosted patients (vaccinated) with inverse probability of treatment weighting models adjusted for country of origin, age, number of comorbidities, tumor stage, and receipt of systemic anticancer therapy within 1 month of COVID-19 diagnosis.

Results

By the data lock of February 4, 2022, the registry counted 613 eligible patients with breast cancer: 60.1% (n = 312) hormone receptor-positive, 25.2% (n = 131) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, and 14.6% (n = 76) triple-negative. The majority (61%; n = 374) had localized/locally advanced disease. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range, 51–74 years). A total of 193 patients (31.5%) presented ≥ 2 comorbidities and 69% (n = 330) were never smokers. In total, 392 (63.9%), 164 (26.8%), and 57 (9.3%) were diagnosed during the prevaccination, Alpha-Delta, and Omicron phases, respectively. Analysis of CFR 28 demonstrates comparable estimates of mortality across the three pandemic phases (13.9%, 12.2%, 5.3%, respectively; P = 0.182). Nevertheless, a significant improvement in outcome measures of COVID-19 severity across the three pandemic time periods was observed. Importantly, when reported separately, unvaccinated patients from the Alpha-Delta and Omicron phases achieved comparable outcomes to those from the prevaccination phase. Of 566 patients eligible for the vaccination analysis, 72 (12.7%) were fully vaccinated and 494 (87.3%) were unvaccinated. We confirmed with inverse probability of treatment weighting multivariable analysis and following a clustered robust correction for participating center that vaccinated patients achieved improved CFR 28 (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.40), hospitalization (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.69), COVID-19 complications (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.45), and reduced requirement of COVID-19-specific therapy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.63) and oxygen therapy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.67) compared with unvaccinated controls.

Conclusion

Our findings highlight a consistent reduction of COVID-19 severity in patients with breast cancer during the Omicron outbreak in Europe. We also demonstrate that even in this population, a complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination course is a strong determinant of improved morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

### Management strategies for patients presenting with symptomatic lymphadenopathy and breast edema after recent COVID-19 vaccination [^9704f0a0]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is a well-documented finding associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Varying guidelines have been published for the management of asymptomatic patients who have a history of recent vaccination and present with incidental lymphadenopathy at screening mammography. Some experts recommend follow-up imaging, and others suggest that clinical management, rather than repeat imaging or biopsy, is appropriate. Symptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and/or additional abnormal imaging findings should be treated differently depending on risk factors and clinical scenarios. Although ipsilateral lymphadenopathy is well documented, ipsilateral breast edema after COVID-19 vaccination has been rarely reported. The combination of ipsilateral lymphadenopathy and diffuse breast edema after COVID-19 vaccination presents a clinical management challenge because edema can obscure underlying abnormalities at imaging. For symptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and associated breast parenchymal abnormality, prompt action is appropriate, including diagnostic evaluation and consideration of tissue sampling. This approach may prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment of patients with malignancy masked by symptoms from the vaccination.
