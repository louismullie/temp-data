## Question

What's the anatomy of respiratory system?
Mention one resource

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the anatomy of the respiratory system and wants one resource mentioned. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, clinically oriented source that succinctly covers respiratory anatomy. Then, I should verify that the source indeed details both upper and lower respiratory tracts, including key structures and their relationships. Next, I will extract and synthesize the anatomical hierarchy, making sure I don't omit critical components like the pleura, diaphragm, and mediastinum. Finally, I will double-check for any inconsistencies and correct them explicitly while citing the chosen resource clearly.

> Let me first confirm the best source to anchor this answer. The SEER training modules from the National Cancer Institute provide a concise, clinically oriented overview of respiratory anatomy and are frequently used in medical education, so I will use the SEER "Introduction to the Respiratory System" and "Anatomy of the Lung" pages as the primary reference, with the NCI Dictionary definition as supportive context [^84dcb74e] [^5060cc42] [^54a4567e].

> I will now examine the upper respiratory tract. Wait, let me verify the division: SEER describes the respiratory tract as divided into upper and lower components, with the upper tract comprising the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx, which aligns with standard teaching and the NCI definition listing nose, throat, and larynx among respiratory organs, so I should include the larynx in the upper tract even though some summaries place it at the transition to the lower tract [^ef748d74] [^54a4567e].

> Next, I should review the lower respiratory tract. SEER clearly identifies the lower tract as including the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs, with the trachea bifurcating into right and left primary bronchi that branch into progressively smaller bronchioles and terminate in alveoli, which are the functional gas-exchange units; I need to ensure I note the epithelial transitions from ciliated pseudostratified columnar to cuboidal to squamous as the airways get smaller [^ef748d74] [^495be1d2].

> Hold on, I should verify lung lobation and pleural relationships. The right lung has three lobes and the left lung has two lobes with a cardiac notch, both enclosed by a double-layered pleura forming a pleural cavity, and the lungs are separated by the mediastinum containing the heart, trachea, esophagus, and lymph nodes; I should also confirm that the diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity and is integral to ventilation mechanics [^5060cc42] [^495be1d2].

> Let me consider the functional framing to ensure completeness. SEER emphasizes that the respiratory system's primary roles are ventilation, external respiration in the lungs, internal respiration at the tissues, and regulation of blood pH; I should also remember that neural control of breathing and cough involves brainstem circuits and vagal afferents, though I won't over-detail that here since the request is focused on anatomy rather than neurophysiology [^84dcb74e] [^819aecb9].

> But wait, what if I implied the larynx is exclusively lower tract? I should correct that nuance. While SEER lists the larynx within the lower respiratory tract, many curricula treat the larynx as the transition zone between upper and lower airways, so I will acknowledge that variability to avoid overstatement and keep the citation consistent with SEER's structure [^ef748d74].

> In summary, the respiratory system consists of the upper respiratory tract (nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx) and the lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs with their alveoli), with the lungs protected by pleura, bounded by the diaphragm, and separated by the mediastinum; this hierarchy and these relationships are detailed in the SEER training modules, which I have used as the primary source for this synthesis [^ef748d74] [^5060cc42] [^495be1d2].

---

The respiratory system consists of the **upper respiratory tract** (nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx) and the **lower respiratory tract** (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs) [^ef748d74]. The **lungs** are the primary organs, with the right lung having three lobes and the left two, and are enclosed by the pleura and separated by the mediastinum [^5060cc42]. Air enters through the nose, passes through the pharynx and larynx, then the trachea, which divides into bronchi and bronchioles, and finally reaches the alveoli where gas exchange occurs [^495be1d2]. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles drive ventilation, and the system is protected by mucociliary clearance and cough reflexes [^a88d8ce2].

---

## Upper respiratory tract

The upper respiratory tract includes the **nose and nasal cavity**, which filter, warm, and humidify incoming air, and the **pharynx**, a shared passage for air and food that directs air to the larynx. The **larynx** contains the vocal cords and acts as a gateway to the lower respiratory tract, preventing aspiration [^ef748d74].

---

## Lower respiratory tract

The lower respiratory tract comprises the **trachea**, a cartilaginous tube that conducts air from the larynx to the bronchi; the **bronchi and bronchioles**, branching airways that deliver air to the lungs; and the **lungs**, paired organs responsible for gas exchange [^495be1d2].

---

## Lungs

- **Structure**: The lungs are soft, spongy organs enclosed by the pleura, with the right lung having three lobes and the left two lobes to accommodate the heart [^5060cc42].
- **Pleura**: A double-layered serous membrane that reduces friction during breathing [^5060cc42].
- **Mediastinum**: The central compartment containing the heart, trachea, esophagus, and lymph nodes [^5060cc42].

---

## Alveoli

Alveoli are **tiny air sacs** at the ends of bronchioles where gas exchange occurs; their walls are extremely thin, facilitating diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between air and blood [^495be1d2].

---

## Muscles of respiration

The **diaphragm** is the primary muscle of inspiration, contracting to increase thoracic volume, while the **intercostal muscles** assist by elevating the rib cage during inspiration [^notfound].

---

## Protective mechanisms

- **Mucociliary clearance**: Cilia and mucus trap and expel pathogens and particles [^notfound].
- **Cough reflex**: Clears irritants and secretions from the airways [^a88d8ce2].

---

The respiratory system is a coordinated network of airways, lungs, and muscles that enables gas exchange, with protective mechanisms to maintain airway integrity and function [^84dcb74e].

### High-parametric protein maps reveal the spatial organization in early-developing human lung [^66d1319b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The respiratory system, including the lungs, is essential for terrestrial life. While recent research has advanced our understanding of lung development, much still relies on animal models and transcriptome analyses. In this study conducted within the Human Developmental Cell Atlas (HDCA) initiative, we describe the protein-level spatiotemporal organization of the lung during the first trimester of human gestation. Using high-parametric tissue imaging with a 30-plex antibody panel, we analyzed human lung samples from 6 to 13 post-conception weeks, generating data from over 2 million cells across five developmental timepoints. We present a resource detailing spatially resolved cell type composition of the developing human lung, including proliferative states, immune cell patterns, spatial arrangement traits, and their temporal evolution. This represents an extensive single-cell resolved protein-level examination of the developing human lung and provides a valuable resource for further research into the developmental roots of human respiratory health and disease.

### Respiratory system simulations and modeling [^664152da]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Simulators and models of the respiratory system range from simple mechanical devices to complex systems that include sophisticated computers. These systems have considerable utility in clinician education, guiding therapies, evaluating new devices and techniques, and in improving our understanding of the cardiorespiratory system. Simulators and models are of 3 types: signs-and-symptoms simulators, anatomic models, and physiologic models. Signs-and-symptoms simulators range from human actors to computer-controlled patient mannequins. Clinical scenarios, from minor abnormalities to catastrophic emergencies, can be simulated. As has been found with aircraft cockpit simulators, improved clinician performance in simulated emergencies should translate into improved performance in real patient-care situations. Anatomic modeling can simulate basic anatomy for training clinicians. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the airways, using real patient data, can help to plan therapy, understand the disease process, and warn of safety issues. Anatomic modeling with radiographs and magnetic resonance images, sometimes created using radiolabeled tracer gases, can create 3-dimensional images of regional lung anatomy and function. Physiologic signals such as carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption, and washout/washin of various tracer gases can be used to model ventilation-perfusion and ventilation-volume relationships, and those models can improve understanding of disease processes and guide therapies.

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^037e2141]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, posing a significant burden worldwide. Globally, chronic respiratory diseases impacted a large patient group accounting for 7.4% of the world's population and led to 7.0% of total all-cause deaths. Lower respiratory infections kill millions of people annually, and for example, the COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic alone caused more than two million deaths during the 1st year since the outbreak. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with the 5- year survival rate of 10–20% in most countries. Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common lethal infectious disease, ranking above the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome since 2007. These mentioned above are considered the most important lung diseases worldwide from a prevalence standpoint, according to the Forum of International Respiratory Societies. Respiratory diseases, which impose an immense and persistent burden on the health care system worldwide, are intrinsically difficult to diagnose, mainly due to the unavailability of necessary and important diagnostic equipment in remote areas or resource-constrained settings. It is an urgent need to develop a new tool to accelerate homogenization of the diagnosis of respiratory diseases, particularly in areas where medical resources are unevenly distributed or scarce in China.

Radiology plays an indispensable role in the screening, triaging, and diagnosis of various respiratory diseases. Chest radiography, often known as chest X-ray (CXR), is the most commonly used first-line investigative technique for disease evaluation. Computed tomography (CT), which can generate three-dimensional (3D) volumes and offer more precise information on pathologies than CXR images, is also a mainstay of medical imaging strategies for thoracic disease diagnosis. Although these techniques can capture digital texture invisible to human eyes, the accurate diagnosis is still challenging owing to the lack of interobserver agreement in radiological evaluation. There are many chest abnormalities; the co-occurrence of multiple abnormalities is frequently observed in the same imaging modality, and the same pathology may disperse in various sites in one scan. A wide variety of chest abnormalities pose a huge challenge to the accurate diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. Therefore, improving the use of bulk radiological images has been of paramount importance and enormous value.

### Is the lung built for exercise? Advances and unresolved questions [^6a86b0c7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nearly 40 yr ago, Professor Dempsey delivered the 1985 ACSM Joseph B. Wolffe Memorial Lecture titled: "Is the lung built for exercise?" Since then, much experimental work has been directed at enhancing our understanding of the functional capacity of the respiratory system by applying complex methodologies to the study of exercise. This review summarizes a symposium entitled: "Revisiting 'Is the lung built for exercise?'" presented at the 2022 American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting, highlighting the progress made in the last three-plus decades and acknowledging new research questions that have arisen. We have chosen to subdivide our topic into four areas of active study: (i) the adaptability of lung structure to exercise training, (ii) the utilization of airway imaging to better understand how airway anatomy relates to exercising lung mechanics, (iii) measurement techniques of pulmonary gas exchange and their importance, and (iv) the interactions of the respiratory and cardiovascular system during exercise. Each of the four sections highlights gaps in our knowledge of the exercising lung. Addressing these areas that would benefit from further study will help us comprehend the intricacies of the lung that allow it to meet and adapt to the acute and chronic demands of exercise in health, aging, and disease.

### Effects of childhood respiratory diseases on the anatomical and functional development of the respiratory system [^89e6ff5d]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The anatomical and functional development of the lung appears especially vulnerable to a whole range of insults during gestation and the first few years of life. A significant proportion of adult lung disease originates in utero or early infancy. Most publications on this topic are descriptive retrospective studies. An important limitation of these is that structural changes may precede abnormalities in lung function and development of symptoms. Little is known with certainty with respect to the long-term effects of early insults to the respiratory system. Furthermore, the reversibility of the functional and/or structural defects is hardly ever adequately investigated and it is probably not correct to extrapolate findings from adult studies to paediatric pulmonary diseases. Promoting or facilitating optimal lung growth in fetuses and infants and reducing the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in infancy may reduce the incidence of adult chronic lung disease in generations to come.

### Toward a cell atlas of the human airway [^459a2750]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Although this study excels regarding sample collection and data analysis, it is not without limitations; probably the most important are the limited size and diversity of the population. This is essential, as age, sex, race, and ethnicity may have substantial effects on the cellular content of the human airway, a compartment constantly in contact with environmental exposures. It would be regrettable if single-cell profiling, a transformative cutting-edge technology, repeats errors of past eras and sets its reference of cells based on one homogenous and limited population. Of course, as more scRNAseq data sets of the lung and respiratory tract become available, the integration of these data sets into an airway cell atlas that is truly representative of human diversity becomes possible. For this to happen, several conditions are required. First, the data has to be publicly available and deposited on a public database with equal access to all to allow integration, synergy, and validation of results by others in the community. Second, a convention is needed about what constitutes a cell, the transcriptional and quantitative attributes and experimental validations required to define an scRNAseq finding as a "real cell", and the nomenclature used to name it. Third, we as a community must move beyond convenience cohorts to carefully planned cohorts, taking into account the diversity parameters mentioned above. Finally, a minimum set of metadata must be defined for human samples. It is possible that integrating this data set with currently available normal human lung and airway data sets as well the recent very large human lung disease data sets will allow immediate validation and augmentation of the exciting results in this manuscript. In summary, the study by Deprez and colleagues is a major milestone toward the generation of a comprehensive cell atlas of the human airway. Providing such a comprehensive and accurate atlas will improve our understanding of the airway and its function in development, health, and disease. Combining this effort with similar efforts from diseased tissues will eventually lead to better approaches in the diagnosis and management of airway diseases.

### Various approaches to clinically related research can yield helpful insight. A personal perspective [^4552bd8e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Attending two recent meetings (the joint American Physician Scientists Association, American Society of Clinical Investigation, and Association of American Physicians meeting and the American Thoracic Society meeting) and listening to state of the art presentations, viewing research posters, and interacting with young scientists about so much new and exciting human research rekindled my thoughts about how one could now begin research. For me this occurred, with excellent mentoring and supervision, as first a descriptive "looking" approach to identify host immunity components in a variety of animal models and then manipulating these models to mimic disease processes, focusing on the respiratory tract and innate immunity. Next, we moved to characterize these host immunity components in normal humans, before applying these to in vitro and clinical illness situations for patients. The intent of this research sequence was to better describe and manipulate immunopathology relevant to disease. A bench-to-patient approach, mostly descriptive and "looking", was the path. I have illustrated these steps with applicable references. Now seems such a crucial time to further scientific knowledge and to foster personalized medicine, despite a period of financial restraint. We need discussion of ways to best approach "looking" for still unknown basic information about the human respiratory system. Two special examples are identifying the still unknown cells in human lung tissue and their functions and manipulating the extensive respiratory microbiome.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^819aecb9]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Organization of the brainstem control system — a network including the ventrolateral medulla, raphe nuclei, and pons is responsible for controlling the duration of the inspiratory, compressive, and expulsive phases of coughing as well as the magnitude of motor activation of the respiratory muscles, and this network also regulates respiratory muscles to produce breathing. Evidence supports an anatomically distributed, but shared, network for both cough and breathing, with synaptic connections that can explain motor drive to respiratory muscles during both behaviors; the process by which selected populations alter their activities for both behaviors is known as reconfiguration.

### Introduction to the respiratory system-SEER training modules… [^84dcb74e]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to the Respiratory System When the respiratory system is mentioned, people generally think of breathing, but breathing is only one of the activities of the respiratory system. The body cells need a continuous supply of oxygen for the metabolic processes that are necessary to maintain life. The respiratory system works with the circulatory system to provide this oxygen and to remove the waste products of metabolism. It also helps to regulate pH of the blood. Respiration is the sequence of events that results in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body cells. Every 3 to 5 seconds, nerve impulses stimulate the breathing process, or ventilation, which moves air through a series of passages into and out of the lungs. After this, there is an exchange of gases between the lungs and the blood. This is called external respiration. The blood transports the gases to and from the tissue cells.

The exchange of gases between the blood and tissue cells is internal respiration. Finally, the cells utilize the oxygen for their specific activities: this is called cellular metabolism, or cellular respiration. Together, these activities constitute respiration.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^fd1d9cbb]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Your nice and elaborate experimental study demonstrating that your favorite molecule is essential in the pathogenesis of a common lung disease is ready for submission. You chose a very prestigious journal. After a few weeks, you receive the reviewers' comments. One (or more) of the reviewers is asking for a formal quantification of the histological findings in your animal model. What now? After a brief search, you find out that there exists something called stereology (in case the reviewer didn't already mention it) that is considered the gold standard to quantitate lung architecture in microscopy. There is even an official research policy statement by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) about this. You approach one of the leading scientists in the field of lung stereology and ask for help. After a few emails have been exchanged, this expert tells you that your study cannot be rescued at this stage, because all you have available for analysis is a few paraffin sections taken arbitrarily from each mouse lung without knowledge of the volume of the fixed lung, but these alone are not suitable for stereological analysis (compare Table 1 for common problems). Sadly, without these data the journal is not willing to accept your paper for publication.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^b5fb5dc1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

COVID-19 affects all components of the respiratory system, including the neuromuscular breathing apparatus, the conducting airways, the respiratory airways and alveoli, the pulmonary vascular endothelium, and pulmonary blood flow. As of this writing, after fewer than 6 months of clinical experience and research into the disease, many publications have described gross and histological pathology, radiographic changes, and clinical manifestations of the disease. Few data, however, convincingly combine these observations into a more complete mechanistic model of the disease that permits researchers and clinicians to identify cause-and-effect relationships that can be targeted safely and effectively to improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, the accumulated data to this point identify several tantalizing avenues for investigation that may successfully lead to a fuller understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of viable therapeutic targets. Although COVID-19 of the respiratory system appears to be a complex disease that may resist finding a single silver bullet intervention, these observations provide promising avenues to pursue. This review summarizes much of the known data on COVID-19–induced disorders of the respiratory system, offering researchers and clinicians an early and rough sketch of the challenges that confront us.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^bf529881]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Applying imaging metrics in computational modeling to predict lung function highlights that modeling supports the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of images and provides data to aid the development and refinement of physiological models. Because imaging modalities offer complementary information and no single method captures all measures simultaneously, the goal is to integrate multimodal image data with physiological measurements to characterize how structure determines function, and quantitative linking of lung structure and function can be done only through computational modeling based on the laws of physics. Given the complexity and multifactorial nature of respiratory diseases, structure-based models that include interactions among tissue, airway, and circulation can facilitate analysis and interpretation of how intersubject differences, imaging protocols, and normal or abnormal physiology contribute to imaging-based metrics, and carefully constructed models can examine contributions of different factors and provide mechanistic understanding beyond statistical methods. General principles state that biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters; forward models are useful for sensitivity analyses and can predict emergent behavior in response to parameter changes, whereas inverse models can derive information that cannot be measured directly.

### Regenerative medicine for the respiratory system: distant future or tomorrow's treatment? [^ba3c0291]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Regenerative medicine (RM) is a new field of biomedical science that focuses on the regeneration of tissues and organs and the restoration of organ function. Although regeneration of organ systems such as bone, cartilage, and heart has attracted intense scientific research over recent decades, RM research regarding the respiratory system, including the trachea, the lung proper, and the diaphragm, has lagged behind. However, the last 5 years have witnessed novel approaches and initial clinical applications of tissue-engineered constructs to restore organ structure and function. In this regard, this article briefly addresses the basics of RM and introduces the key elements necessary for tissue regeneration, including (stem) cells, biomaterials, and extracellular matrices. In addition, the current status of the (clinical) application of RM to the respiratory system is discussed, and bottlenecks and recent approaches are identified. For the trachea, several initial clinical studies have been reported and have used various combinations of cells and scaffolds. Although promising, the methods used in these studies require optimization and standardization. For the lung proper, only (stem) cell-based approaches have been probed clinically, but it is becoming apparent that combinations of cells and scaffolds are required to successfully restore the lung's architecture and function. In the case of the diaphragm, clinical applications have focused on the use of decellularized scaffolds, but novel scaffolds, with or without cells, are clearly needed for true regeneration of diaphragmatic tissue. We conclude that respiratory treatment with RM will not be realized tomorrow, but its future looks promising.

### Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in respiratory medicine [^c1146af3]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

The past 5years have seen an explosion of interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques in medicine. This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as 'normal' or 'abnormal' DNNs are 'trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests. This article surveys progress in this area over the past 5years, as well as highlighting the current limitations of AI and machine learning and the potential for future developments.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^33488c29]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society key conclusions and recommendations — quantitative imaging modalities (CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI) offer innovative quantitative information on lung structure and function, and assumptions and limitations of each should be clearly stated to avoid misinterpretation of results. Lung tissue density is higher in gravitationally dependent than nondependent regions, and acquisition conditions affect distributions and quantification; acquisition conditions should be documented and standardized when possible and considered in data interpretation. Quantitative analysis of imaging data should follow basic principles of unbiased study design and sampling, and measurements should be related to a well-defined anatomical or volumetric reference space and normative data when appropriate. Optimizing the accuracy of landmark segmentation, registration, and automated image analysis protocols are major areas in need of research and validation, and methodology should be clearly described. Established guidelines and characterized reference standards should be followed to maximize reproducibility among sessions, scanners, and modalities. Automated exhaustive voxel-by-voxel image analysis increases precision but not necessarily accuracy, and high-precision measurements may exacerbate systematic bias and reduce the accuracy of results. Care should be taken to select appropriate physiological parameters for correlation with imaging metrics, and the limitations of comparisons should be considered. Gas exchange is determined by alveolar ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion, and terminology inferred from imaging should be precise to avoid confusion. Functional lung imaging remains emergent; many techniques lack rigorous validation or gold standards, and there is a need for more studies using robust animal models to directly validate conclusions against quantitative structural analysis. Computational models of physiological processes may be combined with imaging metrics to aid prediction, validation, and mechanistic interpretation linking imaged findings to function.

### Adult bronchoscopy training: current state and suggestions for the future: CHEST expert panel report [^9716e36a]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Bronchoscopy simulation modalities — low- and high-fidelity models are characterized and supported by evidence: Simulation technology in bronchoscopy is available in two forms: low-fidelity inanimate mechanical airway models and high-fidelity computer-based electronic simulation. Low-fidelity simulation models consist of molded tracheobronchial trees that offer realistic tubular-shaped airway-like structures with accurate anatomy to the first subsegmental bronchi level, assisting novice learners in memorizing airway anatomy, building muscle memory, and enhancing hand-eye coordination, with relative low cost but a lack of interactive capability that limits situational learning. High-fidelity simulation models present computer-generated three-dimensional images of the airways, offer training through a proxy bronchoscope with various scenarios, can track performance metrics and generate a performance score, and provide repeated training in a safe, stress-free environment with exposure to rare or difficult scenarios and immediate feedback, though the main disadvantage is high cost. High-fidelity simulators have been validated as a performance measurement tool with an ability to discriminate among bronchoscopists with varying levels of bronchoscopy skills, have been shown to speed the acquisition of bronchoscopy skills among novice bronchoscopists, are supported by a well-conducted meta-analysis, and comparisons suggest animal or plastic models may be superior to more costly virtual reality simulators.

### COVID-19 severity prediction from chest X-ray images using an anatomy-aware deep learning model [^584496e4]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been adversely affecting the patient management systems in hospitals around the world. Radiological imaging, especially chest x-ray and lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, plays a vital role in the severity analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, with an increasing number of patients and a lack of skilled radiologists, automated assessment of COVID-19 severity using medical image analysis has become increasingly important. Chest x-ray (CXR) imaging plays a significant role in assessing the severity of pneumonia, especially in low-resource hospitals, and is the most frequently used diagnostic imaging in the world. Previous methods that automatically predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia mainly focus on feature pooling from pre-trained CXR models without explicitly considering the underlying human anatomical attributes. This paper proposes an anatomy-aware (AA) deep learning model that learns the generic features from x-ray images considering the underlying anatomical information. Utilizing a pre-trained model and lung segmentation masks, the model generates a feature vector including disease-level features and lung involvement scores. We have used four different open-source datasets, along with an in-house annotated test set for training and evaluation of the proposed method. The proposed method improves the geographical extent score by 11% in terms of mean squared error (MSE) while preserving the benchmark result in lung opacity score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AA model in COVID-19 severity prediction from chest X-ray images. The algorithm can be used in low-resource setting hospitals for COVID-19 severity prediction, especially where there is a lack of skilled radiologists.

### Systems biology and clinical practice in respiratory medicine. the twain shall meet [^1f517533]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Respiratory diseases are highly complex, being driven by host-environment interactions and manifested by inflammatory, structural, and functional abnormalities that vary over time. Traditional reductionist approaches have contributed vastly to our knowledge of biological systems in health and disease to date; however, they are insufficient to provide an understanding of the behavior of the system as a whole. In this Pulmonary Perspective, we discuss systems biology approaches, especially but not limited to the study of the lung as a complex system. Such integrative approaches take into account the large number of dynamic subunits and their interactions found in biological systems. Borrowing methods from physics and mathematics, it is possible to study the collective behavior of these systems over time and in a multidimensional manner. We first examine the physiological basis for complexity in the respiratory system and its implications for disease. We then expand on the potential applications of systems biology methods to study complex systems, within the context of diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and critical illness. We summarize the significant advances made in recent years using systems approaches for disease phenotyping, applied to data ranging from the molecular to clinical level, obtained from large-scale asthma and COPD networks. We describe new studies using temporal complexity patterns to characterize asthma and COPD and predict exacerbations as well as predict adverse outcomes in critical care. We highlight new methods that are emerging with this approach and discuss remaining questions that merit greater attention in the field.

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^b8370e6c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the context of precision medicine, we aimed at generating an AI-based automatic analysis pipeline to empower precise abnormality identification and accurate disease diagnosis in the respiratory field. Here, we developed the DeepMRD TR model based on the deep-learning algorithms to address the aforementioned realistic clinical application and technological issues through real-world large-scale CT scans and CXR images. To verify the generalizability and robustness of the DeepMRD TR system, we validated the system in an external dataset collected from another institution. We compared the performance of AI system on CT and CXR images to enable actual deployment in the scenario where CT devices are less available. Further we deployed a preliminary version of the AI system into the clinical workflow to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating our AI system into real-life clinical workflows in a human + AI fashion with advantages on time consumption and prediction accuracy. Therefore, our model will hopefully aid junior physicians in developing their competence, and senior physicians in improving their efficiency.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^a88d8ce2]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Anatomy and Neurophysiology of Cough — CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report explains that bronchopulmonary C-fibers and a subset of mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive myelinated sensory nerves play essential roles in regulating cough, and these vagal sensory nerves terminate primarily in the larynx, trachea, carina, and large intrapulmonary bronchi; other bronchopulmonary sensory nerves, sensory nerves innervating other viscera, as well as somatosensory nerves innervating the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal musculature regulate cough patterning and cough sensitivity. The brainstem and higher brain control systems that process this sensory information are complex, but our current understanding of them is considerable and increasing, and the relevance of these neural systems to clinical phenomena, such as urge to cough and psychologic methods for treatment of dystussia, is high, with modern imaging methods having revealed potential neural substrates for some features of cough in the human. Cough preserves the gas-exchanging functions of the lung by facilitating clearance of aspirate, inhaled particulate matter, accumulated secretions, and irritants that are either inhaled or formed at sites of mucosal inflammation, and an impaired cough reflex can have acute, dire consequences. Under normal conditions, therefore, cough serves an important protective role in the airways and lungs; however, cough is also a mechanism for the spread of life-threatening respiratory tract infections.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

### Resident cellular components of the human lung: current knowledge and goals for research on cell phenotyping and function [^d0871314]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of the workshop was to identify still obscure or novel cellular components of the lung, to determine cell function in lung development and in health that impacts on disease, and to decide promising avenues for future research to extract and phenotype these cells. Since robust technologies are now available to identify, sort, purify, culture, and phenotype cells, progress is now within sight to unravel the origins and functional capabilities of lung cells in developmental stages and in disease. The Workshop's agenda was to first discuss the lung's embryologic development, including progenitor and stem cells, and then assess the functional and structural cells in three main compartments of the lung: (1) airway cells in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and bronchial glands (basal, secretory, ciliated, Clara, and neuroendocrine cells); (2) alveolar unit cells (Type 1 cells, Type 2 cells, and fibroblasts in the interstitium); and (3) pulmonary vascular cells (endothelial cells from different vascular structures, smooth muscle cells, and adventitial fibroblasts). The main recommendations were to: (1) characterize with better cell markers, both surface and nonsurface, the various cells within the lung, including progenitor cells and stem cells; (2) obtain more knowledge about gene expression in specific cell types in health and disease, which will provide insights into biological and pathologic processes; (3) develop more methodologies for cell culture, isolation, sorting, co-culture, and immortalization; and (4) promote tissue banks to facilitate the procurement of tissue from normal and from diseased lung for analysis at all levels.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^0acee09e]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

Pneumonia models — development and selection considerations emphasize defining the specific research question, with methodological rigor and careful attention to factors so models provide relevant and reliable data, including the organisms, host factors, specific methodology, and outcome measures. Choice of organism and model type, including selection of an appropriate animal species that recapitulates human lung physiology and immune response, is important, and each animal species has unique immune and respiratory features with relevance to human infection. For ethical or cost reasons, in vitro models and in silico models can be useful, and human-derived lung organoids or cell coculture systems provide insights into human-specific host–pathogen interactions without animal use. Inoculation method and technical details such as intranasal versus intratracheal inoculation can vary across laboratories, and options include simulation of natural routes such as aerosolized infections. Consistency in key factors is paramount, including bacterial preparation, mouse age and environment, acclimatization, and anesthesia type, and recent publications outline standardized methods; consistency in animal husbandry also mitigates microbiota-related variations in pulmonary response. Host factors and immune responses can be assessed using genetically modified animals or animals with induced comorbidities, and measuring immune cell recruitment, cytokine levels, and markers of lung injury provides insights.

### Respiratory tract… [^ef748d74]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory Tract The respiratory tract is divided into two main parts: the upper respiratory tract, consisting of the nose, nasal cavity and the pharynx; and the lower respiratory tract, consisting of the larynx, trachea, bronchi and the lungs. The trachea, which begins at the edge of the larynx, divides into two bronchi and continues into the lungs. The trachea allows air to pass from the larynx to the bronchi and then to the lungs. The bronchi divide into smaller bronchioles which branch in the lungs forming passageways for air. The terminal parts of the bronchi are the alveoli. The alveoli are the functional units of the lungs and they form the site of gaseous exchange.

Stereological principles in quantitative image analysis — Stereology is the statistical science providing practical methods for extracting accurate and precise quantitative structural information from imaging data sets of irregular objects. Stereological methods make no assumptions regarding shape, size, orientation, or spatial distribution of objects and are unbiased by design instead of relying on geometric model assumptions that may introduce bias. Stereology is the method of choice for quantifying lung structure in microscopy with rigorously defined standards, principles, and practical applications, and the same principles apply to CT, micro-CT, PET, MRI, and other modalities ("in vivo morphometry"), with use documented in the brain, heart, and lung.

Cough versus breathing regulation and chemosensory influences — cough and breathing can be differentially regulated by primary afferent inputs to the brainstem, indicating regulation of cough is customized to the function of the behavior. During cough, ventilation increases significantly and this alteration is necessary to prevent a loss of respiratory muscle excitability as CO2 falls; the depression of cough induced by hypoxia is less well understood and may reflect a shift in priority of the respiratory muscle control system. The permissive/facilitatory effect of SARs on cough is also not well understood but may help optimize respiratory muscle performance and facilitate expulsive airflows when cough is elicited at higher lung volumes.

Quantitative imaging (QI) — challenges and sources of error emphasize that advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms and distilled into selected "biomarkers" to evaluate their ability to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, and emergent QI metrics vary among centers in the methods of acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation; technological advances contribute to difficulty in standardization. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including 1) technical issues (e.g., depth of inspiration, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution), 2) nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest (e.g., comparing regions, lobes, or airways), and 3) lack of a well-defined reference space, as well as 4) inaccurate landmark coregistration for evaluating paired images obtained at different lung volumes and 5) failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Suggestions for health information technology trials for respiratory disorders in low-and middle-income country settings: what can we learn from trials in high-income country settings? [^fc62f8bc]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Health Information Technology (HIT) is sometimes seen as a silver bullet for human resource, medical and economic challenges facing health systems. The evidence supporting widespread use of HIT is, however, still patchy and inconsistent. In this Perspective piece, we seek to interpret and draw key lessons from a selection of illustrative trials in developed countries with robust health-care settings in respiratory medicine that failed to demonstrate effectiveness, and offer suggestions to maximise the chances of success in subsequent HIT deployments. Particularly low- and middle-income countries, with relatively weak health infrastructures and limited health care, propose considerable room for improvement. Early experiences of studying HIT thus far in high-income country settings suggest that this process should preferably begin with trials of low-cost, well-established technologies in patient groups with a moderate burden of disease while carefully evaluating patient safety.

### DeepBreath-automated detection of respiratory pathology from lung auscultation in 572 pediatric outpatients across 5 countries [^52791fd8]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep learning to detect the diagnostic signatures of several pediatric respiratory conditions from lung auscultation audio. Particular attention was dedicated to the identification and correction of hidden biases in the data. We standardise acquisition practices and perform robust model evaluation as well as explicitly report external validation on independently collected cohorts with a broad geographic representation.

Despite these strict constraints, DeepBreath returned promising results, discriminating several disease classes with over 90% area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, and often significantly outperforming a corresponding Baseline model based on age and respiratory rate (RR). The results on the external validation were, on average, less than 8% lower, compared to 21% lower for the Baseline models. Even the binary classifier for pneumonia achieved 75 and 74% AUROC in internal and external validation respectively. This value is considered surprisingly good in light of the notorious lack of international gold standard for the diagnosis of the disease and the international context of our cohort. DeepBreath also showed potential to maintain stable performance under sparse data conditions. Indeed, using just 5-10-second recordings from 4 anatomic positions on the thorax was equivalent to using 30 second clips from all 8 positions.

The interpretable-by-design approach of attention-spectogram mapping further validates the clinical relevance of our results, offering unique insights into the model's decision-making process. These tangible visualizations map the predictive attention on the audio spectrogram allowing it to be aligned with human annotations of the respiration cycle. We found intuitive concordance with inspirations and expirations, which better ensures that discrimination is based on respiratory signals rather than spurious noise. Thus, DeepBreath can be interrogated by medical experts, allowing them to make an informed assessment of the plausibility of the model's output. This interpretation technique could possibly be used as a more objective way to identify adventitious sounds, requiring no (laborious) time-stamped labeling of audio segments, but using only clip-level annotations. Extrapolating the possible applications of this approach, it could even provide a method for standardising the unique acoustic characteristics of respiratory disease into a visually interpretable set of patterns that could find a use in medical training.

### Respiratory microbiota: addressing clinical questions, informing clinical practice [^b62ec3f4]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

While efforts to identify microbes associated with airways disease are not new, the sophistication of both our conceptual understanding of these systems and the approaches used to characterise them have increased dramatically over the last decade. A point has now been reached where complex microbial systems in the airways and the manner in which they can influence clinical course increasingly represent a central consideration when trying to understand and treat respiratory disease. However, with the application of ever more sophisticated ecological tools, recent additions to the literature have become less accessible to the non-specialist reader. Furthermore, in order to have the greatest beneficial impact, respiratory microbiota studies must be driven by clinical questions, and the insight gained linked directly with improvements in clinical practice. In this article, we set out the key principles underpinning microbiota research in clinical contexts, as well as providing practical guidance on how best such studies can be designed, executed and interpreted. We examine how an understanding of the respiratory microbiota both challenges fundamental assumptions and provides novel clinical insights into lung disease.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Anatomy of the lung-SEER training modules… [^5060cc42]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Anatomy of the Lung The lungs are the major organs of the respiratory system, and are divided into sections, or lobes. The right lung has three lobes and is slightly larger than the left lung, which has two lobes. The lungs are separated by the mediastinum. This area contains the heart, trachea, esophagus, and many lymph nodes. The lungs are covered by a protective membrane known as the pleura and are separated from the abdominal cavity by the muscular diaphragm. With each inhalation, air is pulled through the windpipe and the branching passageways of the lungs, filling thousands of tiny air sacs at the ends of the bronchi. These sacs, which resemble bunches of grapes, are surrounded by small blood vessels. Oxygen passes through the thin membranes of the alveoli and into the bloodstream. The red blood cells pick up the oxygen and carry it to the body's organs and tissues.

As the blood cells release the oxygen they pick up carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism. The carbon dioxide is then carried back to the lungs and released into the alveoli. With each exhalation, carbon dioxide is expelled from the bronchi out through the trachea.

### Validation of imaging measures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^6165ae6e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The imaging community has greatly benefitted from the deployment of software libraries that enable deep learning approaches to image postprocessing. These tools have led to a divergence of efforts surrounding image analytics. Unlike those focused on hypothesis-driven approaches that involve segmentation and quantification of anatomic features believed to be related to the condition of interest, deep learning–based efforts may converge on a clinical signal without human input. One thing that is generally common to both is the belief that the validation of these techniques requires a demonstration of clinical association. Although such findings may substantiate the methods being presented, we cannot conflate substantiation with true validation. With imaging, the latter can really only be done with tissue. Vasilescu and colleagues should be congratulated for taking on such a challenging study long after the medical community had accepted PRM, and establishing this link between noninvasive imaging features and pathologic findings in severe COPD. Future work may help establish these measures in early or mild COPD, from which conclusions about pathologic contributions to disease progression in COPD may be better inferred. For now, at the very least, we can drop the word "functional" and embrace this as a metric for small airway disease in smokers.

### Advancing sleep health equity through deep learning on large-scale nocturnal respiratory signals [^0d48b27e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Sleep disorders affect billions globally, yet diagnostic access remains limited by healthcare resource constraints. Here, we develop a deep learning framework that analyzes respiratory signals for remote sleep health monitoring, trained on 15,785 nights of data across diverse populations. Our approach achieves robust performance in four-stage sleep classification (82.13% accuracy on internal validation; 79.62% on external validation) and apnea-hypopnea index estimation (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.90 and 0.94, respectively). Through transfer learning, we adapt the model to radar-derived respiratory signals, enabling contactless monitoring in home environments. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across demographic subgroups, supports real-time processing through self-supervised learning techniques, and integrates with a remote sleep health management platform for clinical deployment. This approach bridges critical gaps in sleep healthcare accessibility, supporting population-level screening and monitoring, paving the way for scalable sleep healthcare, and advancing sleep health equity.

### Establishing a normative atlas of the human lung: computing the average transformation and atlas construction [^af220ac1]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To establish the range of normal for quantitative computed tomography (CT)-based measures of lung structure and function, we seek to develop methods for matching pulmonary structures across individuals and establishing a normative human lung atlas.

Materials and Methods

In our previous work, we have presented a three-dimensional (3D) image registration method suitable for pulmonary atlas construction based on CT datasets. The method has been applied to a population of normative lungs in multiple experiments and, in each instance, has resulted in significant reductions in registration errors. This study is a continuation to our previous work by presenting a method for synthesizing a computerized human lung atlas from previously registered and matched 3D pulmonary CT datasets from a population of normative subjects. Our method consists of defining the origin of the atlas coordinate system; defining the nomenclature and labels for anatomical structures within the atlas system; computing the average transformation based on the displacement fields to register individual subject to the common template subject; constructing the atlas by deforming the template with the average transformation; and calculating shape variations within the population.

Results

The feasibility of pulmonary atlas construction was evaluated using CT datasets from 20 normal volunteers. Substantial reductions in shape variability were demonstrated. In addition, the constructed atlas depends only slightly on a specific subject being selected as the template. These results indicate the framework is a robust and valid method for pulmonary atlas construction based on CT scans. The atlas consists of a grayscale CT dataset of the template, a labeled mask dataset of the template (ie, lungs, lobes, and lobar fissures are labeled with different gray levels), a data set representing the population's average shape, datasets representing the population's shape variations (ie, the magnitude of standard deviation), a data structure to contain the labels and coordinates of major airway branchpoints, and the labels of the mask dataset, and a reference coordinate system for each lung.

Conclusion

A computerized human lung atlas representing by the average shape of a population of twenty normal subjects was constructed and visualized. The atlas provides a basis for establishing regional ranges of normative values for structural and functional measures of the human lung. In the future, we plan to use the computerized human lung atlas to help detect and quantify early signs of lung pathology.

Recommendations for design and analysis of next-generation sequencing studies — documentation, teams, quality control, data sharing, and cellular heterogeneity — state that methods for design and analysis in RNA sequencing studies are more variable, so researchers should clearly document their methods, including software versions and input parameters, and consider validating key results with a different analysis method; multidisciplinary teams should include bioinformaticians, statisticians, and computational biologists to assist with large datasets; quality control is the responsibility of the investigators and it should not be assumed that the core sequencing facility has performed all necessary quality control steps; data sharing is required by many funders and should be the default; and because of the extreme cellular heterogeneity of the lung, future studies should address cellular heterogeneity in design and analysis by any of the proposed methods.

The intention of this short primer is to raise your appetite for proper quantitative assessment of lung micro-structure. The method of choice for obtaining such data is stereology. Rooted in stochastic geometry, stereology provides simple and efficient tools to obtain quantitative three-dimensional information based on measurements on nearly two-dimensional microscopic sections. In this primer, the basic concepts of stereology and its application to the lung are introduced step by step along the workflow of a stereological study. The integration of stereology in your laboratory work will help to improve its quality. In a broader context, stereology may also be seen as a contribution to good scientific practice.

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^1a16efc1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Combining diagnoses from the DeepMRD TR system and experts

To verify the feasibility of incorporating our AI system into real-life clinical workflows in a human + AI fashion, we evaluated whether the system could assist respiratory clinicians and radiologists with their diagnoses while attempting to quantify the improvement. First, we employed an assessment approach to investigate the performance beyond AUC to establish the threshold selection by considering the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity to match different expert groups. Second, to assess the deep learning system for clinical implementation, we compared the time required to generate a clinically acceptable diagnosis, with and without the assistance of the DeepMRD TR system.

We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of readers' eight different binary classifications, as well as the AI system's threshold score, to match readers' sensitivity and specificity in Table 2. For example, at the same sensitivity, the DeepMRD TR system performed better in terms of specificity than the junior radiologists (0.929 vs. 0.880). We also explored the potential involvement of the system in increasing the diagnostic performance of senior/junior clinicians and senior/junior radiologists in the workflow. When using the majority vote and weighted error over the predicted classes of multiple images for each patient, the combined result achieved a sensitivity of 0.673 (95%CI:0.652–0.694) and specificity of 0.912 (95%CI:0.890–0.918) for junior radiologists, achieving a significant improvement compared to that with the sensitivity of 0.569 (95%CI:0.546–0.579) and specificity of 0.880 (95%CI:0.870–0.894) without the assistance of the AI system (Table 2).

### AI co-pilot bronchoscope robot [^a051119c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

At present the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into bronchoscopy is further expanding the horizons of this burgeoning field. By leveraging advanced algorithms, such as machine learning and computer vision technologies, researchers are developing image-guided navigation systems that process and interpret bronchoscopic imagery, facilitating real-time localisation, trackingand interventional path planningfor endoscopy and enabling precise navigation within the bronchial tree. These software systems enhance the accuracy and efficiency of bronchoscopic procedures. Furthermore, by providing automated, continuous guidance throughout such a procedure, an image-guided system can help reduce the cognitive load on the operating doctor, allowing the doctor to focus on other critical aspects of the procedure. However, these systems present safety concerns during bronchoscopic procedures because they rely on bronchoscope localisation in preoperative CT –, which may result in misregistration and unsafe steering of the robot due to the limited field of view and body–CT visual discrepancies. Concerns have been raised about the risk of complications, such as pneumothorax and bleeding, underlining the need for ongoing research on and optimisation of these platforms.

We report an AI co-pilot bronchoscope robot for safe pulmonary steering. At the hardware level, we have designed a bronchoscope robot with a quick catheter replacement feature (utilising thin catheters for deep lung examination and thick catheters for examination and biopsy) based on magnetic adsorption, offering advanced performance that meets clinical requirements. At the software level, we have developed an AI–human shared control algorithm based on learning from experts, which can accommodate discrete human interventions while reducing the reliance on doctor expertise. Overall, the presented robotic system enhances safety while maintaining efficiency in bronchoscopy by providing novice doctors with increased autonomy. Through tests of this bronchoscope system on realistic human bronchial phantoms with simulated respiratory behaviour performed by a novice doctor with the AI co-pilot and by an expert, we demonstrate that our system enables novice doctors to access different bronchi proficiently. Subsequently, to validate the safety and effectiveness of our system under physiologically relevant conditions, we assess the system's steering capability in vivo using a live porcine lung to mimic the human bronchus. Our system carries the potential to improve the diagnosis and management of pulmonary disorders. It is anticipated that the cost and logistical barriers associated with the adoption of such platforms will decrease in the future, helping to overcome the challenge of medical resource disparities and contributing to the improvement of global health outcomes.

### Is the content of textbooks on the evaluation of a patient in respiratory distress adequate? [^7af2e3e3]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to rapidly and precisely evaluate patients in respiratory distress is essential. Due to limited opportunities for formal instruction during training, textbooks are the main educational source to teach junior physicians how to interpret the signs of respiratory distress. The quality of the textbook content relevant to respiratory distress is unknown.

Objective

To examine the content on the evaluation of a patient in respiratory distress in a representative sample of textbooks and Internet resources.

Methods

Two physicians individually reviewed the most recent edition of 21 standard textbooks from a variety of specialties. Smartphone applications, UptoDate, and MD Consult were examined. Each physician reviewed the source for 14 different signs. For each sign, the reviewers determined 3 parameters: a mention of the sign, its pathophysiology, and its detection. The reviews were compared for discrepancies, and a third reviewer resolved them.

Results

The normal respiratory rate was mentioned in 10 (48%) of textbooks, and ranged between 10 and 22 breaths/min. Each sign was mentioned by a mean of 45 ± 26% of the textbooks. The pathophysiology of the signs was described by a mean of 33 ± 30% of the textbooks. The most and least commonly mentioned inspection signs were cyanosis and retraction of suprasternal notch, respectively. They were mentioned in 20 (95%) and 4 (19%) textbooks, respectively. The most and least commonly mentioned palpation signs were thoracoabdominal asynchrony or paradox and tracheal tug, respectively. They were mentioned in 17 (81%) and 4 (19%) textbooks, and their pathophysiology was described in 15 (71%) and 4 (19%) textbooks, respectively. The reviewers also found inconsistency in the descriptions of the meaning of scalene muscle contraction and thoracoabdominal asynchrony and paradox.

Conclusions

The content of the reviewed textbooks on the evaluation of respiratory distress is inconsistent and deficient.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^4b57380b]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Your small pilot study serves another purpose: It can be used to determine your sampling and analysis design for your definite study. This includes e.g. the number of individuals per group, the number of tissue blocks per lung, the number of sections per tissue block, the number of fields of view per section at a given magnification, and the stereological test system (see Step 6 below).

In case the total alveolar surface area of the lung is of interest in your study, how can you measure this? Obviously not directly. Neither can you roll out the inner surface of a lung on a lab bench and use a ruler nor can you trace the alveolar surface in microscopic sections for that purpose. Structural measurements in microscopy are a challenge for two reasons (and forgetting about these challenges leads to common mistakes, see Table 1):
There is a reduction in size. The thin microscopic sections you investigate constitute only a fraction, actually an infinitesimal sample, of the whole lung. However, you want to know the total alveolar surface area of that lung. So you have to measure surface density (the ratio of surface per unit volume) in these sampled sections first and then multiply this surface density by the reference space (total volume of lung parenchyma) to calculate total alveolar surface area in the lung (only then the units make sense — check yourself). Therefore, think of the total volume of the (fixed) lung (see Step 3 below) as the starting point for taking your samples (see Step 4 below) as well as the end point for reporting your data (see Step 6 below). So, measurements on microscopic sections are not the end point, because they are ratios, not totals. These ratios are subject to the " reference trap " where a change in the ratio can be due to a change in the numerator (alveolar surface area) or the denominator (parenchymal volume) or both, thus leading to ambiguity in interpretation. Don't fall into this "reference trap" by reporting ratios. Instead, measure the reference space and compute total values (see Steps 3 and 6 below).
There is a reduction in dimension. The microscopic sections you investigate are thin slices. Although the structures you are interested in are three-dimensional (3D) entities, their representation in sections is two-dimensional (2D). Something that looks small in your section, e.g. an alveolar profile, might be much bigger but is cut at the periphery. A line in your section could represent a tubular as well as a plate-like structure. Depending on the section plane, a tubular structure could also appear as a point in your section created by a transect. The alveolar surface you are interested in (2D) will appear as a thin boundary line (1D) towards the alveolar lumen. In short, we lose one dimension due to the sectioning process, and therefore we lose important qualitative and quantitative information. In analogy to the "reference trap", this has been termed the "dimension trap". The appearance of 3D structures in nearly 2D microscopic sections does not represent the full reality. Don't fall into this "dimension trap" by using particle profile counts in sections to obtain particle number in 3D space. Instead, use the disector (see Step 5 below).

Assessing heterogeneity with stereology — object size may be expressed as a number- or volume-weighted mean volume, and when both are known an object's size distribution can be estimated; spatial distribution of objects in subcompartments within a reference space may be expressed by a "relative labelling index". Stereology has been applied to quantify acinar structures by HP gas MRI combined with modeling of alveolar gas diffusion to infer regional gas exchange and its heterogeneity in normal and pathological states.

### Application of continuous positive airway pressure for thoracic respiratory motion management: an assessment in a magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy environment [^fb5aaf40]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Deep inspiratory breath hold (DIBH) has been a clinically validated approach for the management of respiratory motion during the delivery of radiation therapy. During DIBH, lung volume increases, resulting in 2 major benefits: (1) targets typically affected by respiration (ie, lung, breast, liver, or abdominal lesions) have reduced excursion, thereby reducing the overall target volume requiring radiation; and (2) sensitive organs at risk such as the heart move away from the radiation treatment fields, thus reducing the dose. Although dosimetrically favorable, DIBH requires a high degree of patient cooperation to successfully deliver. Furthermore, it is time consuming and its use increases treatment delivery times.

Many clinics use additional techniques such as active breathing control or spirometers to improve repeatability of breath holds. However, this strategy depends on patient compliance, involves longer treatment times, and uses more clinical resources. Although motion can be limited through modulation of respiration, it can also be accounted for through use of medical imaging in the treatment room for real-time localization of the tumor. ViewRay Inc (Cleveland, OH) designed a Co-60 based integrated magnetic resonance (MR) 0.35 T–guided radiation delivery system in 2012 and subsequently was able to substitute the radioactive cobalt-based system with a 6MV linear accelerator (linac)–based integrated MR-guided system in 2017. The Unity system (Elekta A.B. Stockholm, Sweden; Philips N.V. Amsterdam, Netherlands) is another linac in clinical use with on-board 1.5 T imaging capability. The ability to obtain MR images during radiation treatments with these integrated systems allows better soft-tissue visualization and online adaptive treatment planning, and some systems allow real-time imaging-based treatment gating. Lesions can be tracked in real time (currently up to 8 frames/s) and respiratory gating can be performed based on internal anatomy. This technology has shown promise in facilitating delivery of dose-escalated stereotactic radiation treatments, where enhanced visualization of tumors and surrounding organs at risk allows for greater certainty of structure boundaries. Onboard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also provides near real-time verification of breath hold reliability, which has been used clinically in treatments of tumors of the abdomen and thorax. Nevertheless, challenges that remain include the need for repeated breath holds during the course of these treatment sessions to deliver the daily dose and improving overall patient compliance. One intervention shown to improve reproducibility is incorporating audio-visual biofeedbackor real-time coaching.

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^01eb8998]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

However, some limitations merit consideration in our study, hopefully, which we can resolve in the future. Given that the AUC has been considered as a relatively effective performance metric for disease prediction in academic research, the AUC was utilized to evaluate our deep-learning model and to compare human/DeepMRD TR performances. While the AUC alone has limited practical utility, notably, it is still ongoing to select the proper operating points adopted in clinical workflow, taking account of outcomes and cost. Second, the annotation biases introduced by the large-scale image dataset could affect the performance of abnormality detection and disease diagnosis and should be taken with caution. The labels of the training images were text mined from EHRs utilizing NLP, and a comparison of NLP labels vs. manual ground-truth annotations would be intriguing but unrealistic, owing to the inaccessibility of annotations from clinical experts for such a large training set. Third, our patients were all Asians, which could potentially limit the generalizability of our AI system to other international regions. Additional validation across populations from American and European hospitals is warranted to further validate the reported performance. Fourth, selection biases were resulted from choosing a subset of radiological abnormalities for prediction would lead to selection bias. Finally, the number of participating clinicians, coupled with retrospective data vs. prospective validation, limited the actionability of the report. In the foreseeable future, the increased use of DeepMRD TR will empower clinicians in routine clinical workflows.

Finally, this study demonstrated the value of an AI system in distinguishing between a wide range of chest abnormalities and various thoracic diseases using a deep learning platform with a comparison against senior/junior doctors' performance on a large-scale dataset, offering clinical experts the potential of a fast versatile triage tool that leverages deep learning to improve operational efficiency and ultimately enhance clinical decision-making. Future well-designed prospective studies and algorithm performance improvements will expand its application and feasibility for the diagnostic assessment of all lung disorders.

### An introduction to systematic reviews in respiratory medicine [^65dcf71e]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Reviews are an essential component of modern medicine. The volume of literature is large, even about a single treatment for pulmonary disease. The task of retrieving all the relevant papers, then assessing the evidence to reach a valid conclusion is very time consuming. At every stage there is the risk of sampling error (failure to get all the evidence) and bias (a systematic distortion of the results due to a weakness in the methodology). There are essentially two types of review: narrative reviews that follow no rules, exposing them to sampling error and bias; and systematic reviews that attempt to minimise these effects by following an explicit structure for retrieving all of the evidence and attempting an objective synthesis of the results from the different trials. A good review can serve a number of purposes including: assembling all the relevant evidence in one place, providing a valid estimate of the overall effect of treatment, producing guidance for clinical practice and generating hypotheses for further trials about patients or settings in which the treatment effect may be less or more effective.

Airway comparative analysis — matching approaches and caveats: Table 5 outlines selection criteria with example metrics and considerations, including designation of "Terminal bronchiole", designating a generation number for each airway, path distance (e.g., 5 cm from carina or pleura), lumen size (e.g., 2-mm-diameter airways), and airways at a stipulated inner perimeter with wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10); considerations note pathology may alter airway status, anatomical variations in branching pattern, body and lung size variations, risk of bias when pathology alters airway dimension (e.g. COPD may narrow airway lumens; therefore, 2-mm airways may occur at a different generation compared with subjects without COPD), and that regression assumptions should be confirmed with potential effects of outliers assessed.

Doing lung stereology step by step

Let's go through the workflow of a typical stereological study, from its planning stage to the final publication. It consists of 7 crucial steps. Along the way we will familiarize you with the basic concepts of lung stereology and the important points to consider (Table 3). Cross references between these steps are given to show how they are interrelated. We will also provide references for further reading.

Table 3
The 7 crucial steps of a stereological study of the lung

This table summarizes the crucial steps involved in a typical stereological study of the lung and the way this primer is organized. Points to consider at each of these 7 steps are covered in the text. Stereological terms are explained in Table 2

Step 1: Planning your stereological study

You should have the concept of your stereological design ready before the practical part of your study starts. Most likely you will have to do a little pilot study in advance. This will give you an impression of the changes in lung structure in your model. Do a thorough qualitative microscopic analysis. What exactly are the alterations in lung structure between your experimental groups that you want to quantitate? Think of the lung as being composed of different compartments which can be subdivided further (which may require a cascade of increasing magnification levels, see Step 4 below and Fig. 1). What is your target compartment? Whatever it is, always derive it from the whole lung, and also relate your measurements in that target compartment back to the whole lung when reporting your final data (see Steps 3 and 6 below).

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^1a480bfa]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We developed and validated the DeepMRD TR system with the aim to streamline the CT/CXR scan interpretation workflow. Our model makes a diagnosis by simulating the reasoning process of an expert clinical worker. The AI-assisted workflow in real-world practice starts with installing "DeepMRD TR " offline in the hospitals. When a patient undergoes a radiological examination, our AI system will automatically take CT volumes or CXR images as input, subsequently, process the data, then analyze the suspicious regions of interest, generate the CAMs, and output final abnormality predictions and disease diagnosis nearly instantaneously. There might be several challenges including incompatibility of such systems with local medical equipment, and additional patient waiting time due to model inference to achieve an "actionable" diagnosis, thus limiting the actual clinical deployment. With regard to these issues, we have developed easy-to-obtain docking between the DeepMRD TR system and radiology picture archiving and communication system (PACS) or image scanners to make the software available. Thus, the time to achieve an "actionable" diagnosis by our system is negligible and the overall diagnosis time could even be shortened, leading to optimization of the established clinical workflow through the integration of DeepMRD TR (Fig. 5).

Table 4 — computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diffuse lung disease summarizes that CT provides "Rapid (< 10 s) acquisition" and can "quantify regional structural features down to 1–2 mm" but entails "Exposure to ionizing radiation" and that "Most acquisitions provide structural rather than functional information". MRI is "Sensitive to many aspects of function", including sensitivity "to alveolar geometry (in vivo morphometry)" and the ability to "evaluate perfusion and gas diffusion", but it "may require specialized hardware", has "Structural imaging generally lower resolution than CT", and "Long acquisition time increases cardiorespiratory motion artifacts".

Challenges in quantitative imaging (QI) — advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms distilled into selected "biomarkers" correlated with global function to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, emergent QI metrics vary among centers in acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation, technological advances contribute to the difficulty in standardization, and the use of medical jargon makes it difficult for the less initiated to evaluate the potential and limitations of QI-derived metrics. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including technical issues, nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest, lack of a well-defined reference space, inaccurate landmark coregistration for paired images obtained at different lung volumes, and failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Artificial intelligence / machine learning in respiratory medicine and potential role in asthma and COPD diagnosis [^3d4526bc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a subset of AI, are increasingly used in medicine. AI excels at performing well-defined tasks, such as image recognition; for example, classifying skin biopsy lesions, determining diabetic retinopathy severity, and detecting brain tumors. This article provides an overview of the use of AI in medicine and particularly in respiratory medicine, where it is used to evaluate lung cancer images, diagnose fibrotic lung disease, and more recently is being developed to aid the interpretation of pulmonary function tests and the diagnosis of a range of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The development and validation of AI algorithms requires large volumes of well-structured data, and the algorithms must work with variable levels of data quality. It is important that clinicians understand how AI can function in the context of heterogeneous conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where diagnostic criteria overlap, how AI use fits into everyday clinical practice, and how issues of patient safety should be addressed. AI has a clear role in providing support for doctors in the clinical workplace, but its relatively recent introduction means that confidence in its use still has to be fully established. Overall, AI is expected to play a key role in aiding clinicians in the diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases in the future, and it will be exciting to see the benefits that arise for patients and doctors from its use in everyday clinical practice.

### Development and validation of an abnormality-derived deep-learning diagnostic system for major respiratory diseases [^64537617]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory diseases impose a tremendous global health burden on large patient populations. In this study, we aimed to develop DeepMRD TR, a deep learning-based medical image interpretation system for the diagnosis of major respiratory diseases based on the automated identification of a wide range of radiological abnormalities through computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) from real-world, large-scale datasets. DeepMRD TR comprises four networks (two CT-Nets and two CXR-Nets) that exploit contrastive learning to generate pre-training parameters that are fine-tuned on the retrospective dataset collected from a single institution. The performance of DeepMRD TR was evaluated for abnormality identification and disease diagnosis on data from two different institutions: one was an internal testing dataset from the same institution as the training data and the second was collected from an external institution to evaluate the model generalizability and robustness to an unrelated population dataset. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our system achieved the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.856 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.843–0.868) and 0.841 (95%CI:0.832–0.887) for abnormality identification, and 0.900 (95%CI:0.872–0.958) and 0.866 (95%CI:0.832–0.887) for major respiratory diseases' diagnosis on CT and CXR datasets, respectively. Furthermore, to achieve a clinically actionable diagnosis, we deployed a preliminary version of DeepMRD TR into the clinical workflow, which was performed on par with senior experts in disease diagnosis, with an AUC of 0.890 and a Cohen's k of 0.746–0.877 at a reasonable timescale; these findings demonstrate the potential to accelerate the medical workflow to facilitate early diagnosis as a triage tool for respiratory diseases which supports improved clinical diagnoses and decision-making.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

Quantitative imaging study design — precision versus bias and measurement efficiency emphasize that "Bias" refers to systematic errors leading to inaccuracy and "Precision" refers to measurement reproducibility; bias "can be neither detected in the data nor decreased by making more measurements" and is avoided a priori by rigorous design, whereas precision can be checked and adjusted by increasing sample size or number of measurements. Because "more measurements do not increase accuracy if bias exists at higher levels of study design", automated exhaustive measurements "could aggravate inaccuracy and reduce efficiency", and it is "more efficient to invest extra effort into the higher levels of study design"; with unbiased sampling "it is not always necessary to exhaustively analyze each voxel". In a well-designed study, precision is tuned so the within-subject coefficient of error is "significantly smaller than" between-subject variation; "repetitive imaging can often be made to assess response to intervention", and baseline between-subject variability is less important in longitudinal designs in which subjects act as their own controls.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society joint workshop — methods and scope involved a multidisciplinary panel convened to examine the accuracy of major current quantitative imaging (QI) biomarkers from CT, PET, and MRI, caveats in methodology and interpretation, and key knowledge gaps for validation and exploration. Participants reviewed literature on QI metrics used to infer structural and physiological processes including volume partition, attenuation-based parenchymal and bronchovascular analysis, mechanics ventilation, perfusion, ventilation–perfusion matching, and diffusion, and emphasized general principles for accurate quantification across modalities and diffuse lung diseases. For each modality, the committee reviewed QI metrics in terms of accuracy, precision and reproducibility, assumptions, limitations, validation against independent measures, and incorporation into biophysical models to predict lung function, and although specific guidelines are not part of this report, general "good practice" approaches are outlined. Lung nodule analysis is not included, the nascent field of artificial intelligence or machine learning is beyond the scope, potential conflicts of interest were disclosed and managed, and participants with relevant industry-funded research were recused from comparing the imaging or analysis methods with others in the relevant sections of the report.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^07fa6729]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Sampling

Tightly interrelated with the measurement of the reference space and processing of lung tissue is the sampling of tissue blocks for microscopy. Actually, stereology is all about rigorous unbiased (and thus, truely representative equal opportunity) sampling. A bad sample will inevitably result in bad data and thus bad science. In general, sampling must be randomized for location, i.e. each part of the lung has the same chance for being selected for analysis. For anisotropic structures with a preferential orientation in space (e.g. major conducting airways), some parameters (e.g. surface area and length) also require randomization for spatial orientation.

Various stereological sampling designs have been developed. The basic principle for randomization of location is systematic uniform random sampling (SURS). The first sample is chosen randomly but determines the position of all other samples which are selected by a predefined constant sampling interval (Fig. 3). Depending on the target compartment you are interested in, you may have to follow this SURS principle along a cascade of microscopic magnifications (e.g. distinguishing parenchyma vs. non-parenchyma at a low light microscopic magnification, but distinguishing alveolar septum, alveolar airspace and alveolar duct airspace within parenchyma at a higher light microscopic magnification). This principle, where the phase of interest at a lower magnification becomes the reference phase at a higher magnification, has been termed cascade sampling (Fig. 1). Along this cascade, you must not break the SURS chain at any point. Also keep in mind that the microscopic resolution influences the data. This is of particular relevance for alveolar surface area estimation where the well-known "coast of Britain effect" leads to higher values with higher resolution because finer irregularities become visible. Selective targeting of subcompartments within the lung, which can either be defined by anatomy (e.g. individual lung lobes) or by pathology (e.g. lesioned regions), is addressed by stratified sampling where those subcompartments are sampled seperately. The basic concept of fractionator sampling is to keep track of the sampling fraction throughout the cascade of sampling stages (e.g. slices, slabs, blocks, sections, fields of view). Fractionator sampling can easily be combined with SURS (Fig. 3). Its great advantage is that particle number can be estimated without bias independent of tissue deformation by multiplying the total counts at the final sampling step by the inverse of the sampling fraction along all sampling stages.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^cc2bc3ac]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, causing a pandemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 appears to cause predominantly respiratory disease in the form of viral pneumonia.
Severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection can lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure with features of the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection also may increase the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, by mechanisms that are not fully understood.

Coronaviruses are important human pathogens, and research into their behavior is nearly a century old. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, and then spread worldwide. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the name of the human disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was previously known as 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus). Viral pneumonia is the most frequent serious clinical manifestation of COVID-19, prominently featuring fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography. – Dry cough is more common than a productive cough. Dyspnea appears after a median time of 5 to 8 days. Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with the Berlin definition of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who require mechanical ventilation have a high risk of death.

A detailed understanding of the respiratory pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains elusive, however, because comprehensive data from clinical and research tools such as pulmonary artery catheterization or transpulmonary thermodilution, respiratory mechanics, mixed inert gas elimination technique, or electrical impedance tomography remain lacking or under development. – The clinical observations, radiology, and pathology offer clues about the respiratory pathogenesis of COVID-19 and raise interesting research questions. This review will highlight the current knowledge on COVID-19 pathophysiology, with a focus on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on airway and alveolar epithelium, vascular endothelium, and the control of breathing. We present questions that arise from these observations and indicate possible future research directions that will enhance our understanding of COVID-19 clinical pathophysiology and guide the development of future treatments.

This article describes the impact of various toxic substances on the airway and pulmonary system. Pulmonary anatomy and physiology provide the basis for understanding the response to toxin-induced injury. Simple asphyxiants displace oxygen from the inspired air. Respiratory irritants include water-soluble and water-insoluble compounds. Several inhaled agents produce direct airway injury, which may be mediated by caustic, thermal, and hydrocarbon exposures. Unique pulmonary toxins and toxicants are discussed, as well as inhaled toxin mixtures. Several inhaled toxins may also impair oxygen transport. The pulmonary system may also provide a mechanism for systemic toxin delivery on respiratory exposure.

### Deep-learning-based whole-lung and lung-lesion quantification despite inconsistent ground truth: application to computerized tomography in SARS-CoV-2 nonhuman primate models [^36ec1649]. Academic Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Animal modeling of infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is important for exploration of natural history, understanding of pathogenesis, and evaluation of countermeasures. Preclinical studies enable rigorous control of experimental conditions as well as pre-exposure baseline and longitudinal measurements, including medical imaging, that are often unavailable in the clinical research setting. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging provides important diagnostic, prognostic, and disease characterization to clinicians and clinical researchers. In that context, automated deep-learning systems for the analysis of CT imaging have been broadly proposed, but their practical utility has been limited. Manual outlining of the ground truth (i.e., lung-lesions) requires accurate distinctions between abnormal and normal tissues that often have vague boundaries and is subject to reader heterogeneity in interpretation. Indeed, this subjectivity is demonstrated as wide inconsistency in manual outlines among experts and from the same expert. The application of deep-learning data-science tools has been less well-evaluated in the preclinical setting, including in nonhuman primate (NHP) models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection/COVID-19, in which the translation of human-derived deep-learning tools is challenging. The automated segmentation of the whole lung and lung lesions provides a potentially standardized and automated method to detect and quantify disease.

Materials and Methods

We used deep-learning-based quantification of the whole lung and lung lesions on CT scans of NHPs exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We proposed a novel multi-model ensemble technique to address the inconsistency in the ground truths for deep-learning-based automated segmentation of the whole lung and lung lesions. Multiple models were obtained by training the convolutional neural network (CNN) on different subsets of the training data instead of having a single model using the entire training dataset. Moreover, we employed a feature pyramid network (FPN), a CNN that provides predictions at different resolution levels, enabling the network to predict objects with wide size variations.

Results

We achieved an average of 99.4 and 60.2% Dice coefficients for whole-lung and lung-lesion segmentation, respectively. The proposed multi-model FPN outperformed well-accepted methods U-Net (50.5%), V-Net (54.5%), and Inception (53.4%) for the challenging lesion-segmentation task. We show the application of segmentation outputs for longitudinal quantification of lung disease in SARS-CoV-2-exposed and mock-exposed NHPs.

Conclusion

Deep-learning methods should be optimally characterized for and targeted specifically to preclinical research needs in terms of impact, automation, and dynamic quantification independently from purely clinical applications.

### Middle airway obstruction – it may be happening under our noses [^2c438d77]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lower airway obstruction has evolved to denote pathologies associated with diseases of the lung, whereas, conditions proximal to the lung embody upper airway obstruction. This approach has disconnected diseases of the larynx and trachea from the lung, and removed the 'middle airway' from the interest and involvement of respiratory physicians and scientists. However, recent studies have indicated that dysfunction of this anatomical region may be a key component of overall airway obstruction, either independently or in combination with lung disease. New diagnostic modalities to effectively diagnose middle airway obstruction are being developed, and it has become feasible to identify and quantify middle airway obstruction.

Conclusion

We, therefore, propose adding 'middle airway obstruction' to our nomenclature to embed it in diagnostic approaches, and to allow due emphasis on this neglected anatomical region.

### Pictorial review of the pulmonary vasculature: from arteries to veins [^70e69e22]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Pathology of the pulmonary vasculature involves an impressive array of both congenital and acquired conditions. While some of these disorders are benign, disruption of the pulmonary vasculature is often incompatible with life, making these conditions critical to identify on imaging. Many reviews of pulmonary vascular pathology approach the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins and bronchial arteries as individual topics. The goal of this review is to provide an integrated overview of the high-yield features of all major disorders of the pulmonary vasculature. This approach provides a more cohesive and comprehensive conceptualisation of respiratory pathology. In this review, we present both the salient clinical and imaging features of congenital and acquired disorders of the pulmonary vasculature, to assist the radiologist in identifying pathology and forming a robust differential diagnosis tailored to the presenting patient. TEACHING POINTS:
- Abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature are both congenital and acquired.
- Pathology of a single pulmonary vascular territory often affects the entire pulmonary vasculature.
- Anomalous pulmonary venous flow is named as a function of its location and severity.
- Bronchial arteries often undergo dilatation secondary to cardio-respiratory pathology.

In this multicenter diagnostic validation study among adults with shortness of breath, 98.3% of ultrasound examinations performed by trained health care professionals with AI guidance were of sufficient quality to meet diagnostic standards and were not statistically different compared with images acquired by LUS experts without AI guidance.

Meaning

With AI assistance, trained novices can produce expert-level images that can be used to assess pathology after a short training session, potentially enhancing access to LUS in resource-constrained settings.

### Zen and the art of nomenclature maintenance: a revised approach to respiratory symbols and terminology [^8f3a79cb]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

In this paper we point out that there are different entities involved in the mathematical descriptions, or models, of the respiratory system: variables and parameters. These, in turn, can be divided into different types. Variables can be primary variables, difference variables, or change variables. Difference variables express the difference between primary variables measured simultaneously at 2 locations. Change variables are primary variables measured relative to fixed reference values. Parameters that appear in input-output models that are valid over a wide range of inputs can be interpreted as properties. There are 3 levels of properties, depending on the detail included in the model. If the model specifically includes the geometry of the system and the substances of which the system is composed, then the parameters in the model are material properties. If the model includes the general structures that compose the system, the parameters are structural properties. And if the model describes the behavior of the system as a whole with no detail included pertaining to internal makeup, then the parameters can be considered system properties. Parameters that appear in mathematical descriptions of input and/or output wave shapes can be interpreted as waveform characteristics. General waveform characteristics are attributes of arbitrary inputs and/or outputs. However, in those special cases in which a system is subjected to a well-defined, specialized input and the output waveform is described mathematically (even if only at a single point), the parameter(s) in such descriptions can be considered system response characteristic(s). We suggest that the symbols and names given to these various entities should follow well-defined guidelines that distinguish among the entity types. These guidelines should include symbol and name conventions and also sign conventions and expected unit ranges on appropriate measurement scales. One such set of conventions would be as follows. Italicize all variables. Use upper-case for primary (absolute) variables. Use the delta symbol (Delta) to denote difference variables (difference between 2 locations). Use lower-case letters for change variables (change relative to a reference, or operating, point) and for abbreviations (eg, "pl" for "pleural"). Use upper-case characters to represent the initial letters of words (eg, "AO" for "airway opening"). Make bold nonitalicized groups of letters used for properties (upper-case, lower-case, multi-height). Do not bold or italicize groups of letters used for characteristics (upper-case, lower-case, multi-height). Compound symbols are those that include subscripts and/or superscripts. Subscripts following a symbol indicate location, direction, or index (time); if more than one subscript, separate them by commas. Superscripts following a symbol indicate a component, or it can indicate a power if the symbol is enclosed in parentheses. Letters on the same line as initial letter but in smaller type are part of the generic symbol. Arguments are enclosed in parentheses; parentheses are also used to isolate compound symbols from powers or additional subscripts. Adapt currently standard symbols to retain their identity but conform to the above conventions. The sign of an entity is always dictated by and its interpretation is based on the model in which the entity is used. Units used are consistent with measurement resolution and accuracy. Copious examples of the applications of this set of suggested conventions are given in the text and in 4 tables. Our hope is that the presentation of these suggestions will start a dialogue in the field and will influence journal and book publishers to adopt a consistent set of conventions for the names and symbols used for respiratory-system-related terms.

### A short primer on lung stereology [^dfdc3e19]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Most common problems in micro-structural assessment of the lung

Modified from

SURS systematic uniform random sampling, IUR isotropic uniform random

What went wrong? If you don't know, this primer is for you. It aims to help you to do better next time, in particular by planning ahead for a quantitative assessment of lung micro-structure. Don't be deterred by the mathematical theory of stereology (although we have to confess that some of the original articles we reference in this primer are a tough read). Rest assured that this is actually an advantage because it provides a solid scientific foundation (from stochastic geometry) for what you will be doing. Think of stereology as a toolbox. These tools have names that may sound unfamiliar to you. Therefore, you find a little glossary that defines common stereological terms in Table 2. The basic principles how to use stereology can be learnt in a few hours. The production of data is straightforward. For (almost) every task there is an appropriate tool. You just have to be willing to change a few lab habits regarding the processing of lung tissue for "standard histology". This is probably the biggest hurdle. Then the rest is easy.

In this primer, we focus on the application of stereology in combination with conventional microscopic techniques (e.g. basic light microscopy). In principle, stereology can be combined with any microscopy (actually any imaging) method (see). The point we want to make here is that no fancy extra equipment is needed to do proper basic lung stereology (which also means that no excuses are accepted). It is all about the design of the study and the appropriateness of the methods for your specific needs.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: climate change and human health [^090b62dd]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Priority research infrastructure needs — surveillance, monitoring, and alert systems are emphasized to address climate-related respiratory risks. Workshop participants believed that for both low- and high- resource countries to benefit from climate change and respiratory health research, improved research infrastructure and concerted international cooperation among governments, agencies, scientists, and communities are paramount, and Myriad research needs exist in low- and high-resource countries that should be remedied to effectively develop research partnerships that can address major climate-related risks to global respiratory health. A crucial step toward building research infrastructure is to understand the existing national surveillance systems, augmenting their efficiency and scope, and reinforcing the completeness and reliability in data collection, with implementation of accurate and reliable surveillance systems necessary to identify, capture, and monitor climate changes that can affect respiratory health. Monitoring and alert system priorities include Pollen Tracking: Develop national and international pollen- monitoring networks; International Air Quality–Monitoring Network: Develop and fund improved national and international air quality- monitoring networks, particularly in rapidly growing cities of the developing world; Weather Forecasting: Improve weather forecasting to understand climate-forced change in weather and its impact on human health (heat, humidity, extreme weather events, precipitation, food and water security); and Weather Alert Systems: Expand or develop effective alert systems to inform communities about pending extreme weather events that can link to air pollution-monitoring systems.

Additional comments on lung volume recruitment (LVR) — "Low-quality evidence suggests that regularly increasing lung volumes and expiratory cough flows with LVR has immediate and long-term effects on vital capacity, maximum inspiratory capacity, and assisted cough flows", and "Regular LVR may have a positive impact on clinical outcomes". "No evidence suggests that one method of LVR is superior to another, for example, resuscitation bag vs MPV, or volumetric cough mode, although MPV availability improves autonomous LVR", and "An LVR resuscitation bag is inexpensive, and the technique is easy to learn for caregivers". Effectiveness "can be limited by bulbar function and compliance with the respiratory system", and "More randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of LVR with objective adherence measures". "The advantages of LVR through glossopharyngeal breathing include that the technique does not require resources and has no documented adverse consequences", but "not all patients can perform glossopharyngeal breathing effectively, and training is required", while "Manually assisted coughing, however, is readily available, can be taught in a single visit, and is feasible on its own or with an LVR maneuver".

### Bronchi, bronchial tree,&lungs-SEER training modulestraining.seer.cancer.gov › anatomy › respiratory › passages › bronchi… [^495be1d2]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchi, Bronchial Tree, & Lungs Bronchi and Bronchial Tree In the mediastinum, at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi. The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli. The cartilage and mucous membrane of the primary bronchi are similar to that in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the smallest bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple cuboidal epithelium to simple squamous epithelium. The alveolar ducts and alveoli consist primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Lungs The two lungs, which contain all the components of the bronchial tree beyond the primary bronchi, occupy most of the space in the thoracic cavity. The lungs are soft and spongy because they are mostly air spaces surrounded by the alveolar cells and elastic connective tissue. They are separated from each other by the mediastinum, which contains the heart. The only point of attachment for each lung is at the hilum, or root, on the medial side. This is where the bronchi, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves enter the lungs. The right lung is shorter, broader, and has a greater volume than the left lung. It is divided into three lobes and each lobe is supplied by one of the secondary bronchi. The left lung is longer and narrower than the right lung.

It has an indentation, called the cardiac notch, on its medial surface for the apex of the heart. The left lung has two lobes. Each lung is enclosed by a double-layered serous membrane, called the pleura. The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of the lung. At the hilum, the visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura that lines the wall of the thorax. The small space between the visceral and parietal pleurae is the pleural cavity.

### A guide to guidelines for pulmonary, sleep, and critical care medicine clinicians [^b5d009d2]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Both the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network have recently published standards for trustworthy guidelines. The standards address multiple aspects of guideline development, including being transparent about funding and methodology, minimizing bias related to conflicts of interest, assembling writing committees with broad stakeholder representation, using rigorous and systematic methods to synthesize evidence and formulate recommendations, and periodically assessing guidelines for currency and updating them as required. In this article, we present the perspective of the Documents Development and Implementation Committee of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) on these and other guideline-related topics of relevance to ATS members. In addition, we summarize the many important take-home messages from a workshop that was jointly sponsored by the ATS and the European Respiratory Society, and attempt to place these messages in the context of a methodology that is rapidly evolving and a landscape in which clinical practice guidelines are subjected to ever-increasing scrutiny by clinicians, patients, and other third-party stakeholders.

### Conference summary: computers in respiratory care [^55e15e86]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Computers and data management in respiratory care reflect the larger practices of hospital information systems: the diversity of conference topics provides evidence. Respiratory care computing has shown a steady, slow progression from writing programs that calculate shunt equations to departmental management systems. Wider acceptance and utilization have been stifled by costs, both initial and on-going. Several authors pointed out the savings that were realized from information systems exceeded the costs of implementation and maintenance. The most significant finding from one of the presentations was that no other structure or skilled personnel could provide respiratory care more efficiently or cost-effectively than respiratory therapists. Online information resources have increased, in forms ranging from peer-reviewed journals to corporate-sponsored advertising posing as authoritative treatment regimens. Practitioners and patients need to know how to use these resources as well as how to judge the value of information they present. Departments are using computers for training on a schedule that is more convenient for the staff, providing information in a timely manner and potentially in more useful formats. Portable devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) have improved the ability not only to share data to dispersed locations, but also to collect data at the point of care, thus greatly improving data capture. Ventilators are changing from simple automated bellows to complex systems collecting numerous respiratory parameters and offering feedback to improve ventilation. Clinical databases routinely collect information from a wide variety of resources and can be used for analysis to improve patient outcomes. What could possibly go wrong?

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^82689276]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As LUS was dismissed by Traditional Medical Textbooks only a few years ago, most LUS practitioners have had to learn its use and refine their skills through combinations of on‐the‐job training and continuing educational activities. However, there is now the opportunity to incorporate LUS training into the basic education and training of all physicians learning the practice of medicine. As point of care US training becomes accepted as a core curriculum study in Medical School all physicians will gain competency. The World International Network Focused on Critical Ultrasound (WINFOCUS) has long supported this paradigm and holds regular scientific assemblies dedicated to this undertaking. Many Universities have already introduced this training into their undergraduate curriculum and have many years of experience with medical students learning US. Rationally, Educational Bodies are now recommending the incorporation of US training into the basic Medical School curriculum. Institutions with experience recommend integrating US training into multiple different educational opportunities and experiences. For instance, the University of South Carolina School of Medicine utilizes US images and demonstrations to complement courses without dedicated hands‐on scanning sessions such as neuroanatomy, pathology, and introduction to clinical medicine problem‐based learning (PBL) small groups, and the University of Calgary has incorporated basic US training into undergraduate anatomy and pathophysiology learning.

### Respiratory research in the UK: investing for the next 10 years [^74b930af]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Delivering the OLS vision

Delivering on the healthcare mission objective in the OLS Vision for Life Sciences needs a 10-year strategic plan with relevant milestones and monitoring embedded. While it is essential to maximise use of existing resource, it is unlikely that everything could be achieved without significant additional investment. We should argue for prioritisation of funding schemes such as those supported by UKRI and Innovate UK to support the OLS priorities listed above. Delivering the vision will also need significant investment from industry so we can develop the new drugs, diagnostics, therapeutic devices and technologies to transform health outcomes in partnership. Finally, overarching co-ordination will be essential. There is currently no single structure to ensure this happens effectively and we need to create one. To facilitate this, we believe it is time to bring together current major funders of respiratory research, including NIHR, the research councils, industry and AMRC members to develop the framework to maximise the respiratory research community's ability to deliver on the OLS vision. This will require integrated actions across the healthcare communities, to avoid research happening in disconnected silos: key tasks are highlighted in box 1.

Box 1
Eight key actions

Rationalise and extend core datasets on respiratory disease incidence, prevalence and outcomes to provide centralised open access to data which is regularly updated to facilitate research and healthcare delivery.
Establish a monitoring observatory to examine risk factors for respiratory disease and model predicted changes in disease patterns.
Prioritise case finding initiatives for undiagnosed respiratory diseases, including a universal lung healthcare check.
Establish a task force to increase access to effective therapy for respiratory diseases with a particular emphasis on 'hard to reach' groups.
Create UK virtual centres of excellence for different respiratory diseases to facilitate delivery of clinical research studies, with a remit to work across the healthcare sector to improve efficiency through effective collaboration.
Set up working groups to subphenotype and redefine respiratory diseases and to make recommendations on research into future therapeutic approaches.
Establish a task and finish group to explore barriers which prevent trainees following careers in respiratory research and to identify incentives to increase future capacity.
Establish a cross-sector UK strategic group to provide leadership and oversight of the respiratory research portfolio, to monitor progress on key actions and delivery of the OLS Vision.

The OLS Vision provides a challenge for the respiratory community with which we must engage. Both the health of our population and the future international standing of our respiratory research will depend largely on how we address this vision over the next few years.

### The future of artificial intelligence using images and clinical assessment for difficult airway management [^d980a1c9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Difficult airway management is a scenario in which the clinician encounters challenges with oxygenation, ventilation, laryngoscopy, and/or tracheal intubation. Several algorithms for difficult airway management and prediction exist, although current protocols demonstrate low sensibility and specificity. One-size-fits-all solutions are ill-suited for complex issues like airway management, where the complexity of an emergency setting can synergize with patient's comorbidities and unstable vital signs.

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are automatic and sophisticated methods that recognize complex patterns by combining imaging data with clinical assessments (Table 1). Deep-learning (DL) models aim to represent complex data using more superficial hierarchized structures defined from specific features. AI has been developed and implemented in health care with the potential to reduce health inequities and improve global health and anesthesiology outcomes. AI tools use big data from electronic health records and complex datasets, integrating different types of information. They identify clusters and extract value to transform large volumes of data into predictive models, thereby enhancing the quality of decision-making quality. A variety of AI models is machine learning or machine-learning models that use a mathematical formula to predict future events. Although physical airway examination remains an essential tool to identify difficult airways, a multidimensional analysis using machine-learning models to predict difficult airways could be helpful (Table 2). AI and machine-learning represent new advances in airway management. If machine-learning can predict difficult airways in adults, AI may offer providers real-time clinical decision support during intubation. Several X-ray machine-learning and DL models have recently been developed and validated to predict difficult airways and identify tracheal tube malpositioning. Other imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be helpful for adequately reconstructing airway anatomy. Nevertheless, the pivotal value of imaging techniques for clinical application may be limited by factors such as radiation, medical costs, equipment requirements, and burden of medical staff can limit their use in clinical practice.

### The opportunities and challenges of developing imaging biomarkers to study lung function and disease [^6388b4b4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Recent advances in imaging offer exciting opportunities to develop and validate lung-specific biomarkers as valuable adjuncts to diagnosis, tests of treatment efficacy, and/or treatment monitoring. State-of-the-art structural, functional, and molecular imaging methods allow the lungs to be visualized noninvasively in vivo at submillimeter and subsecond spatial and temporal scales. However, the development and validation of imaging biomarkers present some special challenges, including the following: equipment evaluation, procedure standardization, data regarding reproducibility and replication, interrater variability, the production and measurement of reference standards, sensitivity to interventions or disease progression, intersubject variance, choice of image reconstruction and segmentation algorithms, automated versus observer-dependent image analysis, data acquisition during conditions of standardized lung volume, whether a reliable association can be demonstrated between the imaging biomarker and a clinical endpoint, and whether its use will have a favorable cost-effective impact on drug development or disease management. Establishing such performance characteristics, especially for single investigators at single institutions, can be daunting if not impossible for costly biomarkers such as imaging. Therefore, to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by state-of-the-art imaging methods, new approaches to analytic and clinical validation must be developed in collaboration with industry, foundation, and federal funding agencies.

### Incorporating considerations of cost-effectiveness, affordability, and resource implications in guideline development: article 6 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^944b8eee]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are based on the best available research evidence. This is the sixth of a series of 14 articles prepared to advise guideline developers for respiratory and other diseases on how to achieve this goal. In this article, we focused on integrating cost and resource information in guideline development and formulating recommendations focusing on four key questions.

Methods

We addressed the following specific questions. (1) When is it important to incorporate costs, and/or resource implications, and/or cost-effectiveness, and/or affordability considerations in guidelines? (2) Which costs and which resource use should be considered in guidelines? (3)What sources of evidence should be used to estimate costs, resource use, and cost-effectiveness? (4) How can cost-effectiveness, resource implications, and affordability be taken into account explicitly? Our work was based on a prior review on this topic and our conclusions are based on available evidence, consideration of what guideline developers are doing, and workshop discussions.

Results and Discussion

Many authorities suggest that there is a need to include explicit consideration of costs, resource use, and affordability during guideline development. Where drug use is at issue, "explicit consideration" may need to involve only noting whether the price (easily determined and usually the main component of "acquisition cost") of a drug is high or low. Complex interventions such as rehabilitation services are to a greater degree setting- and system-dependent. Resources used, and the costs of those resources, will vary among systems, and formal identification by a guideline group of the resource requirements of a complex intervention is essential. A clinical guideline usually contains multiple recommendations, and in some cases there are hundreds. Defining costs and resource use for all of them-especially for multiple settings-is unlikely to be feasible. At present, disaggregated resource utilization accompanied by some cost information seems to be the most promising approach. The method for assigning values to costs, including external or indirect cost (such as time off work), can have a significant impact on the outcome of any economic evaluation. The perspective that the guideline assumes should be made explicit. Standards for evidence for clinical data are usually good-quality trials reporting a relevant endpoint that should be summarized in a systematic review. Like others, we are therefore proposing that the ideal sources of evidence for cost and resource utilization data for guideline development are systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that report resource utilization, with direct comparisons between the interventions of interest.

### Establishing a normative atlas of the human lung: intersubject warping and registration of volumetric CT images [^071e528f]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To establish the range of normal values for quantitative CT-based measures of lung structure and function, the authors developed a method for matching pulmonary structures across individuals and creating a normative human lung atlas.

Materials and Methods

A computerized human lung atlas was synthesized from computed tomographic (CT) images from six subjects by means of three-dimensional image registration. The authors identified a set of reproducible feature points for each CT image and used these points to establish correspondences across subjects, used a landmark- and intensity-based consistent image registration algorithm to register a template image volume from the population to the rest of the pulmonary CT volumes in the population, averaged these transformations, and constructed an atlas by deforming the template with the average transformation.

Results

The effectiveness of the authors' method was evaluated and visualized by means of both gray-level and segmented CT images. The method reduced the average landmark registration error from 10.5 mm to 0.4 mm and the average relative volume overlap error from 0.7 to 0.11 for the six data sets studied.

Conclusion

The method, and the computerized human lung atlas constructed and visualized by the authors with this method, provides a basis for establishing regional ranges of normative values for structural and functional measures of the human lung.

### AirSeg: learnable interconnected attention framework for robust airway segmentation [^f765c71f]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate airway segmentation is vital for diagnosing and managing lung diseases, yet it remains challenging due to data imbalance and difficulty detecting small airway branches. This study proposes AirSeg, a learnable interconnected attention framework incorporating advanced attention mechanisms and a learnable embedding module, to enhance airway segmentation accuracy in computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed framework integrates multiple attention mechanisms, including image, positional, semantic, self-channel, and cross-spatial attention, to refine feature representations at various network and data levels. Additionally, a learnable variance-based embedding module dynamically adjusts input features, improving robustness against spatial inconsistencies and noise. This improves the model's robustness to spatial inconsistencies and noise, leading to more reliable segmentation results, especially in clinically challenging regions. AirSeg can be integrated with any UNet-like network with flexibility. The framework was evaluated on two datasets (in vivo and in situ) using several UNet-based architectures, comparing performance with and without AirSeg integration. Training employed data augmentation, a hybrid loss function combining Dice Similarity Coefficient and Intersection over Union losses, and statistical analysis to assess accuracy improvements. Integrating AirSeg into segmentation models led to statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Specifically, accuracy increased by 16.18% (p = 0.0035) for in vivo datasets and by 10.32% (p = 0.0097) for in situ datasets. These enhancements enable more precise identification of airway structures, including small branches, critical for early diagnosis and treatment planning in pulmonary care. The proposed model achieved a weighted average accuracy improvement of 12.43% (p = 0.0004) over other conventional models. AirSeg demonstrated superior performance in capturing both global structures and fine details, effectively segmenting large airways and intricate branches. Ablation studies validated the contributions and impact of individual attention mechanisms and the embedding module. The improvement in accuracy translates to more precise airway segmentation, enhancing the detection of small branches crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. The statistically significant p-values confirm that these gains are reliable, reducing manual correction efforts and improving the efficiency of automated airway analysis in clinical settings.

### Imaging research in fibrotic lung disease; applying deep learning to unsolved problems [^9b73f19d]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been a groundswell of research interest in computer-based methods for objectively quantifying fibrotic lung disease on high resolution CT of the chest. In the past 5 years, the arrival of deep learning-based image analysis has created exciting new opportunities for enhancing the understanding of, and the ability to interpret, fibrotic lung disease on CT. Specific unsolved problems for which computer-based imaging analysis might provide solutions include the development of reliable methods for assisting with diagnosis, detecting early disease, and predicting disease behaviour using baseline imaging data. However, to harness this technology, technical and societal challenges must be overcome. Large CT datasets will be needed to power the training of deep learning algorithms. Open science research and collaboration between academia and industry must be encouraged. Prospective clinical utility studies will be needed to test computer algorithm performance in real-world clinical settings and demonstrate patient benefit over current best practice. Finally, ethical standards, which ensure patient confidentiality and mitigate against biases in training datasets, that can be encoded in machine-learning systems will be needed as well as bespoke data governance and accountability frameworks to encourage buy-in from health-care professionals, patients, and the public.

### New international guidelines and consensus on the use of lung ultrasound [^501d4f60]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Beyond image scoring and segmentation, novel AI approaches should also be developed to provide feedback to the user in real time during imaging sessions. There is tremendous potential for AI to help optimize the quality of LUS images as well as to guide the operator during the acquisition.

As an example, to standardize image quality, a proposal explicitly mentioning defined boundaries for key imaging settings (imaging depth, MI, focal‐point position, and suggested probes) has been published during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Moreover, it is important to develop additional criteria on contrast. To do so, the pleural line could be exploited, automatically segmented, and used as a landmark to obtain feedback on image quality. This will contribute to a uniform and reliable assessment of the lung using US.

Finally, AI methods have highly unexploited potential, which could be unleashed if used directly on RF data instead of beam‐formed images. This would help exploit the rich information contained in the US signals, which is bound to be affected by structural changes associated with a wide range of lung diseases.

Statement 2 (Technical Statement)

Before new technologies will be mature, LUS will continue to be performed with standard US imaging. In order to improve its reproducibility, standardization of imaging protocols is essential.

Guidelines

In order to guarantee the reproducibility of LUS studies, always report explicitly the adopted MI range, the probe and scanner utilized, the imaging frequency range, the focal and imaging depth range as well as the areas of the chest examined, chest wall thickness and the rationale for the choices made.

Future Developments

Extensive studies are required to define the optimal imaging settings and understand their impact on the imaging patterns.

Growing literature is showing the clinical impact of US imaging for the assessment of lung diseases.

This is even truer of point‐of‐care USin the context of COVID‐19 pandemic.,

However, LUS differs from US imaging of other organs and tissues because it lacks one‐to‐one anatomical relationship between the structure of lung parenchyma and its appearance in the images. In fact, the elevated air content of the lung hinders US waves propagation through the parenchyma. In particular, the size and distribution of the air‐filled volumes (eg, the alveoli) produces and modulates multiple scattering phenomena, which prevent conventional B‐mode anatomical imaging but can be exploited for the assessment of interstitial diseases.

Variant interpretation dissemination and infrastructure — Third, rapid dissemination of clinically actionable information to health providers is critical for widespread adoption of precision medicine, yet there are no centralized databases supported to guarantee that genetic information concerning pathogenicity of sequence variants is reliably curated in a sustained manner, and interpretation of clinically actionable variants often differs across clinical sequencing laboratories. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) is attempting to address this deficiency through the establishment of standards for variant interpretation and a publicly accessible informatics infrastructure to efficiently exchange expertly curated information. Although ClinGen has established eight Clinical Domain Working Groups covering 31 diseases, expert panels in pulmonary disease have yet to be convened.

### Studying the pulmonary endothelium in health and disease: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^c75634a6]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2024). High credibility.

In vitro endothelial cell experimentation and reporting — Many in vitro experiments still rely on endothelial cells plated on standard cultureware under static conditions, and studies should report the detailed methods for application of extracellular matrix and any physical forces applied (i.e., flow and/or shear, strain). The page specifies that criteria used to select imaging areas, how many areas were selected, details of the imaging conditions, and whether antibodies used (source, catalog number and lot number) and how they were validated also should be reported, and it adds that the exact details of how "n" was calculated and the type of replicates (biological, technical, individual clusters) should be reported when publishing in vitro data.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^151d9544]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Program organization and patient selection for pulmonary rehabilitation vary widely, but applicability is broad: although programs share essential features, resources, setting, structure, personnel, and duration vary considerably across systems; pulmonary rehabilitation can be adapted for any individual with chronic respiratory disease, and there is good evidence it is beneficial irrespective of baseline age and disease severity, with earlier referral at milder stages allowing more emphasis on preventive strategies and maintenance of physical activity.

### A soft systems approach of asthma management in children based on therapeutic education and e-learning [^587e5a35]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the most common respiratory chronic diseases is asthma, with 5–16% of world prevalence. In chronic disease, prevention, diagnosis, management, and palliation are the strategies for a care model; the patient-self management is fundamental with the so-called therapeutic education (TE) to train the patient in the necessary skills. The challenge of TE grows when the patient is a child or a person with special needs, even more in public health care in low- and middle-income countries. This is a problematic human situation, that needs soft system thinking. In this research, the analytic hierarchy process was used to determine the perceived importance of the factors that affect children's asthma health care in a public health institution in Mexico. The soft systems methodology (SSM) was applied to learn about the disease self-management, in order to obtain activities models and an action plan. According to AHP, human resources and education were percived as the most important among the factors that affect children health care within the institution. The perceived importance of two main subfactors (human resources training and TE) was around 34%, which emphasizes the need to generate strategies for the improvement of the education of patients and health care providers. In MSS, the rich vision, the CATWOE, the root definition, and an activities model were proposed, including the application of an instructional design methodology (ADDIE) for the development of learning objects of asthma for children. Desirable and feasible actions and recommendations include the update of the national clinical practice guides, the use of control measures such as the Asthma Control Test, and a daily asthma diary to register the daily status of the breathing capacity, the drug administration, and the potential trigger events. The proposed model can be used as part of a systemic patient-and-family centered approach for chronic care model (CCM), particularly in diseases unsuitable for prevention interventions.
