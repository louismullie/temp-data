## Question

Rasmussen anuryesm

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Rasmussen's aneurysm, specifically its definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis, management, prognosis, and special considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and its historical context. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and histopathology. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to characterize clinical presentation and severity. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic strategy, including imaging modalities and pitfalls. I will now examine the differential diagnosis, especially other causes of massive hemoptysis in TB. Next, I should review management, including endovascular techniques and when surgery is preferred. Finally, I will assess prognosis and highlight special scenarios and key takeaways, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and historical context. Rasmussen's aneurysm is a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm arising from a branch of the pulmonary artery adjacent to or within a tuberculous cavity, historically linked to chronic cavitary tuberculosis and first described in the 19th century, with contemporary series documenting more than 200 cases to date [^5f5cff39].

> I need to check the pathophysiology carefully. The mechanism is erosion of the pulmonary arterial wall by chronic granulomatous inflammation within a TB cavity, leading to a focal dilation that is actually a pseudoaneurysm lacking all arterial wall layers and thus prone to rupture; histopathology shows destruction of elastic fibers and inflammatory remodeling, which explains the high risk of catastrophic hemorrhage [^5f5cff39] [^4321b6dc].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. Wait, let me verify the prevalence figures. Autopsy series suggest around 4% in cavitary TB, while CT-based studies of massive hemoptysis in TB report approximately 6.9% due to Rasmussen's aneurysm, and pulmonary artery sources account for less than 10% of hemoptysis overall, underscoring its rarity but clinical importance in selected patients [^5f5cff39] [^4321b6dc].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while many cases present with life-threatening massive hemoptysis, some patients have milder, intermittent hemoptysis or even incidental discovery on imaging; nonetheless, the classic and most dangerous presentation is sudden large-volume hemoptysis with hemodynamic instability, and mortality after rupture can approach 50%, which mandates urgent recognition and intervention [^798a24df] [^4321b6dc].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. CT pulmonary angiography is the first-line modality to detect and localize the culprit pseudoaneurysm, typically appearing as a contrast-enhancing intracavitary outpouching with a feeding pulmonary artery branch; digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for confirmation and treatment planning, and bronchial artery embolization will not control bleeding from a pulmonary artery source, so identifying the correct vessel is critical [^4321b6dc] [^814c2e93].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis. I should double-check that bronchial artery hypertrophy and rupture, aspergilloma-related bleeding, bronchiectasis, and malignancy are the main alternatives, and importantly, bronchial artery embolization is effective for bronchial sources but ineffective for pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms, which is why CTA-based source identification changes management entirely in this setting [^6e9beb44] [^4321b6dc].

> Now, I need to ensure management recommendations are precise. Endovascular embolization is the first-line therapy for Rasmussen's aneurysm, with glue, coils, plugs, or liquid embolic agents such as EVOH used to exclude the pseudoaneurysm and parent vessel; combined strategies and direct percutaneous injection are reasonable when conventional transcatheter embolization fails or the feeder is not identified, and surgery is reserved for refractory cases or when endovascular therapy is unavailable or contraindicated [^4321b6dc] [^bccf7f50] [^cab2f663] [^330c7332].

> But wait, what if the cavity contains an aspergilloma or the aneurysm is very peripheral. I should confirm that coexisting aspergilloma can shift preference toward surgical resection of the affected lobe rather than embolization, and that percutaneous direct puncture embolization is a viable option for peripheral pseudoaneurysms when catheter access is not feasible, which has been reported successfully after failed transcatheter coil attempts [^2bb91d46] [^330c7332].

> I will now examine prognosis and outcomes. Let me verify the mortality signal again — rupture carries high mortality, yet with timely endovascular therapy, hemostasis is achievable and durable in most cases; recurrence risk is minimized by complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm, and contemporary series report successful ablation with preserved pulmonary flow and no recurrence after adequate antituberculous therapy, though residual cavitation and lung destruction may persist [^798a24df] [^829b631a] [^554e80ab].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. Rasmussen's aneurysm can occur in previously treated, apparently healed TB cavities and may be discovered incidentally on imaging for other reasons; in adolescents and young adults, it remains a rare but critical cause of massive hemoptysis, and early CTA in any patient with cavitary TB and hemoptysis can be lifesaving by enabling prompt embolization before exsanguination [^35cf153f] [^554e80ab] [^4321b6dc].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure nothing is missing. Rasmussen's aneurysm is a pseudoaneurysm of a pulmonary artery branch within or adjacent to a TB cavity, best diagnosed by CTA and definitively managed by endovascular embolization; it is rare but carries high rupture mortality, so clinicians must distinguish it from bronchial arterial bleeding and avoid ineffective bronchial artery embolization in this scenario [^4321b6dc] [^798a24df].

Rasmussen's aneurysm is a **pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm** caused by chronic inflammation from tuberculosis, most often within a cavitary lesion [^4321b6dc]. It presents with **life-threatening hemoptysis** and is best diagnosed by CT angiography [^4321b6dc]; endovascular embolization is the first-line treatment, with surgery reserved for refractory cases [^4321b6dc] [^bccf7f50]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to reduce mortality [^554e80ab].

---

## Pathophysiology

Rasmussen's aneurysm arises from **chronic granulomatous inflammation** in tuberculosis that erodes the pulmonary arterial wall, forming a pseudoaneurysm — a contained rupture without all arterial layers — that is prone to rupture and massive hemorrhage [^4321b6dc] [^5f5cff39].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with **massive hemoptysis** (often > 500 mL in 24 hours), which can cause hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, and death [^798a24df]. Less commonly, patients may have recurrent smaller hemoptysis episodes or be asymptomatic until rupture [^35cf153f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Chest radiography**: May show cavitary lesions but is nonspecific [^c29d7b92].
- **Contrast-enhanced CT/CT angiography**: Gold standard; shows a contrast-filled outpouching from a pulmonary artery branch within or adjacent to a cavity [^4321b6dc] [^bccf7f50].
- **Pulmonary angiography**: Confirmatory and guides endovascular therapy [^814c2e93].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of massive hemoptysis in tuberculosis include **bronchial artery hypertrophy/rupture**, aspergilloma, bronchiectasis, and malignancy; distinguishing these is essential because bronchial artery embolization is ineffective for pulmonary artery bleeding [^4321b6dc] [^6e9beb44].

---

## Management

- **Stabilization**: Airway protection, fluid resuscitation, and correction of coagulopathy [^notfound].
- **Endovascular embolization**: First-line therapy; high success and low recurrence [^4321b6dc] [^bccf7f50].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for failed embolization or unsuitable anatomy; higher morbidity [^9449df99].
- **Antituberculous therapy**: Essential to control the underlying disease [^829b631a].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **timely diagnosis and intervention**; mortality from rupture can be as high as 50% [^798a24df]. Endovascular therapy has markedly improved outcomes, with low recurrence when combined with antituberculous treatment [^bccf7f50] [^829b631a].

### Rasmussen's aneurysm: a forgotten entity? [^5be0ee1d]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

We present the case of a rare entity which is a complication of a disease process that had almost disappeared from the Western World. With the recent resurgence in reported cases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) in Western communities, it is important to recognize complications and sequelae. A young alcoholic male with confirmed active TB suffered a cardiac arrest following massive haemoptysis. Multidetector computed tomography angiography diagnosed a Rasmussen's aneurysm, confirmed by digital subtraction angiography and then successfully embolized with glue. We outline this rare case and the embolization technique and review previously documented reports.

### Rare cause of massive haemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis: rasmussen's aneurysm [^4321b6dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Massive haemoptysis in cases with underlying tuberculosis can be due to varied aetiopathologies like bronchiectasis, aspergillomas, broncholiths or vascular abnormalities. Of the vascular complications, bronchial arteries are the most common source of haemorrhage and the pulmonary arteries account for < 10% of haemoptysis.

Rasmussen's aneurysm is a focal dilation of a branch of the pulmonary artery due to arterial wall erosion secondary to chronic inflammation within a tubercular cavity. Arteries involved are small to medium-sized branch vessels; therefore, the aneurysms are usually peripherally located. The reported incidence is around 5% in cavitatory tuberculosis.

It is an entity that requires urgent clinical differentiation from bronchial arterial sources of bleeding, due to higher relative intravascular pressures in bronchial circulation which is more challenging to treat, leading to poor outcomes.

Emergency endovascular techniques like arterial embolisation are the preferred treatment modality for massive haemoptysis due to inflammatory aneurysms.

### Rare but life-threatening cause of massive haemoptysis in an adolscent with tuberculosis: rasmussen's aneurysm [^554e80ab]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Rasmussen's aneurysm is a rare yet fatal cause of massive haemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis. Early identification and timely intervention are of utmost importance to reduce the associated mortality. A girl in early adolescence presented with persistent fever and massive haemoptysis who required intubation and was subsequently confirmed to have tuberculosis. CT pulmonary angiogram showed the presence of pseudoaneurysms in the left upper and lower lobes. The haemoptysis resolved following the embolisation of the culprit's vessel. Residual lung destruction was evident on CT after a 12-month course of antituberculosis therapy. Rasmussen's aneurysm is a significant vascular complication of cavitary tuberculosis and needs to be considered in patients presenting with massive haemoptysis.

Rasmussen's aneurysm was first described in 1868 in 11 patients with tuberculosis; since then, more than 200 cases have been documented in the literature to our knowledge. On the basis of autopsies, the prevalence of Rasmussen's aneurysm has been estimated to be 4% in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In a study of massive hemoptysis associated with tuberculosis infection diagnosed using CT, Rasmussen's aneurysm was found in 6.9% of patients. There have been reports of mortality due to massive hemoptysis, as observed in the present case. Apart from the resection of the affected pulmonary lobe, endovascular embolization has emerged as the most successful and less invasive treatment option in recent years. Our hospital did not have an interventional radiologist. In addition, the patient's respiratory condition was poor, making patient transfer to another hospital difficult. If contrast-enhanced CT and CT angiography had been performed earlier, Rasmussen's aneurysm could have been diagnosed earlier, and the patient's life could have been saved by performing endovascular embolization.

### Rasmussen's aneurysm with aspergilloma in old, healed pulmonary tuberculosis [^2bb91d46]. Clinical Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Rasmussen's aneurysm is rare sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis. The hemoptysis caused by rupturing of it is usually massive and needs early and aggressive management. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a case of Rasmussen's aneurysm with aspergilloma proved pathologically. The accomplishment of aspergilloma changes the first choice of treatment from endovascular embolisation to surgery.

### Rasmussen's aneurysm masquerading as mass lesion [^35cf153f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Haemoptysis is an often encountered respiratory symptom. The amount of haemoptysis varies from mild to life-threatening severity and may indicate the underlying pulmonary disorder. Herein, we report a 50-year-old male smoker who presented with occasional streaky to mild haemoptysis for last 1year. He had pulmonary tuberculosis 10 years ago and had received adequate treatment. Chest radiograph was suspicious of a mass lesion in left upper lung. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of thorax revealed pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm suggestive of Rasmussen's aneurysm. Unlike this case, Rasmussen's aneurysm usually manifests as life-threatening haemoptysis and portends a high mortality.

### Glue ablation of rasmussen's aneurysm in a case of epituberculosis [^829b631a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s presented with massive haemoptysis and breathlessness for 1day. She had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis based on sputum CBNAAT (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) and was on antitubercular treatment for previous 2weeks. Her chest X-ray showed right middle lobe lateral segment dense consolidation with bilateral nodular infiltrates. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed a well-defined homogenously enhancing vascular lesion of size 10×11×13mm in the right hilar region communicating with the descending branch of right pulmonary artery, suggesting a Rasmussen's aneurysm. It was in close proximity to the segmental bronchus that was almost completely occluded, suggesting epituberculosis. Transvenous pulmonary artery glue embolisation successfully achieved complete ablation of the aneurysm with preserved arterial flow. She has later completed 6months of antitubercular treatment and is cured with no recurrence of haemoptysis. Her lung infiltrates have resolved with some lung scarring.

### Endovascular embolization with EVOH for the treatment of a rasmussen aneurysm [^cab2f663]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

First-line treatment of pulmonary artery aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms (PAA/PAPA) is percutaneous or endovascular embolization. The present case of a Rasmussen aneurysm, a PAPA caused by Tuberculosis (TB), was successfully treated with ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH), a radiopaque liquid embolic agent with favorable characteristics. A 35-year-old man presented as a new patient with hemoptysis, and CT imaging revealed multiple cavitary lesions and a 2.1 cm aneurysm in the upper right lobe. Endovascular treatment was delivered and a complete lack of filling of the lesion was noted on post-treatment angiography. The patient's history includes risk factors and past TB infection. Despite the suspicious imaging, diagnostic tests were negative for active TB in this patient. He was then found to have MRSA bacteremia and a mediastinal lymph node positive for M. avium. The etiology of this aneurysm is suspicious for the superinfection of a chronic tuberculous cavity with M. avium, MRSA, or both.

### Rare cause of massive haemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis: rasmussen's aneurysm [^c29d7b92]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Description

A woman aged 48 years presented to the accident and emergency department with three episodes of massive haemoptysis of ∼500 mL. On examination, her vitals were stable. She had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 2 years prior to this episode for which she had taken a complete course of antituberculous drugs for 9 months and was symptom-free and sputum culture-negative at the end of treatment. Her blood routines showed leucocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (ESR). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were smear positive for acid-fast bacilli, thus she was diagnosed to have a relapse with active tuberculosis.

Imaging evaluation included a chest radiograph which showed cavitatory lesions with air fluid levels in bilateral lung fields with surrounding air space shadowing (figure 1). A plain multidetector CT (MDCT) was performed, which revealed multiple discrete cavities randomly distributed throughout both lungs (figure 2) and the largest cavity was in the right lower lobe and had hyperdense (blood density) contents within (figure 3). A contrast-enhanced MDCT angiography revealed a well defined, spherical, intracavitary wall-based lesion with homogenous intense enhancement similar to aorta in arterial phase images (figure 4). A branch from the descending right pulmonary artery was noted leading into the lesion (figure 5). The lesion was diagnosed as a Rasmussen's aneurysm within a tubercular cavity. The patient requested a discharge against medical advice and was lost to follow-up.

### Hemoptysis from rasmussen's aneurysm [^0e8b903f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

A 43-year-old Japanese man with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital for the management of pulmonary tuberculosis; he had sputum production, cough, and exertional dyspnea for 3 months. The sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction test results were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was commenced on directly observed antituberculosis therapy, including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Forty-five days after treatment commenced, he had hemoptysis of approximately 100 mL, which was conservatively managed with hemostatic agents, including tranexamic acid and carbazochrome sodium sulfonate hydrate. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography (Figures 1A–C, white arrow) with three-dimensional reconstruction were performed on the same day, and the findings showed an 11-mm-diameter pseudoaneurysm of the left lower pulmonary artery surrounded by high-density fluid collection. On the 60th day of hospitalization, another hemoptysis episode occurred, and his respiratory condition deteriorated rapidly. Three days later, his blood oxygen saturation gradually dropped, and he received oxygen via a reservoir mask. Three hours later, he developed ventricular fibrillation, and despite intensive care with endotracheal intubation, replacement fluids, defibrillation, and noradrenaline, his heart rate did not normalize, and he died of cardiac arrest. Autopsy revealed hemorrhage within a necrotic layer in the left lung (Figure 2A and B, white arrow). Elastic van Gieson staining showed fragile elastic fibers destroyed by inflammation (Figure 3, white arrow). This rupture of the pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm caused by M. tuberculosis infection is called Rasmussen's aneurysm.

### From crisis to cure: endovascular management of rasmussen pseudoaneurysm presenting as life-threatening hemoptysis [^bccf7f50]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rasmussen's pseudoaneurysm is a rare and potentially lethal pulmonary vascular complication of tuberculosis. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of massive hemoptysis in patients known or suspected to have pulmonary tuberculosis. CT angiography is the first investigation to confirm the diagnosis and localize the bleeding source. Endovascular interventions remain the mainstay of treatment in Rasmussen's pseudoaneurysm, with common embolic agents such as glue, coils, and plugs.

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old female was diagnosed with pulmonary Koch's 6years ago. She took antitubercular therapy for 6months and was asymptomatic for the last 5 and ½years. She presented with 2 episodes of massive hemoptysis for the previous 2days. CT angiography in emergency showed cavitary changes in the left upper lobe with focal contrast-filled outpouching measuring 2cm×2cm from the superior segmental branch of the left descending pulmonary artery. The patient was immediately posted for embolization of the pseudoaneurysm. She had another episode of massive hemoptysis on the cath lab table and went into class II hypovolemic shock. Immediate fluid resuscitation was done. Successful embolization of the pseudoaneurysm sac with glue with proximal coil embolization of the pulmonary artery branch was done. Clinical ImpactThis case highlights the efficacy of combined glue and coil embolisation for managing Rasmussen pseudoaneurysm-induced massive hemoptysis, offering a life-saving, minimally invasive alternative to surgery. It emphasises the importance of early diagnosis using cross-sectional imaging and prompt intervention by interventional radiologists. The technique's dual approach ensures secure embolisation and reduced recurrence risk. Clinicians should consider this approach in similar cases to minimise mortality and morbidity. This case report further underscores the role of multidisciplinary collaboration in achieving optimal patient outcomes in life-threatening hemoptysis.

### Massive hemoptysis due to rasmussen aneurysm: detection with helicoidal CT angiography and successful steel coil embolization [^814c2e93]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the successful management of two cases of massive hemoptysis related to pulmonary aneurysms in patients with active tuberculosis.

Design and Setting

Retrospective study in the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital.

Patients

Between July 1996 and January 2002, 46 cases of hemoptysis related to active tuberculosis needed ICU admission. In two cases, pulmonary aneurysm was the source of bleeding.

Results

Diagnosis was suspected on enhanced CT scan and confirmed by pulmonary angiograms. Transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation was successful. Both patients were alive at 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Massive hemoptysis occurring in patients with active tuberculosis could arise from pulmonary aneurysms. In such cases, bronchial artery embolization is ineffective. Before referring those patients for emergency surgery, an alternative strategy using angiographic study and transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation might be of interest.

### Therapeutic approaches for pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms and analysis of outcomes [^9449df99]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A pseudoaneurysm is a contained arterial rupture surrounded by relatively thin adventitia or surrounding perivascular soft tissue, while a true aneurysm involves all three layers. PAPs are detected in up to 11% of patients examined for hemoptysis and in approximately 14% of those with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. A PAP that originates from the tuberculous cavity is known as a Rasmussen aneurysm. Other common causes of PAPs include infection, vasculitis, neoplasm, trauma, and iatrogenic injury.

To treat PAPs, several reports support the use of endovascular treatment as a first-line treatment whenever possible. The percutaneous direct puncture embolization can be selected for PAPs that involve peripheral branches of the pulmonary artery by employing embolizing agents such as thrombin or glue under CT, ultrasound, and/or fluoroscopy guidance. Surgical treatment such as pneumonectomy, lobectomy, prosthetic graft or pericardial patch interposition, pulmonary artery ligation, or hilar clamping with direct arterial repair can be performed in certain cases. Medical treatment can be another option, particularly in patients with small infectious PAPs.

### Timing of surgery in rasmussen syndrome: is patience a virtue? [^98a92987]. Epilepsy Currents (2014). Low credibility.

Rasmussen syndrome affects previously normal people and forever changes their lives and the lives of their families. Although understood as a probable autoimmune condition, medical treatment remains limited and surgery remains the only cure, although with inevitable functional consequences. Difficulties remain in deciding on the optimal timing of surgery. Here, we review data available to aid clinicians faced with making the decision of when to recommend hemispherectomy. Not all patients have rapidly progressive disease, however, and such patients may benefit from immunomodulatory treatment. Thus, a patient's clinical course requires careful evaluation in order to identify those who would benefit most from early surgery.

### A review of the genetics of intracranial berry aneurysms and implications for genetic counseling [^0e6a9218]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2017). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis Type I

Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in NF1. The primary characteristics of NF1 are café-au-lait spots, iris Lisch nodules, and benign neurofibromas (Conway et al.). Vascular abnormalities are also a recognized characteristic of NF1 and patients under 29 years of age have an increased prevalence of IBA relative to the general population risk (Rasmussen et al.). Intracranial aneurysms have been documented as a cerebrovascular feature of NF1 (Friedman et al; Jett and Friedman). Retrospective reviews of NFI patient data have reported the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms to be between 9 and 11%. The youngest reported NF1 patient to have an intracranial aneurysm was 1 year of age. However, routine screening for intracranial aneurysms is not recommended for NF1 patients (Muhonen et al; Rosser et al; Schievink et al; Uranishi et al; Zhao and Han; Zöller et al.). Conway and coauthors (Conway et al.) did not detect any intracranial aneurysms in their autopsy study of 25 NF1 patients between 3 and 69 years of age.

### Percutaneous injection therapy for a peripheral pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm after failed transcatheter coil embolization [^330c7332]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Coil embolization to occlude the feeding artery of a pseudoaneurysm is an effective treatment to control hemoptysis. However, a feeding artery of the pseudoaneurysm may not be identified at pulmonary angiography, resulting in a failure to obtain embolization. We describe here two cases of a Rasmussen aneurysm that was successfully treated with percutaneous injection of thrombin (case 1) and N-butyl cyanoacrylate (case 2) under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance after failed transcatheter coil embolization.

Acquired causes of BAH

There are several acquired diseases that can cause bronchial artery hypertrophy.

Inflammatory diseases and infection, such as bronchiectasis (Fig. 6), cystic fibrosis (Fig. 7), tuberculosis (TB), or aspergilloma (Fig. 8), may be associated with BAH. The proposed mechanism is complex, probably due to vasculitis with increased neovascularity and microvascular thrombosis of the pulmonary vessels. This process appears to be mediated by angiogenic growth factors, which promote the proliferation and expansion of the bronchial arteries.

Rasmussen's aneurysm. Active TB can cause hemoptysis due to rupture of a Rasmussen's aneurysm (a, white arrow), which is a pseudo-aneurysm of the pulmonary artery adjacent to a cavity in patients with pulmonary TB (b)

Bronchiectasis is an acquired disorder characterized by permanent abnormal dilatation and destruction of the bronchial walls. Its pathophysiology involves an infectious insult to the airways, with impaired drainage, airway obstruction, and/or a defect in host defense. There is a multitude of etiologies associated with bronchiectasis, such as cystic fibrosis, cigarette smoking, pulmonary infections, defective host defenses, and foreign-body airway obstruction. Recurrent airway inflammation promotes neovascularity and bronchial artery dilatation, increasing the risk of hemoptysis (Figs. 6 and 7).

### Evaluation of the bronchial arteries: normal findings, hypertrophy and embolization in patients with hemoptysis [^200d3457]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Infection is also associated with BAH, and one of the most common agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nowadays, despite recent medical advances, TB remains a relevant health burden, particularly in developing countries. Historically, hemoptysis was considered almost pathognomonic for pulmonary tuberculosis. Hemoptysis is a potential complication of active or prior TB. Bleeding in active TB can occur in the setting of cavitary or noncavitary disease and usually results from bronchial arterial ulceration, with necrosis of adjacent blood vessels. Rarely, active TB can cause hemoptysis due to rupture of a Rasmussen's aneurysm, which is a pseudo-aneurysm of the pulmonary artery adjacent to a tuberculous cavity. When it occurs, it may lead to life threatening massive hemoptysis, with associated high mortality rate (Fig. 8).

Although strongly associated with active pulmonary TB, hemoptysis can also present following resolution of an acute disease (post-primary TB) due to airway or lung parenchymal distortion with associated vascular changes. This irreversible process leads to distortion and damage of local bronchial vascularization, which becomes hypertrophied, dilated, and exposed, with increased risk of bleeding. Other causes of hemoptysis in the setting of inactive/prior TB include the erosion of a healed calcified lymph node through a bronchial artery, bronchiectasis due to structural lung damage, and fungal colonization of prior lung cavities with Aspergillus or other species, leading to hemoptysis due to erosion of adjacent vasculature (Fig. 9).

### Clinical and radiological features associated with rupture of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm: a retrospective study [^798a24df]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemoptysis is a serious clinical complication, which can be fatal. The source of hemorrhage is mainly the bronchial artery. Hemoptysis due to pulmonary arterial origin is quite rare and it is estimated to occur in less than 10% of cases. Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (PAP) is one of causes associated with pulmonary artery. Histologically, a pseudoaneurysm comprises either the media, adventitia, or the soft tissue surrounding the vessel, unlike a true aneurysm which involves all three layers of the artery. As a consequence, the pseudoaneurysm has a higher risk of rupture. Hemoptysis has been described as a possible warning sign for rupture of PAP. In patients with massive hemoptysis undergoing bronchial artery embolization, 5–11% patients result from PAP rupture. Once PAP ruptures, the mortality can be as high as 50%. Therefore, risk assessment of the rupture of PAP is critical for early identification.

As low incidence and asymptomatic manifestation, patients with PAP are frequently underdiagnosis or misdiagnosed. PAP may be congenital or acquired. It has been found that PAP was associated with infection, primary or metastatic lung neoplasm, traumatic injury, pulmonary arterial hypertension, or vasculitis. Previous case series have reported that pseudoaneurysms secondary to aspergillus and tumors both tend to be adjacent to cavitary lesion. Rasmussen's aneurysms were often accompanied by tuberculous cavities, which appeared to be more prone to rupture and cause fatal hemoptysis. However, it remains uncertain whether the cavitary lesions and the rupture are clinically related.

The diameter of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been well-established as a crucial determinant and independent predictor of AAA rupture. A reliable assessment of hemodynamics is also crucial for predicting the risk of AAA rupture. Nevertheless, the relationship between pseudoaneurysm size and hemodynamics and PAP rupture has rarely been discussed. Currently, only case reports and series have described the etiology and radiological features. Little is known about the relevant factors for rupture of pseudoaneurysm in the lung. Therefore, this study aimed to illustrate the clinical characteristics of the rupture of pseudoaneurysm in a single center and further identify patients at high risk of rupture for early intervention.

### Thoracic sequelae and complications of tuberculosis [^ce8d8e02]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis when droplet nuclei laden with bacilli are inhaled. In accordance with the virulence of the organism and the defenses of the host, tuberculosis can occur in the lungs and in extrapulmonary organs. A variety of sequelae and complications can occur in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary portions of the thorax in treated or untreated patients. These can be categorized as follows: (a) parenchymal lesions, which include tuberculoma, thin-walled cavity, cicatrization, end-stage lung destruction, aspergilloma, and bronchogenic carcinoma; (b) airway lesions, which include bronchiectasis, tracheobronchial stenosis, and broncholithiasis; (c) vascular lesions, which include pulmonary or bronchial arteritis and thrombosis, bronchial artery dilatation, and Rasmussen aneurysm; (d) mediastinal lesions, which include lymph node calcification and extranodal extension, esophagomediastinal or esophagobronchial fistula, constrictive pericarditis, and fibrosing mediastinitis; (e) pleural lesions, which include chronic empyema, fibrothorax, bronchopleural fistula, and pneumothorax; and (f) chest wall lesions, which include rib tuberculosis, tuberculous spondylitis, and malignancy associated with chronic empyema. These varieties of radiologic manifestations can mimic other disease entities. Therefore, recognition and understanding of the radiologic manifestations of the thoracic sequelae and complications of tuberculosis are important to facilitate diagnosis.

Radiologic Criteria

The focus of the discussion revolved around use of chest radiographs alone to diagnose CPA; requiring computed tomography (CT), which is often unavailable, might delay diagnosis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that CT is more sensitive than chest radiography for demonstrating several features, namely, > 1 fungal balls, pulmonary nodules, multiple cavities, and disease in the apices and retrocardiac space. Considering the limited availability of CT in many healthcare settings, the radiologic criteria adopted are based solely on chest radiograph findings. Where available, CT is recommended in the context of clinical and microbiological suspicion of CPA with a nondiagnostic chest radiograph.

Fungal Ball or Aspergilloma, Intracavitary Material, or Fluid Level on Chest Radiograph

The differential diagnosis for a fungal ball in the lung is limited: echinoccocal cyst, necrotizing bronchogenic carcinoma, or acute or subacute invasive fungal infection. Similar-appearing conditions are lung abscess, Rasmussen aneurysm in a tuberculous cavity, cavitating hematoma, or lung infarct. If single and in a localized area of lung, with few or no symptoms, a simple aspergilloma is the most precise diagnosis (Figure 1) and can be resected or observed without antifungal treatment. Although presence of a fungal ball is highly suggestive of an aspergilloma as a manifestation of CPA, microbiological confirmation is required for a definitive diagnosis.

Figure 1
A) Chest radiograph showing aspergilloma (fungal ball) in the left upper lung lobe. B) Axial computed tomography image shows increased density in an irregular left apical cavity, a sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis, consistent with an aspergilloma.

Occasionally, a fluid level is visible in cavities. Few of these cavities have been sampled with aspiration and microbiological analysis, but when done, cultures are usually positive for A. fumigatus or, less commonly, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pathogens. Therefore, a fluid level in a cavity is entirely consistent with CPA but may also represent co-infection.

### Evidence that a subset of aneurysms less than 7 mm warrant treatment [^e24d7eb9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Traditional Dogma

The ISUIA trial aimed to provide the neurosurgeon with the evidence needed for making decisions regarding patients who would benefit from treatment of UAs. It was reported that the rupture risk among patients with a UIA of < 7 mm in diameter in the anterior circulation was 0% (no prior SAH from other aneurysm) and 1.5% (prior SAH) over 5 years. The rupture risk in the posterior circulation or posterior communicating artery site was 2.5% (no prior SAH) and 3.4% (prior SAH) over 5 years. However, other studies have reported conflicting results from the ISUIA. Wermer et al 37 conducted a comprehensive meta‐analysis of the natural history of aneurysms. It was noted that the UIA rupture rate was approximately 1% for smaller UIAs (5/565 measuring < 5 mm in diameter, and 1% [23/2249] for < 7 mm in diameter with follow‐up of 3.7 and 7.7 years, respectively). The rupture rate was 0.24% per year in those < 5 mm and 0.13% per year in those < 7 mm in diameter. Zylkowski et al 38 studied 110 UIAs < 7 mm in 70 patients and reported a rupture risk of 2.7%. With the ISUIA study, more emphasis has been given to size, location, and history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, so that these variables became the most important factors used in day‐to‐day clinical practice guiding the management of incidental aneurysms with addition of several other clinical factors such as life expectancy, family history, and smoking. 39, 40, 41, 42 Traditionally, aneurysms < 10 mm are given a 0.5% to 0.7% annual risk of rupture. 7 This estimate was found to be nonhomogeneous since a large percentage of RAs fall in this size category, and many are as small as 5 mm, making the relationship between size and rupture more sophisticated. 4, 29, 39, 43, 44, 45 In addition, shape, a potential indirect estimator of underlying hemodynamic changes, seems to play a role in RAs, as Ryu et al found that irregular aneurysms (multilobular or had 1 or more daughter sacs) tend to rupture more than simple‐lobed ones. 46 In a multitude of studies, the daughter sacs were significantly related to rupture, which may be due to higher shear stress values present at or adjacent to the blebs. 9, 41, 47 One study found that for anterior communicating aneurysms, size > 5 mm, the presence of blebs, and an anterior direction of the dome are significantly associated with RAs, and recommended that aneurysms with these characteristics should be treated. 41 This study also challenges the IUSIA trial that estimated the risk of rupture to be 0% for small anterior circulation aneurysm. Furthermore, Chalouhi et al reported their experience with treating 151 patients between 2004 and 2011 who presented with small ruptured aneurysm with a diameter size of < 3 mm. 48

### What is the fate of disconnected brain tissue in a child with rasmussen syndrome? A case report [^92802501]. Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a case of Rasmussen syndrome in a 7-year-old boy, presenting with epilepsia partialis continua, hemiplegia, and progressive mental deterioration. The initial MRI examination was normal, followed by progressive left hemispheric cortical atrophy and abnormal high signal intensity over the left occipital, parietal, and cingulate gyral areas over an 18-month period. On the basis of the clinical diagnosis and biopsy findings of Rasmussen syndrome, functional hemispherectomy was carried out at 7.5 years of age with alleviation of clinical seizures for the following 44 months. The follow-up MRI demonstrated atrophic changes involving the remaining left hemisphere with increased signal and cortical volume loss, as well as the absence of abnormal signal in the right hemisphere at 10 years of age. Our MRI findings are consistent with the progression of Rasmussen syndrome in the ipsilateral hemisphere even after functional-hemispherectomy without clinical seizures.

Discussion and conclusion

NF1 is one of the most frequent autosomal-dominant inherited disorders, with an incidence of 1 in 3000 births (Falcone et al.). There is a great variety of manifestations in NF1, involving mesenchymal tissue in musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems (Hinsch et al.). Although the estimated prevalence of NF-V has been reported as 0.4–6.4%, the actual frequency is unknown, as most patients with NF-V are asymptomatic throughout life. According to an autopsy series of patients with NF1 who died of other causes, vasculopathy was reported in 44% of cases (Salyer and Salyer). Therefore, with the inclusion of asymptomatic NF-V, the frequency of vasculopathy in patients with NF1 may be higher than previously reported.

Patients with NF1 have a decreased life expectancy, by ∼15 years, compared to that of the general population. Malignant neoplasms are the most common cause of death in NF1, followed by vasculopathy (Rasmussen et al.). Cardiovascular disease, haemorrhage, and embolism associated with vasculopathy are frequent causes of death in adult patients with NF1 (Zoller et al.). NF-V includes aneurysms, aneurysmal dilatation, stenosis, rupture, and arteriovenous malformations (D'Errico et al; Hinsch et al; Falcone et al.). Among these, aneurysmal dilatation is the most common form of vasculopathy (D'Errico et al.). Additionally, the involvement of multiple vessels is a common characteristic of NF-V (Friedman et al.). In fact, in the present case, multiple aneurysmal dilatations and multiple splenic aneurysms were observed on CT.

### Evidence that a subset of aneurysms less than 7 mm warrant treatment [^fc7500a8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Second, there was a clear linear relationship between changes in radial and aneurysm pressures: An acute change in systemic arterial pressure resulted in nearly equal changes in arterial pressure inside the aneurysm, with the intra‐aneurysm pressure being almost always below that of the systemic one. This highlights that hypertension may result in an increased intra‐aneurysm pressure and stresses the aneurysm wall. More importantly, the authors found a significant variation in the slopes of this relationship from patient to patient. This means that some aneurysms were more vulnerable to changes in pressure. The authors measured this vulnerability index and found that it is independent of the aneurysm size or location. In fact, 1 aneurysm of < 5 mm had the steepest slope in pressure changes, showing an exaggerated response to pressure variation. This could potentially explain why some smaller aneurysms progress to growth and even rupture. Furthermore, in a different patient, the intra‐aneurysm pressure was consistently higher than the systemic one, possibly due to vessel sclerosis and poor autoregulation. The clinical implications of this study were that a subpopulation of patients may have an exaggerated aneurysmal pressure response and would be particularly prone to rupture, and that in some individuals with chronic hypertension and vessel sclerosis, the intra‐aneurysm pressure can even supersede the systemic one. In fact, Takao et al indicated that RAs have a significantly lower pressure loss coefficient that can be translated to lesser resistance to blood flow. 28 This facilitation to flow renders the vessel susceptible to sudden changes in pressure, thereby increasing the risk of rupture. 28 The findings of these studies suggest that a subcategory of small aneurysms (< 7 mm) can be considered hemodynamically unstable and may proceed to rupture.

Hemodynamic Factors Predisposing to Rupture

The physiopathology that leads to the development of aneurysms and their subsequent rupture has been partially explained by hemodynamic components in a multitude of studies; high wall shear stress seems to play the predominant role in high‐flow aneurysm, whereas high intra‐aneurysmal pressure and low‐flow stasis are the main factors in low‐flow aneurysms. 25 It is hypothesized that the lower the flow, the higher the degenerative changes, and the higher the risk of rupture. Ruptured aneurysms (RAs) can have areas with higher than average and more concentrated wall shear stress with smaller impingement zones (where the inflow jet impacts against the aneurysm wall) when compared with unruptured ones. 26, 27, 28 Furthermore, it is reported that hemodynamic variables are dependent on the morphology of the aneurysm and on its feeding vessels. 25, 29, 30 Chronic hypertension seems to play a major role in aneurysm formation since it is more prevalent in patients with CAs compared to the general population. 31 It is also a well‐established independent risk factor. 31 Lin et al introduced the parent–daughter angle parameter, 32 which is formed by the vector of flow in the feeding artery with the vector of flow in the aneurysm. They found that a smaller angle was associated with increased rupture rate, a finding consistent with previous studies that showed increased wall shear stress when the angle of bifurcation decreases. 32 Hasan and colleagues directly measured the pressure changes between the aneurysm and the systemic circulation. 33 Dual‐sensor microwires with the capacity to simultaneously measure flow velocity and pressure were used to measure systolic, diastolic, and mean pressure inside the aneurysm sac and to measure both pressures and flow velocities in the feeder vessel just outside the aneurysm in patients undergoing endovascular treatment. Measurements were taken at baseline and then during a gradual increase in systemic systolic blood pressure to a target value of ≈25 mm Hg above baseline. This study demonstrated several important points. First, peak and mean flow velocities in the parent arteries did not change significantly with increased systolic blood pressure, nor did vessel diameters as measured by angiography. This is an important finding since traditionally, investigators have studied geometrical characteristics and variables governing the aneurysm risk of rupture since geometry could indirectly reflect hemodynamic variables. One example would be the aspect ratio (defined as the maximum perpendicular distance between the neck and the dome, divided by the neck width), with the rationale that the smaller the aneurysm neck, the slower the flow and subsequently the higher the risk of rupture. 29, 34, 35, 36 A common threshold of the aspect ratio, above which there is a significant risk of rupture, varied between studies and was hard to define. This could be possibly attributable to the fact that velocity alone cannot explain the rupture mechanism, since low‐flow velocity may lead to the opposite outcome, which is aneurysm thrombosis. 35 Another reason would be that mean and peak flow velocities do not significantly change. 33

A 23-day-old boy with prenatal diagnosis of basilar artery aneurysm presented with multiple congenital red patches consistent with capillary malformations. Genetic testing confirmed the presence of a heterozygous pathogenic variant of the RASA1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome. This case illustrates an atypical presentation of the RASA1 associated CM-AVM syndrome, with the intracranial vascular malformation diagnosis preceding the identification of the skin lesions. Arterial aneurysms have been associated with CM-AVM syndrome in rare instances but to our knowledge this is the first reported case of an aneurysm of the basilar artery.

### Rasmussen's encephalitis: clinical features, pathobiology, and treatment advances [^78562b44]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Rasmussen's encephalitis is a rare chronic neurological disorder, characterised by unilateral inflammation of the cerebral cortex, drug-resistant epilepsy, and progressive neurological and cognitive deterioration. Neuropathological and immunological studies support the notion that Rasmussen's encephalitis is probably driven by a T-cell response to one or more antigenic epitopes, with potential additional contribution by autoantibodies. Careful analysis of the association between histopathology and clinical presentation suggests that initial damage to the brain is mediated by T cells and microglia, suggesting a window for treatment if Rasmussen's encephalitis can be diagnosed early. Advances in neuroimaging suggest that progression of the inflammatory process seen with MRI might be a good biomarker in Rasmussen's encephalitis. For many patients, families, and doctors, choosing the right time to move from medical management to surgery is a real therapeutic dilemma. Cerebral hemispherectomy remains the only cure for seizures, but there are inevitable functional compromises. Decisions of whether or when surgery should be undertaken are challenging in the absence of a dense neurological deficit, and vary by institutional experience. Further, the optimum time for surgery, to give the best language and cognitive outcome, is not yet well understood. Immunomodulatory treatments seem to slow rather than halt disease progression in Rasmussen's encephalitis, without changing the eventual outcome.

Post-hemispherotomy outcome

At Centre 1, 11/17 (65%; 7/12 [58%] with preoperative CEA, 4/5 [80%] without preoperative CEA) and at Centre 2, 28/37 (76%; 3/5 [60%] with preoperative CEA, 25/32 [78%] without preoperative CEA) were seizure-free after hemispherotomy. ILAE outcomes (1-2-3-4-5-6) at Centre 1 were 7-0-2-2-1-0/12 in cases with preoperative CEA (7 with ILAE outcome 1; 0 with ILAE outcome 2; 2 with ILAE outcome 3;…), and 4-0-1-0-0-0/5 in cases without preoperative CEA. At Centre 2, ILAE outcomes were 3-0-0-2-0-0/5 in preoperative CEA cases and 23-0-5-3-1-0/32 in cases without preoperative CEA. In a mixed-effects logistic regression model across both centres, becoming seizure-free after hemispherotomy was significantly less likely if CEA was present before surgery (OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50–0.95; P = 0.029). When analysing interictal and ictal patterns separately, postoperative seizure freedom was significantly less likely if preoperative contralesional interictal epileptiform discharges were present (OR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.50–0.98; P = 0.045), but not associated with preoperative contralesional ictal onset (OR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.57–1.45; P = 0.70). Contralesional interictal epileptiform discharges persisted in 6/12 (50%, Centre 1) and 2/34 (6%, Centre 2) of all hemispherotomy cases with postoperative EEG available.

A 15-year-old girl with a 3-year history of Rasmussen syndrome (RS) underwent left functional hemispherectomy by central disconnection. Clinical seizures then ceased. Five months postoperatively, ictal EEG discharges were associated with focal hyperperfusion on SPECT within the disconnected hypoperfused left hemisphere, suggesting that the basic mechanisms of RS may continue, only to remit later. EEG and SPECT may complement studies of these in seizure-free surgically treated patients in whom clinical follow-up may be unrevealing.

### Limited chronic focal encephalitis: another variant of rasmussen syndrome? [^5fc4ad83]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a more limited and less malignant form of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE).

Methods

Three subjects (all women; 37, 31, and 32 years of age) developed childhood or late onset chronic focal encephalitis, with a relatively nonprogressive form of the disorder.

Results

In our patients, clinical features were dominated by partial seizures without marked focal motor deficit and in two with choreo-dystonic movements. The diagnosis of RE was supported by histologic examination and anatomic and functional MRI.

Conclusions

These cases extend the phenotypic presentations of Rasmussen encephalitis and confirm Theodore Rasmussen's suggestion that there may be mild and nonprogressive forms of the disease.

### Rasmussen's encephalitis: structural, functional, and clinical correlates of contralesional epileptiform activity [^a4b1040d]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study indicates that postoperative seizures seem to be more likely when CEA is present preoperatively. CEA could be used as a marker for predicting postsurgical seizure freedom. It should not be dismissed that approximately a quarter of individuals with RE are not seizure-free postoperatively. As our data do not show the progression of CEA during the disease course, this may suggest that individuals with RE and CEA are less likely to benefit from surgery from the outset. This finding, however, needs to be validated in prospective cohorts.

On clinical grounds, neuropsychology demonstrates the functional relevance of CEA. It has previously been noted that mental impairment seems to correlate with the bilateral occurrence of EEG epileptic abnormalities in RE, which aligns with our results.

Regarding the neuropathological findings, it cannot be said with absolute confidence whether the lack of a group difference in inflammatory markers between individuals with and without CEA represents a lack of association or merely a sampling error. A brain biopsy in one of the contralesional regions indicated by the MRI analyses would be of utmost interest but cannot be ethically justified in typical, unilateral RE cases. In a recent case report of an individual with bilateral RE and bilateral imaging findings, biopsies were taken from the presumed inflammatory hotspots in both hemispheres. Twenty-five months after disease onset, inflammation indicative of RE was observed only in the primarily affected hemisphere. However, eighteen months later, histopathological findings consistent with RE were found in biopsies from both hemispheres. This demonstrates that RE-typical inflammation can indeed be present in both hemispheres.

Theodore Brown Rasmussen succeeded Wilder Penfield as director of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and held this post from 1960 to 1972. During his career, Rasmussen probably performed more operations for epilepsy than any other surgeon of his time; he became the foremost authority in this field. His meticulous follow-up analyses of the MNI seizure series provided substantial evidence for the success of surgery in the treatment of focal epilepsy. In addition, he made significant contributions to surgery of the pituitary gland for control of cancer, treatment of cerebral and spinal tumors, application of the intracarotid Amytal test for lateralization of speech and memory function, and characterization and treatment of epilepsy accompanied by chronic encephalitis, now referred to as Rasmussen syndrome. His painstaking attention to surgical details as well as his insistence on close monitoring of patient care and critical scrutiny of clinical results marked him as an outstanding teacher and role model for young neurosurgeons and neuroscientists.

Mixed effects logistic regression of contralesional epileptiform activity

In a sample-wise mixed-effects logistic regression model across both centres, the presence of CEA was significantly associated with a younger age at onset (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.83–0.97; P = 0.006), but not disease duration (OR = 1.0; 95% CI 0.95–1.1; P = 0.81) (Fig. 2 g). When analysing interictal and ictal patterns separately, both interictal epileptiform discharges (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.84–0.98; P = 0.011) and ictal onset (OR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.64–1.1; P = 0.19) were more likely with younger age at onset; however, the latter effect did not reach statistical significance. From this analysis, however, it cannot be said whether contralesional interictal or ictal patterns ooccur first.

We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery pseudoaneurysms of any size in patients of acceptable operative risk because of the possibility of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery true aneurysms > 2 cm, with a demonstrable increase in size, or with associated symptoms in patients of acceptable risk because of the risk of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). We suggest observation over intervention for small (< 2 cm), stable asymptomatic CAAs or those in patients with significant medical comorbidities or limited life expectancy. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA discovered at laparotomy, we suggest ligation if sufficient collateral circulation to the liver can be documented. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA diagnosed on preoperative imaging studies who are stable, we recommend treatment with open surgical or appropriate endovascular methods based on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). For the elective treatment of CAA, we suggest using an endovascular intervention if it is anatomically feasible; however, elective treatment may appropriately involve open surgical, endovascular, or laparoscopic methods of intervention, depending on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). To determine the need for revascularization of the celiac artery and its branches in treating CAA, we suggest evaluating the status of the superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery, and other relevant collateral circulation, which must be carefully documented on preoperative CTA or angiography. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We suggest screening patients with CAAs for other arterial aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). In patients in whom a CAA is being observed with a nonoperative or noninterventional approach, we suggest annual surveillance with CTA scans to assess for growth.

EEG findings in validation study

For the validation study at Centre 2, a total of 3503.2 EEG recording hours in 156 samples (37/156 post-hemispherotomy) were included, with a median of 46.5 EEG recording hours per subject. In sample-wise analysis of presurgical EEG, contralesional interictal epileptiform discharges were detected in 13/112 (12%) EEG samples with interictal epileptiform discharges (Fig. 2 c, yellow bars). Contralesional seizure onset was found in 4/79 (5%) EEG samples with seizure patterns (see Fig. 2 e). In case-wise analyses, CEA was found in 8/59 (14%) individuals (Fig. 2 d, f, yellow bars). There was no significant difference in total EEG recording hours between cases with CEA and those without CEA (U = 254, P = 0.27). The frequency distributions between both centres did not differ significantly about interictal epileptiform discharges (χ 2 (2) = 5.82; P = 0.055) and ictal onset (χ 2 (2) = 2.99; P = 0.22), but concerning abnormal interictal slowing (χ 2 (2) = 19.60; P < 0.001). The frequency distributions between the cohort from Centre 1 without adult-onset cases (childhood and adolescence cases only, onset < 19 years) and the cohort from Centre 2 only showed a trend-level difference regarding ictal onset (χ 2 (2) = 5.57, P = 0.062), but were significantly different concerning abnormal interictal slowing (χ 2 (2) = 13.90, P < 0.001) and interictal epileptiform discharges (χ 2 (2) = 12.65, P = 0.002).

### Evidence that a subset of aneurysms less than 7 mm warrant treatment [^b7c31d2a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple attempts to predict the hemodynamic characteristics of an aneurysm and to quantify the wall shear stress have been made throughout the literature by focusing on shape as a principal estimator. However, direct measurements of the pressure changes showed that it was independent of size, 33 suggesting that a subset of small aneurysms tend to rupture.

Discussion

Based on a dataset from two epilepsy centres, CEA was observed in almost half of the cases at Centre 1 and in less than a sixth at Centre 2. CEA was associated with younger age at disease onset, persisted after hemispherotomy, and was associated with an increased risk of unfavourable postsurgical seizure outcome. In the exploration study conducted at Centre 1, it was also related to altered morphometry in temporal and insular cortices, with lower intelligence and worse verbal memory.

Frequencies of EEG findings on a sample-wise level did not differ significantly in both centres. On a case-wise level, however, CEA was found in almost half of all individuals at Centre 1, but in less than a sixth at Centre 2. The discrepancy between centres may be explained by the lower number of EEGs per case at Centre 2. Another explanation for the difference is the study design: EEG findings were based on a detailed expert review of the raw data at Centre 1. Consensus was reached in case of disagreement, which can be regarded as an academic gold standard. In contrast, EEG findings were directly extracted from routine clinical reports at Centre 2, corresponding to daily clinical practice. In this reading, this difference suggests that subtle CEA may be overlooked in routine EEG assessments. To address this issue, it may be appropriate to analyse the raw EEG data objectively in future studies using computer-aided approaches.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) follow-up and surveillance — after open surgical reconstruction, we suggest completion imaging before hospital discharge using axial imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or arteriography in select cases, with long-term follow-up with surveillance imaging; for patients managed nonoperatively, we suggest annual surveillance imaging until two consecutive studies are stable, after which surveillance may be extended to every 2 to 3 years. The natural history shows slow to null growth, with recent estimates indicating a median annualized growth rate of 0.06 to 0.6 mm, and the largest multi-institutional retrospective series found no difference in growth rate based on aneurysm morphology or calcification.

### The evolution of intracranial aneurysm treatment techniques and future directions [^97a79bf4]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We summarized the available treatment options for IAs. The treatment should be approached in a multidisciplinary manner, taking into account the characteristics of the IA, patient's comorbidities, the patient's preferences, and the experience of the operator. The patient's condition at presentation plays an important role in the decision-making by experienced neurovascular surgeons and endovascular specialists. In certain complex IA cases, a single approach may be inadequate to completely treat it, and its successful treatment requires a combination of microsurgical and endovascular techniques. Ultimately, it is intended that this review will allow the reader to apply the best matched evidence to decide the best approach towards a particular lesion.

Severe focal epilepsy is regarded as a clinical hallmark of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). The authors report two children with progressive hemiparesis, contralateral hemispheric atrophy, and pathologic features characteristic for RE. At histologic diagnosis and over several months, neither patient experienced seizures. The report enlarges the clinical spectrum of RE and suggests that seizures are not an obligatory presenting symptom of the disorder.

### Intimal thickening of meningeal arteries after serial corticectomies for rasmussen encephalitis [^c3561fa5]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Rasmussen encephalitis is a rare cause of intractable epilepsy in children. Between 2008 and 2010, 4 patients had second cortical resections performed after a primary corticectomy for Rasmussen encephalitis. In each case, we observed some degree of vessel wall change in leptomeningeal arteries, consisting of moderate to moderately severe intimal hyperplasia. The intervals between original resection and second operation ranged from 8 months to 10 years. Ages of the patients ranged from 9 to 12 years at their first resection and from 10 to 19 years at the time of revision. Four other Rasmussen encephalitis cases operated upon in the years 2006 to 2010 and 2 surgical revisions for severe cortical dysplasia, 1 for mild cortical dysplasia and 1 for recurrent dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, did not show significant vascular abnormalities (with surgical intervals of 10 months to 16 years). Leptomeningeal intimal hyperplasia appears to develop in the interval between repeated cortical resections for Rasmussen encephalitis, an inflammatory disorder. The pathogenesis of this vascular change may be related to meningeal inflammation in Rasmussen encephalitis. This finding in children undergoing surgical resection for Rasmussen encephalitis may itself lead to "secondary" ischemic change that contributes to worsening of epilepsy.

### Endotension: what do we know and not know about this enigmatic complication of endovascular aneurysm repair [^f6ff98d5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

As the use of endovascular approaches to treat aneurysm repair continues to increase, more and more patients have been identified with endoleaks. Five types of endoleaks have been defined. Endotension, or type V endoleak, remains controversial owing to its variable definition across studies and the range of proposed treatments. Thus, we performed a review of the reported studies to summarize the diagnosis and treatment of this rare complication after endovascular aneurysm repair to determine what we do and do not know about this rare form of endoleak. The presence of an endoleak places patients at an increased risk of aneurysm sac enlargement and potential rupture. Although additional research is essential and yet difficult to perform, we sought to provide a guide for the management of this perplexing endoleak known as endotension.

### Endovascular management of fusiform aneurysms in the posterior circulation: the era of flow diversion [^0ac86aef]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

Fusiform aneurysms are uncommon compared with their saccular counterparts, yet they remain very challenging to treat and are associated with high rates of rebleeding and morbidity. Lack of a true aneurysm neck renders simple clip reconstruction or coil embolization usually impossible, and more advanced techniques are required, including bypass, stent-assisted coiling, and, more recently, flow diversion. In this article, the authors review posterior circulation fusiform aneurysms, including pathogenesis, natural history, and endovascular treatment, including the role of flow diversion. In addition, the authors propose an algorithm for treatment based on their practice.

### Theodore Brown rasmussen (1910–2002) [^82b45578]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

"We compared 100 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, who exhibited the running down phenomenon (i.e. postoperative seizures that eventually remit following a period of months to years) following temporal resections, with two groups of patients… We found a significant correlation between prognosis and the size of the epileptogenic area as defined".

Rasmussen's thorough epidemiological research program, which examined the plastic adaptation of the human cortex after removal of epileptic tissue, sustained his impact on medicine beyond his time as an active neurosurgeon and director of the MNI, while laying the basis for his legacy as an outstanding investigator and teacher in clinical neuroscience. During the first three postwar decades, Rasmussen had probably performed more operations for epilepsy than most contemporary neurosurgeons. He was a member of The Society of Neurological Surgeons since 1950, its president in 1970, and was eventually honoured with the Society's Distinguished Service Award in 1989. A number of his trainees later went on to head neurosurgery departments throughout North America. As a private man, Rasmussen was also a musician, playing both the clarinet and saxophone, and had used these talents already to supplement his allowance in his early medical school days. His colleagues and students warmly remember Rasmussen for his social amenability and educational talents:

"He was always precise and deliberate; rounds were conducted at a half-trot. His aphorisms became part of the mental fabric of all his trainees. 'Must not do that. Do not jiggle the brain', and 'Put up the side rails; the bed is high and the floor is hard', spring to mind. While not effusive in his manner, he was never unkind or sarcastic".

After the death of his wife in 1998, he relocated westward from Montreal in Quebec to be with his children in Calgary, Alberta, where he was frequently approached by members of the Calgary Pathology Department who asked for advice on histopathological specimens from patients with severe epilepsy and brain tumours. Theodore Rasmussen passed away in 2002.

Detailed justification — Pathophysiology and definitions in AV access aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms: After creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), hemodynamic forces in both the artery and the vein are altered, increasing vessel diameter, blood flow, and blood volume; outflow stenosis with increased intraluminal pressure, repeated cannulations, and genetic predisposition contribute to aneurysm formation. A true aneurysm is defined as a circumscribed dilation of all 3 layers of the vessel wall, whereas a pseudoaneurysm is an extraluminal "blood flow through" defect walled off by soft tissue, and in arterial circulation an aneurysm is defined as a vessel that is 1.5 times greater than the normal, expected blood vessel diameter.

Results

Clinical characteristics of exploration cohort at Centre 1

At Centre 1, 68 individuals with RE (39 female, 36 left-hemispheric focus, median onset seven years, range 1–51 years) met the diagnostic criteria for RE and were included in this study (Table 1). Brain biopsies that confirmed RE diagnosis were performed in 39/68 (57%) cases. All individuals, except for two, were treated with anti-seizure medication (median number of anti-seizure medication taken as monotherapy or in combinations in the past history 6, range 0–15). Fifty-nine subjects (87%) received at least one type of immunotherapy. Seventeen individuals (25%, median age at onset 5 years, range 2–11 years) underwent hemispherotomy, and postsurgical EEG data were available in 12 cases. No cases of incomplete disconnection were identified in the neuroradiological reviews of postoperative MRI.

Clinical characteristics of validation cohort at Centre 2

The validation cohort from Centre 2 consists of 59 individuals with RE (35 female, 33 left-hemispheric focus, median onset 6 years, range 2–14 years). Brain biopsies were performed in 12/59 (20%) subjects. All individuals were treated with anti-seizure medication (median number of anti-seizure medication 6, range 2–14). Fifty-three subjects (89%) received at least one type of immunotherapy. Thirty-seven individuals (63%, median age at onset 5 years, range 2–14 years) from London underwent hemispherotomy, with postsurgical EEG available in 34 cases. The use of anti-seizure medication (U = 1708.5, P = 0.86) and immunotherapy (χ 2 (1) = 0.29, P = 0.80) did not differ between both centres. Significantly more individuals were treated surgically at Centre 2 than at Centre 1 (χ 2 (1) = 16.9, P < 0.001).

### Brief history of surgical timing: surgery for ruptured intracranial aneurysms [^71278a94]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

The neurosurgical profession has taken a circuitous route to attain its current knowledge about timing for aneurysm surgery. While addressing the timing issue, neurosurgeons were beset by many pressures simultaneously. They were forced to justify not only optimal surgical techniques but the need for surgery at all in the treatment of ruptured aneurysms. The beliefs of surgeons with strong personalities, in addition to intuitive guesses, often served to guide surgery in the absence of scientific evidence. That any progress could be made against a background of desperately ill patients and frustrating early results is remarkable. The author briefly outlines the controversies and misdirection that accompanied this progress toward understanding surgical timing in the treatment of ruptured aneurysms.

After adjustment for baseline factors, increasing age, psychiatric illnesses, and increasing numbers of recurrent admissions within the year following AMI remained as independent determinants of poorer adherence to both statins and β-blockers, while prior evidence-based medication use within 6 months preceding the index AMI hospitalization was associated with improved adherence to these therapies. Figure 1 illustrates that the unadjusted relationship between adherence and mortality followed a dose-response–type adherence-mortality gradient for statins and β-blockers. However, there was no such adherence-mortality association with calcium channel blockers.

### De novo formation and rupture of an aneurysm. case report [^57cbe40d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

The authors describe a case of de novo formation and rupture of an aneurysm located at the junction of the left internal carotid artery and the superior hypophyseal artery in a middle-aged woman 2 months after another aneurysm, located on the anterior communicating artery, had been clipped. This case is rare because of the short interval between the last angiographic study performed at the first operation and the diagnosis of the de novo aneurysm; in this case the interval was only 47 days, compared with other cases in the literature in which the intervals were 3 to 34 years. Aneurysms can enlarge considerably in 2 to 4 weeks and can rupture at or soon after their formation. This case provides insight into aneurysm formation and rupture.

### Treatment of recurrent intracranial aneurysms after neck clipping: novel classification scheme and management strategies [^bef2ff87]. Operative Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Follow-up and Limitations

Unfortunately, the present report could not derive a rate of aneurysm recurrence after clipping, because the study defined a numerator but not a denominator. Without prospective long-term follow-up of clipped aneurysms over a broad population, the true rate of recurrence will remain unknown. The true etiology of aneurysm recurrence after complete neck clipping also remains unclear. However, a small but definite propensity toward recurrence clearly exists, and most recurrent aneurysms require some form of retreatment. Based on our experience with 23 patients, our follow-up protocol appears reasonable, and long follow-up exceeding 10 years is required for young, healthy patients. Particularly in patients with neck remnant or pre-existing diseases associated with cerebral aneurysms, more frequent follow-up may be necessary. Our novel classification is free of ambiguity and our algorithm is systematic and extremely practical for both pre- and intraoperative decision making. Although the appropriateness of our classification and algorithm needs to be evaluated in further studies with larger groups, we believe that this classification and accompanying algorithm will be theoretically comprehended and accepted by most neurosurgeons. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of management strategies using our classification on the outcomes for recurrent aneurysm.

Ethnicity and intracranial aneurysm wall composition

Although Japanese or Finnish ethnicity seems to be an important risk factor for aneurysmal disease, no systematic study comparing the effects of different ethnicities for aneurysmal wall composition has been done so far. Comparison of the various studies performed in cohorts from different ethnicities is difficult due to absence of a research consortium for the histological characterization of the IA wall. In Table 7, histological characterization of aneurysmal wall from Japanese, Finnish, and Swiss population is presented. Although there may be slight differences between the three cohorts, the overall comparison between these three studies on different ethnicities confirms once more that ruptured IAs present a more degenerative wall in comparison to the wall of unruptured IAs. The degeneration process affects first the endothelium, then the structure of the vascular wall and finally favors the progression of inflammation. However, even if the mechanisms of IA wall degeneration seem nearby between the three cohorts, cases selection, wall classification, and methods of histological quantifications are different between the cohorts which could reduce the chances to observe differences between ethnicities.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and rasmussen-like syndrome: an association? [^2c77b763]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an immune-mediated condition that has a broad spectrum of manifestations, including seizures, coma, psychosis, and focal neurological deficits. Although usually a diffuse process, unihemispheric involvement mimicking early stages of Rasmussen encephalitis can occur. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a unique syndrome characterized by progressive hemiplegia, drug-resistant focal epilepsy, cognitive decline, and hemispheric brain atrophy contralateral to the hemiplegia.

Patient Description

We describe a two-year-old girl with progressive right weakness and epilepsia partialis continua, concerning for early Rasmussen's encephalitis, who tested positive for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. She experienced complete clinical recovery after immunotherapy. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were absent at three weeks and again at one year after the first treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin.

Conclusions

There are few reports of Rasmussen-like encephalitis in individuals with anti-NMDA receptor antibody positivity. Thus the clinical significance of this association is yet to be determined. In addition, several other antibodies have been documented in individuals with Rasmussen encephalitis. The lack of a consistently reported antibody in Rasmussen encephalitis patients and the temporary nature of the anti-NMDA receptor antibody in our patient raise the following question: Is the presence of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies the cause of the symptoms or secondary to the pathogenic process?

### Evidence that a subset of aneurysms less than 7 mm warrant treatment [^57e8be82]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, larger size means higher risk, but small aneurysms need to be carefully evaluated by relying on different indicators. A multitude of studies have reported that a significant portion of SAHs have resulted from small aneurysms. 2, 11, 12, 62 A subset of small aneurysms < 5 to 7 mm may be highly unstable and warrant treatment, based on hemodynamic and inflammatory components. Future research is required to individualize aneurysm treatment based on age, anatomy, and possibly molecular/investigational imaging, instead of grouping all aneurysms together.

### Infratentorial MRI findings in rasmussen encephalitis suggest primary cerebellar involvement [^ff7c1482]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study morphometrically investigated the cerebellum in a large cohort of patients with RE. Although its results ground our suspicion of a primarily affected cerebellum, they remain fragmentary for the most obvious limitation — the inclusion of brain imaging data where brain biopsies and histologic analysis would be needed to ultimately claim inflammation in the cerebellum of patients with RE. The association between imaging markers and their structural underpinnings remains overly simplistic, and cerebellar brain biopsies are not available for evident reasons. These hurdles cannot be overcome by our study. Another limitation of this study are the inhomogeneous MRI acquisition protocols. However, although AIs and tract comparisons calculated in this study are within-subject measures and therefore unlikely to contain scanner-specific biases, the ICA approach we used was previously shown to robustly eliminate scanner-specific artifacts. Beyond that, the remaining VBM analysis did show comparable results when adjusting for different scanners and the use of 3D or T2-weighted data sets did not have a significant influence on the FLAIR intensity AIs. Last, despite our comparably large sample size, it has to be noted that our patient cohort stems from a single epilepsy center and possible sampling biases cannot be completely ruled out. Furthermore, tractography results lack statistical power due to a reduced number of patients providing diffusion data and should, therefore, be taken with caution.

Taken together, our analyses were both challenged by and indicative for the varying manifestations of the same disease. Thus, a crucial factor for a better understanding of RE might be the differentiation of possible disease subgroups showing distinct cerebral and cerebellar atrophy patterns. Together with recent studies showing seemingly contradictory volumetric changes on the contralesional cerebral hemisphere, the present work identified different patterns of cerebellar atrophy, suggests an ipsilesional cerebellar inflammation, and complements the picture of complex brain alterations in patients with RE, extending beyond the affected hemisphere.

### The charm of structural neuroimaging in insanity evaluations: guidelines to avoid misinterpretation of the findings [^f1405939]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Rule number 3. Not every brain abnormality leads to behavioural symptoms. The correlation between brain function and criminal behaviour is far from perfect. Although violent behaviour is more likely in patients with frontal lobe deficits than in patients with (for example) parietal or occipital deficits, not every patient with frontal lobe damage manifests violent behaviour. In addition to the famous case of Phineas Gage, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire should be considered. After being wounded in the right temporal lobe during World War I, Apollinaire became unaffectionate and indifferent to his girlfriend, his personality became defiant and nostalgic, and his work became darker — but he never manifested aggressive behaviour. Indeed, the brain is incredibly plastic, and different clinical conditions demonstrate that even large brain lesions may not lead to important behavioural deficits. An example is Rasmussen encephalopathy, a rare inflammatory brain disorder leading to the death of one hemisphere. To date, the only known effective treatment is a hemispherectomy. The literature reveals that if a hemispherectomy is performed during childhood, patients may not have severe neurologic sequelae. Rule number 3 has been violated in the case of Gianfranco Stevanin, as the defence attorney wrongly ascribed his violent behaviour to the frontal lobe deficit. This rule would help in minimizing confirmation bias, which describes the tendency of experts to reach conclusions that confirm what they already believe to be true.

### Rasmussen's encephalitis: structural, functional, and clinical correlates of contralesional epileptiform activity [^dbde661d]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is a rare immune-mediated brain disorder characterised by pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy and progressive unihemispheric brain atrophy with neurological deficits and cognitive decline. Since its first description, the unilateral occurrence of RE constitutes its most prominent characteristic. Hemispherectomy, the resection of the affected hemisphere or hemispherotomy, the disconnection of the hemisphere, are currently the only effective treatments. Its success rates support the theory of a strictly unilateral disease. The few existing studies involving EEG recordings in people with RE have repeatedly shown interictal epileptiform activity over the contralesional hemisphere, mainly in an advanced disease stage, and have been related to cognitive decline. One study reported interictal epileptiform activity over the contralesional hemisphere in 2/8 (25%) individuals 3–6 months after seizure onset but in 5/8 (62%) individuals 3–5 years after seizure onset. Its occurrence was predictive of a decline in full-scale IQ. Similarly, another study observed the development of contralateral epileptiform activity in 8/12 (66%) individuals after 2 months to 4 years. A third study found interictal epileptiform activity over the contralesional hemisphere in 15/49 (30%) individuals with RE and highlighted the discrepancy between unilateral neurologic signs, MRI, pathologic findings, and bilateral EEG abnormalities. The argument for RE as solely a unihemispheric disease lacks sufficient backing given the paucity of adequately powered EEG studies. Alternative suggestions point towards a potentially more diffuse process, not fully captured by MRI, but this needs confirmation.

We hypothesised that contralesional epileptiform activity has structural underpinnings and is functionally and clinically relevant. To examine this hypothesis, we assessed data from two major tertiary epilepsy centres in Europe. We aimed (i) to quantify EEG characteristics in people with RE based on a multimodal dataset, (ii) to link epileptiform EEG activity to MRI, histopathology, neuropsychology, and pre-and postoperative clinical indices, and (iii) to validate the EEG findings on an external dataset.

### Theodore Brown rasmussen (1910–2002) [^eb2b9afd]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment options for epilepsy had been markedly advanced in Germany by the Breslau neurologist Otfrid Foerster (1873–1941), with whom Penfield had learned his operative techniques during two research periods in 1928 and 1931. Upon returning from Europe, Penfield successfully developed a similar treatment centre in Montreal, where patients' cortices were neurophysiologically mapped and stimulated in intraoperative settings. Together with his mentor Penfield and a number of German-speaking émigré neuroscientists, among whom were Jerzy Olszewski (1913–1964) and Fred Andermann (b. 1930), Rasmussen succeeded in further developing neurological and operative treatment options for epilepsy. As a most versatile neurological surgeon, he later pioneered hemispherectomy as a curative therapy to suppress the cortical spread of pathologic activity in intractable epilepsy. This option became used in children whose brains were sufficiently plastic to adapt to the loss of half the cortex, allowing physiological functions to be relearned even after such a drastic operation.

Rasmussen's collaboration with Penfield culminated in the seminal work, "The Cerebral Cortex of Man", in which their intricate electrostimulatory and neurosurgical findings were published. Together with the Japanese–Canadian physician Juhn Atsuhi Wada (b. 1926), he further introduced intracarotid amobarbital tests for the functional lateralization of speech and memory, a research approach that was complementary with Rasmussen's efforts to preserve function when removing damaged neural tissue in epileptic patients. In addition, he was a pioneer in pituitary gland surgery and also performed innovative operations in patients with cerebral and spinal tumours. Through his compilations of large data-sets that documented the outcome of epilepsy surgery, Rasmussen explored the efficiency of his surgical techniques, while also characterizing the histopathology of chronic encephalitis in several conditions:

### Rasmussen's encephalitis: structural, functional, and clinical correlates of contralesional epileptiform activity [^38c93f01]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Progressive inflammation of one hemisphere characterises Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE), but contralesional epileptiform activity has been repeatedly reported. We aimed to quantify contralesional epileptiform activity in RE and uncover its functional and structural underpinnings. We retrospectively ascertained people with RE treated between 2000 and 2018 at a tertiary centre (Centre 1) and reviewed all available EEG datasets. The temporal occurrence of preoperative contralesional epileptiform activity (interictal/ictal) was evaluated using mixed-effects logistic regression. Cases with/without contralesional epileptiform activity were compared for cognition, inflammation (ipsilesional brain biopsies), and MRI (cortical and fixel-based morphometry). EEG findings were validated in a second cohort treated at another tertiary centre (Centre 2) between 1995 and 2020. We included 127 people with RE and 687 EEG samples. Preoperatively, contralesional epileptiform activity was seen in 30/68 (44%, Centre 1) and 8/59 (14%, Centre 2). In both cohorts, this activity was associated with younger onset age (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.83–0.97; P = 0.006). At centre 1, contralesional epileptiform activity was associated with contralesional MRI alterations, lower intelligence (OR = 5.19; 95% CI 1.28–21.08; P = 0.021), and impaired verbal memory (OR = 10.29; 95% CI 1.97–53.85; P = 0.006). After hemispherotomy, 11/17 (65%, Centre 1) and 28/37 (76%, Centre 2) were seizure-free. Contralesional epileptiform activity was persistent postoperatively in 6/12 (50%, Centre 1) and 2/34 (6%, Centre 2). Preoperative contralesional epileptiform activity reduced the chance of postoperative seizure freedom in both cohorts (OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.50–0.95; P = 0.029). Our findings question the concept of strict unilaterality of RE and provide the evidence of contralesional epileptiform activity as a possible EEG predictor for persisting postoperative seizures.

Introduction

Giant cerebral aneurysms (> 25 mm) may be treated via endovascular or microsurgical means, with each approach having its own benefits, risks and technical challenges. They represent an extremely complicated subset of aneurysm pathology. Giant aneurysms may require a multimodal approach combining both endovascular and microsurgical approaches to achieve the best possible outcomes.

In patients who are thought to have RAA and have increased radiation exposure risks or renal insufficiency, we recommend non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to establish the diagnosis (Grade 1C). Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and women of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA contrast materials. If preoperative planning and recognition of distal renal artery branches cannot be adequately assessed on conventional cross-sectional imaging (CTA), we recommend the use of catheter-based angiography.

### Seizure outcomes in children with rasmussen's encephalitis undergoing resective or hemispheric epilepsy surgery: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^7f5f42b7]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis to identify preoperative factors associated with a good seizure outcome in children with Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) undergoing resective or hemispheric epilepsy surgery.

Methods

Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) were searched with no language or date restrictions to identify cohort studies of consecutive participants undergoing resective surgery that reported seizure outcomes. The authors recorded all preoperative factors that could plausibly be associated with seizure outcomes and used Cox regression analysis to identify which of these variables were associated with seizure freedom (i.e. Engel class I).

Results

Of 720 citations, 19 articles reporting on 187 participants were eligible. Seizure freedom (Engel class I) was observed in 113 participants (60.4%). On univariate analyses, younger age at disease onset (hazard ratio [HR] 0.906, p = 0.001), younger age at surgery (HR 0.928, p < 0.001), shorter time to surgery (HR 0.921, p = 0.001), and hemispherectomy (HR 0.283, p < 0.001) were all associated with longer time to postoperative seizure recurrence. Additionally, multivariable analysis including the aforementioned variables showed that younger age at surgery (HR 0.946, p = 0.043) and hemispherectomy (HR 0.297, p < 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with a greater time to seizure recurrence and longer duration of seizure freedom.

Conclusions

The majority of pediatric patients undergoing resective or hemispheric surgery for RE achieve good seizure outcome. Although small retrospective cohort studies are inherently prone to bias, the best available evidence utilizing individual participant data suggests hemispheric surgery and younger age at surgery are associated with good seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery. Large, multicenter observational studies with long-term follow-up are required to evaluate the risk factors identified in this review.

### Infratentorial MRI findings in rasmussen encephalitis suggest primary cerebellar involvement [^1d56feb8]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The processes behind the lower volume in both the ipsilesional cerebellar GM and WM at the group level, the ipsilesional components resulting from the ICA, and the strongly asymmetric ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy in individual patients are more enigmatic. Cerebellar atrophy, ipsilesional to the cerebral focus, has been reported anecdotally before; however, the reason for this remained unknown. In this study, particularly strong correlations of FLAIR intensity AIs, indicative of possible asymmetrical inflammatory processes in the cerebellum, and morphometric AIs can be found for patients with predominantly ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy. Hyperintensities in FLAIR images of patients with ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy, correlating with the severity of volumetric damage, strongly promote that the inflammation in RE is not restricted to the cerebrum but can further spread in the brainstem and even enter the ipsilesional cerebellum. A primary cerebellar inflammation in a patient diagnosed with RE has not been reported so far, but an involvement of the ipsilesional brainstem has been. Moreover, in a 1984 report, the authors presented an autopsied patient who died at age 7, which retrospectively allowed the diagnosis of RE (case 5). Of interest, the brain autopsy of this patient not only showed atrophy and inflammation in the cerebrum but also revealed ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy and inflammation within the ipsilesional brainstem and cerebellum. Furthermore, a recent study on unilateral relapsing primary angiitis of the CNS, which shares RE's characteristical unilateral brain involvement, discussed the possibility that both conditions might be related and could lie in the same disease spectrum. Of interest, an ipsilesional cerebellar or brainstem involvement was also found in 2 of 3 patients. In our data set, age at disease onset and morphometric AIs only correlated in patients with predominant ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy in the sense that a later disease onset was associated with a stronger asymmetry. This is noteworthy, as published patients with RE showing ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy are associated with a concomitant, uncommon occipital disease focus, which in turn has also been associated with later disease onset. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesized primary cerebellar inflammation explaining both the here quantitatively assessed and the previously reported ipsilesional cerebellar atrophy in RE. This may suggest an elevated risk of motor and nonmotor cerebellar functional abnormalities in patients with RE, which, in the future, need to be systematically assessed, for example, by using the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) score and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS)/Schmahmann scale, respectively.

### Rasmussen syndrome and long-term response to thalidomide [^2dd7eeb4]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

We report a 13-year-old female who experienced symptoms and signs of Rasmussen encephalitis for the first time at the age of 5 years. Various therapeutic procedures, including conventional and new antiepileptic drugs, steroids, immunoglobulin, plasma exchanges, and partial hemispherectomy, were applied, but their results were unsatisfactory. During one of the exacerbations, when the patient's life was endangered, thalidomide was administered. Frequency and intensity of epileptic seizures were reduced significantly, and the quality of her life improved. Except for moderate neutropenia, the other adverse effects were not recognized. In our opinion, thalidomide is not a first-choice drug for Rasmussen encephalitis but is a good alternative only for cases refractory to other well-known and accepted therapeutic procedures.

CONCLUSION

While important to consider the biological behavior of flow diversion for complex and giant intracranial aneurysms, it is also pertinent to consider the potential role of PRS in the incidence of neurovascular disease when applicable. More research into the effect of PRS on cerebral vasculature and subsequently aneurysm formation is needed. A better understanding of these mechanisms may elucidate the nature of aneurysms in the pediatric population, improve treatment, and determine the clinical importance of intracranial aneurysms in differential diagnoses and continued long-term follow-up in PRS cases.

### Management of intracranial aneurysms associated with arteriovenous malformations [^2d0adcdb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Intracranial or brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are some of the most interesting and challenging lesions treated by the cerebrovascular neurosurgeon. It is generally believed that the combination of BAVMs and intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is associated with higher hemorrhage rates at presentation and higher rehemorrhage rates and thus with a more aggressive course and natural history. There is wide variation in the literature on the prevalence of BAVM-associated aneurysms (range 2.7%-58%), with 10%-20% being most often cited in the largest case series. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with unruptured BAVMs and coexisting IAs has been reported to be 7% annually, compared with 2%-4% annually for those with BAVM alone. Several different classification systems have been applied in an attempt to better understand the natural history of this combination of lesions and implications for treatment. Independent of the classification used, it is clear that a few subtypes of aneurysms have a direct hemodynamic correlation with the BAVM itself. This is exemplified by the fact that the presence of a distal flow-related or an intranidal aneurysm appears to be associated with an increased hemorrhage risk, when compared with an aneurysm located on a vessel with no direct supply to the BAVM nidus. Debate still exists regarding the etiology of the association between those two vascular lesions, the subsequent implications for patients' risk of hemorrhagic stroke, and finally the determination of which patients warrant treatment and when. The ultimate goals of the treatment of a BAVM associated with an IA are to prevent hemorrhage, avoid stepwise neurological deterioration, and eliminate the mortality risk associated with recurrent hemorrhagic events. The treatment is only justifiable if the risks associated with an intervention are lower than or equivalent to the long-term risks of disability or mortality caused by the lesion itself. When faced with this difficult decision, a few questions need to be answered by the treating neu-rosurgeon: What is the mode of presentation? What is the symptomatic lesion? Which one of the lesions bled? What is the relationship between the BAVM and IA? Is it possible to safely treat both BAVM and IA? The objective of this review is to discuss the demographics, natural history, classification, and strategies for management of BAVMs associated with IAs.

### Treatment of recurrent intracranial aneurysms after neck clipping: novel classification scheme and management strategies [^7ac008b1]. Operative Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

The main goal in the treatment of cerebral aneurysm is complete obliteration of the aneurismal sac and neck. Surgical clipping is a useful option for achieving this goal, but aneurysm recurrence after initial clipping remains an important issue. The frequency of aneurysm recurrence after complete clipping is difficult to determine, but has been reported as about 0.02% to 0.52% annually. - To date, surgical clipping, endovascular coil embolization, combined surgery, and other methods have been applied for the treatment of lesions.- Surgical treatment for recurrence of a previously clipped aneurysm is one of the most difficult procedures in aneurysm surgery. Such surgery is not only technically difficult due to issues such as surgical-site adhesions, but also difficult in terms of decision making. We describe our experience with recurrent aneurysms after neck clipping, and discuss the management of this entity. Analysis of the anatomical characteristics of recurrent aneurysms led to a novel classification scheme, with type-specific management recommendations for this diverse and potentially treacherous collection of aneurysms.

Other Syndromes

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I (Adachi et al.), Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (Allison et al; Bock and Schwegler; Munyer and Margulis), and Herediatary Hemorrahagic Telangiectasia (HHT) (Willemse et al.) are often mentioned as being associated with IBA. While all have had individual patient case reports which document the presence of intracranial aneurysms, these data are not as robust as are the data for the syndromes listed above and in Table 3. Specific recommendations for IBA screening in these disorders must await larger cohort studies, though in the case of HHT, the currently-recommended screening protocols to detect cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) would be expected to detect IBA as well (McDonald and Pyeritz). Most frequently in HHT patients intracranial aneurysms form along arteries leading into AVM (Willemse et al.). Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are also believed to be at risk for aneurysms in the brain and elsewhere, so current recommendations are that all FMD patients have cross-sectional imaging from head to pelvis with a sensitive method like CTA or MRA (Kadian-Dodov et al.). Though autosomal dominant inheritance has been suggested for fibromuscular dysplasia, definitive genetic candidates have yet to emerge (Kiando et al.). Moyamoya angiopathy, which is also associated with NF1 (Koss et al.), appears to have a pathogenesis that is distinct from that of intracranial berry aneurysms; it is not clear whether the occasional association of intracranial aneurysms with moyamoya (Kawaguchi et al; Yu et al.) reflects a common pathophysiology at the molecular level, or whether it reflects pathology at one vascular site that perturbs downstream hemodynamics.
