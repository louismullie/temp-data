## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents to the nephrology clinic after an abdominal ultrasound performed for vague flank pain reveals a 4 cm mass in the right kidney, suspected to be an angiomyolipoma. She has a history of epilepsy and facial angiofibromas. The nephrologist suspects a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).

According to current expert guidelines, what specific renal function assessment should be performed in this patient with suspected tuberous sclerosis and a newly identified renal angiomyolipoma?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what specific renal function assessment should be performed in a 28-year-old woman with suspected tuberous sclerosis complex and a newly identified 4 cm renal angiomyolipoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnostic context and why renal function assessment matters in TSC. Then, I should verify the exact guideline-recommended test and how to calculate eGFR. Next, I will consider adjunctive assessments like blood pressure and proteinuria. After that, I should review the rationale for annual surveillance and how this 4 cm lesion influences management. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and its implications. Suspected TSC with a 4 cm angiomyolipoma places the patient at risk for renal complications including hemorrhage, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, so establishing a baseline renal function is essential for surveillance and treatment planning [^c1d5d226] [^8973ddbf].

> I need to check the exact guideline directive. The 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference explicitly recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to evaluate renal function in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed TSC, and to repeat renal function and blood pressure assessment at least annually thereafter [^889697b6] [^c9361d52] [^d8ee397f].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical method for GFR assessment. The consensus recommends blood tests to determine GFR using creatinine-based equations, with MDRD for adults and the bedside Schwartz formula for children; alternatively, serum cystatin C can be used to estimate GFR, which is particularly helpful when creatinine may be misleading due to muscle mass or other factors [^a73da5ae].

> Wait, let me verify the adjunctive elements I should include. Accurate blood pressure measurement is recommended at diagnosis and at least annually because TSC-associated renal disease increases the risk of secondary hypertension, and proteinuria should be screened given its prognostic significance and the potential for mTOR inhibitor–related proteinuria during therapy [^cf671499] [^c9361d52] [^4270fb1b].

> I should confirm the surveillance cadence and how this 4 cm lesion fits. Annual assessment of renal function and blood pressure is advised, while abdominal MRI every 1–3 years is recommended to monitor angiomyolipoma progression and cystic disease; importantly, asymptomatic angiomyolipomas larger than 3 cm warrant consideration of mTOR inhibitor therapy as first-line to reduce hemorrhage risk and preserve renal parenchyma, which makes the baseline eGFR even more critical for treatment decisions and monitoring [^c9361d52] [^6a43c06c] [^efda174e] [^67cf19f2].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. The specific renal function assessment recommended at diagnosis of suspected TSC is to obtain a serum creatinine and calculate the estimated GFR using the MDRD equation for adults, with consideration of cystatin C if creatinine-based eGFR is unreliable; concurrently, measure blood pressure accurately and screen for proteinuria, then repeat renal function and blood pressure at least annually thereafter [^889697b6] [^a73da5ae] [^cf671499] [^c9361d52].

---

In patients with suspected TSC and a newly identified renal angiomyolipoma, **annual assessment of renal function (eGFR) and blood pressure** is recommended [^c9361d52] [^d8ee397f]. At baseline, obtain **serum creatinine with eGFR calculation** (MDRD or CKD-EPI) [^a73da5ae] and a **urinalysis for proteinuria**, as these guide risk stratification and management decisions [^notfound]. MRI is the preferred modality to characterize the lesion and detect additional renal involvement [^11467c2c] [^483c2a8b]. Repeat eGFR and blood pressure at least yearly, and monitor the angiomyolipoma with MRI every 1–3 years [^c9361d52] [^6a43c06c].

## Recommended renal function assessment

### Baseline assessment

- **Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)**: Calculate eGFR using the MDRD or CKD-EPI equations to establish baseline renal function [^a73da5ae] [^4270fb1b].

- **Urinalysis**: Screen for proteinuria, as it is a marker of renal involvement and may influence management decisions [^4270fb1b].

- **Blood pressure measurement**: Accurate blood pressure assessment is essential due to the increased risk of secondary hypertension in TSC patients [^cf671499] [^38b111a7].

---

### Follow-up assessment

Annual **eGFR and blood pressure monitoring** should be performed to detect early renal impairment or hypertension [^c9361d52] [^d8ee397f]. Repeat **urinalysis** is indicated if proteinuria is detected initially or if renal function declines.

---

## Imaging modalities for renal angiomyolipoma

MRI is the **preferred imaging modality** for characterizing renal angiomyolipomas and detecting additional lesions, such as renal cysts or polycystic kidney disease, which are common in TSC [^11467c2c] [^483c2a8b]. Ultrasound may be used for initial screening or in patients who cannot undergo MRI, but it may miss smaller or fat-poor lesions [^7a393850]. CT is an alternative when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, but it involves radiation exposure and may miss fat-poor lesions [^a73da5ae].

---

## Frequency of renal function assessment

Annual **eGFR and blood pressure monitoring** is recommended for all patients with TSC, regardless of lesion size or symptoms [^c9361d52] [^d8ee397f]. MRI every 1–3 years is advised to monitor lesion progression and detect new lesions [^6a43c06c] [^94636037].

---

## Clinical implications of renal function assessment

Renal function assessment in TSC patients with renal angiomyolipoma has **important clinical implications**:

- **Risk stratification**: Baseline renal function and blood pressure help stratify patients into risk categories, guiding management decisions [^6b5848aa].

- **Treatment decisions**: Impaired renal function or hypertension may influence the choice of therapy, such as mTOR inhibitors or embolization [^efda174e] [^67cf19f2].

- **Monitoring treatment response**: Regular renal function assessment allows for early detection of treatment-related renal toxicity or disease progression [^4270fb1b].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Assessment** | **Frequency** | **Method** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum creatinine and eGFR | Annually | Blood test |
| Urinalysis | Baseline, then as indicated | Urine test |
| Blood pressure | Annually | Accurate measurement |
| MRI | Every 1–3 years | Imaging |

---

In patients with suspected TSC and a newly identified renal angiomyolipoma, **annual assessment of renal function (eGFR) and blood pressure** is recommended, with baseline serum creatinine, eGFR calculation, urinalysis, and MRI to characterize the lesion and detect additional renal involvement [^c9361d52] [^11467c2c].

Kidney

For asymptomatic, growing angiomyolipoma measuring larger than 3 cm in diameter, treatment with an mTOR inhibitor is currently recommended as the most effective first-line therapy in the short term. The demonstrated tolerability so far to date is far preferable to the renal damage caused by angiomyolipoma progression as well as surgical and embolitic/ablative therapies, though studies are still needed to confirm long-term benefits and safety. (Category 1)

Annual clinical assessment of renal function and hypertension is required. Blood pressure control is also critical, so accurate measurement of blood pressure for patients is crucial, using age-specific criteria for children. Patients with hypertension should be treated with an inhibitor of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system as first line therapy, but avoiding an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in those treated with an mTOR inhibitor. (Category 1)

Imaging to diagnose polycystic disease, renal cell carcinoma or other tumors, and changes in angiomyolipoma should also be performed. MRI, often obtainable at the same time as brain surveillance imaging, is the preferred imaging modality, but if MRI is not available, CT or US can still provide useful information. Selective embolization followed by corticosteroids, kidney-sparing resection, or ablative therapy for exophytic lesions are acceptable second-line therapy for asymptomatic angiomyolipomata. For acute hemorrhage, embolization followed by corticosteroids is more appropriate. Nephrectomy is to be avoided because of the high incidence of complications and increased risk of future renal insufficiency, end-stage renal failure, and the poor prognosis that results from chronic kidney disease. Fat-poor angiomyolipomata are not uncommon in patients with TSC, but if there is doubt and lesions are growing faster than 0.5 cm per year, a needle biopsy using a sheath technique or an open biopsy may be considered.

### Treatment of renal angiomyolipoma and other hamartomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex [^e36bf9cf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by growth of benign tumors (hamartomas) in multiple organs, especially the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, and skin. Tuberous sclerosis complex is usually caused by a mutation in either the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or tuberous sclerosis complex 2 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Currently, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors are recommended in adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex for the treatment of asymptomatic, growing renal angiomyolipoma that are > 3 cm in diameter and pediatric or adult patients with brain lesions (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) that either are growing or are not amenable to surgical resection. Clinical evidence suggests that systemic administration of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may provide concurrent improvements in multiple lesions and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex. With the major paradigm shift in consensus guidelines toward screening at diagnosis and ongoing monitoring and with the recent availability of an effective oral treatment, it is important that nephrologists have a thorough understanding of our role in the management of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Because the various manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex typically emerge at different periods during patients' lifetimes, patients will need to be followed throughout their lives. Unlike brain and cardiac lesions, renal lesions are more likely to emerge as patients age and can grow at any time. Considerations regarding long-term medication administration for the potential control of multiple tuberous sclerosis complex manifestations will need to be addressed; these include the most appropriate starting dose, appropriate doses for tumor shrinkage versus prevention of regrowth, and management of adverse events. Best practices and potential obstacles for nephrologists treating patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who have multiple manifestations are considered.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a complex childhood disorder characterised by the formation of hamartomas in multiple organs. Annual review of this disease is recommended to monitor the development of complications. We aim to provide a concise, evidence-based framework to assist clinicians during this annual review. We focus on the following areas: (A) what questions need to be asked during annual review, (B) which areas need emphasis on examination, (C) when is an investigation required and (D) referral to tertiary specialists and other members of the multidisciplinary team. It should also be noted that there are ongoing debates regarding screening intervals in certain areas. These include the frequency, modality of screening and degree of intervention for astrocytomas and renal angiomyolipomas. This review seeks to summarise the product of the ongoing debates, and provide evidence-based suggestions in light of the uncertainty.

Ongoing surveillance and management recommendations for individuals previously diagnosed with TSC

Once the diagnosis of TSC is established and initial diagnostic evaluations completed, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor progression of known problems or lesions and emergence of new ones (Table 3). Some manifestations begin in childhood and are less likely to be present or cause new problems in adulthood, such as cardiac rhabdomyomas or subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. In contrast, problems with LAM are typically limited to adults, and renal manifestations require significantly more monitoring and intervention in adulthood compared with childhood because of the cumulative nature of angiomyolipomata and other renal lesions. Finally, other aspects of TSC may be present throughout the entire lifespan of the individual, such as epilepsy and TAND, but specific manifestations and impact on overall health and quality of life can vary. Thus, ongoing periodic surveillance is needed after initial diagnosis for optimal care and prevention of secondary complications associated with TSC. Management of specific complications of TSC will often require input from a multidisciplinary team.

Genetics

Genetic testing and counseling should be offered to individuals with TSC when they reach reproductive age, and first-degree relatives of affected individuals should be offered clinical assessment and, where a mutation has been identified in the index case, genetic testing. (Category 1)

Brain

Symptomatic SEGA or SEGA associated with increasing ventricular enlargement, or with unexplained changes in neurological status or TAND symptoms, require intervention or more frequent clinical monitoring and reimaging. For acutely symptomatic individuals, surgical resection is the recommended intervention, and cerebrospinal fluid diversion may also be necessary. For growing but otherwise asymptomatic SEGA, either surgical resection or medical therapy with mTOR inhibitors can be effective. Shared decision-making with the patients or their parents in selecting the best treatment option should take the following considerations into account: risk of complications or adverse effects, cost of treatment, expected length of treatment, and potential impact on TSC comorbidities. Patients with unilateral, single, gross total resectable SEGA without individual risk factors or other comorbidities preferentially may benefit from surgery, whereas patients with multisystem disease or multiple or infiltrating SEGA lesions that are not amenable to gross total resection may favor mTOR inhibitor treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The methods of TOSCA have been described in detail previously. In short, TOSCA is a multicentre, international disease registry conducted at 170 sites across 31 countries worldwide. Between August 2012 and August 2014, patients of any age with a documented clinic visit for TSC in the preceding 12 months or newly diagnosed with TSC were enrolled.

In the TOSCA registry, general information on patient background such as demographic data, family history, genotype, vital signs, prenatal history, clinical features of TSC across all organ systems, comorbidities and rare manifestations were collected at baseline and at regular visits scheduled at a maximum interval of 1 year to ensure an ongoing data stream.

Data specific to renal angiomyolipoma included physical tumour characteristics (multiple, bilateral, lesion size and growing lesions), clinical signs and symptoms and management. The effects of age, gender and genotype on the prevalence of renal angiomyolipoma were also evaluated. Mean age of angiomyolipoma diagnosis at baseline were compared between patients with TSC1 and TSC2 mutations using Z test, while Chi-square test was used to analyze association between genotype and renal characteristics (such as history of angiomyolipoma, lesion > 3 cm, growing angiomyolipoma, patients with/without signs or symptoms, or treatment received by patients) at baseline. This is an observational study, and therefore no additional clinical or laboratory assessments/interventions were performed other than those required for disease surveillance or management according to the local best practice.

As the registry is observational in nature, results are reported with descriptive statistics only. All eligible patients enrolled in the TOSCA registry were considered in the analysis. Continuous variables were evaluated quantitatively (e.g. frequency, mean, standard deviation, median, range), and categorical variables (e.g. presence/absence of a manifestation) were analysed in terms of frequency distribution at baseline and at follow-up.

This study was designed and conducted according to the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consents were obtained from all patients, parents or guardians prior to enrolment with prior endorsement by the local human research ethics committee.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^90b47a53]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC is mainly focused on preventing acute events, preserving renal parenchyma and maintaining kidney function. A surprisingly high rate (34.6%) of patients had lesions > 3 cm in diameter, a size where active intervention is recommended. Embolization is the preferred therapy for renal angiomyolipoma presenting with acute haemorrhage, while mTOR inhibitors are the recommended first-line therapy for asymptomatic growing angiomyolipoma lesions ≥ 3 cm in diameter. Overall, patients with renal angiomyolipoma in our study were most commonly treated with embolization followed by mTOR inhibitors. This balance may change with the expanding use of mTOR inhibitors in younger populations, an important question for this ongoing cohort study to address.

The 2012 International TSC Consensus Group recommends that nephrectomy should be avoided in patients with TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma. However, there was a high rate of nephrectomy in patients in the TOSCA cohort (20%). When treatment modalities used were stratified by age of patients, mTOR inhibitors were the most common treatment modality in patients aged ≤ 18 years while embolization and nephrectomy was more common in patients aged > 18 years. As stated, mTOR inhibitor therapy is now the recommended first-line treatment for pre-symptomatic angiomyolipoma and our cohort data included historical treatment in older patients. Renal malignancy has been reported in about 2–4% patients with TSC, which is much higher than that reported in a comparable age group in the general population. However, the occurrence rate of renal malignancy observed in this cohort was lower (1.1%) than that reported previously. However, we need to consider that the rate of malignancy was calculated based on patients who survived at the time of analysis.

Endpoints and assessments

In EXIST-1, the primary endpoint was SEGA response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in SEGA volume (in the absence of worsening of nontarget SEGAs, new lesions ≥ 1 cm in diameter and new or worsening hydrocephalus). Secondary endpoints included time to and duration of SEGA response, renal angiomyolipoma response rate (proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in renal angiomyolipoma volume) and safety.

In EXIST-2, the primary endpoint was the renal angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the sum of volumes of all target renal angiomyolipoma lesions (in the absence of new target lesions > 20% increase from nadir in kidney volume or Grade ≥ 2 renal angiomyolipoma-related bleeding). Secondary endpoints included time to and duration of renal angiomyolipoma response, time to progression and safety.

In both studies, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatinine levels were assessed at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 18, then every 3 months thereafter. Protein was assessed by urine dipstick by the investigator at baseline and study visits at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Results were confirmed by a central laboratory in the event of relevant abnormalities. eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for patients ≥ 18 years of age or the 'bedside' Schwartz formula in those < 18 years. Creatinine and proteinuria were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0.

### Clinical practice recommendations for kidney involvement in tuberous sclerosis complex: a consensus statement by the ERKNet working group for autosomal dominant structural kidney disorders and the ERA genes&kidney working group [^6b5848aa]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of proliferative lesions throughout the body. Management of TSC is challenging because patients have a multifaceted systemic illness with prominent neurological and developmental impact as well as potentially severe kidney, heart and lung phenotypes; however, every organ system can be involved. Adequate care for patients with TSC requires a coordinated effort involving a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and support staff. This clinical practice recommendation was developed by nephrologists, urologists, paediatric radiologists, interventional radiologists, geneticists, pathologists, and patient and family group representatives, with a focus on TSC-associated kidney manifestations. Careful monitoring of kidney function and assessment of kidney structural lesions by imaging enable early interventions that can preserve kidney function through targeted approaches. Here, we summarize the current evidence and present recommendations for the multidisciplinary management of kidney involvement in TSC.

Background

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by benign tumours that can affect all organs (brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, and skin) at different stages in life. It is caused by mutations in the TSC 1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC 2 gene on chromosome 16. Epilepsy, neurocognitive impairments, autism, and dysfunctional renal and pulmonary organ systems are common symptoms.

Patients with TSC are at risk of suboptimal medical management for several reasons. First, it is a relatively rare disease affecting 1/6000 to 1/10000 live births. Therefore, some physicians may not be very well conversant with the disease, and this may result in late diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Second, as TSC is a multisystem disease affecting many organs, coordinated follow-up is necessary from different medical specialties including neurology, paediatrics, genetics, nephrology, urology, dermatology, pneumology, and imaging. Third, TSC is a chronic, lifelong disease, and thus requires a transition in care from the paediatric department to the adult department. During such a transition, there is a risk that important information might be mislaid and follow-up and management might suffer. Fourth, the clinical manifestations of TSC are highly variable, some mild forms of TSC may be found in adults with no particular history, and therefore may not be properly diagnosed or managed by general practitioners. Fifth, intellectual disability (ID) occurs in about half of TSC patients, and may be a barrier to diagnosis and optimal care.

These challenges make it important that TSC patients and their families receive correct and appropriate information on symptoms, with surveillance and access to potential treatments throughout life. This is particularly true for renal manifestations of TSC that tend to increase during adolescence. These manifestations vary considerably between patients and are the leading cause of TSC-related deaths in adults. TSC-associated renal manifestations include occurrence of renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), cysts, and carcinomas, and occur in 48–85% of patients. Spontaneous bleeding of an AML is one of the most serious renal complications, and, at worst, may be life-threatening, potentially necessitating emergency nephrectomy. Although the causes of AML bleeding are not well understood, the risk increases with AML size, and several guidelines recommend renal imaging every one to 3 years to monitor AML growth and to trigger prophylactic treatment for those AML considered to be at risk of bleeding.

### Microscopic kidney disease in tuberous sclerosis complex and treatment with mTOR inhibition [^dd31532f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Declining kidney function in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is often attributed to large lesions, including angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and cysts, that encroach on the normal parenchyma or that require intervention and loss of parenchyma from surgical debulking or embolization. Consequently, research on inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein complex implicated in TSC pathophysiology for its role in promoting cell growth and proliferation, has largely focused on their ability to reduce AML size. Clinical guidelines distilled from this research limit mTOR inhibition as a first-line treatment to patients with large AMLs. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in patients without large AMLs or a history of renal intervention. Alternate mechanisms postulated for CKD in TSC may suggest a role for mTOR inhibition in this population. In this report, we present 2 cases of a microscopic variant of TSC kidney disease causing declining kidney function, as well as anecdotal evidence for the use of mTOR inhibition to improve kidney function in the absence of large AMLs. We highlight the importance of annual kidney function assessment in patients with TSC and suggest a low threshold for kidney biopsy in patients with declining glomerular filtration rate without a clear etiology clinically or radiographically.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^8973ddbf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal angiomyolipoma occurs at a high frequency in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is associated with potentially life-threatening complications. Despite this frequency and severity, there are no large population-based cohort studies. Here we present baseline and follow-up data of the international TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) with an aim to provide detailed clinical characteristics of renal angiomyolipoma among patients with TSC.

Methods

Patients of any age with a documented clinic visit for TSC within 12 months or who were newly diagnosed with TSC before participation in the registry were eligible. Data specific to renal angiomyolipoma included physical tumour characteristics (multiple, bilateral, lesion size and growing lesions), clinical signs and symptoms, and management. The effects of age, gender and genotype on the prevalence of renal angiomyolipoma were also evaluated.

Results

Renal angiomyolipoma was reported in 51.8% of patients at baseline, with higher frequency in female patients (57.8% versus 42.2%). The median age at diagnosis was 12 years. Prevalence of angiomyolipoma was higher in patients with TSC2 compared with TSC1 mutations (59.2% versus 33.3%, P < 0.01). Of the 1031 patients with angiomyolipoma at baseline, multiple lesions were reported in 88.4% and bilateral in 83.9% of patients, while the size of angiomyolipoma was > 3 cm in 34.3% of patients. Most patients were asymptomatic (82%). Frequently reported angiomyolipoma-related symptoms included bleeding, pain, elevated blood pressure and impaired renal function. Embolization and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors were the two most common treatment modalities.

Conclusions

The TOSCA registry highlights the burden of renal angiomyolipoma in patients with TSC and shows that renal manifestations are initially asymptomatic and are influenced by gender and genotype. Furthermore, the occurrence of significant problems from angiomyolipoma in a minority of younger patients suggests that surveillance should begin in infancy or at initial diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a hereditary disorder, affects ∼1 million people worldwide. TSC1 and TSC2 mutations result in increased activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), leading to increased metabolism, proliferation and tumor growth. Up to 80% of patients with TSC develop renal angiomyolipomata — tumors comprising blood vessels, smooth muscle-like cells and adipose-like tissue. Ultrastructural analysis and immunohistochemical and biochemical expression of pericyte-associated proteins by angiomyolipomata suggest that they are derived from vascular pericytes, mesenchymal perivascular cells located on the abluminal surface of capillaries involved in the regulation of microvascular stability, development and function. mTORC1 signaling has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in renal hypertrophy. In preclinical models, deletions in TSC2 result in abnormal renal cell polarity and the development of cysts.

Renal angiomyolipomata are the most common cause of TSC-related mortality in adults. Compared with sporadic renal angiomyolipomata, those associated with TSC usually occur in multiples and are larger, bilateral and more likely to grow. Aneurysms develop frequently from these tumors and may lead to life-threatening spontaneous hemorrhage. Renal angiomyolipoma > 3 cm, aneurysm > 0.5 cm and renal angiomyolipoma growth increase the risk of renal hemorrhage. Patients with renal angiomyolipomata are also at risk for hypertension and renal failure, which leads to increased health care utilization and associated costs. Guidelines recommend first-line treatment with a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor for asymptomatic, growing renal angiomyolipoma > 3 cm in diameter; however, these guidelines also caution that long-term benefits and safety data are needed. Proteinuria is a known adverse event (AE) associated with mTOR inhibitors, and screening is warranted.

### Evolving strategies in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex-associated angiomyolipomas (TSC-AML) [^6bb6940d]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous benign tumors that occur in multiple organ systems throughout the lifetime of the affected individuals. Renal angiomyolipomas occur in up to 80% of TSC patients, and chronic kidney disease from increasing tumor burden is the primary cause of TSC-related mortality. Our review evaluates evidence for localized and systemic therapy in the management of TSC-angiomyolipomas. Urologists or nephrologists experienced in TSC disease should coordinate the care of TSC patients with renal involvement to improve care and reduce costs.

FIGURE 1
Patients with history of renal angiomyolipoma across age groups. Percentage of patients with renal angiomyolipoma in each age group was calculated considering the total number of patients in that age group as the denominator.

A repeat scan to monitor angiomyolipoma was carried out in 977 patients (44.1%) with known angiomyolipoma. Growth of angiomyolipoma was observed in 218 patients (21.1%; 100 patients aged ≤ 18 years and 118 aged > 18 years). The mean time from the previous scan to the last assessment was 1.3 years. The occurrence rate and physical characteristics of renal angiomyolipoma at first follow-up visit were similar to that observed at baseline (Table 2).

Table 2
Renal angiomyolipoma features according to mutation type

The majority of the patients with renal angiomyolipoma were asymptomatic at baseline (845 patients, 82.0%) and at first follow-up visit (801 patients, 87.4%). Among the symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms reported at baseline and at first follow-up visit were pain (6.1% and 3.7%), elevated blood pressure (5.7% and 5.1%), haemorrhage (5.0% and 1.5%), microscopic haematuria (4.3% and 3.3%) and impaired renal function (3.9% and 3.3%), respectively (Table 2).

Overall, renal angiomyolipomas were treated in 309 patients (28.9%). However, the percentage of patients requiring treatment increased progressively with age to 48.6% by age > 40 years (Table 3). The most common treatment modalities (either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities) were embolization (46.0%) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (43.4%) (Table 2). The most common treatment modality in patients aged ≤ 18 years was mTOR inhibitors whereas embolization was most common in patients aged > 18 years (Table 3). The most common treatment modality at first follow-up visit was mTOR inhibitors (Table 2).

Kidney

At the time of diagnosis, abdominal imaging should be obtained regardless of age. As for brain, MRI is the preferred modality for evaluation of angiomyolipomata because many can be fat-poor and hence missed when abdominal CT or US are performed.MRI of the abdomen may be combined in the same session as MRI of the brain, thereby limiting the need for multiple sessions of anesthesia if anesthesia is needed for successful MRI. MRI of the abdomen may also reveal aortic aneurysms or extrarenal hamartomas of the liver, pancreas, and other abdominal organs that also can occur in individuals with TSC. In addition to imaging, accurate blood pressure assessment is important because of increased risk of secondary hypertension. To assess renal function at time of diagnosis, blood tests to determine glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using creatinine equations for adults, or children. Alternatively, measurement of serum cystatin C concentration can be used to evaluate GFR.(Category 1)

Lung

To evaluate for LAM, females 18 years or older should have baseline pulmonary function testing, 6-minute walk test, and high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT). When possible, low-radiation protocols should be used. A serum vascular endothelial growth factor type D (VEGF-D) level may be helpful to establish a baseline for future LAM development or progression. Counseling on smoking risks and estrogen use (such as some oral contraceptive preparations), which can compound the impact of LAM, should also occur in adolescents and adults. (Category 2A)

Skin and teeth

All patients should undergo a detailed clinical dermatologic and dental exam at time of diagnosis to evaluate for facial angiofibromas, fibrous cephalic plaques, hypomelanotic macules or confetti lesions, ungual fibromas, shagreen patch, defects in tooth enamel, and intraoral fibroma. (Category 2A)

Heart

In pediatric patients, especially younger than three years of age, an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained to evaluate for rhabdomyomas and arrhythmia, respectively. In those individuals with rhabdomyomas identified via prenatal ultrasound, fetal echocardiogram may be useful to detect those individuals with high risk of heart failure after delivery. (Category 1)

In the absence of cardiac symptoms or concerning medical history, echocardiogram is not necessary in adults, but as conduction defects may still be present and may influence medication choice and dosing, a baseline ECG is still recommended. (Category 2A)

### Effect of everolimus on renal function in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: evidence from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 [^8ffcd4a2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Everolimus (EVE), an mTOR inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in TSC-associated disorders, including renal angiomyolipoma. The effect of EVE on renal function was assessed in patients with TSC in the Phase 3 EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 studies. The primary endpoints for these two studies were subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and renal angiomyolipoma response rate, respectively, and EVE demonstrated significant benefit over placebo (PBO). In addition, in an exploratory subset analysis of patients in EXIST-1 with renal angiomyolipoma, EVE demonstrated a greater reduction in total renal angiomyolipoma volume versus PBO (angiomyolipoma response rate 53.3% versus 0%). Following positive results in the double-blind core phases, patients receiving PBO were offered open-label EVE in the extension phases.

Some preclinical studies have suggested that mTOR activity that is too high or too low may result in kidney injury. In order to better assess this question in the TSC population, the long-term effects of EVE (∼4 years) on renal function in patients from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 are reported here.

Conclusions

The presence of renal AML in patients with an age-range of 18–40 years should raise suspicion for concurrent TSC as the underlying cause. Therefore, particularly patients with bilateral renal AML should be referred for further testing for TSC, especially in light of the recent changes in the management of TSC and the option of a disease targeted therapy with mTOR-Inhibitors.

Background

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a birth incidence of 1:6000 and an estimated 1 million affected individuals worldwide. TSC is caused by an inactivating mutation in either the TSC-1 or the TSC-2 gene, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin. These proteins form a complex that activates the GTPase-activating protein Rheb to inhibit the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). The lack of mTOR-inactivation leads to an increase of protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, differentiation, and growth, which may affect virtually every organ. Therefore, TSC is very variable in its clinical manifestations. Formerly, TSC was defined by Vogt's triad of facial angiofibromas, mental retardation, and intractable epilepsy. Nowadays, the clinical diagnosis is usually confirmed by either a set of major and minor diagnostic criteria or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TSC-1 or TSC-2 by molecular genetic testing. Even though neurological (90%) and cutaneous (90%) manifestations, such as cortical tubers, epilepsy, giant cell astrocytoma, hydrocephalus, neurodevelopmental impairment, and facial angiofibromas, are the most common symptoms of TSC, 70 to 80% of TSC patients are also affected by renal angiomyolipoma (AML). Histologically, these benign tumours are composed of blood vessels, adipose tissue, and smooth muscle. In contrast to sporadic AML, TSC-associated AML usually manifest in childhood and adolescence. Growing renal AML pose a significant cause of mortality in TSC patients, since they bear the risk of severe life-threatening haemorrhage and impair the renal parenchyma, which leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually end-stage renal disease. Given the current world population, the incidence of TSC, and the frequency of renal involvement, approximately 500,000 patients with TSC worldwide have at least CKD stage 1. A literature review supports the impression that AML in patients with TSC tends to present earlier, with larger tumours of greater multiplicity, and more frequently in combination with haemorrhage, than in sporadic-type AML patients. In general, surgical resection is avoided whenever possible in order to preserve renal function; interventions are required in case of persistent pain or acute or repeated bleeding episodes. The risk of bleeding increases with the size of AML. Therefore, beyond therapeutic nephron-sparing surgery or embolization, prophylactic intervention in large AML are recommended. In TSC patients, new targeted treatment options with mTOR-inhibitors proved to be beneficial – especially in AML patients.

### Effect of everolimus on renal function in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: evidence from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 [^d84f9823]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

As would be expected based on the differing enrolment criteria of the studies, renal disease was more severe in patients in EXIST-2 than in EXIST-1. Renal angiomyolipoma burden at baseline was greater in EXIST-2; 7% of those in EXIST-1 and 60% of those in EXIST-2 had six or more renal angiomyolipoma lesions measuring ≥ 1 cm and 37.5% of the patients in EXIST-2 had undergone prior renal angiomyolipoma-related interventions (Table 1), with nephrectomy (full or partial) in 20 patients (18%). By contrast, in EXIST-1, 4 of 111 patients (3.6%) had undergone a prior renal intervention. In patients who undergo total nephrectomy, renal function is typically halved, which could have contributed to the lower eGFR in the patients in EXIST-2 compared with EXIST-1 (Figure 1), and is one of the reasons why clinical guidelines recommend avoidance of surgical and embolic or ablative therapies where possible in patients with renal angiomyolipoma. Kidneys with a large renal angiomyolipoma burden can still contribute significantly to renal function, therefore the decision to undergo nephrectomy should be balanced against loss of function. Our data indeed show the difference that previous nephrectomy had on eGFR in patients in EXIST-2, but no significant decline in eGFR over time was observed during treatment in these patients. The effects of age likely contributed to the differences between the observed eGFRs in each study (Figure 3). With regards to the increase in percentage change of eGFR seen in EXIST-1, it is possible we may be observing that predominantly younger patients with TSC renal disease and early impairment of GFR improve on EVE. However, later time points have fewer patients due to discontinuations or not reaching that length of treatment by the cutoff date, so caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of the latest time points of the figures showing eGFR. It should also be noted that although both studies estimated GFR in adults using the MDRD equation, because the MDRD formula is believed to overestimate GFR in children, the Schwartz formula was used to estimate GFR in patients < 18 years of age (the majority of the population in EXIST-1). Among other differences with the MDRD equation, the Schwartz formula includes patient height as a variable instead of age.

### Renal angiomyolipomata [^58094db5]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomata can exist as an imaging curiosity or represent a life-threatening condition. There are likely over 10 million people world-wide who have a renal angiomyolipomata and approximately one tenth of these people also have tuberous sclerosis complex. The optimum treatment of angiomyolipomata is focused on sparing renal tissue and has included no intervention, both total and partial nephrectomy, and embolization. As basic science investigation into the biology of angiomyolipomata progresses, there is even hope for successful drug therapy. Because these renal lesions can be associated with other organ system dysfunction, a number of medical specialists become involved in the care of affected patients. The purpose of this article is to update the nephrologist on the molecular understanding of renal angiomyolipomata and for the possibilities of pharmacologic therapy in the future.

### Pediatric renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis complex [^7dbdc1b2]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of hamartomas in multiple organs. Up to 80% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex will have at least 1 angiomyolipoma in their lifetime. We describe the incidence and natural history of angiomyolipoma in a pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex population and analyze tumor growth to determine optimal renal imaging intervals in an effort to improve counseling, treatment and followup.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex from 2004 to 2014. Patients were included if they had a clinical or genetic diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and had undergone at least 1 renal imaging study.

Results

A total of 145 patients were analyzed. Median age was 14 years (range 0 to 28). Overall incidence of angiomyolipoma was 50.3%. Median age at first angiomyolipoma detection was 11 years (range 2 to 26). Median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by age at first detection was 0.0 mm for patients 0 to 6 years old, 0.9 mm for those 7 to 11 years old, 2.5 mm for those 12 to 16 years old and 1.8 mm for those 17 years old or older. Median yearly angiomyolipoma growth rate stratified by tumor size at first detection was 0.1 mm for tumors 0.6 to 0.9 cm, 1.8 mm for those 1.0 to 1.9 cm and 4.3 mm for those 2.0 to 2.9 cm. A total of 35 patients (24.1%) received mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors. Eight patients underwent a total of 13 surgical interventions, of whom 2 had previously been treated with mTOR inhibitors. Median patient age at surgical intervention was 18.0 years and median angiomyolipoma size was 5.0 cm.

Conclusions

Angiomyolipoma growth in children with tuberous sclerosis complex can be rapid and unpredictable. We recommend yearly renal ultrasound in all patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, with consideration of magnetic resonance imaging in those at risk for rapid growth and future intervention (ie those older than 11 years and/or those with renal angiomyolipomas larger than 2 cm).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 were randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled, Phase 3 studies. EXIST-1 (NCT00789828) examined EVE for treating TSC-associated SEGA and EXIST-2 (NCT00790400) examined EVE for treating renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Methods from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 have been published previously; in brief, both studies comprised double-blind core phases followed by open-label extension phases, with patients being followed for 4–5 years. This retrospective analysis examined long-term renal function data collected prospectively throughout both studies.

Patients

In EXIST-1, eligible patients were 0–65 years of age with a definite diagnosis of TSC according to consensus criteria and growing SEGAs, with one or more target SEGA ≥ 1 cm in diameter assessed by multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients must have been medically stable and unlikely to require surgery for SEGAs, with no critical hydrocephalus or imminent cerebral herniation.

Eligible patients in EXIST-2 had a definite diagnosis of TSC or sporadic LAM per consensus criteria, and were ≥ 18 years old with one or more renal angiomyolipoma ≥ 3 cm in diameter. Patients requiring angiomyolipoma-related surgery or with renal angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or embolization during the previous 6 months or those with severely impaired lung function were excluded.

Local independent ethics committees at each center approved the protocols and the studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice, Declaration of Helsinki and all local regulations. Safety data were reviewed every 6 months by an independent data monitoring committee appointed in each study and all patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent before enrolment.

Treatment

Patients were originally randomly assigned 2:1 to receive EVE or PBO in a double-blind phase and then could receive open-label EVE in an extension phase. In EXIST-1, patients received EVE at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m²/day, with adjustment to achieve target trough levels of 5–15 ng/mL. In EXIST-2, patients received EVE 10 mg/day, with dose modifications allowed based on tolerability.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^ca97f348]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

A striking finding in our study was the occurrence of angiomyolipoma in very young children and the need for treatment as early as 2 years of age or younger (Table 3 and Figure 1). In the TOSCA cohort the earliest age of diagnosis of angiomyolipoma was < 2 years. This compares with other studies, which reported an estimated average age of onset to be between 7.2 and 11.1 years. The proportion of patients receiving treatment for angiomyolipoma increased progressively with increasing age. About 15% of patients received treatment by age 14, 27% by age 18, 40% by age 40 and 49% by age > 40.

The number of patients with haematuria and hypertension in the TOSCA cohort was low compared with those reported in TSC patients in other studies. This low incidence of signs and symptoms could be explained by the high number of young patients enrolled in the study and also by the preemptive treatment of renal angiomyolipoma in patients who were under on-going surveillance (not lapsed from follow-up). On-going surveillance is recommended in patients with asymptomatic tumours per international TSC guidelines. Chopra et al. evaluated adherence to surveillance guideline recommendations in an Australian TSC cohort and compared it among adults and pediatric patients. The study showed that there was a significantly lower rate of adherence to surveillance guidelines in adult patients than in pediatric patients. This highlights the need for a focused transition plan for TSC patients transferred to adult care.

Studies have shown a gender disparity among patients with TSC-associated angiomyolipoma, with more occurrences in female patients. A retrospective study by Rakowski et al. showed that complications due to angiomyolipoma were more common in women than in men with TSC. Furthermore, about two-thirds of the patients recruited in EXIST-2, a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis, were women. Both of these findings suggest that women with TSC are more vulnerable to developing renal complications. The gender disparity in angiomyolipoma complications raises a possible role of sex hormones in the pathogenesis of these lesions. Our study showed a similar finding with higher frequency of renal angiomyolipoma in females (57.8%) compared with males, however, this was not statistically significant. A future analysis is planned (after another years data has been collected) to ascertain if the rate of complications or treatment is higher in females.

### Prevalence of angiomyolipoma among patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: a U.S. healthcare claims database study… [^5a992154]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract e12042 Background: Angiomyolipoma are common benign neoplasm in the kidney, and are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. The objectives of this study were to examine AML prevalence among TSC patients in a real world setting, and to explore the relationship between AML prevalence and ages, genders, or residential regions. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on a large US commercial healthcare claims database. Patients with a TSC claim between 2000 and 2009 and with continuous 12-month enrollment after their first TSC claim were selected for the study. AML patients were identified based on ICD-9CM code. Patients' genders, residential regions, and age on their first TSC/or AML claim were derived respectively from enrollment files and healthcare claims. Two-sample.

t tests and Chi-square tests were used to explore the relationships between AML prevalence, genders, residential regions and the age groups. Results: The study included 2, 767 TSC patients with a mean age of 28. 5 years on their first TSC claims, and
55. 3% were female. AML prevalence among TSC patients was 7. 8% in their first observed post-TSC year, and could be 78% at the end of the
10. thobserved post-TSC year if AML incidence rate remains constant. Associations between AML prevalence and age groups, genders, or residential regions were statistically significant; and variations of AML prevalence by genders, residential regions and age groups at the first TSC claim were observed.

Conclusions: In a real world setting AML occurred in 7. 8% TSC patients in the first post-TSC year, and could increase to 78% within 10 years if the incidence rate remained at
701. 1 per 10, 000 TSC patient years. AML prevalence was associated with age, gender and residential regions, and varied significantly by ages, genders and residential regions. Further research is needed to explore the factors that resulted into these associations. Information Published In Journal of Clinical OncologyVolume 30

### Everolimus [^d0a2a310]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Renal Angiomyolipoma

A randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EXIST-2, NCT00790400) of everolimus tablets was conducted in 118 patients with renal angiomyolipoma as a feature of TSC (n = 113) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 5). The key eligibility requirements for this trial were at least one angiomyolipoma of ≥ 3 cm in longest diameter on CT/MRI based on local radiology assessment, no immediate indication for surgery, and age ≥ 18 years. Patients received everolimus tablets 10 mg or matching placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CT or MRI scans for disease assessment were obtained at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 weeks and annually thereafter. Clinical and photographic assessment of skin lesions were conducted at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation. The major efficacy outcome measure was angiomyolipoma response rate based on independent central radiology review, which was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, absence of new angiomyolipoma lesion ≥ 1 cm, absence of kidney volume increase ≥ 20%, and no angiomyolipoma related bleeding of ≥ Grade 2. Key supportive efficacy outcome measures were time to angiomyolipoma progression and skin lesion response rate. The primary analyses of efficacy outcome measures were limited to the blinded treatment period and conducted 6 months after the last patient was randomized. The comparative angiomyolipoma response rate analysis was stratified by use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) at randomization (yes vs. no).

Introduction

The clinical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are highly diverse in both organ system involvement and severity. Any organ system can be involved, with some more prevalent during infancy and childhood and others more likely to affect individuals as adults. Birth incidence is estimated to be 1:5800. Many manifestations can be life-threatening and appropriate surveillance and management is necessary to limit morbidity and mortality in this disease. Appropriate management is also crucial for optimal quality of life of affected individuals and requires coordination of care among medical specialties and from childhood to adulthood on a regular basis and especially during the critical transition from pediatric to adult health care services.

In 1998, the National Institutes of Health sponsored the first Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference to develop recommendations for diagnosis and clinical management of patients affected by TSC. At that time, the two known genes responsible for TSC cases had been identified but their function and molecular role were not yet known. We now know that the TSC1 and TSC2 genes encode for hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), which form a regulatory complex responsible for limiting the activity of an important intracellular regulator of cell growth and metabolism known as mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via inhibition of the small GTPase ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). The functional relationship between TSC1/TSC2 and mTORC1 has led to important clinical advances in the use of mTORC1 inhibitors for the treatment of several clinical manifestations of TSC, including cerebral subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, – renal angiomyolipomas, and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).– Significant advances in imaging, surgery, interventional radiology, medical, and behavioral therapies have transformed TSC management since 1998.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^5c6d53a3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from inherited or sporadic germline mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 encoding hamartin and tuberin, respectively. It is characterized by hamartomatous lesions in multiple organs, including the brain, kidney, skin, heart, lungs and retina.

Renal problems are very frequent in patients with TSC after neurological manifestations and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Renal manifestations include angiomyolipoma, epithelial cysts, polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma. The occurrence rate and clinical characteristics of renal lesions in TSC have been assessed primarily in either single- or two-centre case series or in population-based studies with small sample sizes with varied findings. The estimated prevalence of angiomyolipoma varied between studies and ranged from 55% to 80%. Some studies showed a higher proportion of renal angiomyolipoma in females, whereas others have shown no gender disparity. Patients with TSC2 mutations have been reported to exhibit a higher incidence and severity of angiomyolipoma compared with patients with TSC1 mutations. Patients with TSC-associated renal angiomyolipoma are susceptible to spontaneous life-threatening haemorrhage.

Despite considerable progress in the understanding of TSC and associated renal manifestations, there is a need for a large population-based cohort study to better understand clinical characteristics and natural history of renal angiomyolipoma in patients with TSC and its relationship with age, gender and genotype to target surveillance and therapy to those at greatest risk.

The TuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease Awareness (TOSCA) has been designed to address the knowledge gaps in the natural history of TSC by collecting data from patients across many countries worldwide. The TOSCA registry has provided better insight into the overall TSC manifestations including clinical characteristics of renal angiomyolipoma. In this report, we present baseline and 1-year follow-up data of the TOSCA registry with focus on the clinical characteristics of renal angiomyolipoma.

### Effect of everolimus on renal function in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: evidence from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 [^d4a707f4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A reduction in renal angiomyolipoma volume observed with everolimus (EVE) treatment in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) has been postulated to translate to clinical benefit by reducing the risk of renal hemorrhage and chronic renal failure.

Methods

The long-term effects of EVE on renal function (∼4years of treatment) were examined in patients treated with EVE in the Phase 3 EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 studies. Patients in EXIST-1 had TSC and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and patients in EXIST-2 had renal angiomyolipoma and a definite diagnosis of TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. EVE was administered at 4.5mg/m²/day, with adjustment to achieve target trough levels of 5-15ng/mL in EXIST-1 and at 10mg/day in EXIST-2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatinine levels were assessed at baseline, at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 18, then every 3months thereafter. Proteinuria was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.

Results

A total of 111 patients from EXIST-1 and 112 patients from EXIST-2 were included in this analysis. Respective mean ages at EVE initiation were 10.5 [standard deviation (SD) 6.45] and 33.2 (SD 10.29) years, and 3.6% and 37.5% of patients had undergone prior renal intervention. Mean baseline eGFR was 115 and 88mL/min/1.73 m² in EXIST-1 and EXIST-2, respectively. Overall, mean eGFR remained stable over time in both studies, with an decline in renal function mostly confined to some patients with severely compromised renal function before treatment. Patients with prior renal intervention exhibited low eGFR values throughout the study. The incidence of proteinuria increased after initiating treatment with EVE and was mostly Grade 1/2 in severity, with Grade 3 proteinuria reported in only two patients. Measurements of proteinuria were limited by the use of urine dipstick tests.

Conclusions

The use of EVE does not appear to be nephrotoxic in patients with SEGA or renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC and may preserve renal function in most patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00789828 and NCT00790400.

Surveillance and management recommendations for individuals with newly suspected or newly diagnosed TSC

TSC is usually first suspected in individuals when one or more clinical diagnostic criteria are identified (Table 2). The purposes of initial diagnostic studies are to confirm the diagnosis in individuals with "possible" TSC and to determine the extent of disease and organ involvement in individuals with "definite" TSC. Baseline studies are also important in guiding treatment decisions should additional disease manifestations emerge in later years.

Genetics

All individuals should have a three-generation family history obtained to determine if additional family members are at risk of diagnosis. Gene testing is recommended for genetic counseling purposes or when the diagnosis of TSC is suspected or in question but cannot be clinically confirmed (Category 1).

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^0f36b566]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

This study had a number of limitations. First, owing to the observational nature of the registry, only data already available from routine clinical practice was collected. However, participation of a variety of centres with different specialists has helped inclusion of a large number of patients with TSC, which are representative of hospital clinical practice. Furthermore, patients were recruited through clinical centres with expertise in TSC and hence milder cases may not always be seen at these centres.

In conclusion, the TOSCA registry highlights the burden of renal angiomyolipoma in patients with TSC and provides valuable insights in understanding the characteristics, complications and treatment of renal angiomyolipoma in these patients. The data in the TOSCA registry show that renal manifestations are generally initially asymptomatic and are influenced by gender and genotype. Renal angiomyolipoma may occur in patients aged < 2 years but the occurrence rate increases markedly with time, with up to 49% of patients requiring treatment interventions over 40 years of age.

Abstract

Background

A reduction in renal angiomyolipoma volume observed with everolimus (EVE) treatment in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) has been postulated to translate to clinical benefit by reducing the risk of renal hemorrhage and chronic renal failure.

### Everolimus for renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis: extension of a randomized controlled trial [^5093666a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment of renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (sporadic LAM), but follow-up is limited. Longer term efficacy and tolerability data from a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are presented.

Methods

Following favorable results from the primary analysis (data cutoff 30 June 2011) of the EXIST-2 trial, patients still receiving study treatment were allowed to enter an open-label extension. Everolimus was initiated at 10 mg once daily and titrated based on tolerability. The primary outcome was angiomyolipoma response rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in target lesion volumes). Safety was a secondary endpoint.

Results

As of the cutoff date (1 May 2013), 112 patients had received everolimus, and the response rate in 107 patients with angiomyolipoma (median duration of medication exposure of 28.9 months) was 54%. The proportion of patients achieving angiomyolipoma reductions of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% increased over time, reaching 81.6% (62/76) and 64.5% (49/76), respectively, by Week 96. No everolimus-treated patients experienced renal bleeding. The long-term safety profile was consistent with previous reports; adverse events (AEs) were mostly Grade 1/2, and there were no new safety issues. The frequency of emerging AEs and severe AEs lessened over time.

Conclusions

Longer term everolimus treatment appeared safe and effective in patients with TSC- or sporadic LAM-associated renal angiomyolipoma not requiring surgical intervention. Continued reduction in angiomyolipoma volume was demonstrated, and there was no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding; AEs were predictable and generally manageable.

### Evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of cryoablation in the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma related to tuberous sclerosis complex: the cryo-TSC… [^2d9d8dcf]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 669 Background: Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Approximately 60%–80% of patients with TSC have bilateral angiomyolipoma. Cryotherapy is one treatment option for renal tumors, but the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy for TSC–AML is not clear. We planned this study to establish the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy for TSC–AML. Methods: This was an open-label, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy for TSC–AML of 4 cm or less in diameter in patients at least 16 years old. The exclusion criteria were an inability to withdraw from mTOR inhibitor and failure to maintain rest during cryotherapy. mTOR inhibitors were withdrawn at least 7 days prior to cryotherapy and discontinued during the study period. Cryotherapy was performed using Cryohit.

Safety was assessed at 1, 2, 6, and 9 months after cryotherapy, and efficacy was assessed at 3 and 9 months after cryotherapy. The efficacy of cryotherapy was evaluated according to the modified RECIST or RECIST criteria. The primary endpoint was the disease control rate, and secondary endpoints included the overall response rate, safety, renal function, quality of life, and need for additional treatment. Results: The disease control and overall response rates were 100% and 93. 3%, respectively. After 9 months of follow-up, the median creatine level was slightly increased by 0. 06 mg/dL. Quality of life was stable, and no additional treatment was needed. Three Grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients. Conclusions: Cryoablation is a safe and effective treatment option for TSC–AML. Clinical trial information: jRCTs072200039.

### Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex in a patient referred for uncontrolled hypertension and renal dysfunction: a case highlighting the importance of proper diagnostic work-up of hypertensive patients [^5a239990]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 39-year-old woman with resistant hypertension and renal dysfunction. The patient was hospitalized 3 months earlier for dyspnea at the Department of Cardiology, where she was diagnosed with heart failure (left ventricle injection fraction: 25–30%), pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine: 1.58mg/dl), and resistant hypertension and discharged with optimal heart failure treatment. At presentation to our clinic, apart from uncontrolled hypertension for more than 10 years and history of pre-eclampsia and fetal loss, the patient had obesity (BMI: 38kg/m) and facial fibromas. The first diagnostic steps proposed by the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) Guidelines to identify other target-organ damage and causes of secondary hypertension revealed typical proteinuric hypertensive nephropathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and sleep-apnea syndrome. Furthermore, a renal ultrasound showed multiple bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, confirmed by an MRI scan. Following consultation with the Neurology and Dermatology Departments, the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex, based on presence of six major criteria, was confirmed. During the following 10 months, careful adjustments in the patient's antihypertensive treatment, reinforcement of lifestyle interventions, and improved compliance enabled her to reduce her body weight, control blood pressure, improve her heart (left ventricle injection fraction: > 40%), and renal injury (creatinine urine clearance: 125ml/min, urine protein: 178mg/24 day) and serum triglycerides (153mg/dl). These improvements enabled the start of everolimus, required for a slight increase in angiomyolipomas' size (3.46cm) in the repeated examinations.

### Long-term follow-up assessing renal angiomyolipoma treatment patterns, morbidity, and mortality: an observational study in tuberous sclerosis complex patients in the Netherlands [^4c8b7f09]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term data from patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated renal angiomyolipoma (angiomyolipoma) are limited.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting & Participants

Adult patients with TSC treated at the University Medical Center Utrecht (the Netherlands) from January 1990 through April 2012.

Predictors

Patient age and angiomyolipoma stage, based on computed tomography lesion count, size, and impact on renal anatomy, with higher stage representing higher angiomyolipoma burden. Patients in stages 3 or higher were considered at high risk for hemorrhage and candidates for selective arterial embolization.

Outcomes

Kidney-related outcomes included hypertension, anemia, decreased kidney function, dialysis, kidney transplantation, nephrectomy, kidney-related blood transfusions, and mortality. Observed mortality was compared to the Dutch National Bureau of Statistics using standardized mortality ratio.

Results

Median follow-up was 15.8 years, of which staging was available for 5.4 years. Of 351 patients with TSC, 244 (69.5%) had confirmed angiomyolipoma; 144 (59.0%) reached stage 3 or higher. Age and angiomyolipoma stage were positively correlated: median age in the none-detected stage was 36.8 years, increasing to 43.6 years for stage 6. Embolization was performed in 117 patients; 57 had 2 or more embolization procedures. Higher stage was associated with hypertension, anemia, decreased kidney function, and transfusion. Hypertension, anemia, and decreased kidney function were more common in patients who underwent selective arterial embolization. 7 patients required dialysis, 7 received a kidney transplant, and 16 underwent nephrectomy. 29 deaths were recorded, most commonly related to renal complications (n = 9[31%]). Mortality was significantly higher in the study cohort versus the general population (standardized mortality ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 3.4–6.9).

Limitations

Duration of follow-up with staging was too short to observe stage progression in most patients.

Conclusions

Despite the use of preventive selective arterial embolization, patients with TSC exhibit clinically significant kidney disease and excess mortality, largely because of kidney-related complications.

### Effect of everolimus on renal function in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: evidence from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 [^99b852cd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations to our analyses include limited numbers in this subanalysis, use of open-label data (no PBO comparison), the use of two different EVE dosing methods between the two studies, assessment of renal function only by serum creatinine (which is influenced by factors other than renal function, such as muscle mass) and calculation of eGFR by two different equations. Measurement of other biomarkers of kidney function such as cystatin C or creatinine clearance would provide useful additional information regarding kidney function in these patients. Also, the proteinuria analyses were limited in that urine creatinine was characterized by dipstick with local laboratory testing and central measurements of proteinuria were not performed. Finally, patients with severe kidney function impairment (defined as creatinine > 1.5 times ULN) were excluded from study enrolment in both EXIST-1 and EXIST-2.

In conclusion, data from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 suggest preservation of renal function as assessed by eGFR and serum creatinine elevations, except in some patients whose renal function is already severely compromised. Overall, EVE does not appear to be nephrotoxic in patients with SEGA or renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC. However, long-term monitoring of such patients and further studies are warranted.

More than 75% of the patients in EXIST-1 had negative or trace proteinuria levels per laboratory assessment across all time points (Table 4). In EXIST-2, ≥ 50% of patients had negative or trace levels through Week 228. The percentage of patients in EXIST-2 with 1+ to 4+ proteinuria per laboratory assessment while on EVE was relatively stable over time, with most patients in the mild (1+) category.

Safety/tolerability

One patient in EXIST-1 and one patient in EXIST-2 experienced Grade 3 elevations in serum creatinine [> 3.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN)]. Grade 1 or 2 serum creatinine elevations (> ULN to 3.0 × ULN) occurred in 3.6 and 15.2% of patients in EXIST-1 and EXIST-2, respectively. Only two of the serum creatinine elevation events in EXIST-1 and seven in EXIST-2 were reported as AEs. Proteinuria was classified as an AE by the investigator in 3.6% of EXIST-1 and 17.9% of EXIST-2 patients during the course of the studies; this was mostly Grade 1 or 2 (1+ or 2+ to 3+ on a urine dipstick test) in severity. Grade 3 proteinuria (4+ on a urine dipstick test) was reported as an AE in only two patients in EXIST-2; both were suspected to be related to treatment and one led to study discontinuation but resolved after dose reduction/interruption. This patient was the only patient between the two studies that permanently discontinued treatment because of proteinuria.

### Differentiation of sporadic versus tuberous sclerosis complex-associated angiomyolipoma [^3a1d2d7d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We review the imaging of renal angiomyolipomas, including differentiation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated and sporadic renal angiomyolipomas and other solid renal tumors. We also focus on radiologic interventions and molecular targeting of the TSC genetic pathway.

Conclusion

Imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of renal angiomyolipomas. It provides essential information to make the best therapeutic decisions about the interventional and pharmacologic options to help prevent bleeding and preserve functional parenchyma.

### Renal angiomyolipoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: findings from the tuberOus SClerosis registry to increase disease awareness [^1aba7ba6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The TOSCA study represents the largest cohort of TSC patients, with data accrued from 170 sites across 31 countries worldwide. The study showed several notable findings. Renal angiomyolipoma were reported in 51.8% of patients in the TOSCA cohort, which was lower than that observed in other studies. A probable reason for the lower rates of renal angiomyolipoma observed in this study was the younger median age of the TOSCA cohort. As shown in Figure 1, there is markedly increasing prevalence in the adult age range mirroring that of the published series rates of 55–80%. In a retrospective cohort study of 170 patients with TSC, a significant association between advancing age and the incidence of renal angiomyolipoma was reported. Furthermore, the presence of renal angiomyolipoma was unknown for 151 patients (6.8%) suggesting no renal imaging was performed in these patients to confirm or exclude the presence of renal angiomyolipoma. However, it is important to note that the total number of patients enrolled in this study was considerably larger than in previous studies.

### Effect of everolimus on renal function in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: evidence from EXIST-1 and EXIST-2 [^5e1747f0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

Table 1 shows baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the 111 and 112 patients in EXIST-1 and EXIST-2, respectively, who received one or more dose of EVE and are included in this analysis. Because of the age at which SEGAs typically appear, all patients who received EVE in EXIST-1 were < 30 years of age. Angiomyolipomata more commonly cause symptoms in adulthood, therefore entry criteria for EXIST-2 restricted patients to those ≥ 18 years of age. EXIST-1 enrolled more males than females, whereas two-thirds of the patients in EXIST-2 were female. Sixty-four percent of patients in EXIST-1 also had evidence of renal angiomyolipoma, but lesions were smaller than those in patients in EXIST-2. Approximately one-third of patients (38%) in EXIST-2 had undergone renal interventions before recruitment; 23 patients had undergone prior embolization, 20 had prior nephrectomy (total or partial), 4 had surgical removal of a lesion and 1 had thermoablation. In EXIST-1, four patients had undergone a prior renal intervention (nephrectomy).

Table 1
Baseline a demographics and disease characteristics

At study completion (2 October 2014 and 4 February 2015, for EXIST-1 and EXIST-2, respectively), the median duration of EVE exposure was ∼47 months in both studies. Nearly 75% of the patients completed the studies per the protocol (Table 2).

Patient disposition

Renal function

Overall, mean eGFR remained stable over time in both studies (Figure 1). Mean eGFR values were lower in EXIST-2 than in EXIST-1. One patient in EXIST-1 and eight in EXIST-2 experienced severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) at least once postbaseline. All of these patients had considerably compromised renal function before starting EVE (i.e. Stage 3/4 CKD) and eight exhibited continued renal function decline (Table 3). In other patients, including 27 with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², eGFR mostly remained stable or improved throughout treatment with EVE.

### Everolimus for angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (EXIST-2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^a0dafe2f]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Angiomyolipomas are slow-growing tumours associated with constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The insidious growth of these tumours predisposes patients to serious complications including retroperitoneal haemorrhage and impaired renal function. Everolimus, a rapamycin derivative, inhibits the mTOR pathway by acting on the mTOR complex 1. We compared the angiomyolipoma response rate on everolimus with placebo in patients with tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphanioleiomyomatosis-associated angiomyolipomata.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with at least one angiomyolipoma 3 cm or larger in its longest diameter (defined by radiological assessment) and a definite diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 fashion with the use of an interactive web response system, to receive oral everolimus 10 mg per day or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed angiomyolipoma response of at least a 50% reduction in total volume of target angiomyolipomas relative to baseline. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00790400.

Results

118 patients (median age 31.0 years; IQR 18.0–61.0) from 24 centres in 11 countries were randomly assigned to receive everolimus (n = 79) or placebo (n = 39). At the data cutoff, double-blind treatment was ongoing for 98 patients; two main reasons for discontination were disease progression (nine placebo patients) followed by adverse events (two everolimus patients; four placebo patients). The angiomyolipoma response rate was 42% (33 of 79 [95% CI 31–53%]) for everolimus and 0% (0 of 39 [0–9%]) for placebo (response rate difference 42% [24–58%]; one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p < 0.0001). The most common adverse events in the everolimus and placebo groups were stomatitis (48% [38 of 79], 8% [3 of 39], respectively), nasopharyngitis (24% [19 of 79] and 31% [12 of 39]), and acne-like skin lesions (22% [17 of 79] and 5% [2 of 39]).

Interpretation

Everolimus reduced angiomyolipoma volume with an acceptable safety profile, suggesting it could be a potential treatment for angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis.

### Renal disease in tuberous sclerosis complex: pathogenesis and therapy [^c1d5d226]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hamartomatous tumours of the brain, heart, skin, lung and kidney. Patients with TSC show a diverse range of neurological features (including seizures, cognitive disability and autism) and renal manifestations (including angiomyolipomas, epithelial cysts and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)). TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These two proteins form a complex that negatively regulates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. In clinical trials, allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 decrease angiomyolipoma size, but the tumours regrow after treatment cessation. Therefore, the development of strategies to eliminate rather than suppress angiomyolipomas remains a high priority. This Review describes important advances in the TSC field and highlights several remaining critical knowledge gaps: the factors that promote aggressive behaviour by a subset of TSC-associated RCCs; the molecular mechanisms underlying early-onset cystogenesis in TSC2-PKD1 contiguous gene deletion syndrome; the effect of early, long-term mTORC1 inhibition on the development of TSC renal disease; and the identification of the cell or cells of origin of angiomyolipomas.

### Fate of pediatric renal angiomyolipoma during mTOR inhibitor treatment in tuberous sclerosis complex [^bf3397df]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical and radiographic follow-up of renal angiomyolipoma (AML) in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) on mTOR inhibitors.

Methods

We performed retrospective chart review of children who were diagnosed with TSC between 2000 and 2019 and prescribed everolimus at age ≤ 18 years. Treatment assessment was performed in patients who were medically-compliant by serum drug trough levels and who had at least a baseline and one subsequent renal imaging study.

Results

Nineteen patients were analyzed. Average age of everolimus initiation was 9 years, and indication was neurologic in 17 (90%). Fourteen patients (73.6%) had AML with average size of 1.9 (0.4–5) cm. Medication was discontinued due to side effects in 3 (16%) patients. Treatment assessment was analyzed for 15 patients with median medication exposure 5.1 (0.8–8.5) years. Among 13 with AML, the dominant lesion decreased in size in 9 (69%) and stayed stable in 4 (31%). Greatest absolute size decrease was seen for lesions ≥ 2 cm. No new AML lesions formed during treatment.

Conclusion

Although not currently approved for this indication, everolimus appears to be well-tolerated with similar efficacy for pediatric AML as in adult AML. Use may be most warranted in children with AML ≥ 2 cm.

### Enhancing disease awareness for tuberous sclerosis complex in patients with radiologic diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma: an observational study [^cd4c77d2]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder, with renal manifestations like angiomyolipoma (AML) occurring in 70–80% of patients. AML usually cause more complications in TCS patients than in non-TSC patients. However, AML patients are not routinely investigated for TSC. Our aim was to retrospectively assess the correlation between radiologically diagnosed AML and TSC.

Methods

All patients were stratified into AML related vs. unrelated to TSC. Correlations were calculated to determine the association between age, AML, and TSC.

Results

Complete data were available for 521 patients with renal AML, in 7 of which the concurrent diagnosis of TSC was found. Younger age significantly positively correlated with the prevalence of TSC in AML patients (p < 0.01). 37 (7%) of the 521 patients were within the age-range of 18–40 years, in which TSC occurred in 6 cases, 4 (66.7%) of which presented with multiple, bilateral renal AML (p < 0.05), and 2 (33.3%) of which with a single, unilateral AML (p < 0.05). In patients with AML but without TSC, unilateral AML was found in 83.9% and bilateral AML in 16.1% (p < 0.05). Simple binary logistic regression analysis revealed bilateral AML (OR 33.0; 95% CI 3.2–344.0; p = 0.003) (but not unilateral AML (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.88; p = 0.04)) to be a risk factor for TSC.

Conclusions

The presence of bilateral AML in patients within the age-range of 18–40 years should raise suspicion for TSC as the underlying cause. Therefore, our advice is to refer patients with multiple bilateral renal AML for further investigations regarding TSC.

RESULTS

Patient demographics and clinical characteristics

As of 30 September 2015 (data cut-off date for the third interim analysis), baseline data were available for 2216 patients and first follow-up visit data were available for 1911 patients. Baseline patient demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Median age at inclusion was 13 years (range < 1–71 years). Median age at diagnosis of TSC was 1 year (range < 1–69 years). There were 144 (6.5%) patients with prenatal diagnoses. Molecular testing for genetic mutations was performed in 1000 (45.1%) patients. Of these, 644 patients (64.4%) had a TSC2 gene mutation, 197 (19.7%) had a TSC1 gene mutation, 6 patients had both TSC1 and TSC2 gene mutations and 144 (14.4%) had no mutation identified.

Baseline patient demographics and clinical characteristics (N = 2216)

Renal angiomyolipoma

A total of 1070/2065 patients (51.8%) had renal imaging and had a history of renal angiomyolipoma. The other 151 patients had not had renal imaging. Of the 1070 patients with documented renal angiomyolipoma, 42.2% were males, and 57.8% females. The frequency at each age distribution is presented in Figure 1. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 16.9 years [median (range) 12 years (< 1–67 years)]. Of 1070 patients with a history of angiomyolipoma, angiomyolipoma was present at baseline in 1031 patients, while renal angiomyolipomas were resolved on treatment in 23 patients (2.1%) and no longer detectable in 16 patients (1.5%). In 1031 patients with renal angiomyolipoma present at baseline, 911 patients (88.4%) had multiple renal angiomyolipoma and 865 patients (83.9%) had bilateral renal angiomyolipoma. Angiomyolipoma size > 3 cm was observed in 354 patients (34.3%; 68 patients aged ≤ 18 years and 286 aged > 18 years).

### Urological counseling and followup in pediatric tuberous sclerosis complex [^5b4b6a12]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We review our experience with renal manifestations in pediatric patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex, and offer recommendations for urological counseling, followup and treatment of these patients.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed clinical notes on 41 patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex followed at our institution from childhood. Patient data were gathered in a database focusing on renal involvement. The latter was assessed by periodic clinical evaluations and ultrasound. The risk of renal involvement was evaluated in relation to patient age, genotypic pattern and number of extrarenal manifestations.

Results

Overall, 15 patients (36.6%) had renal involvement. The latter increased with age and was more common in cases with TSC2 genotypic pattern or multiple extrarenal manifestations. Angiomyolipomas were the most common lesions (11 patients), followed by renal cysts (2) and polycystic kidney disease (2). Cystic lesions were the most common in patients younger than 16 years. Renal failure developed in the 2 patients with polycystic kidney disease by the 2nd decade of life. Overall, treatment was required in 2 cases of symptomatic angiomyolipoma. Both patients were female, and had multiple extrarenal manifestations and bilateral renal involvement. One patient underwent open surgery at age 21.3 years and 1 underwent radiological embolization at age 23.4 years.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex should undergo urological evaluation and followup. Although most of the lesions remain silent during childhood, the incidence of renal involvement increases with age. The need for treatment is highest in females with multiple extrarenal manifestations and bilateral renal involvement.

### Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex: patients' and parents' knowledge and routines for renal follow-up-a questionnaire study [^3c05d442]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are a major clinical feature in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Spontaneous bleeding can be life threatening, and appropriate information and proper surveillance and management are important to limit morbidity and mortality. Because TSC is a rare disease, patients are at risk of suboptimal medical management. Our aim was to investigate patients' and parents' knowledge about renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and to identify current routines for renal follow-up.

Methods

A questionnaire survey was initiated by the French Reference Centre on TSC. It was distributed in France through university hospitals and the patients' association (2009–2011), and to patients registered by the Norwegian National Centre for Rare Epilepsy-Related Disorders (2013–2014). Contingency tables with Chi-Square test for independence (with Yates Continuity Correction) and Pearson-Chi-Square value were used for correlation statistics.

Results

We included 357 patients (France, n = 257; Norway n = 100). Most participants knew that TSC is associated with AMLs. However, 42% did not know about the risk of AMLrelated bleeding, and 37% had been informed about the risk of bleeding only after the age of 15 years. Furthermore, 14% did not know whether they themselves or their child had AMLs. Patients had less knowledge than parents. Medical consultations and patient associations were the main sources of information. Among 30% of patients, renal imaging was not received at all, or not conducted every 1–3 years, as recommended by current guidelines. Regular imaging was more frequent in patients with AMLs < 15 years, than in patients with AMLs ≥ 15 years. Ultrasound was the most frequently used imaging modality.

Conclusions

Knowledge of renal AML in TSC patients and their parents was lower than expected, and follow-up by renal imaging was suboptimal for a substantial proportion of patients. Patients and parents should be informed about the risk and symptoms of renal bleeding, at the latest when the patient is 15 years. Monitoring the growth of AMLs should be standardized to comply with guidelines. Transition between adolescence and adulthood is a high-risk period and ensuring appropriate follow-up at this time is particularly important.

### Tuberous sclerosis: current update [^f4d5f333]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a relatively rare autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder secondary to mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. Although manifestation of the classic triad of seizures, intellectual disability, and facial angiofibromas may facilitate timely diagnosis of TSC, the multisystem features that may indicate TSC in the absence of these manifestations remain highly variable. In addition, patients with TSC are at risk of developing multiple benign and malignant tumors in various organ systems, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, imaging plays a critical role in diagnosis, surveillance, and management of patients with TSC. It is crucial that radiologists be familiar with TSC and the various associated imaging features to avoid a delayed or incorrect diagnosis. Key manifestations include cortical dysplasias, subependymal nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, cardiac rhabdomyomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and angiomyolipomas. Renal angiomyolipomas in particular can manifest with imaging features that mimic renal malignancy and pose a diagnostic dilemma. Other manifestations include dermatologic and ophthalmic manifestations, renal cysts, renal cell carcinomas, multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia, splenic hamartomas, and other rare tumors such as perivascular epithelioid tumors. In addition to using imaging and clinical features to confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing can be performed. In this article, the molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and imaging features of TSC are reviewed. Current recommendations for management and surveillance of TSC are discussed as well. © RSNA, 2021.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of renal angiomyolipoma [^84cbaf8a]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Advances in minimally invasive therapies and novel targeted chemotherapeutics have provided a breadth of options for the management of renal masses. Management of renal angiomyolipoma has not been reviewed in a comprehensive fashion in more than a decade. We provide an updated review of the current diagnosis and management strategies for renal angiomyolipoma.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a PubMed(®) search of all available literature for renal or kidney angiomyolipoma. Further sources were identified in the reference lists of identified articles. We specifically reviewed case series of partial nephrectomy, selective arterial embolization and ablative therapies as well as trials of mTOR inhibitors for angiomyolipoma from 1999 to 2014.

Results

Renal angiomyolipoma is an uncommon benign renal tumor. Although associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, these tumors occur sporadically. Risk of life threatening hemorrhage is the main clinical concern. Due to the fat content, angiomyolipomas are generally readily identifiable on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, fat poor angiomyolipoma can present a diagnostic challenge. Novel research suggests that various strategies using magnetic resonance imaging, including chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging, have the potential to differentiate fat poor angiomyolipoma from renal cell carcinoma. Active surveillance is the accepted management for small asymptomatic masses. Generally, symptomatic masses and masses greater than 4 cm should be treated. However, other relative indications may apply. Options for treatment have traditionally included radical and partial nephrectomy, selective arterial embolization and ablative therapies, including cryoablation and radio frequency ablation, all of which we review and update. We also review recent advances in the medical treatment of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex associated angiomyolipomas with mTOR inhibitors. Specifically trials of everolimus for patients with tuberous sclerosis complex suggest that this agent may be safe and effective in treating angiomyolipoma tumor burden. A schema for the suggested management of renal angiomyolipoma is provided.

Conclusions

Appropriately selected cases of renal angiomyolipoma can be managed by active surveillance. For those patients requiring treatment nephron sparing approaches, including partial nephrectomy and selective arterial embolization, are preferred options. For those with tuberous sclerosis complex mTOR inhibitors may represent a viable approach to control tumor burden while conserving renal parenchyma.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC): renal and extrarenal imaging [^975112e8]. Academic Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a multiorgan syndrome manifesting with several benign and malignant tumors. Complications arising from renal abnormalities are a leading cause of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Renal cell carcinoma is relatively uncommon, occurring in 2%-4% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex syndrome, but nonetheless can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Extrarenal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex, including within the chest, abdomen and central nervous system, aid in diagnosis. Pathogenesis and management are also discussed, including the importance of the types of renal masses found in these patients.

### Enhancing disease awareness for tuberous sclerosis complex in patients with radiologic diagnosis of renal angiomyolipoma: an observational study [^5c10ff03]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

AML are mostly diagnosed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or sonography, generally with near certainty due to their unique appearance. An imaging study involving 12,970 male and 4971 female Japanese healthy adults identified renal AML in 13 (0.1%) males and 11 (0.22%) females. However, even though the correlation between AML and TSC has been described and TSC patients have an increased risk for AML-related complications, disease awareness for TSC in AML patients is low in clinical practice.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the radiologic diagnosis of renal AML can lead to the identification of TSC patients and thus increase disease awareness for TSC.

We discuss an 18-year-old girl, diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis complex and known to have renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) but having no regular urological follow-up, who presented with left-sided abdominal pain and haematuria on urine dipstick testing at the out-of-hours General Practitioner (GP) service. She was diagnosed as having urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis and discharged with simple analgesia and antibiotics. Subsequent imaging of her renal tract demonstrated multiple large AMLs with evidence of recent bleeding, which required arterial embolisation.

### Imaging features of tuberous sclerosis complex with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease: a contiguous gene syndrome [^5df94d18]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Genes for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) type 2 and autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) type 1 are both encoded over a short segment of chromosome 16. When deletions involve both genes, an entity known as the TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, variable phenotypes of TSC and ADPKD are exhibited. This syndrome has not been reviewed in the radiology literature. Unlike renal cysts in TSC, cystic disease in TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome results in hypertension and renal failure. A radiologist might demonstrate polycystic kidney disease before the patient develops other stigmata of TSC. Conversely, in patients with known TSC, enlarged and polycystic kidneys should signal the possibility of the TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome and not simply TSC. Distinguishing these diagnoses has implications in prognosis, treatment and genetic counseling.

Objective

To describe the clinical and imaging findings of tuberous sclerosis complex and polycystic kidney disease in seven pediatric patients.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed renal and brain imaging of children and young adults with genetically proven or high clinical suspicion for TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome.

Results

We included seven pediatric patients from two referral institutions. Ages ranged from birth to 21 years over the course of imaging. The mean follow-up period was 9 years 8 months (4 years 6 months to 20 years 6 months). No child progressed to end-stage renal disease during this period. Three patients were initially imaged for stigmata of TSC, three for abdominal distension and one for elevated serum creatinine concentration. All patients developed enlarged, polycystic kidneys. The latest available imaging studies demonstrated that in 12 of the 14 kidneys 50% or more of the parenchyma was ultimately replaced by > 15 cysts, resulting in significant cortical thinning. The largest cysts in each kidney ranged from 2.4 cm to 9.3 cm. Echogenic lesions were present in 13 of the 14 kidneys, in keeping with angiomyolipomas (ranging from 0.4 cm to 7.8 cm). Compared to the latest imaging studies, the initial studies only demonstrated 64% of kidneys to be borderline or enlarged; the majority had 10 or more cysts and 0–5 echogenic foci in each kidney, measuring 0.8 cm maximally, which were possible angiomyolipomas. Increased cortical echogenicity was observed in eight kidneys, and decreased corticomedullary differentiation was demonstrated in six kidneys. Cortical thinning varied with size and number of cysts.

Conclusion

The sonographic renal findings in TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome progress over time and demonstrate a specific pattern of renal disease different from typical tuberous sclerosis complex. There are multiple cysts at presentation and there is progressive enlargement of the kidneys and of the renal cysts. Because clinical or imaging findings of TSC may not manifest in the young child, the radiologist can be the first to suggest a diagnosis of TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome and recommend thorough skin examination and imaging in search of TSC findings. The radiologist should be able to suggest the diagnosis of TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome in children with TSC who have large cysts occupying a large portion of an enlarged kidney. This should not be dismissed as renal cystic disease of TSC or as ADPKD because the diagnosis of TSC2/ADPKD1 contiguous gene syndrome has implications for patient management and prognosis.

### Renal involvement in tuberous sclerosis complex and Von Hippel-Lindau disease: shared disease mechanisms? [^587865ba]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Tuberous sclerosis complex and von Hippel-Lindau disease are distinct autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndromes that can exhibit similar renal phenotypes and seem to share some signaling pathway components. Similarities exist in the current clinical management of, and the newly identified potential therapeutic approaches for, these conditions. This Review summarizes the pathophysiologic and therapeutic overlap between tuberous sclerosis complex and von Hippel-Lindau disease and highlights the results of recent drug trials in these settings.

### Tuberous sclerosis complex surveillance and management: recommendations of the 2012 international tuberous sclerosis complex consensus conference [^234ac87b]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder affecting every organ system, but disease manifestations vary significantly among affected individuals. The diverse and varied presentations and progression can be life-threatening with significant impact on cost and quality of life. Current surveillance and management practices are highly variable among region and country, reflective of the fact that last consensus recommendations occurred in 1998 and an updated, comprehensive standard is lacking that incorporates the latest scientific evidence and current best clinical practices.

Methods

The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group, comprising 79 specialists from 14 countries, was organized into 12 separate subcommittees, each led by a clinician with advanced expertise in tuberous sclerosis complex and the relevant medical subspecialty. Each subcommittee focused on a specific disease area with important clinical management implications and was charged with formulating key clinical questions to address within its focus area, reviewing relevant literature, evaluating the strength of data, and providing a recommendation accordingly.

Results

The updated consensus recommendations for clinical surveillance and management in tuberous sclerosis complex are summarized here. The recommendations are relevant to the entire lifespan of the patient, from infancy to adulthood, including both individuals where the diagnosis is newly made as well as individuals where the diagnosis already is established.

Conclusions

The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Recommendations provide an evidence-based, standardized approach for optimal clinical care provided for individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex.
