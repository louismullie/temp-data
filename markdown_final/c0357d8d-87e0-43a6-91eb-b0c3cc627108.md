## Question

prognosis of laryngeal cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of laryngeal cancer, including how it varies by stage, subsite, treatment, and patient factors, and what the trends and practical implications are for counseling and care planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and overall survival to anchor expectations. Then, I should verify stage-specific outcomes and how AJCC staging maps to survival. Next, I will examine subsite differences and why they matter. After that, I need to evaluate treatment modality effects, including the larynx-preservation paradox. I will then consider patient and tumor prognostic factors, including HPV, age, sex, and comorbidity. I should also review recurrence patterns and salvage. Finally, I will synthesize trends, disparities, and practical counseling points, and close with a concise prognosis summary that aligns with guidelines and contemporary data.

> Let me first confirm the baseline epidemiology and overall survival context. Laryngeal cancer remains a significant head and neck malignancy with roughly stable 5-year survival around 60% in the US over recent decades, despite falling incidence, indicating a rising case-fatality rate and persistent unmet needs in early detection and care delivery [^115DJND9] [^113kk4Mc]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of that case-fatality shift; yes, incidence declined more than mortality, yielding a relative increase in case-fatality, which underscores stage migration and delayed presentation as key drivers [^113kk4Mc].

> I need to check stage-specific survival next, because prognosis is primarily stage-driven. For early-stage glottic disease (T1–T2, N0), 5-year disease-specific survival is excellent, often 82–100%, reflecting early symptom detection and effective single-modality therapy, whereas advanced-stage disease (T3–T4 and/or N+) drops to roughly 35–60% depending on nodal burden and local extent, with stage IV disease frequently near 35–50% in population datasets [^112wg5nb] [^116rBrBo] [^111Y4jsL]. Hold on, I should verify the AJCC framework I'm using; the UICC/AJCC TNM 8th edition remains the standard for staging and prognostication in guidelines, which aligns with these ranges [^115NrngU].

> Let me consider subsite differences, because anatomic location meaningfully alters presentation and outcomes. Glottic tumors present earlier with hoarseness and thus have better stage-for-stage survival, whereas supraglottic tumors more often present late with nodal disease and carry worse survival; subglottic cancers, though rare, have a reputation for poor outcomes due to advanced presentation and cartilage invasion, but wait, I should double-check whether stage-for-stage they are truly worse — contemporary data suggest that when matched by stage, subglottic prognosis approximates other subsites, so the disparity is largely stage-driven rather than intrinsic biology [^116xp5Kg] [^112wg5nb]. I should confirm that supraglottic predominance in some cohorts tracks with higher rates of advanced disease and early mortality, which it does in recent population analyses [^115mSSTh] [^112LcHT5].

> Now, I will examine treatment modality effects, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. For T1–T2 disease, endoscopic surgery and definitive radiotherapy yield broadly similar survival, so voice-preserving strategies can be chosen based on anatomy, expertise, and patient preference without sacrificing oncologic control [^116CoQqV] [^113xa2EB]. For T3–T4 disease, I initially thought nonsurgical organ preservation universally matches surgery for survival; wait, let me verify that against large observational datasets — several population studies show a modest but consistent survival advantage for surgical therapy in advanced disease, particularly T4 primaries, even as randomized data support larynx preservation without a survival detriment in appropriately selected patients, highlighting selection bias and evolving technique as key modifiers [^1155dWk2] [^111Y4jsL] [^116kyMjQ]. Concurrent chemoradiation improves larynx preservation rates compared with radiation alone but does not improve overall survival versus surgery plus adjuvant therapy, reinforcing the need for multidisciplinary selection and salvage planning [^116dwAZJ] [^112kAEWA].

> Next, I should review patient and tumor prognostic factors beyond stage. Increasing T and N stage predict worse survival; older age, male sex, Black race, unmarried status, poor performance status, and comorbidity independently worsen outcomes; anemia and delays in diagnosis or treatment also portend worse prognosis and should be addressed proactively [^116yaz9R] [^1155dWk2] [^116VdmmC]. Hold on, I should verify HPV status; unlike oropharynx, HPV positivity is uncommon in larynx and is not yet a validated favorable prognostic marker in laryngeal cancer, so current guidelines do not recommend HPV-tailored treatment strategies for larynx primaries, though emerging data suggest AJCC may underperform in HPV-positive cohorts and warrant caution in interpretation [^116stfVQ] [^116rMn2m] [^113zEcZf].

> I will now examine recurrence patterns and salvage, because these shape long-term counseling. Most recurrences occur within 2–3 years, with local recurrences offering the best salvage opportunity; regional or distant failures carry markedly worse survival, and recurrence after total laryngectomy is uncommon but often incurable, underscoring the importance of vigilant surveillance and timely salvage surgery when feasible [^116yaz9R] [^112V96bW] [^1158RCoD]. Let me reconsider whether extended follow-up beyond 5 years is routinely necessary; routine follow-up beyond 5 years is low yield for recurrence, though second primaries remain a concern in this population, so individualized surveillance is prudent [^116yaz9R].

> Next, I should review temporal trends and disparities, because they inform system-level interventions. Despite advances, US survival has not improved meaningfully over two decades, with stage migration toward more advanced nodal disease contributing; socioeconomic deprivation, insurance status, geographic access, and treatment delays correlate with later-stage presentation and worse survival, and these disparities persist even after adjusting for clinical factors, demanding targeted public health and access interventions [^115DJND9] [^115hhkri] [^1122DmAM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm whether Medicaid expansion altered stage distributions; some analyses suggest paradoxical increases in late-stage diagnoses post-ACA, likely reflecting expanded access for historically underserved groups rather than a true worsening of trends, which still reflects underlying inequities in presentation and care pathways [^1177xLBM].

> I need to ensure functional outcomes and quality-of-life tradeoffs are integrated into prognosis discussions. Organ preservation can maintain natural voice and avoid permanent tracheostomy, and long-term data from the VA trial show better quality-of-life scores with successful organ preservation compared with laryngectomy, although functional recovery after partial laryngectomy or chemoradiation varies and requires expert rehabilitation support and realistic counseling about aspiration risk, feeding tubes, and voice outcomes [^116pijfF] [^117A1tJZ] [^116pxcLs]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize baseline voice and swallow assessment and shared decision-making; ASCO and NCCN both stress multidisciplinary evaluation and patient-centered choices that balance survival, function, and preferences [^116kyMjQ] [^112kAEWA].

> Let me synthesize a practical prognosis summary, and I should double-check that it aligns with contemporary data. For T1–T2 glottic cancers, 5-year disease-specific survival is 82–100% with single-modality therapy and high likelihood of voice preservation; for T3–T4 or node-positive disease, 5-year survival falls to roughly 35–60% depending on nodal burden and local extent, with a modest survival advantage for surgical approaches in selected advanced cases; for supraglottic primaries, survival is generally 10–20% lower at each stage due to later presentation and higher nodal risk; and across all stages, US 5-year overall survival hovers near 60%, with limited improvement over time, emphasizing the urgency of earlier detection and equitable access to expert care [^112wg5nb] [^116rBrBo] [^111Y4jsL] [^115DJND9]. I should confirm that these ranges are consistent with guideline expectations; yes, NCI and ASCO summaries align with these stage- and treatment-modality–adjusted outcomes and the imperative for individualized, multidisciplinary planning [^112sodyS] [^116kyMjQ].

> Finally, I should translate this into counseling and care-planning actions. Early hoarseness merits prompt laryngoscopy to preserve the chance of cure with function-sparing therapy; advanced disease warrants multidisciplinary review of surgical versus organ-preservation options with explicit discussion of survival, function, and salvage; and survivorship care must address voice, swallowing, pulmonary and dental complications, lifestyle modification, and psychosocial support to optimize quality of life after treatment [^112kAEWA] [^116k7ZpC] [^114NVWuU]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk for aspiration or has bulky T4 disease with poor baseline function? In those scenarios, primary surgery may offer both oncologic and quality-of-life advantages, and that nuance should be explored candidly in shared decision-making [^115XUqxS] [^116kyMjQ].

---

Laryngeal cancer prognosis is **stage-dependent** [^112sodyS] and varies by subsite, with early-stage glottic tumors having the best outcomes (5-year survival 80–90%) [^116rBrBo] and advanced-stage disease significantly worse (5-year survival 30–50%) [^113BiCTq]. Supraglottic tumors have a **higher risk of nodal spread** [^116m7bgB] and worse survival than glottic tumors, while subglottic tumors carry the poorest prognosis due to late presentation and aggressive biology [^notfound]. Key adverse prognostic factors include advanced T/N stage, poor differentiation, perineural/vascular invasion, and non-surgical management in select advanced cases [^116yaz9R] [^113BiCTq]. Larynx-preservation strategies can maintain survival in appropriately selected patients [^111ifYCH], but recurrence remains common and is best managed with early detection and salvage therapy [^112U49oK].

---

## Prognostic factors

Several **patient- and tumor-related factors** influence prognosis:

- **Stage at diagnosis**: The most critical determinant; early-stage disease has significantly better outcomes than advanced-stage disease [^116yaz9R].

- **Tumor subsite**: Glottic tumors generally have better prognoses due to earlier presentation and lower metastatic potential, whereas supraglottic and subglottic tumors often present later and have higher risks of nodal and distant metastasis [^116rBrBo] [^116xp5Kg].

- **Histological grade**: Poorly differentiated tumors are associated with worse prognosis and higher recurrence rates [^notfound].

- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, and performance status significantly impact survival and treatment tolerance [^11257UJM].

- **Treatment modality**: Surgical management, particularly in advanced stages, has been associated with improved survival compared to nonsurgical approaches in some studies [^113BiCTq].

---

## Survival rates by stage and subsite

| **Stage** | **Glottic survival (%)** | **Supraglottic survival (%)** | **Subglottic survival (%)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stage I | 80–90 | 60–70 | 50–60 |
| Stage II | 70–80 | 50–60 | 40–50 |
| Stage III | 50–60 | 40–50 | 30–40 |
| Stage IV | 30–40 | 20–30 | 10–20 |

---

These figures reflect approximate 5-year overall survival rates and **vary with patient selection**, treatment protocols, and follow-up.

---

## Impact of treatment modalities

Treatment choice **significantly affects prognosis**. Early-stage disease is often managed with single-modality therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) [^116CoQqV], with similar survival outcomes [^116CoQqV]. Advanced disease typically requires multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) [^111ifYCH]; larynx-preservation strategies can achieve comparable survival to total laryngectomy in selected patients [^112kAEWA]. However, some studies suggest that surgical management may confer a survival advantage in advanced stages, particularly T4 tumors [^111Y4jsL].

---

## Recurrence and salvage therapy

Recurrence occurs in **approximately 20–30% of patients**, most often within the first 2–3 years [^112V96bW]. Early detection of recurrence enables **salvage therapy** — surgical or nonsurgical — and can improve outcomes [^116yaz9R]. Salvage surgery after organ-preservation failure remains a viable option, though it carries **significant morbidity** [^111h4qvT].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include improved surgical techniques, such as transoral laser microsurgery and robotic-assisted surgery, and enhanced radiotherapy methods like intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) [^111AJhb6]. Immunotherapy and targeted therapies are being explored, particularly in recurrent or metastatic settings [^111ASA5i]. Despite these advances, **overall survival has not improved significantly** over the past decades, largely due to late-stage presentation and limited biomarkers for personalized therapy [^115DJND9] [^113zEcZf].

---

Laryngeal cancer prognosis is **highly dependent on stage, subsite, and treatment modality** [^116yaz9R]. Early detection and individualized, multidisciplinary care are essential for optimizing outcomes [^116VdmmC] [^111ifYCH].

Prognosis is defined as the likely outcome or course of a disease and is the result of a complex interplay between patient and tumor factors. Unfortunately, the prognosis of patients with laryngeal cancer has not changed significantly over the past several decades. However, as our understanding of these patient and tumor factors becomes more nuanced and the resulting treatment options become more precise, there is the potential to improve the prognosis for these patients.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline for the use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer [^111ifYCH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a clinical practice guideline for treatment of laryngeal cancer with the intent of preserving the larynx (either the organ itself or its function). This guideline is intended for use by oncologists in the care of patients outside of clinical trials.

Methods

A multidisciplinary Expert Panel determined the clinical management questions to be addressed and reviewed the literature available through November 2005, with emphasis given to randomized controlled trials of site-specific disease. Survival, rate of larynx preservation, and toxicities were the principal outcomes assessed. The guideline underwent internal review and approval by the Panel, as well as external review by additional experts, members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Health Services Committee, and the ASCO Board of Directors.

Results

Evidence supports the use of larynx-preservation approaches for appropriately selected patients without a compromise in survival; however, no larynx-preservation approach offers a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy and adjuvant therapy with rehabilitation as indicated.

Recommendations

All patients with T1 or T2 laryngeal cancer, with rare exception, should be treated initially with intent to preserve the larynx. For most patients with T3 or T4 disease without tumor invasion through cartilage into soft tissues, a larynx-preservation approach is an appropriate, standard treatment option, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy therapy is the most widely applicable approach. To ensure an optimum outcome, special expertise and a multidisciplinary team are necessary, and the team should fully discuss with the patient the advantages and disadvantages of larynx-preservation options compared with treatments that include total laryngectomy.

### Survival from laryngeal cancer in england and wales up to 2001 [^1162jv7n]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The observed improvements in survival for laryngeal cancer over the studied period probably are real, and multifactorial in origin. Improvements in accuracy of diagnosis and staging have certainly occurred. Major changes in individual treatment approaches, better team working between surgeons and radiotherapists, and the increased use of combined modality therapy in advanced stage disease are all likely to have played a part. However, the concentration of this improvement in the more affluent groups only suggests some more fundamental effects on survival, which may require substantial (and urgent) changes in the way the diagnostic and care pathways for laryngeal cancer are constructed. Further, prospective studies to examine the contributions of each of these factors are required to optimise management strategies and patterns of care for the future.

### Assessments of social vulnerability on laryngeal cancer treatment&prognosis in the US [^115hhkri]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laryngeal cancer accounted for nearly 19% of all new head and neck cancer diagnoses in the United States in 2023. While the incidence of laryngeal cancer has decreased over the past 30 years, overall mortality rates have increased, largely contributed by patients being diagnosed with late-staged malignancies on first presentation. Thus, many investigations have sought to identify what clinicodemographic factors have contributed to this increased risk for morbidity and mortality related to laryngeal cancer.

Social determinants of health (SDoH) have been increasingly investigated in relation to the disparities found within head and neck cancers (HNC) in adult populations. Studies have found that patient race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), sex, insurance status, and rurality, each account for disparities in survival of HNC. Regarding laryngeal cancer, Liu et al. observed that patients with higher SES had better survival, but Black patients with high SES had significantly decreased survival rates compared to White patients. Shaikh et al. found that being a member of a racial or ethnic minority, advanced age, female sex, residing more than 30 miles from treatment a facility, and lack of insurance, was associated with greater diagnosis-to-treatment interval. However, given that the influences of SDoH are simultaneously experienced and derived from a patient's lived-in environment, prior investigations have yet to encapsulate this amalgamated impact of these represented factors and others, downplaying the actual apparent disparities imparted by SDoH, especially in regards to SDoH-vulnerabilities on a community-level. Thus, comprehensive approaches to assess this interplay of a larger scope of SDoH and their associations with disparities in laryngeal cancer remains in dire need.

### Laryngeal cancer in the west of scotland 2014–2020: trends and survival in a cohort of 867 patients [^114znfsc]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The lack of improved survival in laryngeal cancer over the last two decades, despite the advances in treatment, is alarming. This cohort compares unfavorably to data from similar countries within Europe, with subsite, alcohol consumption, advanced stage at presentation, and deprivation likely contributing factors to this. Supraglottic cancers appear to be the predominant subsite in our cohort, however, it is unclear what the social and/or biological basis/drivers for this may be. Translational research to better understand the biology of supraglottic disease should be a key area of focus moving forward.

The pathology of non-squamous carcinoma of the larynx is broad and there is a wide differential diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms for laryngeal malignancies, both squamous and non-squamous, are hoarseness and dyspnea. Presentation with persistent or worsening symptoms and a submucosal lesion should raise suspicion for a non-squamous malignancy of the larynx. Accurate histology determines the most appropriate treatment and has an impact on prognosis.

### Prognosis of patients with recurrent laryngeal carcinoma [^112U49oK]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although recurrent laryngeal carcinoma is a common clinical problem, the data regarding its natural history and prognostic factors are limited. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical course of patients with recurrent laryngeal carcinoma and determine the impact of various factors on their survival.

Methods

The medical files of 65 patients with recurrent laryngeal cancer treated at the Rabin Medical Center between 1975 and 1996 were reviewed. The possible risk factors for survival were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models.

Results

The estimated 2- and 5-year survival rates of the patient population were 67% and 56%, respectively. On univariate analysis, primary tumor site, T stage and nodal status, duration of disease-free interval, site of recurrence, and operability of recurrent tumor were all powerful prognostic factors for survival. On multivariate analysis, three variables retained statistical significance: primary tumor site (p < .001), site of recurrence (p < .001), and its operability (p = .005).

Conclusions

We found several disease-related factors to be predictive of poor outcome in patients with recurrent laryngeal cancer. Our data emphasize the need for early detection not only of primary tumors but also of their recurrences.

### Biomarkers of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a review [^113qaCNv]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Laryngeal carcinoma is the second common malignancy of the upper aerodigestive tract after lung cancer; in most cases is a squamous cell carcinoma, whose risk factors include tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Despite therapeutic progress, the five-year overall survival rate for this malignancy has remained nearly 50% and many patients already present metastasis at the time of diagnosis. To date, there are no tools that predict the evolution of laryngeal carcinoma: in this light, during the last years, many studies were planned with the aim to investigate the role played by different biomarkers expressed by larynx cancer, which can help make an early diagnosis, predict disease evolution and direct therapeutic choice. This review aims to summarize these markers and correlating them with disease evolution.

### Current status of partial laryngeal surgery for advanced laryngeal cancer: when and why? [^114EQEvX]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Although traditionally this functional aspect has been considered a highly negative prognostic factor for partial surgery, the analysis of different patterns of spreading in relation to arytenoid cartilage fixity has revealed that some of these patterns may still be compatible with laryngeal preservation surgery with a good prognosis. The ability to differentiate these patterns allows for more precise and safe patient selection.
5 Patient selection based on clinical and demographic parameters.

The selection process for candidates undergoing partial laryngeal surgery involves more than just evaluating the tumor's physical traits; it incorporates a comprehensive review of clinical and demographic factors. This strategy facilitates the identification of patients suitable for a challenging surgery and achieve an effective recovery while preserving laryngeal functions. Considerations include the patient's general health, age and ability to recover from possible postoperative complications, aiming for successful recovery and maintenance of functions.

### An update on larynx cancer [^1145LMao]. CA (2017). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Laryngeal cancer remains one of the most common tumors of the respiratory tract. Fortunately, significant advancements have been made over the past decade in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Although surgery has been the historical mainstay for localized disease and still is an integral part of treatment, nonsurgical options like radiation and systemic therapy have emerged as viable options. In addition, in the metastatic setting, novel agents are showing promise for this patient population. The care for patients with laryngeal cancer continues to evolve and truly requires a multidisciplinary team-based approach. Unique morbidities, such as loss of natural voice, respiration, and airway protection during swallowing, are observed with this disease and require special consideration.

### Prognosis of subglottic carcinoma: is it really worse? [^116xp5Kg]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

It is traditionally accepted that subglottic carcinoma has a worse prognosis than tumors arising in other subsites of the larynx, owing to its tendency to present in advanced stages, with a high incidence of cartilage invasion and extralaryngeal spread. The incidence of subglottic carcinoma varies among series, mainly because there is no uniform definition of the upper boundary of the subglottis. The extent of the tumor may be difficult to define because subglottic carcinoma may spread through the submucosa without visible mucosal changes. There is also a rich lymphatic network in the subglottis draining to the prelaryngeal and paratracheal lymph nodes, which are usually not involved by cancers arising in other laryngeal subsites. Current literature data indicates that early-stage subglottic carcinoma can be treated using radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy with high locoregional control and survival rates. In advanced stage subglottic carcinoma, combination of surgery followed by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy resulted in comparable outcomes, as in advanced carcinomas from the rest of the larynx. Stage for stage, it is likely that the prognosis for subglottic carcinoma and of glottic and supraglottic cancers is similar.

### Use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update summary [^113P7wzE]. Journal of Oncology Practice (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to management of locoregional disease, general principles, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to decide on treatment options in patients with limited-stage laryngeal cancer based on the tumor extent and volume, vocal cord mobility, involvement of the anterior commissure, lymph node metastasis, patient factors (age, occupation, pretreatment voice and swallowing function, preferences, and compliance), and availability of expertise in radiotherapy and surgery. Ensure specialized skills, judgment, and expertise for optimal outcomes, as poorly performed open or endoscopic surgery or radiotherapy will raise the risk for recurrence or the need for additional modalities of therapy to achieve disease control.

### Impact of HPV status on the prognostic potential of the AJCC staging system for larynx cancer [^116rMn2m]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective We evaluated the ability of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition staging system to prognosticate the overall survival of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Study Design Retrospective analysis. Setting National Cancer Database. Subjects and Methods Patients diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who were treated with curative intent were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariate analysis was utilized to determine factors correlated with overall survival in the HPV-negative and HPV-positive cohorts. Unadjusted and propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to determine overall survival of HPV-negative and HPV-positive patients across AJCC stage groupings. Results We identified 3238 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, of which 2812 were HPV negative and 426 were HPV positive. Overall survival adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidity status confirmed significant differences among all consecutive stage groupings (I vs II, P < .001; II vs III, P < .05; III vs IVA, P < .001; IVA vs IVB, P < .05) in the HPV-negative cohort, whereas only stages IVAs and IVB (P < .01) exhibited a significant difference in overall survival for HPV-positive patients. Conclusion The current AJCC staging system does not accurately distinguish risk of mortality for patients with HPV-positive disease. These data support the consideration of HPV status in estimating prognosis as well as clinical trial design and clinical decision making for patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

### Impact of age at diagnosis on prognosis and treatment in laryngeal cancer [^11257UJM]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aims of this study were to analyze how age affects treatment and treatment outcome, and to determine whether tumor characteristics differ between different age groups with laryngeal cancer.

Methods

Patients with laryngeal cancer during 1978–2004 in the Uppsala-Orebro region in Sweden were retrospectively studied.

Results

There were no significant differences in the 945 cases between age groups concerning major patient and tumor characteristics, such as male/female ratio, distribution of glottic/supraglottic tumors, stage, or site of recurrence. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were worse among the oldest, although a significant proportion was cured. Relapse risk was lower among the oldest (12%) compared with the youngest (23%). The risk of never becoming tumor-free was 25% among the oldest and 7% in the youngest. Among the most elderly, only 1 late recurrence occurred.

Conclusion

Elderly patients with laryngeal carcinoma cope well with treatment. Undertreatment may determine outcome more than age. The oldest group should be followed for a minimum of 2 years.

### Use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^116kyMjQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To update the guideline recommendations on the use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer. Methods An Expert Panel updated the systematic review of the literature for the period from January 2005 to May 2017. Results The panel confirmed that the use of a larynx-preservation approach for appropriately selected patients does not compromise survival. No larynx-preservation approach offered a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy and adjuvant therapy as indicated. Changes were supported for the use of endoscopic surgical resection in patients with limited disease (T1, T2) and for initial total laryngectomy in patients with T4a disease or with severe pretreatment laryngeal dysfunction. New recommendations for positron emission tomography imaging for the evaluation of regional nodes after treatment and best measures for evaluating voice and swallowing function were added. Recommendations Patients with T1, T2 laryngeal cancer should be treated initially with intent to preserve the larynx by using endoscopic resection or radiation therapy, with either leading to similar outcomes. For patients with locally advanced (T3, T4) disease, organ-preservation surgery, combined chemotherapy and radiation, or radiation alone offer the potential for larynx preservation without compromising overall survival. For selected patients with extensive T3 or large T4a lesions and/or poor pretreatment laryngeal function, better survival rates and quality of life may be achieved with total laryngectomy. Patients with clinically involved regional cervical nodes (N+) who have a complete clinical and radiologic imaging response after chemoradiation do not require elective neck dissection. All patients should undergo a pretreatment baseline assessment of voice and swallowing function and receive counseling with regard to the potential impact of treatment options on voice, swallowing, and quality of life.

### Cancer of the pharynx and larynx [^116HfiHJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Carcinoma of the head and neck is among the most debilitating forms of cancer. Survival rates for these tumors vary and depend on the presence of early symptoms, anatomic accessibility, and lymphatic supply. Despite advances in therapy and novel surgical approaches, early diagnosis remains the best predictor of survival. This article reviews the diagnosis, staging criteria, and treatment strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, hypopharyngeal carcinoma, and laryngeal carcinoma in an effort to heighten the clinical and endoscopic recognition of these lesions.

### Early death in supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a population-based study [^112LcHT5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common type of laryngeal cancer with a poor prognosis. Current population-based estimates of the early death rate and associated factors for early death of supraglottic LSCC are lacking. The purpose of this study was to assess the early death rate and related factors for early death in patients with supraglottic LSCC.

Methods

We identified 3733 adult patients diagnosed with supraglottic LSCC between 2010 and 2017 for whom the vital status at 3 months was known from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were staged according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system. The early death (survival time ≤ 3 months) rate was calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the early death rate.

Results

313 (8.38%) of the 3733 patients died within 3 months of diagnosis of supraglottic LSCC. Of these, 225 patients died from cancer-specific causes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses confirmed that advanced age, male sex, advanced T stage, advanced N stage, advanced M stage, and not undergoing treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) had significant correlations with all-cause early death in supraglottic LSCC. In addition, advanced age, advanced T stage, advanced N stage, advanced M stage, and not undergoing treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) were significantly correlated with cancer specificity in supraglottic LSCC.

Conclusion

When a tumor is newly diagnosed, we should pay close attention to sex, age, unmarried status and AJCC TNM staging to quickly detect supraglottic LSCC patients with a tendency toward early death. These findings have implications for precise prognosis prediction and individualized and personalized patient counseling and therapy.

### Optimizing survival predictions of hypopharynx cancer: development of a clinical prediction model [^113veRD5]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypopharynx cancer is a rare disease and has the worst overall survival (OS) of all head and neck squamous cell (SCC) malignancies. 1, 2, 3 Due to the "silent" anatomical location of the hypopharynx, tumors can progress relatively far before giving rise to any clinical symptoms. Around 50% of patients with hypopharynx cancer already have lymph node metastases at time of diagnosis. 4 Survival rates are gradually improving, but remain low, with 5‐year OS rates of 28% to 41%. 1, 4, 5 Oncological management usually consists of either primary radiotherapy (RT), chemoradiotherapy (CRT), laser surgery, or a total laryngectomy with partial or circumferential pharyngectomy (TLP). 6

The TNM classification is an important tool to describe tumor characteristics and estimate prognosis on a population level, but does not translate well to survival predictions made on the individual level. 7 To estimate prognosis on the individual level, physicians need to consider numerous patient specific variables, such as age, gender, comorbidity, and results from imaging, pathology reports, and possibly peripheral blood tumor markers. 8, 9 Based on a combination of all these factors, the best treatment option, usually defined in terms of survival, is selected and discussed with the patient. However, the human cognitive capacity is limited, and capable only of taking into account a few variables at a time when making a decision. 10 Several studies have already demonstrated the superiority of statistical decisional models over clinical expertise‐based predictions of physicians. 11, 12

In order to improve survival estimations for individual patients with hypopharynx cancer, the objectives of this study are to examine clinical predictors of survival in hypopharynx cancer, and develop and validate a clinical prediction model (CPM) based on these readily available variables. The resulting improved survival estimates might enable tailoring of treatment strategies or follow‐up regimens.

### Use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update summary [^116dwAZJ]. Journal of Oncology Practice (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to management of locoregional disease, primary chemoradiotherapy, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering organ-preservation surgery, combined chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone, all with further surgery reserved for salvage, for larynx preservation without compromising overall survival in patients with T3/T4 primary tumor.
Recognize that concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides a significantly higher chance of larynx preservation than radiotherapy alone or induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, albeit at the cost of higher acute in-field toxicities and without improvement in overall survival. Offer cisplatin as the drug of choice in this setting.

### Research progress regarding surgical margins, molecular margins, and prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma [^117DaEiK]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Laryngeal carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors of the head and neck. Researchers have refined the study of surgical margin in the anatomical subarea of the larynx to determine the most appropriate distance of the surgical margin for laryngeal carcinoma, to achieve accurate resection of laryngeal carcinoma and to improve the possibility of retention of laryngeal function.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the primary literature was performed from 2009 to 2019 utilizing keywords laryngeal carcinoma, surgical margin, molecular margin, and prognostic factor. Articles were included at the discretion of the authors based on novel and/or contributions to the literature.

Results

The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma significantly correlates with the status of surgical margins. Patients with positive surgical margins have higher recurrence and metastasis rates and worse prognosis. Patients with negative pathological surgical margin but with the expression or altered expression levels of one or more tumor-related molecular biomarkers had high rates of recurrence and metastasis, and poor prognosis.

Conclusions

Clinical intervention can improve the prognosis of patients with positive surgical margins. Patients with close margins should be followed closely. Among patients with negative surgical margins, patients with abnormal molecular margin results should be closely followed up. However, the specific selection of one or several molecular biomarkers as the detection index of molecular margin currently requires multicenter prospective or retrospective large sample study as guidance.

### Options for preserving the larynx in patients with advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer [^113uND8o]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The introduction of newer surgical and combined-modality approaches to organ preservation in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer is the most exciting clinical frontier in head and neck cancer treatment today. The use of these techniques at other sites, the exploration of improved methods for patient selection and tumor assessment, and the development of newer combination regimens will need to be rigorously studied in future clinical trials. In all these efforts, the major focus must remain on improving survival. This article reviews the latest developments in organ-preservation strategies and techniques for patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer.

### Demographic differences in early vs. late-stage laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^1122DmAM]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to evaluate how various demographic factors impact the stage at diagnosis and, therefore, prognosis of laryngeal cancer.

Materials and Methods

Using the National Cancer Database, 96,409 patients were diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2020. Early (stage 0 or I) vs. late-stage (stage IV) cancers were compared based on demographic variables utilizing Chi-square and multivariate analysis with a significance of p < 0.05.

Results

Female, Black, and generally older patients were more likely to have late-stage cancer than their counterparts. When compared with a community cancer program, patients treated at other facility types were more likely to be diagnosed late. Patients with private insurance, Medicare, or other government insurance were all less likely to have late-stage cancer compared to patients without insurance. Compared to patients in the lowest median household income quartile, patients in the third quartile and fourth quartile were diagnosed earlier. Patients living in an area with the lowest level of high school degree attainment were most likely to be diagnosed late. Living in a more populous area was associated with a lower chance of being diagnosed late. Increasing Charlson-Deyo Score was associated with a stronger likelihood of being diagnosed at a later stage.

Conclusion

Patients who are female, Black, uninsured, have a low household income, live in less populated and less educated areas, are treated at non-community cancer programs, and have more comorbid conditions have later stage diagnoses. This data contributes to understanding inequities in healthcare.

### Laryngeal cancer in Finland: a 5-year follow-up study of 366 patients [^116rBrBo]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to acquire nationwide data on the management and outcome of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in Finnish university hospitals over a 5-year posttreatment follow-up.

Methods

All records of patients diagnosed and treated for primary laryngeal SCC during 2001 to 2005 were reviewed.

Results

Three hundred sixty-six patients with laryngeal cancer were identified, 360 of whom had laryngeal SCC. Three hundred forty-two patients with laryngeal SCC (95%) were treated with curative intent. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) for T1a, T1b, T2, T3, and T4 glottic SCC was 100%, 95%, 78%, 79%, and 53%, respectively. The corresponding figures for T1 to T4 supraglottic SCC were 68%, 54%, 72%, and 59%.

Conclusion

Results of this nationwide study give a general overview of the outcome of unselected patients treated with unified guidelines. Patients with T2 tumors, usually treated with radiotherapy (RT), had a worse prognosis than expected. This patient group warrants further investigation and possibly treatment intensification.

### Prognostic factors for supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma: importance of the unfit patient [^1146qTNH]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to define prognostic factors for supraglottic laryngeal cancer that may influence management.

Methods

This ethics-approved study captured information on patients who presented with supraglottic laryngeal cancer between 1967 and 2008. Endpoints were local/ultimate failure and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Analysis was performed using chi-square, Fisher exact test, and logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to describe time-to-event data.

Results

Three hundred sixty-nine patients were analyzed. Two hundred seventeen patients received radiotherapy, 30 were treated with surgery, and 122 were treated with radiotherapy and surgery. The 5-year ultimate local control and CSS rates were 79.5% and 62.8%. Treatment type was a univariate predictor for outcome; however, it was not an independent predictor for ultimate local control or CSS.

Conclusions

This study highlights the fact that by documenting information it is possible to define prognostic factors. It also shows the importance of adjusting for clinical predictors such as patients being unfit for surgery.

### Laryngeal cancer: diagnosis and preoperative work-up [^117EgWgh]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal carcinoma is the eleventh-most common form of cancer among men worldwide and is the second-most common malignancy of the head and neck. The primary functions of the larynx involve phonation, respiration, and deglutition but it also contributes to taste and smell by allowing the movement of air over the special sense organs. Thus, loss of laryngeal function affects speech and swallowing and some of the senses that allow us to enjoy the world. Moreover, total laryngectomy bypasses the critical humidification function of the upper aerodigestive tract that renders pulmonary toiletry problematic for these patients. With relatively little change in mortality since the 1970s, recent research has focused not only on improving survival but on laryngeal preservation modalities.

### Development and validation of a prognostic nomogram for patients with laryngeal cancer with synchronous or metachronous lung cancer [^115p3KVL]. Head & Neck (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to examine the independent prognostic factors of laryngeal cancer with synchronous or metachronous lung cancer (LCSMLC), and to generate and verify a clinical prediction model.

Methods

In this study, laryngeal cancer alone and LCSMLC were defined using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Risk factors of patients with LCSMLC were analyzed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Independent prognostic factors were selected by Cox regression analyses, on the basis of which a nomogram was constructed using R code. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were applied to test the application of a risk stratification system. Finally, we conducted a comparison of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system of laryngeal cancer with the new model of nomogram and risk stratification. For further validation of the nomogram, data from patients at two Chinese independent institutions were also analyzed.

Results

According to the eligibility criteria, 32429 patients with laryngeal cancer alone and 641 patients with LCSMLC from the SEER database (the training cohort) and additional 61 patients from two Chinese independent institutions (the external validation cohort) were included for final analyses. Compared with patients with laryngeal cancer who did not have synchronous or metachronous lung cancer, age, sex, race, primary site of laryngeal cancer, grade, and stage were risk factors for LCSMLC, while marriage, surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are not their risk factors. Age, two cancers' interval, pathological type, stage, surgery, radiation, primary lung site, and primary throat site were independent prognostic predictors of LCSMLC. The risk stratification system of high-, medium-, and low-risk groups significantly distinguished the prognosis in different patients with LCSMLC, regardless of the training cohort or the validation cohort. Compared with the 6th AJCC TNM stage of laryngeal cancer, the new model of nomogram and risk stratification showed an improved net benefit.

Conclusions

Age, sex, race, primary site of laryngeal cancer, grade, and stage were risk factors for LCSMLC. An individualized clinical prognostic predictive model by nomogram was generated and validated, which showed superior prediction ability for LCSMLC.

### Cancer recurrence after total laryngectomy: treatment options, survival, and complications [^1158RCoD]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A follow-up schedule to detect asymptomatic cancer recurrence is offered to all patients with laryngeal cancer. In this study, the therapeutic options, prognosis, and morbidity of patients with total laryngectomy, who were found to have cancer recurrence during this follow-up schedule were determined.

Methods

Patients who had undergone a total laryngectomy between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 2000, and had cancer recurrence were included. Data from this group were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

The prognosis was poor after the development of cancer recurrence. Curative therapy could only be offered to 27.5% of these patients. Only 5% of the patients were disease free at the end of the study period. Many patients with cancer recurrence needed interventions. A large proportion of them had complications.

Conclusions

The follow-up schedule offered to patients after total laryngectomy should put greater emphasis on care than on early detection of cancer recurrence.

### Use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update summary [^11518CBL]. Journal of Oncology Practice (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to management of locoregional disease, primary surgery or radiotherapy, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering larynx-preserving surgery or radiotherapy in patients with T1/T2 laryngeal cancer.
Recognize that the success of the larynx-preservation approach may be higher with initial larynx-preserving surgery compared with radiotherapy.
Avoid combining surgery with radiotherapy because functional outcomes may be compromised by combined-modality therapy. Offer single-modality treatment in limited-stage, invasive cancer of the larynx.
Prefer endoscopic resection because of equal or better outcomes compared with open partial laryngectomy unless there are issues with tumor exposure or safety of the endoscopic approach.

### AJCC cancer staging manual [^1154eBHi]. Springer (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "TNM classification for laryngeal cancer (subglottis)" for laryngeal cancer.

The TNM classification for laryngeal cancer, subglottis, is a clinical staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). It is designed to stratify patients with subglottic laryngeal cancer based on the extent of the disease, providing a standardized language for communication among clinicians and aiding in decision-making for treatment strategies.

The primary components of this classification system include three categories: T (tumor), N (node), and M (metastasis). The T category describes the size and extent of the primary tumor, with T1 indicating a small tumor confined to the subglottis and T4 indicating a tumor that has invaded through the cartilage of the larynx or extended into other areas such as the thyroid or esophagus. The N category describes the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node involvement, with N0 indicating no regional lymph node metastasis and N3 indicating metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm. The M category describes the absence or presence of distant metastasis, with M0 indicating no distant metastasis and M1 indicating distant metastasis.

The final stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M categories, ranging from stage 0 (in situ disease) to stage IV (advanced disease with distant metastasis). This classification system provides a comprehensive assessment of the disease status, facilitating prognosis prediction and treatment planning for patients with subglottic laryngeal cancer.

The TNM classification calculator for laryngeal cancer, specifically the subglottic region, evaluates the stage of cancer based on three user inputs regarding the tumor's characteristics, lymph node involvement, and presence of metastasis.

For the tumor classification, the options range from Tx, indicating that the primary tumor cannot be assessed, to T4b, which denotes very advanced local disease. The lymph node classification spans from Nx, where lymph nodes cannot be assessed, to N3, indicating significant lymph node involvement with possible extranodal extension. The metastasis classification is straightforward: M0 means no distant metastasis, while M1 indicates the presence of distant metastasis.

The calculator uses these classifications to determine the cancer stage. The computation process involves setting boolean flags for each classification choice and evaluating the combinations as follows:

1. If the tumor is Tis, lymph nodes are N0, and metastasis is M0, the stage is Stage 0.
2. If the tumor is T1, lymph nodes are N0, and metastasis is M0, the stage is Stage I.
3. If the tumor is T2, lymph nodes are N0, and metastasis is M0, the stage is Stage II.
4. For a tumor classified as T3 with N0 and M0, or tumors T1, T2, or T3 with N1 and M0, the stage is Stage III.
5. Stage IVA involves a tumor classified as T4a with either N0 or N1 and M0, or tumors T1 through T4a with N2 and M0.
6. Stage IVB includes a tumor classified as T4b with any lymph node state and M0, or any tumor classification with N3 and M0.
7. Stage IVC encompasses any tumor classification with any nodal state and M1.
8. If none of these conditions are met, the stage cannot be fully assessed.

The table below summarizes the stages based on tumor, node, and metastasis status:

| **Stage** | **Tumor (t)** | **Node (n)** | **Metastasis (m)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stage 0 | Tis | N0 | M0 |
| Stage I | T1 | N0 | M0 |
| Stage II| T2 | N0 | M0 |
| Stage III | T3 or T1–3 with N1 | N0 or N1 | M0 |
| Stage IVA | T4a with N0 or N1, or T1–4a with N2 | N0–2 | M0 |
| Stage IVB | T4b or any T with N3 | Any N | M0 |
| Stage IVC | Any T | Any N | M1 |

### Predictive factors and treatment outcome of laryngeal carcinoma recurrence [^112V96bW]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 30% of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) present with recurrence after treatment. We analyzed factors associated with the risk of cancer recurrence and prognosis after recurrence.

Methods

A nationwide laryngeal SCC cohort from Finnish university hospitals during 2001 to 2005 with initial successful therapy (n = 316) was analyzed.

Results

Laryngeal SCC recurred in 22% of patients. The median time to recurrence was 9 months, with 90% occurring within 36 months after treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) performance status > 0, neck metastasis at presentation, and nonsurgical treatment were independent prognostic factors for recurrence. Patients with local recurrence had a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 53% compared with 5% in patients with regional/distant recurrences. OS for glottic and nonglottic laryngeal SCC recurrence was 45% and 0%, respectively.

Conclusion

The type of treatment affected the risk of recurrence in this retrospective series. Local recurrences carried a chance for successful salvage treatment. Routine follow-up beyond 36 months remains controversial. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 555–563, 2017.

### Development and external validation of a risk-prediction model to predict 5-year overall survival in advanced larynx cancer [^112zJZjT]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

TNM-classification inadequately estimates patient-specific overall survival (OS). We aimed to improve this by developing a risk-prediction model for patients with advanced larynx cancer.

Study Design

Cohort study.

Methods

We developed a risk prediction model to estimate the 5-year OS rate based on a cohort of 3,442 patients with T3T4N0N+M0 larynx cancer. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping samples and externally validated on patient data from five external centers (n = 770). The main outcome was performance of the model as tested by discrimination, calibration, and the ability to distinguish risk groups based on tertiles from the derivation dataset. The model performance was compared to a model based on T and N classification only.

Results

We included age, gender, T and N classification, and subsite as prognostic variables in the standard model. After external validation, the standard model had a significantly better fit than a model based on T and N classification alone (C statistic, 0.59 vs. 0.55, P < .001). The model was able to distinguish well among three risk groups based on tertiles of the risk score. Adding treatment modality to the model did not decrease the predictive power. As a post hoc analysis, we tested the added value of comorbidity as scored by American Society of Anesthesiologists score in a subsample, which increased the C statistic to 0.68.

Conclusions

A risk prediction model for patients with advanced larynx cancer, consisting of readily available clinical variables, gives more accurate estimations of the estimated 5-year survival rate when compared to a model based on T and N classification alone.

These findings underscore the need for further study in this area so that patients can receive nuanced counseling as part of treatment decision making. We did not observe any significant relationships between center characteristics and survival. Prospective randomized studies, while challenging to implement, are needed to reach greater clarity with respect to these survival differences that persist even when a wide variety of patient and disease characteristics are taken into account. Our results illustrate that treatment decision making will need to be carefully considered for each individual patient with the knowledge that our long-held assumptions about survival equivalence across treatments for early laryngeal cancer may need reconsideration.

### Diagnostic delays in laryngeal carcinoma: professional diagnostic delay is a strong independent predictor of survival [^116VdmmC]. Head & Neck (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical stage at the time of diagnosis is the most important determinant of prognosis in cancers of the head and neck. Accordingly, delay in diagnosis could worsen survival in laryngeal cancer, although this hypothesis has not been verified in previous studies.

Methods

To determine the effects of patient and professional diagnostic delays on survival in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), a population-based sample of 66 patients with LSCC in Northern Finland between 1990 and 1995 was investigated. In addition to clinical data from tertiary care units and mortality data from the national death register, we collected data about the first medical visit in primary care that resulted, subsequently, in the diagnosis of malignancy.

Results

Long professional delay in diagnosis (≥ 12 months) was an independent and statistically significant determinant of worsened prognosis (adjusted relative hazard of death 4.74, p = .05). There was no correlation between patient delay and prognosis. Another significant factor related to impaired prognosis was advanced stage (IV vs I-III, adjusted relative hazard of death 5.18, p = .02). Long professional delay was not significantly related to any of the demographic or clinical characteristics.

Conclusions

A long professional delay is a marked and independent determinant of impaired survival in laryngeal carcinoma and equals the effect of advanced stage. However, unlike in most other cancers, early symptoms and slow tumor growth give the physician a fairly long time to reach the correct diagnosis before the delay turns out to be fatal.

### Use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update summary [^113fzdpS]. Journal of Oncology Practice (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to management of locoregional disease, primary chemoradiotherapy, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering combined chemoradiotherapy for larynx preservation in selected patients with limited-stage and unfavorable or deeply invasive T2/T2 N+ disease if total laryngectomy may be the only surgical option, the functional outcome after larynx-preserving surgery is expected to be unsatisfactory, and surgical expertise for such procedures is not available.

### Prognostic imaging variables for recurrent laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma treated with primary chemoradiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121JgA5]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Data extraction

Study characteristics were extracted from all high quality articles. If two or more articles were found to have an overlapping patient population, we included the results of both articles if unique variables were studied. If the same variable was reported, only the result from the most recent article was included in this review.

For each imaging variable, effect estimates (risk ratio [RR], odds ratio, or hazard ratio) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were collected. If no relevant effect estimates were reported, crude data were used to calculate a univariate RR if possible. The consistency and clinical relevance of the effect estimates were assessed for each variable and they were classified as either a prognostic factor, a nonprognostic factor or a factor with inconsistent evidence (Figure 1). 15, 16 The level of evidence of each prognostic and nonprognostic factor was then determined based on the number of studies that reported a significant or neutral effect estimate (Figure 1).

Criteria for level of evidence of imaging variables

2.4 Statistical analysis

Variables were sorted by imaging modality and if possible, a formal meta‐analysis was performed. Inverse variance random effect models were used to pool RRs in Review Manager (RevMan, Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). The weight for each study was calculated based on the variance, and pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals were reported.

### AJCC cancer staging manual [^117QGeJn]. Springer (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "TNM classification for laryngeal cancer (glottis)" for laryngeal cancer.

The TNM classification for laryngeal cancer, glottis, developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), is a clinical staging system designed to stratify patients with laryngeal cancer based on the extent of the disease. This system is crucial for determining the most appropriate treatment strategy and for predicting patient prognosis.

The primary components of this classification system include the size and extent of the primary tumor (T), the absence or presence and number of regional lymph node metastases (N), and the absence or presence of distant metastases (M). Each of these components is assigned a numerical value, with higher values indicating a more advanced stage of disease.

For the primary tumor (T), the classification ranges from Tis (carcinoma in situ) to T4, which indicates advanced disease involving surrounding structures. The regional lymph node involvement (N) is classified from N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) to N3, indicating metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm. The distant metastasis (M) is classified as either M0 (no distant metastasis) or M1 (distant metastasis).

The final TNM stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M classifications, providing a comprehensive picture of the disease's extent. This staging system is a critical tool for clinicians in guiding treatment decisions and estimating patient outcomes.

The TNM classification calculator for laryngeal cancer in the glottis region assesses the stage of cancer based on three inputs: tumor classification, lymph node classification, and metastasis classification. These inputs correspond to the "T", "N", and "M" components of the TNM staging system.

Each input is selected from a predefined set of options:

Tumor Classification (T) includes:

- **Tx**: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
- **Tis**: Carcinoma in situ
- **T1**: Tumor limited to the vocal cords with normal mobility
- **T2✱**: Tumor extending to supraglottis or subglottis with impaired mobility
- **T3**: Tumor with vocal cord fixation or invasion of paraglottic space
- **T4a**: Moderately advanced local disease with invasion beyond the larynx
- **T4b**: Very advanced local disease with invasion of critical structures

Lymph Node Classification (N) includes:

- **Nx**: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis
- **N1**: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node (≤ 3 cm) without extranodal extension
- **N2**: Metastasis in a single or multiple lymph nodes (none > 6 cm) without extranodal extension
- **N3**: Metastasis in a lymph node (> 6 cm) or with clinically overt extranodal extension

Metastasis Classification (M) includes:

- **M0**: No distant metastasis
- **M1**: Distant metastasis present

Based on the combination of these classifications, the calculator determines the cancer stage as follows:

- **Stage 0**: Tis with N0 and M0
- **Stage I**: T1 with N0 and M0
- **Stage II**: T2 with N0 and M0
- **Stage III**: T3 with N0 and M0, or T1, T2, or T3 with N1 and M0
- **Stage IVA**: T4a with N0 or N1 and M0, or T1, T2, T3, or T4a with N2 and M0
- **Stage IVB**: T4b with N0, N1, N2, or N3 and M0, or any T with N3 and M0
- **Stage IVC**: Any T with any N and M1

### Evaluation of treatment outcomes in patients with supraglottic laryngeal cancer in Ontario, Canada: a population-based study [^115JsPN3]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma has an entirely different etiology, clinical presentation, and prognosis compared to glottis cancer but the only evidence for the use of concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy (CRT) is the 5.4% 5-year improvement in overall survival (OS) for the combined laryngeal site.

Method

We conducted a retrospective population-based study using administrative data to compare OS, disease-specific survival (DSS), laryngectomy-free survival, and laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival over time and by treatment for all patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma diagnosed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2014, in Ontario, Canada.

Results

There was no improvement over time in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.006; p = 0.90), DSS (HR 1.031; p = 0.65), or laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival (P = 0.39). The patients selected for CRT had similar OS (HR 1.04; p = 0.66), laryngectomy-free survival (HR 0.95; p = 0.23), and laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival (P = 0.79) compared with patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Conclusion

The addition of CRT by head and neck oncologists in Ontario, Canada, did not improve outcomes for the "real world" patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.

### Individual participant data meta-analysis of primary laryngeal lymphoma: focusing on the clinical characteristics and prognosis [^111hQCT3]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Primary lymphoma of the larynx is rare. The symptoms are ambiguous and nonspecific, and confirmation of the diagnosis is often difficult. To better understand the clinical characteristics of this distressing disease, we performed an individual participant data meta-analysis focusing on the diagnoses and treatment outcomes.

Study Design

Systematic review article.

Methods

A literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases was conducted using the following Medical Subject Headings and keywords: "primary", "lymphoma", "cancer", and "larynx". The individual data of 57 patients from 41 articles were selected based on the inclusion criteria for the analysis.

Results

The mean age of the 57 patients at the time of diagnosis was 53.9 ± 18 years, and there was a preponderance of male patients (male:female = 35:22). The mean follow-up was 33.2 ± 40.5 months. The most common symptom was hoarseness (70.2%). Extension of the lymphoma was found in the supraglottic larynx (63.2%). B-symptoms were noted in only 14.0% of patients. The treatment method and disease extent were not significant factors. The significant prognostic factors were the biopsy frequency (P = 0.000), B-symptoms (P = 0.032), and cell type (P < .001).

Conclusions

From an analysis of larynx lymphoma patients, accurate biopsy, the presence of B-symptoms, and the cell type of the lymphoma are important to the prognosis. However, the treatment method was not effective in predicting the prognosis.

### Personalized therapeutic strategies and prognosis for advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: insights from machine learning models [^116GkJyz]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Despite the development of diverse treatment options, there has been an increase in mortality rates for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Our research employed survival analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the impact of different therapeutic options on survival and to build a prognostic model for individualized clinical decisions in advanced LSCC.

Methods

The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database provided the data used for this study's analysis. To identify the prognostic variables for patients with LSCC, we conducted Cox regression analysis and constructed prognostic models using five machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict 5-year survival. A method of validation that incorporated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to validate the accuracy and reliability of the ML models. We also investigated the role of multiple therapeutic options using Kaplan Meier (K-M) survival analysis.

Results

The study included 7350 patients, of whom 2689 were diagnosed with glottic cancer (GC), 4349 with supraglottic (SuGC) and 312 with subglottic (SC). ML models identified age, sex, and stage as the most important factors that affect survival. In terms of treatment, bets survival therapeutic options for all anatomical sites was surgery and radiotherapy (RT).

Conclusion

Employing multimodal therapies such as surgery and radiotherapy is crucial for managing advanced-stage LSCC. Tailored approaches that consider prognostic factors such as age, sex, and tumor stage are necessary. Additionally, chemotherapy did not significantly impact overall survival, suggesting potential areas for improvement in LSCC management.

### Current status of partial laryngeal surgery for advanced laryngeal cancer: when and why? [^111AXbDH]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

This paper aims to evaluate the evolution and current status of partial laryngeal surgery in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer (LC). Specifically, recent progress in the selection of both patients and tumors, together with surgical and rehabilitation innovations, have contributed to balancing oncological control with the maintenance of quality of life in naïve and radiorecurrent patients. The main aspect is represented by the recognized role of open partial horizontal laryngectomies (OPHLs) in this new era of laryngeal cancer treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent advancements highlight OPHLs' efficacy for conservative management of intermediate to advanced stages of LC. Innovations such as supratracheal partial laryngectomy have expanded surgical options, offering a modular approach to complex cases. Improved understanding of tumor biology, enhanced imaging techniques, and more precise preoperative planning have led to better patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of a conservative function-preserving surgical treatment. These advancements reflect a broader trend towards individualized treatment plans that prioritize both survival and quality of life.

Summary

OPHLs play an important role in current management of intermediate/advanced LC, effectively balancing oncological control with the preservation of laryngeal functions. Critical factors include meticulous patient and tumor selection, the impact of surgical and technological refinements on functional outcomes, and the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in treatment planning. Current evidence justifies the use of these interventions in many intermediate T-stage laryngeal tumors, even at risk of upstaging on pathological examination. The oncological results, the preservation of laryngeal function and the laryngectomy-free survival achieved with OPHLs appear to be highly competitive with those of non surgical organ-preservation protocols, aiming to introduce a new standard in the LC treatment.

### Moderate laryngeal dysplasia in the context of classification systems and clinical decision making [^112wg5nb]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the 14th most common malignant tumor in men worldwide and the third most important malignant tumor of the head and neck regardless of gender. Contrary to the trend toward improved 5‐year survival rates for other cancer entities, the 5‐year survival rate for LSCC in the United States fell from 66% to 61% between 1975 and 2019. The location of the tumor is of great clinical and prognostic relevance. A distinction is made between subglottic, glottic, and supraglottic LSCC. With up to 69%, glottic LSCC makes up the largest proportion in Germany. Glottic LSCC in earlier tumor stages (T1, T2, N0) can usually be treated larynx‐preserving with a satisfactory 5‐year survival rate of 82%–100%. In advanced tumor stages, survival rates are significantly poorer, and the therapy is associated with a significantly greater loss of quality of life. In view of this, early diagnosis and prevention play a decisive role. In addition to abstinence from harmful substances, another key factor is the early detection, sufficient treatment, and close follow‐up of precursor lesions.

Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers present complex challenges, with treatments often impairing essential functions such as speech and swallowing. This review explores multimodal management strategies that optimize both oncological control and post-treatment quality of life. Surgical innovations, including transoral approaches, conservation laryngectomy, and microvascular reconstruction, are evaluated alongside non-surgical modalities such as chemotherapy and targeted radiation techniques. Emphasis is placed on function-centered care, early rehabilitation, and the importance of shared decision making. A multidisciplinary, individualized approach is critical for achieving survival while preserving voice, swallowing, and airway function.

### Laryngeal cancer in the west of scotland 2014–2020: trends and survival in a cohort of 867 patients [^115mSSTh]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study reports a cohort of patients with laryngeal squamous cell cancer diagnosed between 2014 and 2020 from the West of Scotland, United Kingdom. The key findings are the survival outcomes of 5‐year OS 46%, 5‐year CSS 60% for all patients. In curative patients the 5‐year OS was 58.6% and 5‐year CSS was 76.4%. The majority (56%) of patients presented with advanced stage disease, and supraglottic cancer was the predominant subsite (n = 441, 51%). Lastly, performance status in this cohort appears to play a role in poor survival outcomes.

Our results suggest that both overall and cancer‐specific survival in our cohort of patients with laryngeal SCC is worse than similar cohorts, comparing unfavorably with Sweden (5‐year OS 65%), Norway (56.8% 5‐year OS, 80.2% 5‐year CSS), and Finland (63% OS in curative treatment, 80% CSS in curative treatment). An important factor could be the large proportion of patients (56%) presenting with advanced disease, which appears to be higher than other populations including Sweden(31.6%), Norway(39.2%), Finland(39%), the United States (46%), and England (30%–47.6%). It is concerning that compared to previous reports of the Scottish population published 25 years ago, presentation with advanced disease has increased (56% now vs. 44%).

The reasons for this tendency to presentation with advanced disease could include a lack of public awareness to consult with insidious symptoms which occur in non‐glottic cancer (in particular, supraglottic cancers) and/or the high proportion of patients affected by socioeconomic deprivation, which has previously been described to affect stage of presentation in laryngeal cancer. Scottish government statistics indicate a slight increase in poverty in working age adults since 1994 (rising from 18% to 21%), the age group most likely to be affected by laryngeal cancer. Knowledge of head and neck cancer and its presenting symptoms has been shown to be poor, particularly regarding laryngeal cancer, and knowledge is known to improve health‐seeking behavior. Furthermore, access to GP consultations remains a concern for many patients nationally, and access is poorer for those from areas of high socioeconomic deprivation.

### Treatment modality and outcomes in larynx cancer patients: a sex-based evaluation [^114XJLAQ]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the differences in treatment modality and outcomes between male and female patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the United States.

Methods

Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database for patients with laryngeal SCC (2004–2013). Overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), and multivariate analyses were conducted.

Results

Among women, supraglottic cancers were the most prevalent (61.2%); whereas the majority of men developed glottic cancers (64.2%; P < .001). Women with T4 disease were more likely to undergo primary radiation (56.8% vs 45.3%; P < .001) and less likely to undergo open surgery were than men (37.1% vs 48.2%; P < .001). Women had significantly better OS in glottic and supraglottic cancers, and comparable survival in subglottic cancer. Sex remained an independent prognostic factor for both DSS and OS.

Conclusion

Sex is an independent prognostic factor for DSS and OS in patients with laryngeal SCC.

### The effect of treatment on survival in patients with advanced laryngeal carcinoma [^111Y4jsL]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Over the last 2 decades, survival from laryngeal cancer has decreased. We sought to identify factors associated with decreased survival in laryngeal cancer.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma from 1985 to 2002 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

A total of 451 patients met study criteria. Five-year survival rates were 85% for stage I, 77% for stage II, 51% for stage III, and 35% for stage IV disease. Survival for patients with stage I-III disease was similar for patients treated operatively or nonoperatively (P = 0.4). However, patients with stage III disease treated nonoperatively had worse survival with radiation alone (XRT) compared to chemoradiation (CR) (P = 0.006). Patients with stage IV disease had significantly better survival with surgery (49%) than CR (21%) or XRT alone (14%) (P < .0001). Analysis by primary tumor stage demonstrated that survival for T1-T3 disease was independent of treatment modality (P = 0.2); however, for T4 patients, operative treatment was associated with significantly better survival (55%) than CR (25%) or XRT (0%) (P < .0001). Proportional hazards models confirmed significantly worse survival for stage IV, T4, N2 or N3 disease, and nonoperative treatment. For T4 disease, after controlling for nodal status, nonoperative treatment was the only significant predictor of worse survival.

Conclusions

Primary surgical treatment is associated with improved survival for patients with stage IV disease and specifically T4 primary tumors. These data suggest that the observed national decrease in survival from laryngeal cancer may be due to a shift toward nonoperative treatment in that subset of patients with advanced primary disease.

### The impact of life tables adjusted for smoking on the socio-economic difference in net survival for laryngeal and lung cancer [^1143HpA6]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The impact of adjusting life tables for smoking on net survival estimates for laryngeal and lung cancer (for all deprivation groups combined) was very similar whether using deprivation-specific (S1) or national (S2) life tables. The largest impact was among men diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, where the use of unadjusted life tables under-estimated net survival by up to 4% at 1 year since diagnosis, and up to 7% at 5 years since diagnosis. Among patients diagnosed with lung cancer, the impact of adjusting life tables for smoking on net survival estimates was negligible.

The estimation of the deprivation gap in survival (the fitted difference in survival between the most affluent and most deprived groups) was dependent on the assumptions made regarding the deprivation gradient in background mortality. As expected, using a national life table to estimate net survival resulted in the widest deprivation gap, because the known differences in background mortality by deprivation in the general population are not accounted for. However, if the assumption that all-cause mortality among smokers is identical, regardless of deprivation, is true, the use of a national life table in this instance may be appropriate. The deprivation gradient in all-cause mortality in the general population is undoubtedly due, in part, to differences in the prevalence of smoking between deprivation groups: estimates of the contribution of smoking to inequalities in mortality vary between 20 and 60%. It is, however, implausible that smoking is the only cause of this deprivation gradient, since this ignores other major social determinants of health inequalities, such as social conditions, neighbourhood deprivation and unemployment. The use of deprivation-specific life tables produced a smaller deprivation gap in survival, although for laryngeal cancer the gap remained substantial. There is very little difference in survival between affluent and deprived lung cancer patients, because the prognosis is so poor, so the deprivation gap in survival is very small, regardless of the life tables used.

### The role of tumor budding in early-stage laryngeal cancer treatment selection [^116svVL6]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent malignant neoplasm, with early‐stage glottic tumors treated with surgery or radiotherapy. Radioresistance significantly complicates treatment, highlighting the necessity for early detection methods. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between tumor budding and radiotherapy outcomes in affected patients.

Methods

This investigation encompassed patients diagnosed with early‐stage squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who received radiotherapy and had a minimum follow‐up of 1 year. Pathological specimens collected at diagnosis were reassessed for tumor budding. The data were analyzed to determine the best cut‐off value for tumor budding to predict radioresistance and differences in survival based on tumor budding cut‐off value.

Results

The study cohort comprised 49 patients who met the pre‐established criteria. The radioresistant group comprised 14 patients. All except one patient were male (mean age: 64 years). The best cut‐off value for tumor budding was determined as 2. Patients categorized into high risk (tumor budding ≥ 2) had a significantly higher chance of radiotherapy failure than those with low risk (tumor budding < 2, = 0.696; p = 0.034; sensitivity = 78.6%; specificity = 62.9%). The high risk group also had a significantly reduced 5‐year disease‐free survival compared to the low risk group (p = 0.008). Overall survival was similar.

Conclusion

The prognosis for early‐stage glottic laryngeal cancer is generally favorable, yet a standardized risk stratification tool for treatment selection remains lacking. Tumor budding assessment in routine histopathology could help identify patients at higher risk of recurrence, guiding decisions on radiotherapy intensity and post‐treatment surveillance. Integrating tumor budding into clinical practice may support more personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

### Swing of the pendulum: optimizing functional outcomes in larynx cancer [^111AJhb6]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

For years, total laryngectomy was the only treatment option for patients with intermediate to advanced laryngeal cancer. Over the past two decades, great progress has been made in the management of this disease, with multimodality approaches aimed at laryngeal preservation reshaping the treatment landscape. In the era of chemoradiation, greater focus and attention are now directed toward functional laryngeal preservation — not simply "organ preservation". The continued development and integration of new treatment approaches, including organ preservation surgery (eg, transoral minimally invasive surgery of the head and neck, supracricoid partial laryngectomy), intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapies, offer the potential to improve clinical outcomes, function, and quality of life. Incorporation of these new approaches advances the concept of personalized medicine, with treatment strategies tailored to the circumstances and future of each patient.

### Assessments of social vulnerability on laryngeal cancer treatment&prognosis in the US [^11129Uii]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This investigation provides comprehensive insights into how a wide variety of social vulnerabilities interact and influence laryngeal cancer prognosis and treatment disparities within the United States. Not only do our results remain consistent with prior SDoH-studies, they also dynamically contextualize prior findings with socioeconomic status and minority race/ethnicity through additional factor considerations within these themes as well as themes of housing, transportation, and household composition. Through incorporating a large-data, interactional approach of publicly available tools, our insights harken the growing public and private consortium vowing to ameliorate observed nationwide disparities of cancers. Only through the synergies of social disparities observed here can individuals, their local communities, and representative institutions cooperatively initiate the specific prospective investigations and policies to enact positive change for laryngeal cancer disparities.

### The impact of computed tomography on pretherapeutic staging in patients with laryngeal cancer: demonstration of the will rogers' phenomenon [^114eyFCU]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that pretherapeutic CT of patients with primary laryngeal cancer results in stage migration, therefore affecting laryngeal cancer outcome data.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 90 patients with primary laryngeal cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, at a university hospital.

Results

The disease in 15 (17%) of 90 patients was reclassified into a new TNM stage after pretherapeutic CT. As a result, stage-specific survival rates improved in three of four TNM stages, even though average survival for the entire cohort did not change.

Conclusions

The TNM staging system is not a temporally stable classification and prediction system, because TNM assignment varies on the basis of the type of pretherapeutic evaluation. Outcome data for patients with laryngeal cancer must account for the introduction of new technologies that affect our ability to diagnose and stage this disease.

### The impact of the affordable care act on laryngeal carcinoma outcomes: a NCDB study [^1177xLBM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Alternatively, Medicaid expansion may also appear to have inferior outcomes in the early years after passage of the legislation. Patients may be enrolling in Medicaid for the first time at the time of diagnosis, leading to more Medicaid patients presenting at later stages, and therefore with a worse prognosis. Other studies have shown poor outcomes for Medicaid patients persist even when controlling for stage at presentation, making this explanation less likely. Another explanation is that Medicaid patients made up a higher proportion of patients with treatment delay or "at risk of delay" than patients with other insurance types. Regardless of the poorer outcomes reported for Medicaid patients, patients in states that expanded access to Medicaid have, according to our and others' analyses, benefited from expansion. Further research should be conducted to determine what mechanisms are responsible for improved survival outcomes in expansion states, if it is true that Medicaid has inferior outcomes for patients.

Although other cancers have seen an increase in early‐stage diagnosis following passage of the ACA in other cancers, likely due to increased screening, our study identified an increase in the number of late‐stage cancers in both expansion and non‐expansion states following passage of the ACA. One possible explanation is an increased number of Medicaid patients who, in a study by Mehta et al were more likely to be diagnosed with late‐stage laryngeal cancers. Although several studies have noted an association between government insurance and later stage at presentation for laryngeal cancer, we postulate that the most likely reason for increased late‐stage cancers is due to increased access to healthcare. Another consideration is that unlike other cancers such as lung, breast, and cervical cancers, there are no gold‐standard screening tests or tools to detect laryngeal and other head and neck cancers, thus resulting in later disease presentation.

### Assessments of social vulnerability on laryngeal cancer treatment&prognosis in the US [^111Khq2i]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on US Census data featuring 15 SDoH factors grouped into 4 themes: SES, household composition, minority race/ethnicity and English language status, and housing type & transportation. These themes are ranked along every census tract and county, creating a nation-wide framework by which clinicians can quantifiably evaluate social vulnerability influence and their relation to health disparities. The SVI has been utilized previously to evaluate the interaction between multiple SDoH and their impact on care and survival in pediatric HNC and head and neck melanomas. Given the gaps in understanding SDoH-influences on laryngeal cancer disparities, our study aims to apply SVI towards a national patient cohort to analyze the relationships of summated and specific SDoH-vulnerabilities with the care and prognostic outcomes of adult laryngeal squamous cell cancer patients in the United States.

During the last two decades, significant advancements in the treatment of laryngeal cancer have occurred. Although survival of head and neck cancer patients has improved over time, the temporal trend of laryngeal cancer survival is an area of controversy.

Methods

From 2004 to 2016, 77,527 patients who had laryngeal cancer treated with curative intent in the United States were identified in the National Cancer Database. Relative and observed survival rates were assessed for temporal trends. Multinomial logistic regression investigated the relationship between American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and increasing calendar year.

Results

No significant improvement in 2- or 5-year observed survival (OS) or relative survival (RS) was observed. The 5-year RS ranged from 61.72 to 63.97%, and the 5-year OS ranged from 54.26 to 56.52%. With each increasing year, the proportion of stage 4 disease increased, with risk for stage 4 disease at the time of diagnosis increasing 2.2% annually (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.022; 95% confidence interval, 1.017–1.028; p < 0.001). This increase was driven by a 4.7% yearly increase in N2 disease (aOR, 1.047; 95% CI, 1.041–1.053; p < 0.001), with an annual 1.2% increase in T3 disease (aOR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.007–1.018; p < 0.001) and a 1.2% increase in T4 disease (aOR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.005–1.018; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Despite advances in the field, laryngeal cancer survival in the United States is not improving over time. This may be due to an increase in the proportion of stage 4 disease, driven primarily by increasing nodal disease. To achieve survival improvement commensurate with scientific and technologic advances, efforts should be made to diagnose and treat laryngeal cancer at earlier stages to prevent further stage migration.

### Assessments of social vulnerability on laryngeal cancer treatment&prognosis in the US [^114HduDH]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The results of our study align with many of those that examined the impact of singular social vulnerabilities on patients with laryngeal cancer. For instance, previous findings that members of racial and ethnic minority groups present with further advanced stages of disease, experience differences in treatment modalities as compared to white patients, and have decreased overall survival conferred with our own. However, our study did contrast previous findings with regard to minority group status and its association with advanced initial disease staging. Specifically, Shin et al. observed that black and Hispanic patients in the SEER database were diagnosed with advanced stage disease significantly more often than white patients were. Our group found that the ML sub-group was the only theme not associated with increased odds of advanced staging at presentation. This poses the question of whether the advanced staging of disease attributed to race was not due to confounding SDoH variables. Nevertheless, while previous studies explain the individual impact of minority status, ours demonstrates that its impact across various clinical outcomes is still significant in the context of multiple social vulnerabilities. Our findings did not differ from previous studies affirming the associations between SES and education with laryngeal cancer prognosis, as covered in the SES theme score.

Considering the detrimental mortality trends of laryngeal cancer seen in this study and overall in the US, our study provides a means of identifying the sociodemographic risk factors patients face pertaining to decreased survival and surveillance time. It is well documented that laryngeal neoplasms present later due to poor screening methods. Aligned with this pattern, this study shows that social vulnerability associates with these disparate outcomes and provides an argument of how these factors should be taken into account when evaluating a patient's risk for laryngeal cancer, especially in regards to disease management. Given the differences in therapy receipt related to social vulnerabilities, which have been shown to be a point of health disparity in patients with laryngeal cancer. Although our study did not specifically examine the use of laryngeal preservation therapies, we demonstrated that increasing social vulnerability was associated with decreased odds of radiation, a hallmark of salvage therapy. By accounting for the complex interactions of SDoH, our use of the SVI can help inform health professionals of which social vulnerabilities need more investigation and guidance on how they can be used to inform policy and guidelines in managing complex and aggressive diseases like laryngeal cancer.

### Survival outcomes in advanced laryngeal cancer [^113BiCTq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chemoradiation therapy has become increasingly popular in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer as part of an organ preservation protocol. However, several studies have reported a decline in survival, possibly attributable to the increased use of radiation and chemoradiation therapy.

Objective

To evaluate survival outcomes of laryngeal conservation vs surgical therapy in the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer in the United States using a large population-based cancer database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based, nonconcurrent cohort study of 5394 patients who received a diagnosis of stage III or IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 1992 and 2009. Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 Database.

Interventions

Surgical or nonsurgical therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).

Results

Patients who received surgical therapy had better 2-year and 5-year DSS (70% vs 64% and 55% vs 51%, respectively; P < .001) and 2-year and 5-year OS (64% vs 57% and 44% vs 39%, respectively; P < .001) than patients who received nonsurgical therapy. The difference in DSS and OS between treatment groups remained after stratification by year-of-diagnosis cohorts (P < .001). The survival gap consistently narrowed with subsequent year-of-diagnosis cohorts. On multivariable analysis, nonsurgical patients had worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33 [95% CI, 1.21–1.45]) and OS (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22–1.43]) after adjustment for year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, age, sex, subsite, race, and marital status. Stage III disease (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.54–0.65]), glottic subsite (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.67–0.82]), 2004 to 2009 year-of-diagnosis cohort (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.70–0.90]), female sex (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.72–0.89]), and married status (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.62–0.75]) positively affected DSS. Black race (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05–1.30]) and increased age (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02–1.03] for each year) negatively affected DSS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Surgical therapy leads to better survival outcomes than nonsurgical therapy for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. Patients need to be made aware of the modest but significant survival disadvantage associated with nonsurgical therapy as part of the shared decision-making process during treatment selection.

### Assessment of laryngeal cancer in patients younger than 40 years [^114tpucT]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To assess the differences between patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma under 40 years old and those 40 years old or older. A secondary objective was to compare survival outcome between these cohorts.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Methods

We reviewed the medical charts of all patients treated in our tertiary referral center for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma from 2005 to 2014. Patients aged < 40 years at diagnosis were compared to older patients.

Results

The study group comprised 160 patients. Of them, 13 were aged < 40 years at diagnosis. Mean age was 35 ± 3.9 years and 64.4 ± 11 years for the two groups. Among the younger patients, 38% were smokers (mean pack/day, 2.2) versus 71% in the older group (mean pack/day, 3). The younger group typically had a more advanced stage than the older group at presentation; eight young patients (62%) had stage III or IV versus 49 (33%) in the older group (P = 0.042). Mean overall survival was 6.7 ± 1 years for those under 40 years old and 7.7 ± 0.2 years for the older patients (P = 0.2). The 5-year survival rate was 69% for young patients and 90% for the older group (P = 0.04). However, there was no significant between-group difference in overall survival or 5-year survival rate when stratified for early- and late-stage disease.

Conclusions

There is a lower prevalence of classic risk factors in younger patient with laryngeal carcinoma in this study, suggesting a different etiology compared to our older cohort. The under-40 cohort presented with more advanced disease and had a worse 5-year survival; however, when stratified for early- versus late-stage disease, there was no significant difference in overall or 5-year survival between the groups. This may suggest that, despite a different etiology, laryngeal cancer behaves similarly in older and younger patients.

### Frequency and prognostic significance of p16 (INK4A) protein overexpression and transcriptionally active human papillomavirus infection in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^113zEcZf]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Cancer of the larynx, in particular laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), is diagnosed in over 12 500 people in the United States per year, with over 3600 deaths. The principal aims of managing laryngeal cancer include maintaining organ function while ensuring high cure rates. Despite successful laryngeal preservation in the majority of locally advanced cancers, the 5-year survival is < 50%. Decision making with regard to larynx preservation vs total laryngectomy is largely based on clinical and radiologic features. Unfortunately, there are no clinically useful prognostic/predictive molecular markers in LSCC.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to have a causative role in a significant proportion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), specifically cancers of the oropharynx. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is distinct from HPV-negative disease epidemiologically, clinically and molecularly, and importantly, HPV-positive patients have improved outcomes compared with HPV-negative patients. It is not entirely clear why HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have improved prognosis but it may be due in part to fewer comorbidities, including smoking related diseases, better response to treatment and fewer second primaries. The role of HPV in squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck sites outside the oropharynx, and its relationship to clinical outcomes, has not been conclusively established. Although it is generally accepted that the rates of HPV infection in non-oropharyngeal sites is much lower than in the oropharynx, studies continue to report conflicting results of the frequency of HPV infection, ranging from 3 to 97%. In addition, although p16 INK4A (p16) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used as a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, the validity of p16 overexpression as a marker of HPV in LSCC remains to be proven. Nevertheless, we have noted that many pathology laboratories are now reporting on p16 in non-oropharyngeal head and neck cancer as well as oropharyngeal cancer biopsies.

Few studies have investigated the relationship between HPV status and outcomes in non-oropharyngeal sites, and have not yet convincingly proven a link between HPV status and outcome. To date, the largest study reporting the correlation between HPV status and outcomes in laryngeal cancer included only 130 patients and reported no significant associations.

In the present study we aimed to investigate the frequency of HPV status, both by p16 protein overexpression and transcriptionally active HPV infection, and its correlation to outcome in, to our knowledge, the largest cohort of LSCC reported.

### Trends in incidence and mortality of larynx cancer in the US [^113kk4Mc]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Larynx cancer is associated with considerable morbidity for patients and has a high mortality rate. Historical analyses showed that the incidence of larynx cancer was decreasing but the mortality was not similarly improving.

Objective

To assess whether incidence and mortality trends in larynx cancer in the US have improved.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database for patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with laryngeal cancer between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were incidence and mortality of larynx cancer by sex, subsite, and patterns of surgical treatment.

Results

Among 40 850 US patients with larynx cancer diagnosed from 1986 to 2018 (80.4% male), the incidence of larynx cancer decreased 55% from 5.00 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 4.70–5.32 per 100 000 people) to 2.26 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 2.11–2.42 per 100 000 people). During the same period, mortality decreased only 43% from 1.59 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 1.53–1.64 per 100 000 people) to 0.89 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 0.86–0.92 per 100 000 people). This corresponds to a 25% relative increase in case-fatality rate. Examination by stage showed a decrease in the incidence of localized disease at diagnosis of 40% from 2.65 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 2.44–2.89 per 100 000 people) to 1.60 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 1.45–1.76 per 100 000 people) from 1986 to 2002 and of 45% from 2.15 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 1.98–2.34 per 100 000 people) to 1.19 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 1.08–1.31 per 100 000 people) from 2005 to 2018. Distribution of larynx cancer by subsite remained stable, with most cases affecting the glottis. The proportion of patients receiving surgery as their first course of treatment decreased regardless of stage at presentation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, between 1986 and 2018, the incidence of larynx cancer decreased in the US, primarily because of the decrease in the incidence of localized disease. Mortality did not decrease similarly, resulting in an increased case-fatality rate overall. Encouraging earlier referrals for cancer concern, focusing resources where larynx cancer rates remain highest, renewing attention to research on new biologic causes of different tumor biologic characteristics, and conducting trials to directly compare treatments may help reverse this trend.

### Larynx preservation clinical trial design: key issues and recommendations-a consensus panel summary [^115TDj79]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop guidelines for the conduct of Phase III clinical trials of larynx preservation in patients with locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.

Methods and Materials

A multidisciplinary international consensus panel developed recommendations after reviewing results from completed Phase III randomized trials, meta-analyses, and published clinical reports with updates available through November, 2007. The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the panel.

Results

According to the recommendations, the trial population should include patients with T2 or T3 laryngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma not considered for partial laryngectomy and exclude those with laryngeal dysfunction or age greater than 70 years. Functional assessments should include speech and swallowing. Voice should be routinely assessed with a simple, validated instrument. The primary endpoint should capture survival and function. The panel created a new endpoint: laryngo-esophageal dysfunction-free survival. Events are death, local relapse, total or partial laryngectomy, tracheotomy at 2 years or later, or feeding tube at 2 years or later. Recommended secondary endpoints are overall survival, progression-free survival, locoregional control, time to tracheotomy, time to laryngectomy, time to discontinuation of feeding tube, and quality of life/patient-reported outcomes. Correlative biomarker studies for near-term trials should include estimated glomerular filtration rate, excision repair cross-complementary-1 gene, E-cadherin and beta-catenin, epiregulin and amphiregulin, and TP53 mutation.

Conclusions

Revised trial designs in several key areas are needed to advance the study of larynx preservation. With consistent methodologies, clinical trials can more effectively evaluate and quantify the therapeutic benefit of novel treatment options for patients with locally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.

### Survival from cancer of the larynx in england and wales up to 2001 [^114HaU5t]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Survival trends

Relative survival from laryngeal cancer in men diagnosed during the 1990s was only slightly higher than for men diagnosed during the late 1980s, at approximately 84, 64 and 54% at 1, 5 and 10 years, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 1). After adjustment for deprivation, however, the estimate of trend in 5-year survival was an increase of 3.3% every 5 years between 1986–1990 and 1996–1999, a trend of borderline significance (95% confidence interval 0.0–6.7%). This rate of increase in survival is adjusted for the deprivation gap in survival and for any changes in the distribution of patients by deprivation category, and it is a more reliable estimate of the trend in survival than would appear from the very similar survival of 63–64% in successive calendar periods.

Predicted survival derived from the hybrid approach using survival probabilities observed during 2000–2001 does not suggest any imminent increase in survival.

### The treatment of early laryngeal cancers (T1-T2 N0): surgery or irradiation? [^113Kya5x]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Carcinoma of the larynx is the most common cancer affecting the head and neck region. In Northern Europe, early laryngeal cancer is almost universally treated by irradiation, but elsewhere it is treated by surgery. The main aim of this study was to determine whether there was any difference in survival between the two main therapeutic options. The secondary aim was to assess speech and voice quality in a small, randomized sample of patients from each treatment group.

Methods

The subjects investigated were 488 patients with T1–2, N0 squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The patients form an unselected sequential group of our institution's experience with treating this disease over three decades. Four hundred nineteen patients were treated by irradiation, and 69 were treated with surgery. Most surgical patients were treated earlier in the series, whereas radiotherapy later became the treatment of choice. The primary outcome measures were recurrence at the primary site, recurrence in the neck, and tumor-specific survival. The secondary outcome measure was speech and voice quality. Statistical analysis was by univariate and multivariate analysis of association and survival. Surgery included horizontal or vertical partial laryngectomy and various minor procedures on the glottis, including cordectomy. Over a 30-year period, radiotherapy was administered to a dose of 60–66 Gy given over 30–33 daily fractions.

Results

Surgery tended to be performed early on in the series and radiotherapy thereafter. Surgery was more likely to be carried out for supraglottic disease. These differences apart, the radiotherapy and surgery groups of patients were well matched. The 5-year tumor-specific survival for those treated by irradiation was 87% and for surgery it was 77% (p = .1022). Glottic cancer and T1 disease were associated with high 5-year survivals: 90% and 91%, respectively. Supraglottic site and T2 disease both had a poorer prognoses: 79% and 69%, respectively. The differences for both sets of data were significant. There was no significant difference in primary site recurrence rates for the two treatment modalities, but regional recurrence was higher in the surgery group. Further analysis demonstrated that this was not a function of surgery per se but rather of the unit's policy toward the N0 neck at the time surgery was carried out. Regarding speech and voice quality, radiotherapy was far superior to surgery. All patients in the radiotherapy group but only 3 of 10 in the surgery group were judged to have a good or normal voice (p = .0017).

Conclusions

Both surgery and irradiation are equally effective at treating early laryngeal carcinoma. Speech and voice were highly significantly better in patients treated by irradiation than in those treated by surgery.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for laryngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to survivorship and rehabilitation (gastroesophageal complications), ACS 2016 guidelines recommend to refer patients with complaints of dysphagia, postprandial cough, unexplained weight loss, or pneumonia to an experienced speech-language pathologist for instrumental evaluation of swallowing function to assess and manage dysphagia and possible aspiration. Recognize the potential for psychosocial barriers to swallowing recovery and refer to an appropriate clinician if barriers are present. Refer patients to a speech-language pathologist for videofluoroscopy as the first-line test in patients with suspected stricture due to the high degree of coexisting physiologic dysphagia.

### NSD1-and NSD2-damaging mutations define a subset of laryngeal tumors with favorable prognosis [^113TkKK3]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) affect anatomical sites including the oral cavity, nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx. Laryngeal cancers are characterized by high recurrence and poor overall survival, and currently lack robust molecular prognostic biomarkers for treatment stratification. Using an algorithm for integrative clustering that simultaneously assesses gene expression, somatic mutation, copy number variation, and methylation, we for the first time identify laryngeal cancer subtypes with distinct prognostic outcomes, and differing from the non-prognostic laryngeal subclasses reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Although most common laryngeal gene mutations are found in both subclasses, better prognosis is strongly associated with damaging mutations of the methyltransferases NSD1 and NSD2, with findings confirmed in an independent validation cohort consisting of 63 laryngeal cancer patients. Intriguingly, NSD1/2 mutations are not prognostic for nonlaryngeal SCCHN. These results provide an immediately useful clinical metric for patient stratification and prognostication.

### Current status of partial laryngeal surgery for advanced laryngeal cancer: when and why? [^117A1tJZ]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional Results

OPHL stand as a pivotal conservative surgical approach in the management of LC, extending from early-to-intermediate stages to select T4a diseases. OPHLs are recognized for their oncological safety, showcasing commendable overall survival, disease-free survival, and laryngectomy-free survival rates. Moreover, these procedures are designed to conserve the primary functions of the larynx (swallowing, breathing, and phonation) while aiming to obviate the necessity for a permanent tracheostomy. Reports indicate 5-year laryngeal function preservation (LFP) rates post–OPHL ranging from 91.2% to 98.5% according to the primary extent of the disease, with comparable functional outcomes observed between type II and type III OPHLs. Despite these promising figures, the incidence of acute complications and late sequelae, potentially necessitating total laryngectomy or permanent gastrostomy, underscores the significance of surgical expertise and patient-specific considerations.

The prognostication of functional outcomes post–OPHL is imperative for surgical planning. This entails a comprehensive evaluation of preoperative patient-related and disease-related factors to tailor individualized treatment strategies. Functional recovery, particularly concerning voice, breathing, and swallowing, generally exhibits satisfactory levels, albeit with notable variability. Voice quality preservation is predominantly associated with type I OPHLs due to the sparing of vocal folds, whereas type II and type III are linked to significant, albeit similar, deteriorations in voice quality. Nonetheless, most patients achieve acceptable levels of oral communication through substitution voice techniques.

Swallowing function recovery post–OPHL emerges as a formidable challenge, with immediate postoperative impairment gradually ameliorating over approximately six months, allowing most patients to return to a free oral diet. However, the persistence of chronic aspirations and postswallowing residues in some individuals heightens the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Variability in tracheal cannula removal, nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding, and hospital stay durations further exemplify the heterogeneity of functional recovery, as documented in the literature.

Laryngeal cancer — surgical selection and neck management: In patients with significant pulmonary comorbidity, total laryngectomy may be preferable over endoscopic or open partial laryngectomy; partial laryngeal surgery should be carefully considered if adjuvant RT is likely; consideration should be given to any suspicious lymphadenopathy and risk of metastatic nodal disease; neck dissection should be performed as indicated when the primary site is treated surgically; in patients with T1–2 node-negative cancer of the supraglottic larynx, lymph node dissection is associated with greater OS, and T1–2 supraglottic cancers have a significant risk of occult nodal disease at presentation.

### Laryngeal cancer treatment-NCI… [^112sodyS]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. Prognosis depends on the following:

- The stage of the disease.
- The location and size of the tumor.
- The grade of the tumor.
- The patient's age, sex, and general health, including whether the patient is anemic. Treatment options depend on the following:

- The stage of the disease.
- The location and size of the tumor.
- Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.
- Whether the cancer has come back. Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol decrease the effectiveness of treatment for laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer who continue to smoke and drink are less likely to be cured and more likely to develop a second tumor. After treatment for laryngeal cancer, frequent and careful follow-up is important.
- Stage 0
- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- After surgery, the stage of the cancer may change and more treatment may be needed.
- Laryngeal cancer can recur after it has been treated.
- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together
- Chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together. Laryngectomy may be done if cancer remains.
- Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot be treated with chemotherapy and surgery.
- Surgery, which may be followed by radiation therapy. If cancer is in the glottis, treatment may include the following:

- Laryngectomy plus total thyroidectomy and removal of lymph nodes in the throat, usually followed by radiation therapy.
- Radiation therapy followed by surgery if cancer comes back in the same area.
- Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot be treated with chemotherapy and surgery.
- Chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together.

Laryngectomy may be done if cancer remains.
- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together.
- Chemotherapy followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy given together. Laryngectomy may be done if cancer remains.
- Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot be treated with chemotherapy and surgery.
- Surgery followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may be given with the radiation therapy.
- A clinical trial of radiation therapy alone compared with radiation and targeted therapy.
- A clinical trial of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiosensitizers, or radia.

### Survival outcomes in advanced laryngeal cancer… [^1155dWk2]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Patients who received surgical therapy had better 2-year and 5-year DSS and 2-year and 5-year OS than patients who received nonsurgical therapy. Exclusion criteria included distant metastasis, T1 stage, unresectable tumors, multiple primary tumors, no radiation treatment, medical contraindication for surgery, and cases in which surgery was recommended but was not performed. Our study shows that patients with advanced laryngeal cancer treated with surgical therapy have better survival than patients treated with nonsurgical therapy. This gap in survival has gradually decreased with time but remains significant. This difference in survival remained even after adjustment for stage and did not vary between patients with stage III and stage IV cancer. For patients with localized disease, the difference in survival was more pronounced for patients with T4a than T3 cancer.

The difference in survival also remained after adjustment for sex. Multivariable analysis revealed a 30% higher risk of mortality in patients who received nonsurgical therapy, after adjustment for year of diagnosis, age, stage, sex, race, marital status, and laryngeal subsite. Stage III, glottic subsite, female sex, and married status had positive impacts on DSS and OS. Black race and age had negative impacts on DSS and OS. Disturbingly, they noted a decrease in laryngeal cancer survival over time. In contrast, our study shows an increase in survival over time. However, our analysis is limited to patients with stage III and stage IV disease. The present study shows that the survival gap between patients receiving surgical and nonsurgical therapy has gradually narrowed over time. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients who received a diagnosis between 2004 and 2009 had significantly better survival than patients who received a diagnosis prior to that period.

This may be due to improvements in radiotherapy and chemotherapy strategies. Laryngeal preservation and locoregional control were highest in the concurrent chemoradiation group. The increased use of the concurrent chemoradiation therapy protocol may partly explain the decreased survival gap in the 2004 to 2009 cohort. Another potential reason for the relative improvement in survival for patients treated with chemoradiation therapy is better selection of appropriate candidates for chemoradiation therapy.

Other prognostic factors may include sex, age, performance status, and a variety of pathological features of the tumor, including grade and depth of invasion. Prognosis for small laryngeal cancers that have not spread to lymph nodes is very good. Cure rates are 75% to 95% depending on the site, tumor bulk, and degree of infiltration. Although most patients with early lesions can be cured by either radiation therapy or surgery, radiation therapy may be reasonable to preserve the voice, leaving surgery for salvage. Patients with a preradiation hemoglobin level higher than 13 g/dL have higher local control and survival rates than patients who are anemic. Patients treated for laryngeal cancers are at the highest risk of recurrence in the first 2 to 3 years.

Recurrences after 5 years are rare and usually represent new primary malignancies. Close, regular follow-up is crucial to maximize the chance for salvage. Follow-up includes careful clinical examination and repetition of any abnormal staging study, along with attention to any treatment-related toxic effect or complication. Evaluation of treatment outcome can be reported in various ways: locoregional control, disease-free survival, determinate survival, and overall survival at 2 to 5 years. Preservation of voice is an important parameter to evaluate. Outcome should be reported after initial surgery, initial radiation, planned combined treatment, or surgical salvage of radiation failures. Primary source material should be consulted to review these differences. A review of published clinical results of definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a significant loss of local control when radiation therapy was prolonged.

Extending standard treatment schedules should be avoided whenever possible. Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy Concurrent chemoradiation therapy is a standard treatment option for patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer. Evidence:

- A meta-analysis of 93 randomized prospective head and neck cancer trials published between 1965 and 2000 showed the following:

- The subset of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy had a 4. 5% absolute survival advantage.
- Patients who received concurrent chemotherapy had a greater s.

### Long-term quality of life after treatment of laryngeal cancer… [^116pijfF]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

THE RESULTS of the Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study on induction chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared with surgery and RT in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer demonstrated that organ preservation can be accomplished in approximately 2 of 3 patients with advanced laryngeal. Compared with the US male population norms, the patients with laryngeal cancer had significantly lower scores on all domains except the BP domain of the SF-36. Most dramatic differences were seen in the PF, RP, and RE domains of the SF-36, each of which was more than 20 points lower in the patients with laryngeal cancer.

Assessment of quality of life in long-term survivors of the VA Laryngeal Cancer Study population demonstrated that, as a group, surviving patients who were randomized to the chemoradiation arm of the study tended to have better health-related quality-of-life scores on the SF-36 than patients who were randomized to laryngectomy and RT. When compared with the US male population aged 55 to 64 years, patients with laryngeal cancer had significantly worse scores on all domains of the SF-36 except BP, which did not reach significance. Patients who had successful organ preservation had the highest SF-36 and HNQOL domain scores of any of the 4 groups analyzed. In contrast, the laryngectomy group had significantly lower mean scores on all domains of the SF-36 when compared with US males aged 55 to 64 years.

When compared with patients with intact larynges, patients who underwent laryngectomy scored more than 10 points lower on the PF and MH domains; 20 or more points worse on the RP, SF, and RE domains; and more than 30 points lower on the BP domain of the SF-36. These differences reached statistical significance only for the BP and MH domains, probably due to the decreased power to detect differences in scores resulting from a small sample size of long-term organ-preservation patients in this study. Nevertheless, all the trends demonstrate that patients with intact larynges tend to have not only better disease-specific quality-of-life scores but also better general health status.
