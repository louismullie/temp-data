## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of alveolar soft part sarcoma in adults (unresectable or metastatic + monotherapy)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in adults with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma, specifically for monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the FDA-approved indication and whether multiple dosing regimens are acceptable. Then, I should verify the exact adult dosing options and their equivalence. Next, I will check the pivotal trial details to ensure the regimen matches the evidence base. After that, I should review safety and duration of therapy considerations. Finally, I will consider practical selection among the options and note any subcutaneous formulation nuances, before summarizing the recommendation clearly with citations.

> Let me first confirm the indication and labeled dosing flexibility. Atezolizumab is FDA-approved for adults with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma as monotherapy, and the label explicitly allows three intravenous dosing schedules: 840 mg every 2 weeks, 1200 mg every 3 weeks, or 1680 mg every 4 weeks, all administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, which establishes that these are all acceptable, evidence-based options rather than a single rigid schedule [^115XDkmf] [^117Nufwo] [^117TpMzG] [^114E7hoz].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for these regimens. The pivotal study supporting approval was ML39345, an open-label, single-arm trial in which adult patients received 1200 mg IV every 21 days, and this regimen produced an overall response rate of 24% with durable responses, which underpins the labeled dosing options and confirms clinical activity in ASPS [^111x9Uji] [^112u3zPG]. Hold on, I should also confirm that the NEJM publication aligns with this; yes, the multicenter phase 2 study using 1200 mg every 3 weeks reported a 37% objective response rate and a median duration of response of 24.7 months, reinforcing the clinical efficacy of this schedule and supporting the labeled alternatives as pharmacokinetically and clinically appropriate [^113Wh4qV].

> I need to check safety and duration expectations to contextualize dosing choice. In the FDA review, the median duration of exposure was 8.9 months, with serious adverse reactions in 41% and dose interruptions in 35%, which underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and supports continuation until progression or toxicity, consistent with the labeled intent-to-treat approach [^115cb6GJ]. Let me reconsider whether any of the labeled schedules carry distinct safety signals; the label does not indicate differential safety by schedule, so selection among the three IV options can be individualized based on logistics and patient preference [^115cb6GJ].

> Next, I should review practical selection among the three IV regimens. The 1200 mg every 3 weeks schedule is the most directly evidence-based from ML39345 and the NEJM study, whereas the 840 mg every 2 weeks and 1680 mg every 4 weeks schedules are pharmacokinetically equivalent alternatives that may better suit infusion center capacity, travel constraints, or patient preference, and all are acceptable per FDA labeling [^111x9Uji] [^113Wh4qV] [^117Nufwo] [^117TpMzG] [^114E7hoz]. Hold on, I should verify that these are truly interchangeable; the FDA's multi-disciplinary review confirms the three adult regimens as acceptable dosing options for ASPS, supporting interchangeability in routine practice [^1115MUWi].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers a subcutaneous option. I should confirm whether a subcutaneous formulation is approved for this indication. Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs (Tecentriq Hybreza) is FDA-approved for adults with unresectable or metastatic ASPS as monotherapy, with a fixed-dose subcutaneous regimen of 1875 mg with 30,000 units hyaluronidase every 3 weeks, which offers a different route with different administration instructions and is an appropriate substitute for IV atezolizumab in this setting [^113JBbMJ] [^114bjr7i] [^114qochL]. I should double-check that this substitution is guideline-concordant; NCCN notes that the subcutaneous formulation may be substituted for IV atezolizumab, with distinct dosing and administration, which aligns with this option [^114qochL].

> Let me synthesize the final recommendation. For adults with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma treated with atezolizumab monotherapy, the recommended dosing options are 840 mg IV every 2 weeks, 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks, or 1680 mg IV every 4 weeks, all continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with the 1200 mg every 3 weeks regimen most closely aligned to the pivotal trial evidence; alternatively, atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs 1875 mg/30,000 units SC every 3 weeks may be used as a subcutaneous substitute with different administration instructions [^117Nufwo] [^117TpMzG] [^114E7hoz] [^111x9Uji] [^113Wh4qV] [^113JBbMJ] [^114qochL].

---

The recommended dose of atezolizumab for adults with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma is **840 mg IV every 2 weeks, 1,200 mg IV every 3 weeks, or 1,680 mg IV every 4 weeks** [^117Nufwo] [^117TpMzG] [^114E7hoz] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^111x9Uji]. Alternatively, the subcutaneous formulation (atezolizumab/hyaluronidase-tqjs) can be used at **1,875 mg SC every 3 weeks** [^113JBbMJ] [^114bjr7i]. These regimens are supported by FDA approval and NCCN guidelines [^112xZnK6] [^114qochL].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

The FDA provides **three approved intravenous dosing regimens** for atezolizumab in adults with unresectable or metastatic ASPS:

| **Dosing regimen** | **Frequency** | **Administration** |
|-|-|-|
| 840 mg | Every 2 weeks | Intravenous infusion [^117TpMzG] |
| 1,200 mg | Every 3 weeks | Intravenous infusion [^117Nufwo] |
| 1,680 mg | Every 4 weeks | Intravenous infusion [^114E7hoz] |

---

These regimens are **administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity** [^111x9Uji].

---

## Subcutaneous formulation

In addition to intravenous administration, the FDA has approved a subcutaneous formulation of atezolizumab coformulated with hyaluronidase (Tecentriq Hybreza) [^114bjr7i]. The recommended dose is **1,875 mg administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks** [^113JBbMJ] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^116Wnumz].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimens

The recommended dosing regimens are supported by clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety in patients with unresectable or metastatic ASPS. The pivotal study (ML39345) evaluated atezolizumab in 49 adult and pediatric patients, with adult patients receiving **1,200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks** [^111x9Uji]. The study reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 24% and durable responses, with 67% of responders maintaining a response for at least 6 months and 42% for at least 12 months [^111x9Uji].

Additional clinical data from a multicenter, single-group, phase 2 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported an ORR of 37% with a median duration of response of 24.7 months and a median progression-free survival of 20.8 months [^113Wh4qV]. These findings further support the **efficacy of atezolizumab in ASPS** [^1132gkjy].

---

## Safety considerations

Atezolizumab is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should monitor for immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including:

- Fatigue
- Musculoskeletal pain
- Hypertension
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Pneumonitis
- Hepatitis
- Endocrinopathies

Dose interruptions or discontinuations may be necessary to manage these adverse events [^115cb6GJ].

---

## Alternative therapies

While atezolizumab is the **only FDA-approved therapy** specifically for unresectable or metastatic ASPS, alternative systemic therapies such as pazopanib, sunitinib, and pembrolizumab have demonstrated activity in ASPS and may be considered in certain clinical scenarios [^112xZnK6] [^114RiajG] [^1115m7jh].

---

The recommended dose of atezolizumab for adults with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma is **840 mg IV every 2 weeks, 1,200 mg IV every 3 weeks, or 1,680 mg IV every 4 weeks** [^117Nufwo] [^117TpMzG] [^114E7hoz], or **1,875 mg SC every 3 weeks** for the subcutaneous formulation [^113JBbMJ] [^114bjr7i], until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^111x9Uji].

Unresectable or Metastatic Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in 47 adult and 2 pediatric patients enrolled in Study ML39345 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Adult patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg every 3 weeks and pediatric patients received 15 mg/kg up to a maximum 1200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure to TECENTRIQ was 8.9 months (1 to 40 months).

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving TECENTRIQ. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (> 2%) were fatigue, pain in extremity, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pneumonia (4.1% each).

Dosage interruptions of TECENTRIQ due to an adverse reaction occurred in 35% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 3%) leading to dose interruptions were pneumonitis and pain in extremity (4.1% each).

14.5	Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma

The efficacy of TECENTRIQ HYBREZA as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) has been established in adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous atezolizumab for ASPS. TECENTRIQ HYBREZA is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients. Below is a description of the efficacy results of intravenous atezolizumab in this adequate and well-controlled ASPS trial.

The efficacy of intravenous atezolizumab was evaluated in study ML39345 (NCT03141684), an open-label, single-arm study, in 49 adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with unresectable or metastatic ASPS. Although this study enrolled pediatric patients, TECENTRIC HYBREZA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Eligible patients were required to have histologically or cytologically confirmed ASPS that was not curable by surgery, and an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.

Patients were excluded if they had known primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic CNS metastases, known clinically significant liver disease, or history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.

Adult patients received 1200 mg intravenously and pediatric patients received 15 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 1200 mg) intravenously once every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The major efficacy outcomes were Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR) by Independent Review Committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

A total of 49 patients were enrolled. The median age of patients was 31 years (range: 12–70); 2% of adult patients (n = 47) were ≥ 65 years of age and the pediatric patients (n = 2) were ≥ 12 years of age; 51% of patients were female, 55% White, 29% Black or African American, 10% Asian; 53% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 45% had an ECOG performance status of 1. All patients had prior surgery for ASPS and 55% received at least one prior line of treatment for ASPS; 55% received radiotherapy and 53% received chemotherapy. Of the patients who reported staging at initial diagnosis, all were Stage IV.

Efficacy results of this study are summarized in Table 31.

Objective

The objective was to review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of atezolizumab (Tecentriq) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with unresectable or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS).

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases, published abstracts, and ongoing studies from ClinicalTrials.gov between January 1, 1981, and May 31, 2023. Keywords included atezolizumab, Tecentriq, MPDL3280, immunotherapy, PD-L1, PD-1, pediatrics, sarcoma, and ASPS.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies involving atezolizumab for ASPS were included and discussed.

Data Synthesis

Atezolizumab is an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor. Atezolizumab was granted approval by the FDA specifically for ASPS based on a phase II clinical trial in adult and pediatric patients (n = 49), which reported an overall response rate of 24% and a durable response rate at 6 and 12 months of 67% and 42%, respectively. Common grade 3/4 adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pain (8%), followed by hypertension (6%), weight gain (6%), headache (4%), and dizziness (4%).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice In Comparison With Existing Drugs

Advanced ASPS is a high-risk disease with limited treatment options. Atezolizumab appears to be a viable treatment option in ASPS demonstrating clinical efficacy and a manageable toxicity profile.

Conclusions

With no other treatments that are FDA approved specifically for ASPS, and few demonstrating efficacy in the advanced setting, the approval of atezolizumab, including the first approval for pediatric patients, represents a landmark improvement to the therapeutic arsenal against this rare disease.

### Cediranib in patients with alveolar soft-part sarcoma (CASPS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial [^115tbvQE]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that is unresponsive to chemotherapy. Cediranib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, has shown substantial activity in ASPS in non-randomised studies. The Cediranib in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (CASPS) study was designed to discriminate the effect of cediranib from the intrinsically indolent nature of ASPS.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial, we recruited participants from 12 hospitals in the UK (n = 7), Spain (n = 3), and Australia (n = 2). Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older; metastatic ASPS that had progressed in the previous 6 months; had an ECOG performance status of 0–1; life expectancy of more than 12 weeks; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Participants had to have no anti-cancer treatment within 4 weeks before trial entry, with exception of palliative radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1), with allocation by use of computer-generated random permuted blocks of six, to either cediranib (30 mg orally, once daily) or matching placebo tablets for 24 weeks. Treatment was supplied in number-coded bottles, masking participants and clinicians to assignment. Participants were unblinded at week 24 or sooner if they had progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1); those on placebo crossed over to cediranib and all participants continued on treatment until progression or death. The primary endpoint was percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters between baseline and week 24 or progression if sooner, assessed in the evaluable population (all randomly assigned participants who had a scan at week 24 [or sooner if they progressed] with target marker lesions measured). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01337401; the European Clinical Trials database, number EudraCT2010-021163-33; and the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN63733470 recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.

Findings

Between July 15, 2011, and July 29, 2016, of 48 participants recruited, all were randomly assigned to cediranib (n = 32) or placebo (n = 16). 23 (48%) were female and the median age was 31 years (IQR 27–45). Median follow-up was 34.3 months (IQR 23.7–55.6) at the time of data cutoff for these analyses (April 11, 2018). Four participants in the cediranib group were not evaluable for the primary endpoint (one did not start treatment, and three did not have their scan at 24 weeks). Median percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters for the evaluable population was -8.3% (IQR -26.5 to 5.9) with cediranib versus 13.4% (IQR 1.1 to 21.3) with placebo (one-sided p = 0.0010). The most common grade 3 adverse events on (blinded) cediranib were hypertension (six [19%] of 31) and diarrhoea (two [6%]). 15 serious adverse reactions in 12 patients were reported; 12 of these reactions occurred on open-label cediranib, and the most common symptoms were dehydration (n = 2), vomiting (n = 2), and proteinuria (n = 2). One probable treatment-related death (intracranial haemorrhage) occurred 41 days after starting open-label cediranib in a patient who was assigned to placebo in the masked phase.

Interpretation

Given the high incidence of metastatic disease and poor long-term prognosis of ASPS, together with the lack of efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, our finding of significant clinical activity with cediranib in this disease is an important step towards the goal of long-term disease control for these young patients. Future clinical trials in ASPS are also likely to involve immune checkpoint inhibitors.

### Cediranib phase-II study in children with metastatic alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) [^114KWGXv]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare vascular sarcoma with a clinically indolent course, frequently presents with metastases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising therapeutic target. In a phase-II trial of the VEGF receptor inhibitor cediranib for adults with ASPS, the partial response (PR) rate (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors [RECIST] v1.0) was 35% (15/43; 95% confidence interval: 21–51%). We evaluated cediranib in the pediatric population.

Procedure

Patients < 16 years old with metastatic, unresectable ASPS received cediranib at the pediatric maximum tolerated dose of 12 mg/m 2 (≈70% of the fixed adult phase-II dose orally daily). Tumor response was assessed every two cycles (RECIST v1.0). A Simon two-stage optimal design (target response rate 35%, rule out 5%) was used.

Results

Seven patients (four females), with a median age of 13 years, (range 9–15), were enrolled on stage 1. The most frequent grade 2 or 3 adverse events were neutropenia, diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria. The best response was stable disease (SD) (median cycle number = 34). Three patients were removed from the study treatment for disease progression (cycles 4, 5, and 36). Five of seven patients had SD for ≥ 14 months. Two patients with SD remain on study (34–57+ cycles).

Conclusions

Cediranib did not reach the target response rate in this small pediatric cohort, in contrast to the adult 35% PR rate. The pediatric dosing was 30% lower compared to the adult dosing, which may have contributed to response differences. Prolonged SD was observed in five patients, but given the indolent nature of ASPS, SD cannot be clearly attributed to cediranib. Cediranib has an acceptable safety profile.

Background

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma with a poor prognosis and no established therapy. Recently, encouraging responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors have been reported.

Methods

We conducted an investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-group, phase 2 study of the anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) agent atezolizumab in adult and pediatric patients with advanced ASPS. Atezolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 1200 mg (in patients ≥ 18 years of age) or 15 mg per kilogram of body weight with a 1200-mg cap (in patients < 18 years of age) once every 21 days. Study end points included objective response, duration of response, and progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, as well as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of multistep drug action.

Results

A total of 52 patients were evaluated. An objective response was observed in 19 of 52 patients (37%), with 1 complete response and 18 partial responses. The median time to response was 3.6 months (range, 2.1 to 19.1), the median duration of response was 24.7 months (range, 4.1 to 55.8), and the median progression-free survival was 20.8 months. Seven patients took a treatment break after 2 years of treatment, and their responses were maintained through the data-cutoff date. No treatment-related grade 4 or 5 adverse events were recorded. Responses were noted despite variable baseline expression of programmed death 1 and PD-L1.

Conclusions

Atezolizumab was effective at inducing sustained responses in approximately one third of patients with advanced ASPS. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03141684.).

### Axitinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced sarcomas including alveolar soft-part sarcoma: a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^1115m7jh]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Background

VEGF promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment and contributes to immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance in cancer. We aimed to assess the activity of the VEGF receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor axitinib plus the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with sarcoma.

Methods

This single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial was undertaken at a tertiary care academic medical centre in Miami, FL, USA, and participants were recruited from all over the USA and internationally. Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, and had histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic sarcomas, including alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS); measurable disease with one site amenable to repeated biopsies; an ECOG performance status of 0–1; and progressive disease after previous treatment with at least one line of systemic therapy (unless no standard treatment existed or the patient declined therapy). The first five patients were enrolled in a lead-in cohort and were given axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously for 30 min on day 8 and every 3 weeks for cycles of 6 weeks for up to 2 years. Thereafter, patients received escalating doses of axitinib (2–10 mg) plus flat dose pembrolizumab according to the schedule above. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival. All patients were evaluable for survival and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02636725, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Between April 19, 2016, and Feb 7, 2018, of 36 patients assessed for eligibility, 33 (92%) were enrolled and given study treatment (intention-to-treat population and safety population), 12 (36%) of whom had ASPS. With a median follow-up of 14.7 months (IQR 10.1–19.1), 3-month progression-free survival for all evaluable patients was 65.6% (95% CI 46.6–79.3). For patients with ASPS, 3-month progression-free survival was 72.7% (95% CI 37.1–90.3). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events included hypertension (five [15%] of 33 patients), autoimmune toxicities (five [15%]), nausea or vomiting (two [6%]), and seizures (two [6%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in seven (21%) patients, including autoimmune colitis, transaminitis, pneumothorax, haemoptysis, seizures, and hypertriglyceridemia. There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

Axitinib plus pembrolizumab has manageable toxicity and preliminary activity in patients with advanced sarcomas, particularly patients with ASPS, warranting further investigation in randomised controlled trials.

### Cediranib in patients with alveolar soft-part sarcoma (CASPS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial [^117WjCD3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

To our knowledge, none of the molecularly targeted drugs discussed here have been studied as extensively as cediranib in ASPS or have shown superior activity. A randomised phase 2 study comparing cediranib with sunitinib monotherapy is currently recruiting participants and has yet to report any results. This study does not have a no-treatment group, precluding control for spontaneous stabilisation or regression or variations in the rate of disease progression between the groups.

In CASPS, the proportion of participants who had an objective response at week 24 (19%) was lower than that reported overall by Kummar and colleagues in a phase 2 trial of cediranib in metastatic ASPS (35%), in which participants had a slightly lower median age than in this study (27 years vs 31 years), but a similar proportion had received antiangiogenic therapy previously (26% vs 33% in CASPS). A key difference between the studies is that participants were not required to have had disease progression in the previous 6 months in Kummar and colleagues' study. Although CASPS was open to participants aged 16 years and older (in Kummar and colleagues' study, the threshold was ≥ 18 years) only one patient younger than 20 years was recruited, showing the predominance of participating centres only seeing adult patients.

Undertaking a randomised trial in such a rare disease, which has an incidence of less than one per million people per year, was challenging. The decision to undertake CASPS as a randomised trial was vindicated by the fact that seven (44%) of 16 participants in the placebo group had stable disease at 24 weeks, despite all participants having documented progressive disease before study entry. At the time of primary analysis with a minimum of 6 months follow-up after random assignment to treatment, four (25%) participants in the placebo group had still not progressed. Considering these data, following up participants with ASPS for at least 3 months to confirm progressive disease before considering systemic therapy seems reasonable. The decision to allow crossover to cediranib was made on ethical grounds to enable all participants in the study access to the drug at some stage. This choice inevitably led to confounding in the interpretation of overall survival and long-term progression-free survival, as shown by the apparent convergence of the progression-free survival curves at 12 months.

### Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) [^112u3zPG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.5	Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS)

The efficacy of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in study ML39345 (NCT03141684), an open-label, single-arm study, in 49 adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with unresectable or metastatic ASPS. Eligible patients were required to have histologically or cytologically confirmed ASPS that was not curable by surgery, and an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.

Patients were excluded if they had known primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or symptomatic CNS metastases, known clinically significant liver disease, or history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan.

Adult patients received 1200 mg intravenously and pediatric patients received 15 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 1200 mg) intravenously once every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The major efficacy outcomes were Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR) by Independent Review Committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

A total of 49 patients were enrolled. The median age of patients was 31 years (range: 12–70); 2% of adult patients (n = 47) were ≥ 65 years of age and the pediatric patients (n = 2) were ≥ 12 years of age; 51% of patients were female, 55% White, 29% Black or African American, 10% Asian; 53% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 45% had an ECOG performance status of 1. All patients had prior surgery for ASPS and 55% received at least one prior line of treatment for ASPS; 55% received radiotherapy and 53% received chemotherapy. Of the patients who reported staging at initial diagnosis, all were Stage IV.

Efficacy results of this study are summarized in Table 30.

### Randomized phase II trial of sunitinib or cediranib in alveolar soft part sarcoma [^115b84uq]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, cediranib yielded a lower ORR and shorter PFS compared with other prospective cediranib studies in ASPS, including a single-arm phase II trial we reported previously. While the mPFS was 7.6 months in the cediranib arm of the study described herein, our previous single-arm phase II trial of patients with metastatic unresectable ASPS had an ORR of 35% and a disease control rate of 84% at 24 weeks in the adult cohort. In the pediatric cohort of that NCI trial, there were no objective responses, but 5 of 7 patients had SD for ≥ 14 months. In cediranib in alveolar soft part sarcoma (CASPS), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial in Europe and Australia, an ORR of 19% and mPFS of 10.1 months was observed in the 32 patients with metastatic, unresectable ASPS who were randomized to cediranib compared with an ORR of 0% and mPFS of 4.9 months in the 16 patients randomized to placebo; this difference in PFS was not statistically significant. The primary endpoint in the CASPS study, the percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters between baseline and week 24 or progression if sooner, was significantly different between the two groups, −8.3% [interquartile range (IQR), −26.5 to 5.9] for patients treated with cediranib versus +13.4% (IQR, 1.1–21.3) for those receiving placebo (one-sided P = 0.0010; ref.). Likewise, in the majority of our patients treated with cediranib, we saw target marker lesion diameter reductions, though they did not meet the threshold for PR by RECIST 1.

Patients and Methods

Eligibility criteria

Patients 16 years of age or older with pathologically confirmed metastatic ASPS not curable by surgery were eligible. For patients previously treated with surgery, radiation, and/or systemic therapy, evidence of objective disease progression per RECIST 1 on two CT scans within the 3-month period immediately preceding enrollment was required; this criterion was later amended to two scans within the 6-month period immediately preceding enrollment. Prior treatment with any VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was not allowed; prior treatment with bevacizumab was allowed. Prior treatment with systemic therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients with previously untreated, unresectable, metastatic ASPS who showed clinical evidence of disease progression (including history and increasing physical symptoms) were also eligible and were assessed in a separate cohort through an amendment in 2014.

All patients were required to have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Patients ages 16–17 years were eligible only if they had a BSA ≥ 1.7 m 2 or weighed ≥ 60 kg. Patients with history of serious ventricular arrhythmias or prolonged QTc were excluded. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 and adequate organ and marrow function defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μL, platelets ≥ 100,000/μL, total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5× institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatine clearance ≥ 60 mL/minute for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal were required.

### Cediranib for metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma [^112qSi1E]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, highly vascular tumor, for which no effective standard systemic treatment exists for patients with unresectable disease. Cediranib is a potent, oral small-molecule inhibitor of all three vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs).

Patients and Methods

We conducted a phase II trial of once-daily cediranib (30 mg) given in 28-day cycles for patients with metastatic, unresectable ASPS to determine the objective response rate (ORR). We also compared gene expression profiles in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and evaluated the effect of cediranib on tumor proliferation and angiogenesis using positron emission tomography and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

Results

Of 46 patients enrolled, 43 were evaluable for response at the time of analysis. The ORR was 35%, with 15 of 43 patients achieving a partial response. Twenty-six patients (60%) had stable disease as the best response, with a disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) at 24 weeks of 84%. Microarray analysis with validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction on paired tumor biopsies from eight patients demonstrated downregulation of genes related to vasculogenesis.

Conclusion

In this largest prospective trial to date of systemic therapy for metastatic ASPS, we observed that cediranib has substantial single-agent activity, producing an ORR of 35% and a disease control rate of 84% at 24 weeks. On the basis of these results, an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II registration trial is currently being conducted for patients with metastatic ASPS comparing cediranib with another VEGFR inhibitor, sunitinib.

The 563 patients who received preRT were compared with 1, 126 matched controls.
- The median OS was 110 months for the patients who received preRT versus 66 months for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
- The 5-year survival rate was 62% for the patients who received preRT versus 54% for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
- An absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy of 6% for local relapse-free interval, 10% for distant relapse-free interval, and 10% for RFS. death, 0. 8; P = 0. 029). Subsequent chemotherapy trials were performed using anthracycline and ifosfamide combinations in patients who primarily had extremity or trunk soft tissue sarcomas. The data are conflicting. Evidence:

- In a third, underpowered, single-center trial, 88 patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas underwent surgery and were then randomly assigned to receive four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy, epirubicin or epirubicin plus ifosfamide, versus no adjuvant chemotherapy. The trial was closed prematurely because of a slow accrual rate. P = 0. 06).
- All the benefit associated with chemotherapy appeared restricted to the 19 patients who received epirubicin plus ifosfamide.
- After a median follow-up of 94 months, the 5-year DFS rates were 69% in the chemotherapy arm and 44% in the control arm plus ifosfamide. The remaining 13 trials used doxorubicin alone or with other drugs.

### Randomized phase II trial of sunitinib or cediranib in alveolar soft part sarcoma [^115RnPkS]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Trial design

The trial enrolled patients from July 2011 to September 2019. This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study of cediranib or sunitinib in patients with metastatic ASPS, with crossover to the other treatment arm at disease progression and after a 2-week washout period. Two sets of patients were enrolled on each arm: one set consisted of patients previously treated with either surgery, radiation, and/or systemic therapy, and the other set was treatment-naïve patients (Table 1). The study was conducted using an optimal two-stage design to rule out an unacceptably low 15% clinical response rate [PR + complete response (CR)] in favor of a modestly high response rate of 40%. Randomization to single-agent cediranib or single-agent sunitinib was performed using a predetermined, balanced list based on unique subject identifiers. Depending on treatment allocation, patients received either cediranib 30 mg orally once a day or sunitinib 37.5 mg orally once a day in 28-day cycles. Patients were asked to maintain a diary documenting when drugs were taken and any associated side effects. Cediranib and sunitinib were supplied by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, under collaborative agreements with AstraZeneca and Pfizer, respectively.

Table 1.
Patient characteristics.

Blood for pharmacokinetic analysis was collected from patients receiving cediranib only into a 4 mL EDTA tube at baseline and prior to drug administration on cycle 1 day 15 and on day 1 of cycles 2, 3, and 4.

Adverse events were graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Doses were reduced for grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicities (except electrolyte abnormalities that were correctable within 48 hours and tumor pain responsive to supportive measures) and grade 4 hematologic toxicities (except lymphopenia and anemia). Toxicities were required to have resolved to ≤ grade 2 prior to continuing treatment. Up to 14 days were allowed for resolution of toxicity; otherwise, patients were taken off treatment. Radiographic evaluation was performed at baseline and every two cycles to assess tumor response based on the RECIST version 1.

This trial was conducted under an NCI-sponsored Investigational New Drug Application with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each participating site. All patients provided written informed consent before participation and protocol design and the study was conducted in accordance with recognized ethical guidelines (U.S. Common Rule) and approved by the NIH Institutional Review Board (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01391962).

### Cediranib in patients with alveolar soft-part sarcoma (CASPS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial [^111XLAPb]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The proportion of participants with an objective response, based on best response during the blinded treatment phase, was 19%, with six of 31 participants on cediranib having a partial response at any timepoint during the masked treatment phase. However, at week 24, three of these participants no longer met RECIST criteria for partial response, and thus the proportion of participants with an objective response at week 24 was 11% (three of 28). No participants in the placebo group had a partial response during the blinded treatment phase (one-sided p = 0.072, cediranib vs placebo). 14 (50%) of 28 participants in the cediranib group and seven (44%) of 16 in the placebo group had stable disease at 24 weeks; thus the proportion of participants with clinical benefit at 24 weeks was 61% (17 of 28) for cediranib and 44% (seven of 16) for placebo (post-hoc analysis). Of the seven participants in the placebo group who were stable at 24 weeks, three had received no treatment in the 6 months before randomisation, one had surgery to the primary disease site, and another three were on another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor until a month before randomisation. Of the 14 patients randomly assigned to cediranib with stable disease or better at 24 weeks before therapy, three had no previous treatment; eight had local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy, or both) only to primary or metastatic sites, or both; two had local therapy and another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor; and one had another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor only. Median duration of response in the six patients in the cediranib group who had a partial response during the blinded treatment phase was 16.0 months (IQR 15.7–26.0); all six patients have subsequently progressed (post hoc). Of the 32 participants assigned to the cediranib group, two (6%) who had stable disease up to week 24 subsequently achieved a partial response (one by week 32, the other by week 40). Notably, at the time of primary analysis with a minimum of 6 months follow-up after random assignment to treatment, four (25%) of 16 participants in the placebo group had not progressed. Percentage change in the sum of the diameters of target marker lesions from randomisation to beyond week 24 is shown in the appendix (pp 3–4).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and previous treatments received for ASPS prior to trial entry

A planned interim analysis was done of a snapshot of data taken on Feb 4, 2014, and did not meet the stopping criteria for the primary endpoint (appendix p 57), thus the study continued until the primary analysis. Of 32 participants randomly assigned to cediranib, one (3%) did not start treatment and three (6%) did not have their scan at 24 weeks (one of whom discontinued due to toxicity). Median time on blinded treatment was 23.9 weeks (IQR 20.1–24.6) for participants assigned to cediranib and 22.2 weeks (IQR 9.6–23.8) for those assigned to placebo. Of those who started treatment, 14 (45%) in the cediranib group and four (25%) in the placebo group had at least one dose modification, dose delay, or missed dose during blinded treatment because of adverse events. 11 (35%) of 31 who were given blinded cediranib did not continue to open-label treatment; eight (26%) because of disease progression, one (3%) because of haematemesis, one (3%) because of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and fatigue, and one (3%) because of general poor tolerance and planned surgery. All participants allocated to placebo went on to have at least one dose of open-label cediranib. Of 36 (75%) participants who started open-label cediranib, eight (five from the cediranib group and three from the placebo group) were still on treatment at the data cutoff for this analysis. Reasons for discontinuation in the remaining 28 participants were disease progression (n = 21), adverse events (n = 2), patient choice (n = 4), and death (n = 1). Median time on open-label cediranib was 41.6 weeks (IQR 21.0–67.0) for the participants from the cediranib group and 40.3 weeks (12.2–108.6) for those from the placebo group.

### Evolving treatment of soft tissue sarcoma [^114v7EQL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas comprise multiple histologic subtypes, occur at a number of anatomic sites, and require individualized treatment. Over the past 5 years, 4 new drugs were approved for sarcoma, most of which are driven by histology or the anticipated response to treatment. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for resectable tumors. For unresectable or metastatic disease, doxorubicin remains the backbone of chemotherapy, but other agents have improved on its single-agent efficacy. Chief among them is olaratumab, which, in combination with doxorubicin, is preferred over doxorubicin alone in the updated NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

### Results of an open-label, phase Ia / b study of pembrolizumab plus olaratumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma [^117LJowU]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The study was divided into two phases that included 3 cohorts: phase Ia dose-escalation (cohort 1 and cohort 2) and phase Ib (dose-expansion cohort). A 3+3 dose-escalation design was used in phase Ia to assess the safety of olaratumab + pembrolizumab and to determine the dose of phase Ib. In phase Ia, eligible patients in cohort 1 received olaratumab 15 mg/kg i.v. on day 1 and day 8, patients in cohort 2 received 20 mg/kg i.v. on day 1 and day 8, and patients in both cohorts received pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. fixed-dose on day 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle. In phase Ib, (dose-expansion cohort), patients received olaratumab 20 mg/kg (dose was determined during phase Ia) + 200 mg pembrolizumab. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an adverse event (AE) during cycle 1 that was possibly related to the study drug and fulfilled any one of the following criteria using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0: (i) CTCAE grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity with specific exceptions (Supplementary Table S1), (ii) grade 4 anemia, (iii) grade 4 neutropenia or leukopenia of > 5 days duration, (iv) any febrile neutropenia, (v) grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding or grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and (vi) any other significant toxicity deemed by the primary investigator and Lilly clinical research personnel related to the study dose (such as any possible study medication-related toxicity that required the withdrawal of the patient from the study during cycle 1). During the DLT observation period, patients received olaratumab at dose level 1 (15 mg/kg) or level 2 (20 mg/kg). Olaratumab was administered as an approximately 60 (± 5) minute intravenous infusion on day 1 (prior to pembrolizumab) and day 8 of a 21-day cycle. The pembrolizumab dose was fixed at 200 mg which was administered intravenously over 30 minutes on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The phase Ib (dose-expansion) study evaluated additional safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of olaratumab + pembrolizumab.

### Results of an open-label, phase Ia / b study of pembrolizumab plus olaratumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma [^117PZTX5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (exposure) of olaratumab, when given in combination with pembrolizumab, was similar to previous clinical studies where olaratumab was given in combination with other concomitant therapies. Also, as there were just 2 TE-ADA–positive patients, the sample size was too small to draw conclusions on the effect of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. In this study, PD-L1 expression was found only in 2 patients (6%) with synovial sarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. This finding is consistent with a previous report, in which PD-L1 expression was found in only 4% (3 of the 70 samples; ref.). In this study, responses were not seen in the presence of PD-L1 expression.

Conclusion

In this phase Ia/Ib study, olaratumab (15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) was tolerable with a manageable safety profile when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with STS. The type and frequency of the AEs observed were generally consistent with previous studies and in the expected range. The pharmacokinetics (exposure) of olaratumab when given in combination with pembrolizumab was similar to that reported previously. Antitumor activity was observed in the expansion cohort with a long-lasting PR in 6 (21.4%) patients, however, further studies would be needed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination given the small sample size and the heterogeneity of the population enrolled and to investigate the mechanistic impact of the coadministration of olaratumab with the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Translational Relevance

Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a family of rare types of cancer. Currently, there are only a few therapeutic agents available for the treatment of STS; however, there is still an unmet medical demand for improved STS treatment. This article presents the safety and efficacy of olaratumab + pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic STS with disease progression on standard treatment. Results showed that there was no dose-limiting toxicity and both doses of olaratumab (15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) + pembrolizumab were well tolerated. Adverse events reported were generally consistent with previous pembrolizumab or olaratumab monotherapy studies and within the expected frequency range. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and mechanistic impact of the coadministration of platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors with immune checkpoint modulators.

Background

Patients with metastatic sarcoma have limited treatment options. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, respectively. We investigated the activity and safety of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic sarcoma.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older and had central pathology confirmation of sarcoma with at least one measurable lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, evidence of metastatic, locally advanced or unresectable disease, an ECOG performance status of 0–1, and received at least one previous line of systemic therapy. Patients were assigned to treatment in an unblinded manner, as this trial was conducted as two independent, non-comparative phase 2 trials. Enrolled patients were assigned (1:1) via a dynamic allocation algorithm to intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses. Thereafter, all patients received nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma achieving a confirmed objective response. Analysis was per protocol. This study is ongoing although enrolment is closed. It is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02500797.

Findings

Between Aug 13, 2015, and March 17, 2016, 96 patients from 15 sites in the USA underwent central pathology review for eligibility and 85 eligible patients, including planned over-enrolment, were allocated to receive either nivolumab monotherapy (43 patients) or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (42 patients). The primary endpoint analysis was done according to protocol specifications in the first 76 eligible patients (38 patients per group). The number of confirmed responses was two (5% [92% CI 1–16] of 38 patients) in the nivolumab group and six (16% [7–30] of 38 patients) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (four [10%] patients), decreased lymphocyte count (three [7%]), and dehydration, increased lipase, pain, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, secondary benign neoplasm, and urinary tract obstruction (two [5%] patients each) among the 42 patients in the nivolumab group and anaemia (eight [19%] patients), hypotension (four [10%] patients), and pain and urinary tract infection (three [7%] patients each) among the 42 patients in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in eight (19%) of 42 patients receiving monotherapy and 11 (26%) of 42 patients receiving combination therapy, and included anaemia, anorexia, dehydration, decreased platelet count, diarrhoea, fatigue, fever, increased creatinine, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, hyponatraemia, pain, pleural effusion, and pruritus. There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

Nivolumab alone does not warrant further study in an unselected sarcoma population given the limited efficacy. Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab demonstrated promising efficacy in certain sarcoma subtypes, with a manageable safety profile comparable to current available treatment options. The combination therapy met its predefined primary study endpoint; further evaluation of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in a randomised study is warranted.

Sample size determination and statistical analysis

In phase Ia (cohort 1 and cohort 2), 13 patients were treated and evaluated to determine the recommended dose of olaratumab for phase Ib (dose-expansion cohort). In phase Ib (dose-expansion cohort), 28 patients were enrolled with a total sample size of 41 patients. Considering a minimum sample size of N = 31, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was approximately equal to the observed incidence rate (± 15% to 20%) of patients having a specified AE, or patients who showed a response [PR/complete response (CR)] to treatment.

Continuous variables were presented using the mean, SD, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of patients with an observation (n). TEAEs were summarized by SOC. For categorical variables, the population size (N), the number of patients with events (n), and the percentage of patients with events were reported. For time-to-event endpoints including PFS, DoR, irPFS, irDoR, and OS, the survival curve and the median were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival rates with 95% CIs were provided for various time points. Pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted for patients who received at least 1 dose of olaratumab and had samples collected and analyzed, at specified visits and times. The primary parameters for analysis were the maximum observed serum concentration (C max), minimum observed serum concentration (C min), area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 168 hours (AUC 0–168), area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 336 hours (AUC 0–336), and time of observed maximum serum concentration (t max) of olaratumab. The pharmacokinetic parameters for olaratumab were computed by standard noncompartmental methods of analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin 8.1 (Pharsight, A Certara Company). Immunogenicity samples obtained during this study were analyzed for anti-olaratumab antibodies (RRID: AB_2911063) using a validated immunoassay at Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD), LLC. Samples were assessed using a 4-tiered approach for the detection, confirmation, titer determination, and characterization of neutralizing activity of anti-olaratumab antibodies in human serum. For the PD-L1 assessment, 38 tumor tissue samples [mostly fresh biopsies or obtained within 6 months of study enrollment (< 5 archival tissues were received)] were received at baseline for 36 patients (2 patients from the dose-expansion cohort submitted two separate specimens). Out of 38 samples, three samples did not have malignant tumor cells, 9 (9 patients in dose-escalation cohort) and 26 (24 patients in dose-expansion cohort) tissue specimens with the presence of malignant cells were IHC stained for PD-L1 using the clone 22C3 pharmDx kit at Boyce & Bynum Pathology Laboratories. The PD-L1 expression was determined by the tumor proportion score (TPS) and classified into TPS < 1%, TPS 1%–49%, and TPS ≥ 50%.

Methods

Study design and patients

MASCT-I-1005 was a single-center, open-label, 2-part, phase 1 trial (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04074564). Part A assessed the safety and efficacy of two administration schedules for MASCT-I when combined with camrelizumab and apatinib at fixed doses in patients with advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, and part B further assessed MASCT-I (using the schedule selected based on part A) in combination with apatinib at fixed dose. Here, we report the findings in part A.

Eligible patients were 14–70 years of age; had histologically and cytologically confirmed unresectable recurrent or metastatic bone and soft-tissue sarcoma according to the World Health Organization Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumors; had progressed on at least one line of anti-tumor therapy (such as anthracycline-based chemotherapy or VEGFR-TKI) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (for alveolar soft part sarcoma [ASPS] and clear cell sarcoma patients, no prior treatment was allowed for recruitment as no standard treatment existed; for patients with metastases, the maximum diameter should be no more than 8 cm); had at least one measurable lesion per RECIST version 1.1; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1 (for amputees, performance status of 2 was allowed for recruitment); had a life expectancy of at least 6 months; had adequate cardio-pulmonary function; and had adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function. The key exclusion criteria included active bone metastases or brain metastases; active or history of autoimmune diseases or syndrome, or requiring chronic use of steroids, immunomodulators or immunosuppressive drugs within 2 weeks before study entry; anti-tumor therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry; prior treatment with MASCT, other cellular immunotherapy, or antibodies against PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 within the past 1 year; uncontrolled medical disorder (including active tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, or syphilis infection); and being pregnant or planning to be pregnant.

### Randomized phase II trial of sunitinib or cediranib in alveolar soft part sarcoma [^117Wu4uP]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an extremely rare, highly vascular tumor accounting for less than 1% of soft-tissue sarcomas, predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults. ASPS has a variable growth pattern, and frequently metastasizes to the lungs, brain, and bones. The historical 5-year survival rate for patients with unresectable metastatic disease is 20%. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is ineffective in the treatment of ASPS.

ASPS tumors present with a characteristic unbalanced nonreciprocal chromosomal translocation t(X,17)(p11; q25) resulting in the creation of ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor associated with mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET)-related signal transduction. Gene expression profiling studies have revealed upregulation of transcripts associated with proliferation, metastasis, myogenic differentiation, and angiogenesis, including VEGF.

Cediranib is a small-molecule inhibitor of all three VEGFR (VEGFR-1, -2, and -3) tyrosine kinases. In a phase II trial, single-agent cediranib produced an objective response rate (ORR) of 35% and a disease control rate of 84% at 24 weeks in 43 patients with metastatic, unresectable ASPS. Other clinical results support targeting VEGFR in this tumor, including a trial of the multikinase inhibitor sunitinib which demonstrated five partial responses (PR) in 9 patients with metastatic ASPS in the context of a compassionate use program. In addition, retrospective and prospective studies of sunitinib, alone or in combination, indicate that this agent may have clinical activity in several sarcomas, including soft-tissue sarcomas. Therefore, we conducted a phase II randomized trial of single-agent cediranib or sunitinib to determine whether sunitinib or cediranib could be associated with a modestly high rate of clinical response in patients with ASPS.

### Developments in systemic therapy for soft tissue and bone sarcomas [^112qxKbq]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

The past year has led to significant changes in systemic therapies used to treat soft tissue sarcomas, mainly dominated by the removal of the recently approved drug olaratumab as part of combination therapy with doxorubicin from the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma, according to Dr. Suzanne George. Several histology-specific drugs have entered the space, including pazopanib and pembrolizumab, the latter of which was approved as a category 2B recommendation for alveolar soft part sarcoma, highlighting the rather limited role of immunotherapy in sarcomas. Dr. George also discussed updated data for sorafenib in the treatment of desmoid tumors, as well as the importance of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive tumors.

8.3	Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TECENTRIQ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Contraception

Females

Based on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECENTRIQ and for at least 5 months following the last dose.

Infertility

Females

Based on animal studies, TECENTRIQ may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4	Pediatric Use

Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma

The safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ for unresectable or metastatic ASPS have been established in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Use of TECENTRIQ for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well controlled study of TECENTRIQ in adults and 2 adolescent pediatric patients (≥ 12 years of age) with ASPS with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients 2 years to < 17 years. These data suggest that atezolizumab exposure in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older is comparable with that of adults and is expected to result in similar safety and efficacy to that of adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Pharmacokinetics (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The course of unresectable or metastatic ASPS is sufficiently similar between pediatric patients 2 to 11 years old and that of adults and adolescent patients to allow extrapolation of efficacy and safety to pediatric patients 2 years and older.

The safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ for ASPS have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.

Solid Tumors and Lymphomas

The safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ in pediatric patients have not been established in non-small cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, or melanoma.

The safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ were assessed, but not established in a single-arm, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (NCT02541604) in 60 pediatric patients aged 7 months to < 17 years with relapsed or progressive solid tumors and lymphomas. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this study.

Dose adjustment: reductions, delays, and omissions

The median (Q1–Q3) duration of treatment for olaratumab was 6 (3.0–11.9) weeks for cohort 1, 14.4 (12.4–20.9) weeks for cohort 2, and 14 (6.0–21.8) weeks for the dose-expansion cohort; for pembrolizumab, it was 6 weeks for cohort 1, 14.2 weeks for cohort 2, and 12.5 weeks for the dose-expansion cohort. The majority of dose adjustments (delays, omissions, and reductions) were due to AEs. A total number of 7 patients in cohort 1, 5 in cohort 2, and 26 in the dose-expansion cohort had ≥ 1 dose adjustment. Only 2 patients in the dose-expansion cohort had a dose reduction of olaratumab (dose reductions were determined by the investigator depending on the best interest of the patient or if the patient experienced a DLT). No dose reductions were made for pembrolizumab. In addition, 3 patients (olaratumab: 2 patients, pembrolizumab: 1 patient) in cohort 2 and 14 patients (olaratumab: 8 patients, pembrolizumab: 6 patients) in the dose-expansion cohort had dose delays. Dose omission was reported among 7 patients (olaratumab: 5 patients, pembrolizumab: 2 patients) in cohort 1, 3 patients in olaratumab in cohort 2, and 19 patients (olaratumab: 14 patients, pembrolizumab: 5 patients) in the dose-expansion cohort (Supplementary Table S2).

Soft tissue sarcoma — unresectable or stage IV disease: Biopsy is recommended before any treatment for a patient with unresectable or metastatic disease (RETSARC-4). Patients with unresectable or stage IV disease could be treated with systemic therapy and/or radiation therapy (RT), or undergo surgery for symptom control, and observation is an option if the patient is asymptomatic and there is indolent tumor growth. For patients undergoing definitive high-dose RT, there has been favorable experience reported in the literature with the use of tissue displacement spacers to keep bowel out of the high-dose RT volume. In terms of response rate, the most active chemotherapy regimen in an unselected patient population is AIM (doxorubicin/ifosfamide/mesna). For unresectable or stage IV disease, follow-up imaging is recommended to assess treatment response, and options include CT (preferred) or MRI. Palliative or best supportive care are options if the tumor remains unresectable or if there is disease progression following primary treatment, and in patients with stage IV disease, resection should always be considered for resectable metastatic disease if the primary tumor can be controlled.

### Phase II study of TQB2450, a novel PD-L1 antibody, in combination with anlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma [^114rHjTX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Current systemic treatment for unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (LA/M STS) remains unsatisfactory. The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor anlotinib had gained success in the second line treatment of LA/M STS. Immunotherapy could further improve outcomes for patients with advanced STS. TQB2450 is a humanized mAb against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Treating patients with STS who failed first-line chemotherapy [for patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), previous systemic treatment naїve was allowed] with TQB2450 and anlotinib led to an objective response rate of 75.00% and 11.11% for ASPS and non-ASPS subtypes, respectively. The toxicity is tolerable. This treatment combination showed the promising activity in patients with ASPS and the trend of treatment efficacy in others sarcomas.

### Doxorubicin alone versus intensified doxorubicin plus ifosfamide for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma: a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^111F5b6x]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective targeted treatment is unavailable for most sarcomas and doxorubicin and ifosfamide-which have been used to treat soft-tissue sarcoma for more than 30 years-still have an important role. Whether doxorubicin alone or the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide should be used routinely is still controversial. We assessed whether dose intensification of doxorubicin with ifosfamide improves survival of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma compared with doxorubicin alone.

Methods

We did this phase 3 randomised controlled trial (EORTC 62012) at 38 hospitals in ten countries. We included patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma, age 18–60 years with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. They were randomly assigned (1:1) by the minimisation method to either doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) by intravenous bolus on day 1 or 72 h continuous intravenous infusion) or intensified doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2); 25 mg/m(2) per day, days 1–3) plus ifosfamide (10 g/m(2) over 4 days with mesna and pegfilgrastim) as first-line treatment. Randomisation was stratified by centre, performance status (0 vs 1), age (< 50 vs ≥ 50 years), presence of liver metastases, and histopathological grade (2 vs 3). Patients were treated every 3 weeks till progression or unacceptable toxic effects for up to six cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00061984.

Findings

Between April 30, 2003, and May 25, 2010, 228 patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin and 227 to receive doxorubicin and ifosfamide. Median follow-up was 56 months (IQR 31–77) in the doxorubicin only group and 59 months (36–72) in the combination group. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups (median overall survival 12.8 months [95.5% CI 10.5–14.3] in the doxorubicin group vs 14.3 months [12.5–16.5] in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.83 [95.5% CI 0.67–1.03]; stratified log-rank test p = 0.076). Median progression-free survival was significantly higher for the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group (7.4 months [95% CI 6.6–8.3]) than for the doxorubicin group (4.6 months [2.9–5.6]; HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.60–0.90], stratified log-rank test p = 0.003). More patients in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group than in the doxorubicin group had an overall response (60 [26%] of 227 patients vs 31 [14%] of 228; p < 0.0006). The most common grade 3 and 4 toxic effects-which were all more common with doxorubicin and ifosfamide than with doxorubicin alone-were leucopenia (97 [43%] of 224 patients vs 40 [18%] of 223 patients), neutropenia (93 [42%] vs 83 [37%]), febrile neutropenia (103 (46%) vs 30 [13%]), anaemia (78 [35%] vs 10 [5%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [33%]) vs one [< 1%]).

Interpretation

Our results do not support the use of intensified doxorubicin and ifosfamide for palliation of advanced soft-tissue sarcoma unless the specific goal is tumour shrinkage. These findings should help individualise the care of patients with this disease.

### Durvalumab plus tremelimumab in advanced or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas: a single-centre phase 2 trial [^112P9MGs]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Few standard treatment options are available for patients with metastatic sarcomas. We did this trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and changes in the tumour microenvironment for durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 drug, and tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 drug, across multiple sarcoma subtypes.

Methods

In this single-centre phase 2 trial, done at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX USA), patients aged 18 years or older with advanced or metastatic sarcoma with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 who had received at least one previous line of systemic therapy were enrolled in disease subtype-specific groups (liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, alveolar soft-part sarcoma, chordoma, and other sarcomas). Patients received 1500 mg intravenous durvalumab and 75 mg intravenous tremelimumab for four cycles, followed by durvalumab alone every 4 weeks for up to 12 months. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 12 weeks in the intention-to-treat population (all patients who received at least one dose of treatment). Safety was also analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02815995, and is completed.

Between Aug 17, 2016, and April 9, 2018, 62 patients were enrolled, of whom 57 (92%) received treatment and were included in the intention-to-treat population. With a median follow-up of 37.2 months (IQR 1.8–10.1), progression-free survival at 12 weeks was 49% (95% CI 36–61). 21 grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were reported, the most common of which were increased lipase (four [7%] of 57 patients), colitis (three [5%] patients), and pneumonitis (three [5%] patients). Nine (16%) patients had a treatment related serious adverse event. One patient had grade 5 pneumonitis and colitis.

Interpretation

The combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is an active treatment regimen for advanced or metastatic sarcoma and merits evaluation in specific subsets in future trials.

Funding

AstraZeneca.

Advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma — gemcitabine combinations: Gemcitabine combined with docetaxel, vinorelbine, or dacarbazine has been shown to be active in unresectable or metastatic STS. In a randomized phase II study, gemcitabine plus docetaxel was associated with superior progression‑free survival (6.2 and 3.0 months, respectively) and OS (17.9 and 11.5 months, respectively) compared with gemcitabine alone in metastatic STS. In another phase II study, gemcitabine plus vinorelbine was associated with clinically meaningful rates of disease control, with clinical benefit (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease at 4 months or more) seen in 25% of patients. Gemcitabine plus dacarbazine resulted in superior PFS (4.2 vs. 2.0 months; P = 0.005) and OS (16.8 vs. 8.2 months).

### First-line aldoxorubicin vs doxorubicin in metastatic or locally advanced unresectable soft-tissue sarcoma: a phase 2b randomized clinical trial [^115xxCzo]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Standard therapy for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma has not changed substantially in decades, and patient prognosis remains poor. Aldoxorubicin, a novel albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin, showed clinical activity against advanced soft-tissue sarcoma in phase 1 studies.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin vs doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

International, multicenter, phase 2b, open-label, randomized study at general community practices, private practices, or institutional practices. Between August 2012 and December 2013, 140 patients with previously untreated locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma were screened.

Interventions

Randomization (2:1) to aldoxorubicin 350 mg/m2 (dose equivalent to doxorubicin 260 mg/m2) or doxorubicin 75 mg/m2, administered once every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points were 6-month progression-free survival, overall survival, tumor response rate, and safety. All efficacy end points were evaluated by independent and local review.

Results

A total of 126 patients were randomized, and 123 received aldoxorubicin (n = 83) or doxorubicin (n = 40). Median (range) patient age was 54.0 (21–77 years); 42 (34%) had leiomyosarcoma. By independent review, median progression-free survival was significantly improved (5.6 [95% CI, 3.0–8.1] vs 2.7 [95% CI, 1.6–4.3] months; P = 0.02) with aldoxorubicin compared with doxorubicin, as was the rate of 6-month progression-free survival (46% and 23%; P = 0.02). Median overall survival was 15.8 (95% CI, 13.0 to not available) months with aldoxorubicin and 14.3 (95% CI, 8.6–20.6) months with doxorubicin (P = 0.21). Overall tumor response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) by independent review was higher with aldoxorubicin than with doxorubicin (25% [20 patients, all partial response] vs 0%). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more frequent with aldoxorubicin than with doxorubicin (24 [29%] vs 5 [12%]), but not grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (12 [14%] vs 7 [18%]). No acute cardiotoxic effects were observed with either treatment, although left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50% occurred in 3 of 40 patients receiving doxorubicin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Single-agent aldoxorubicin therapy showed superior efficacy over doxorubicin by prolonging progression-free survival and improving rates of 6-month progression-free survival and tumor response. Aldoxorubicin therapy exhibited manageable adverse effects, without unexpected events, and without evidence of acute cardiotoxicity. Further investigation of aldoxorubicin therapy in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma is warranted.

Patients and Methods

Patients and treatment schedules

The study protocol was approved in 2019 by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutionalized Review Board (protocol available in Supplementary Materials and Methods) and was conducted in accordance with the Belmont Report, and the U.S. Common Rule. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03899805) and followed STROBE reporting guidelines. Patient enrollment took place at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. All patients provided written informed consent. Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed LMS, LPS, or UPS and other sarcomas that might respond to PD-1 inhibition (UPS/Other). Initially, the UPS/Other cohort only included UPS, but an amendment was introduced to broaden eligibility criteria to include other sarcoma subtypes due to emerging reports of potential efficacy in response to immunotherapy. These "other sarcomas" included various histologies that have been reported to respond to immunotherapy such as alveolar soft part sarcoma, angiosarcoma, mismatch repair deficiency sarcomas, and other entities as determined by the principal investigator and treating physician. Key eligibility criteria included adults ages 18 years or older with advanced or metastatic measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and having received at least one prior line of chemotherapy. Patients were ineligible if they received any prior immunotherapy including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA4, or OX40 agonists, and/or if they had a primary immunodeficiency or solid organ transplant. Adequate organ function was required as specified in the protocol. Upon enrollment, archival tissue was requested for confirmation of diagnosis and correlative studies.

### Safety and feasibility of anlotinib in children with high risk, recurrent or refractory sarcomas: an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, phase Ia / Ib trial [^115P1byT]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In a phase II study, patients with refractory metastatic STS were enrolled to receive anlotinib treatment. A total of 166 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall, the 12-week progression-free rate was 68%, and the objective response rate (ORR) was 13% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.6%–18%]. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.6 and 12 months, respectively. Anlotinib demonstrated antitumour activity in several types of STS and the toxicity was manageable.

In recent years, there have also been studies of combination therapies in adult sarcoma. In one study, 30 patients with advanced STS were enrolled to receive up to six cycles of anlotinib plus epirubicin, followed by anlotinib maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The median PFS was 11.5 months while the median OS was not reached. The ORR was 13.33%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 80.0%. The most common adverse events (AEs) included anaemia (43.3%), nausea/vomiting (40.0%), fatigue (36.7%), leukopenia (30.0%), and proteinuria (10.0%), most of which were grade 1 or 2. No treatment-related death occurred, and the safety profile was favourable. In another study, the combination of anlotinib and TQB2450, a novel PD-L1 antibody, showed promising activity in patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). This single-arm, phase 2 trial involving 29 patients with ASPS demonstrated an ORR of 82.1%, with a median PFS of 35.2 months. The safety profile of the combination therapy was also manageable, with the most common adverse event being hypothyroidism. Importantly, no treatment-related deaths occurred. This combination therapy appears to offer a significant benefit in ASPS, highlighting its potential for broader application in ASPS.

Our previous retrospective study showed that for heavily pretreated paediatric solid tumours, anlotinib monotherapy, as well as its combination with chemotherapy, could offer an effective treatment option with tolerable adverse events. However, there have been no prospective studies of anlotinib in paediatric tumours to identify its safety, the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK). Therefore, this study firstly aimed to investigate the safety, PK and feasibility of anlotinib in paediatric sarcomas.

### Long-term follow-up and patterns of response, progression, and hyperprogression in patients after PD-1 blockade in advanced sarcoma [^115fmh1V]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal neoplasms of bone and soft tissue origin and include more than 70 distinct subtypes. Approximately 15,000 cases of soft tissue and bone sarcomas are diagnosed annually in the United States. Despite primary combined modality therapy, 25% to 50% of patients develop recurrent and/or metastatic disease. For patients with unresectable advanced disease, chemotherapy remains the standard of care. However, complete responses (CR) are rare, and the median overall survival (OS) in the metastatic setting is 15 to 20 months.

Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin alone or gemcitabine with docetaxel lead to responses in about 20% of patients in the front line setting. In the second line, chemotherapy response rates are even lower. With pazopanib, despite improved progression-free survival (PFS) over placebo, the median was 4 months without an improvement in OS. For most patients, with cytotoxic chemotherapy the duration of benefit is short-lived without any potential for cure. Therefore, novel and effective systemic therapies are desperately needed for patients with unresectable and metastatic sarcomas.

Early trials evaluating anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) monotherapy in sarcoma reported low objective response rates (ORR) and brief PFS in an unselected sarcoma population. In SARC028, the ORR to pembrolizumab in the entire population was 11%. A study of pembrolizumab plus metronomic cyclophosphamide reported an ORR of 2%. A study of pembrolizumab plus axitinib reported an ORR of 10% in sarcomas other than alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS), which can be uniquely responsive.

The literature to date is limited by the rarity of individual subtypes of sarcomas, lack of controls in clinical trials, and short follow-up. Consequently, it is not clear whether responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are durable, and heterogeneity among sarcoma subtypes has diluted the perceived response rate of "sarcomas" as a group. For example, the ORR for Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and leiomyosarcoma has been below 10%. In contrast, the ORR for angiosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) may exceed 20%, and in ASPS it could be closer to 50%.

### Cediranib in patients with alveolar soft-part sarcoma (CASPS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial [^111pwsrG]. The Lancet: Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is rare, accounting for less than 0.5% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. It predominantly affects young people, with a median age at presentation of 25 years and most patients younger than 30 years at diagnosis. ASPS commonly involves the lower limb, with a slight predominance in women and a high incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Although metastases are intrinsically indolent, the long-term outlook is poor. Lieberman and colleaguesreport that only 15% of patients with no metastases at diagnosis remained metastasis free after 20 years of follow-up, with a median metastasis-free period of 6 years and median survival after development of metastases of 2 years. If patients presented with metastases, median survival was 3 years, compared with 11 years for patients who were metastasis free at diagnosis, and survival tended to worsen with increasing age. Unusually for a soft-tissue sarcoma, in addition to lung metastases, ASPS also metastasises to brain and bone. Histologically, the disease is characterised by uniform polygonal cells arranged in a pseudoalveolar pattern separated by vascular septae, and molecular studieshave shown a characteristic non-reciprocal translocation, t(X;17)(p11.2; q25), resulting in the ASPSCR1–TFE3 fusion gene that replaces the N-terminal portion of TFE3 in a manner consistent with transcriptional deregulation.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before undertaking this study, the available data concerning the activity of the experimental drug cediranib (previously AZD2171) in the treatment of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) consisted of an index case of extended response in ASPS in a phase 2 trial, a phase 2 study of cediranib in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours and soft tissue sarcomas including ASPS, and a phase 2 single-arm study, which was ongoing at the time the CASPS trial was being developed and has since shown activity in ASPS. Other studies involving ASPS, ongoing and completed, were identified using thewebsite, searching for "alveolar soft part sarcoma"; PubMed, searching for publications in English between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018, using the search terms "tyrosine kinase inhibitor", "anti-angiogenic agent", and "alveolar soft part sarcoma"; via presentations at international meetings, and personal communications. Other drugs with reported activity in ASPS include sunitinib, pazopanib, and anlotinib.

Procedures

Patients received either intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1 every 3 weeks, or intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m 2 on day 1 and intravenous gemcitabine 675 mg/m 2 followed by intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 on day 8 every 3 weeks. Gemcitabine was administered over 90 min and docetaxel was administered over 60 min. Dose capping according to sites' local policy and dose banding to within plus or minus 5% of the calculated dose were permitted. Pre-treatment and post-treatment anti-emetics were given for all trial treatments, as per local anti-emetics policy. In both groups, patients completed up to six cycles of treatment in the absence of disease progression, intolerable side-effects, or withdrawal of consent.

Laboratory monitoring (blood count and biochemistry) was done within 72 h of day 1 of each cycle, with additional monitoring on day 8 (blood count only) for gemcitabine and docetaxel treatment. To proceed with treatment on day 1 of each cycle (both groups) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.0 × 10 9 per L, platelet count of at least 100 × 10 9 per L, bilirubin of up to 1.5 × ULN, and aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or both of up to 3.0 × ULN. For administration of treatment on day 8 (in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group) the following were required: absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.0 × 10 9 per L and platelets of at least 75 × 10 9 per L. Dose modifications for adverse events were made according to prespecified criteria: dose reductions of 20% (first occurrence) ND then 33% (second occurrence) were permitted for doxorubicin (in the case of grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia) and gemcitabine and docetaxel (for grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia, grade 2 neuropathy, or any grade pulmonary toxicity); a third occurrence required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was permitted after an episode of febrile neutropenia, at the discretion of the treating investigator and according to local policy. Dose delays of up to 2 weeks for haematological toxicity and up to 3 weeks for non-haematological toxicity were allowed; delays longer than this required the patient to be withdrawn from treatment. For doxorubicin, patients were advised to be withdrawn from treatment if left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 45% or reduced by 20% from baseline (cardiotoxicity monitoring was done according to local institutional policies). For gemcitabine and docetaxel, patients were withdrawn for the following events: grade 3 pulmonary fibrosis, any grade 4 pulmonary toxicity, grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions (docetaxel only), or grade 3 weight gain.

### Activity and safety of geptanolimab (GB226) for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma: a phase II, single-arm study [^115RsUtn]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) are rare and have few treatment options. We assessed the activity of geptanolimab (GB226), a fully humanized programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic ASPS.

Patients and Methods

We conducted this multicenter, single-arm, phase II study (Gxplore-005, NCT03623581) in patients aged 18–75 years who had unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic ASPS at 11 sites in China. Patients received intravenous geptanolimab (3 mg/kg) every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST 1.1 in the full analysis set population.

Results

Between September 6, 2018 and March 6, 2019, we enrolled and treated 37 patients with 23 (62.2%) having received prior systemic treatment. Fourteen [37.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 22.5–55.2] of 37 patients had an objective response assessed by IRC with a 6-month duration of response rate of 91.7%. Median progression-free survival was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.0-not reached) and disease control was achieved in 32 (86.5%; 95% CI, 71.2–95.5) patients. Three of 37 patients reported grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), including anemia, hypophysitis, and proteinuria [one each (2.7%)]. No grade 4 TRAEs were observed. Two (5.4%) patients discontinued treatment due to TRAEs (one with hypophysitis and one with Mobitz type I atrioventricular block). The baseline percentage of CD4 + T cells was adversely associated with patient response (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Geptanolimab has clinically meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic ASPS.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for soft-tissue sarcomas: a systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis [^111zK5iC]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a diverse and rare group of mesodermal-origin cancers, comprising less than 1% of adult malignancies. According to the 2020 World Health Organization Classification of Soft Tissue and Bone Tumors, there are more than 100 different histological and molecular subtypes, each with distinct prognosis, clinical behavior, and response to systemic treatment.

Although surgery is the standard initial treatment, many patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, requiring systemic therapy. However, the heterogeneity of these malignancies makes it challenging to develop robust, evidence-based treatment strategies. Most of the current therapeutic approaches are not specific to the different histologies and do not consider the molecular profiling of tumors. For most advanced STS cases, standard therapy still relies on cytotoxic chemotherapy. Anthracycline-based regimens have been used for over 30 years and continue to play a significant role in the first-line seating for patients with chemo-sensitive tumors. However, many histological subtypes of STS are known to be resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and, despite intensive regimens, the 5-year survival in metastatic disease ranges from 15% to 30%, with median overall survival of 1.5–2 years.

Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for multiple malignancies, representing a major advance in cancer treatment. PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, either as monotherapies or in combination with anti-CTLA-4, have demonstrated some level of antitumor efficacy in advanced sarcomas, particularly in specific STS subtypes, such as alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), angiosarcomas (AS), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS), and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS). However, the response rate remains modest, with fewer than 20% experiencing significant clinical benefit.

A key factor contributing to the low response of STS to immunotherapy is its inherently cold tumor microenvironment. This is characterized by poor immune cell infiltration and low expression of neoantigens, which limit the effectiveness of immune-based treatments. Consequently, overcoming these barriers remains a major challenge in optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies for these tumors.

### Results of an open-label, phase Ia / b study of pembrolizumab plus olaratumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma [^114yut6m]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose:

The study evaluated safety and efficacy of olaratumab + pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) with disease progression on standard treatment.

Patients and Methods:

This was open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized, phase Ia/Ib dose-escalation study followed by cohort expansion (olaratumab + pembrolizumab intravenous infusion). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability.

Results:

The majority of patients enrolled (n = 41) were female [phase Ia: 9 of 13, phase Ib/dose-expansion cohort (DEC), 17 of 28], aged < 65 years. In phases Ia and Ib, 13 and 26 patients received prior systemic therapy, respectively. Patients received olaratumab 15 mg/kg (phase Ia; cohort 1) or 20 mg/kg (phase Ia; cohort 2 and phase Ib) and pembrolizumab 200 mg (phase Ia/Ib). The median (Q1–Q3) duration of therapy (olaratumab) was 6.0 (3.0–11.9; cohort 1), 14.4 (12.4–20.9; cohort 2), and 14.0 (6.0–21.8) weeks (DEC). No dose-limiting toxicities and few grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAE; 15 mg/kg: 2 (increased lipase); 20 mg/kg: 1 (increased lipase), 1 (colitis), 2 (diarrhea), 3 (anemia)] were reported. Two TEAEs (increased lipase) were related to study discontinuations. Twenty-one patients reported mild (grade ≤ 2) TEAEs [phase Ia, disease control rate (DCR):14.3% (1/7, cohort 1); 66.7% (4/6, cohort 2); no responses were reported; phase Ib, DCR: 53.6% (15/28); objective response rate: 21.4% (6/28; RECIST and irRECIST criteria)]. No response was observed in patients with programmed death ligand-1–positive tumors.

Conclusions:

Antitumor activity was observed in some patients in DEC, and combination was well tolerated with manageable safety profile. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and mechanistic impact of platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors with immune checkpoint modulator coadministration.

### Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the palliative treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma [^111LHc7m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable controversy exists as to whether any benefit of doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy outweighs increased toxic effects, inconvenience, and additional costs, compared to single-agent doxorubicin. There is substantial variation in clinical practice in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

Objectives

To determine:1) the effect, if any on response rate or survival, by using doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic STS2)if combination chemotherapy is associated with increased adverse effects compared with single-agent doxorubicin in this setting.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2002), CANCER LIT (1975 to October 2002), reference lists, the Physician Data Query (PDQ) clinical trials database, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting Proceedings (1995 to 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing single-agent doxorubicin with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy in adults with locally advanced or metastatic STS requiring palliative chemotherapy. Abstracts and full reports published in English were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and assessed by two reviewers. Response and survival data were pooled. Data on adverse effects was tabulated.

Main Results

Data on 2281 participants from eight RCTs were available from reports of single-agent doxorubicin versus doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy. Meta-analysis using the fixed effect model detected a higher tumour response rate with combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.60; p = 0.03), but the OR from a pooled analysis using the random effects model and the same data did not achieve statistical significance (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.67; p = 0.10). No significant difference between the two regimens was detected in the pooled one-year mortality rate (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.05; p = 0.14) or two-year mortality rate (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.06; p = 0.13) (N = 2097). Although reporting of adverse effects was limited and inconsistent among trials (making pooling of data for this outcome impossible), adverse effects such as nausea/vomiting and hematologic toxic effects were consistently reported as being worse with combination chemotherapy across the eight eligible studies.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Compared to single-agent doxorubicin, the combination chemotherapy regimens evaluated, given in conventional doses, produced only marginal increases in response rates, at the expense of increased toxic effects and with no improvements in overall survival.

### Atezolizumab shrinks alveolar soft part sarcomas-NCI… [^114aX1UP]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Seven patients chose this option and, so far, none have had evidence on imaging scans that their tumors are growing again. In December 2022, based on an earlier review of this study and its findings, the Food and Drug Administration approved atezolizumab for adults and children 2 years and older with advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma. This is the first drug ever approved for this rare disease. With chemotherapy largely ineffective against ASPS, researchers have been exploring newer treatments, including targeted therapies, but with little success. One targeted therapy, pazopanib, has been approved for soft tissue sarcomas in general, but it's unclear how well it works against ASPS. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab have also shown hints of promise. In a small clinical trial, tumors shrank in 6 of 11 people with ASPS treated with a combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and the targeted drug axitinib.

Responses with atezolizumab that appear to last In the phase 2 trial, 52 adults and children with advanced ASPS who had not previously been treated with checkpoint inhibitors were given an infusion of atezolizumab every 21 days. Among the 37% of participants whose tumors responded to the treatment, the lone complete response occurred about a year after the person began treatment. Of the remaining 33 participants, 30 had stable disease — that is, their cancer didn't get better or worse. Typically, without treatment, ASPS tumors will continue to grow, Dr. Chen said. The findings have potentially important implications for how the drug is used, Dr. Chen and the team wrote. Because of "the possibility of conversion" to a tumor that can respond to the drug, they continued, only giving it to those whose tumors initially have high PD-1 or PD-L1 levels "may exclude patients with ASPS who have the potential to to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment".

Researchers are now looking at whether combining atezolizumab with other drugs might help boost its effectiveness, particularly among those that don't respond to atezolizumab alone. Dr. Chen and her colleagues have launched a trial comparing atezolizumab alone with atezolizumab in combination with selinexor, which works by blocking a key protein that tumor cells need to grow.

### Olaratumab and doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone for treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma: an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 trial [^116u4ZJY]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment with doxorubicin is a present standard of care for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and median overall survival for those treated is 12–16 months, but few, if any, novel treatments or chemotherapy combinations have been able to improve these poor outcomes. Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody that has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.

Methods

We did an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma at 16 clinical sites in the USA. For both the phase 1b and phase 2 parts of the study, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma not previously treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFRα expression by immunohistochemistry. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) or doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimisation randomisation technique. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety and the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided α level of 0.2 and statistical power of 0.8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01185964.

Findings

15 patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin in the phase 1b study, and 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab plus doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin alone) in the phase 2 trial, 129 (97%) of whom received at least one dose of study treatment (64 received olaratumab plus doxorubicin, 65 received doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1–8.3) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (2.8–5.4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 0.44–1.02, p = 0.0615). Median overall survival was 26.5 months (20.9–31.7) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 14.7 months (9.2–17.1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR 0.46, 0.30–0.71, p = 0.0003). The objective response rate was 18.2% (9.8–29.6) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 11.9% (5.3–22.2) with doxorubicin (p = 0.3421). Steady state olaratumab serum concentrations were reached during cycle 3 with mean maximum and trough concentrations ranging from 419 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation in percentage [CV%] 26.2) to 487 μg/mL (CV% 33.0) and from 123 μg/mL (CV% 31.2) to 156 μg/mL (CV% 38.0), respectively. Adverse events that were more frequent with olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (37 [58%] vs 23 [35%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 [35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [18%]), and diarrhoea (22 [34%] vs 15 [23%]). Febrile neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was similar in both groups (olaratumab plus doxorubicin: eight [13%] of 64 patients vs doxorubicin: nine [14%] of 65 patients).

Interpretation

This study of olaratumab with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly significant improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival, suggesting a potential shift in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.

Soft tissue sarcoma — palliative radiation therapy notes that palliative radiation can improve symptoms from unresectable or metastatic disease. Radiation dose and fractionation should be determined based on normal tissue constraints, performance status, patient prognosis, and prior treatment history. Patients with limited volume metastatic disease and an excellent performance status may benefit from dose escalation through intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and patients who have previously received irradiation to the treatment site may benefit from IMRT or SBRT to improve the safety of reirradiation. These guidelines are intended to treat the adult population, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

NCCN Guidelines — adult rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) management guidance: These guidelines strongly recommend that all patients should be referred to institutions with expertise in treating patients with RMS, and evaluation by a multidisciplinary team involving pediatric, medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists is strongly encouraged. Multimodality treatment (surgery, RT, and chemotherapy) planning and risk stratification is required for all patients, and PET imaging may be useful for initial staging because of the possibility of nodal metastases and the appearance of unusual sites of initial metastatic disease in adult patients. Systemic chemotherapy options for RMS may be different than those used with other STS histologies; pleomorphic RMS is usually excluded from RMS randomized clinical trials and consideration to treat according to STS guidelines may be warranted for this group of patients. In the absence of data from prospective clinical trials, there are no definitive, optimal regimens for the management of adult RMS. See Systemic Therapy Agents and Regimens with Activity in Soft Tissue Sarcoma in the algorithm for a list of chemotherapy regimens that are recommended for the management of adults with RMS.

### Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of alveolar soft-part sarcoma: a review [^115Af8ZM]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare, translocation-driven sarcoma of the soft tissues. Alveolar soft-part sarcoma often affects young adults and is characterized by indolent behavior but early evidence of metastatic spread. After recognition of ASPS as a specific entity in 1952, retrospective data indicated prolonged survival in patients with metastases, despite inherent resistance to conventional doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have provided unexpected new treatment strategies for ASPS.

Observations

This review includes articles published between 1952 and March 1, 2018. With the introduction of new molecular diagnostic tools and therapies, the distinctive features of ASPS have become more evident. The identification and better understanding of molecular pathways activated by the characteristic t(X;17)(p11; q25) translocation and its correspondent chimeric ASPSCR1-transcription factor E3 (TFE3) fusion protein open new paths to drug development. The associations of TFE3 and facilitation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment provide a rationale for exploring treatments that affect the balance between T-effector cells and T-regulatory cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, cediranib, and pazopanib, show activity with either tumor responses or disease stabilization in more than 50% of the cases. Given the association of new agents with patient outcomes, it is too early to say whether metastatic ASPS should still be considered incurable in all patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

The biologic outcomes of the canonical genomic event in ASPS remain under investigation; a better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the multiple pathways activated in this sarcoma, including unusual bioenergetics, MET signaling, and angiogenesis, should lead to more rational therapy. Basket trials and related prospective studies focusing on the intersection of specific signaling pathways and diseases with unique genomic features, such as ASPS, will provide an understanding of new options for care.

Procedures

Anlotinib was given orally once daily at 12 mg on day 1–14, followed by one week off, every three weeks per cycle. The doses were chosen based on a previous study in advanced refractory solid tumours. The treatment continued until progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity. Dose reduction to 10 mg per day or 8 mg per day of anlotinib was allowed due to grade 3 nonhaematologic or grade 4 haematologic toxicities, according to the protocol-defined dose modification criteria. Briefly, if the patient could not tolerate 12 mg per day, then the dose could be reduced to 10 mg per day or 8 mg per day. If the dose of 8 mg per day was not tolerated, then treatment was terminated. Once the anlotinib dose was reduced, it could no longer be increased.

In accordance with RECIST version 1.1, responses were assessed by an independent experienced radiologist at each site. Tumour assessment was performed using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within four weeks before treatment started at baseline, 3 weeks after treatment initiation, and every 2 cycles (6 weeks) thereafter. Tumour responses had to be confirmed at least 4 weeks later with a repeat scan. Adverse events were recorded throughout the treatment period and 21 days after the last dose and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The follow-up evaluations were conducted every 8 weeks after treatment was discontinued until the date of death or the data cut-off.

Outcomes

The primary end point was PFS for anlotinib maintenance treatment. Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), and safety. PFS was defined as the period from the start of anlotinib maintenance treatment until the date of disease progression or death due to any cause (which ever occur first). If the subject did not experience disease progression or death, PFS is defined as the period from initiation of treatment to the date of the last confirmed progression-free status. If no postbaseline tumour assessment is available, PFS was censored at the date of enrolment plus one day. The OS was defined as the period from the start of anlotinib maintenance treatment until death due to any cause. According to RECIST version 1.1, the ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or PR prior to progression or any further therapy, and the DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR, PR, and SD.

### Results of an open-label, phase Ia / b study of pembrolizumab plus olaratumab in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma [^114nSUux]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The study evaluated safety and efficacy of olaratumab + pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) with disease progression on standard treatment.

Patients and Methods

This was open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized, phase Ia/Ib dose-escalation study followed by cohort expansion (olaratumab + pembrolizumab intravenous infusion). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability.

Results

The majority of patients enrolled (n = 41) were female [phase Ia: 9 of 13, phase Ib/dose-expansion cohort (DEC), 17 of 28], aged < 65 years. In phases Ia and Ib, 13 and 26 patients received prior systemic therapy, respectively. Patients received olaratumab 15 mg/kg (phase Ia; cohort 1) or 20 mg/kg (phase Ia; cohort 2 and phase Ib) and pembrolizumab 200 mg (phase Ia/Ib). The median (Q1-Q3) duration of therapy (olaratumab) was 6.0 (3.0–11.9; cohort 1), 14.4 (12.4–20.9; cohort 2), and 14.0 (6.0–21.8) weeks (DEC). No dose-limiting toxicities and few grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAE; 15 mg/kg: 2 (increased lipase); 20 mg/kg: 1 (increased lipase), 1 (colitis), 2 (diarrhea), 3 (anemia)] were reported. Two TEAEs (increased lipase) were related to study discontinuations. Twenty-one patients reported mild (grade ≤ 2) TEAEs [phase Ia, disease control rate (DCR):14.3% (1/7, cohort 1); 66.7% (4/6, cohort 2); no responses were reported; phase Ib, DCR: 53.6% (15/28); objective response rate: 21.4% (6/28; RECIST and irRECIST criteria)]. No response was observed in patients with programmed death ligand-1-positive tumors.

Conclusions

Antitumor activity was observed in some patients in DEC, and combination was well tolerated with manageable safety profile. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and mechanistic impact of platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors with immune checkpoint modulator coadministration.

### Assessment of safety and efficacy of combined trabectedin and low-dose radiotherapy for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas: a nonrandomized phase 1 / 2 clinical trial [^117MjcPt]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Active therapeutic combinations, such as trabectedin and radiotherapy, offer potentially higher dimensional response in second-line treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas. Dimensional response can be relevant both for symptom relief and for survival.

Objective

To assess the combined use of trabectedin and radiotherapy in treating patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 1 of this nonrandomized clinical trial followed the classic 3+3 design, with planned radiotherapy at a fixed dose of 30 Gy (3 Gy/d for 10 days) and infusion of trabectedin at 1.3 mg/m2 as the starting dose, 1.5 mg/m2 as dose level +1, and 1.1 mg/m2 as dose level -1. Phase 2 followed the Simon optimal 2-stage design. Allowing for type I and II errors of 10%, treatment success was defined as an overall response rate of 35%. This study was conducted in 9 sarcoma referral centers in Spain, France, and Italy from April 13, 2015, to November 20, 2018. Adult patients with progressing metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and having undergone at least 1 previous line of systemic therapy were enrolled. In phase 2, patients fitting inclusion criteria and receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin and the radiotherapy regimen constituted the per-protocol population; those receiving at least 1 cycle of trabectedin, the safety population.

Interventions

Trabectedin was administered every 3 weeks in a 24-hour infusion. Radiotherapy was required to start within 1 hour after completion of the first trabectedin infusion (cycle 1, day 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The dose-limiting toxic effects of trabectedin (phase 1) and the overall response rate (phase 2) with use of trabectedin plus irradiation in metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas.

Results

Eighteen patients (11 of whom were male) were enrolled in phase 1, and 27 other patients (14 of whom were female) were enrolled in phase 2. The median ages of those enrolled in phases 1 and 2 were 42 (range, 23–74) years and 51 (range, 27–73) years, respectively. In phase 1, dose-limiting toxic effects included grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 5 days in 1 patient at the starting dose level and a grade 4 alanine aminotransferase level increase in 1 of 6 patients at the +1 dose level. In phase 2, among 25 patients with evaluable data, the overall response rate was 72% (95% CI, 53%-91%) for local assessment and 60% (95% CI, 39%-81%) for central assessment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study suggest that the recommended dose of trabectedin for use in combination with this irradiation regimen is 1.5 mg/m2. The trial met its primary end point, with a high overall response rate that indicates the potential of this combination therapy for achieving substantial tumor shrinkage beyond first-line systemic therapy in patients with metastatic, progressing soft-tissue sarcomas.
