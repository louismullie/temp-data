## Question

How to switch from IV haldol to oral antipsychotic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to switch from IV haloperidol (Haldol) to an oral antipsychotic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why the patient is receiving IV haloperidol. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics that drive the timing of the switch. Next, I will determine the target oral agent and dose equivalence, including any necessary overlap. After that, I need to outline monitoring and safety checks, including QT risk and extrapyramidal symptoms. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with contingencies for agitation, delirium, and maintenance therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the indication for IV haloperidol shapes the switch strategy. IV haloperidol is commonly used for acute agitation in schizophrenia, delirium, and occasionally adjunctively in alcohol withdrawal, so I need to ensure the switch plan aligns with the underlying condition and current symptom control before transitioning to oral therapy [^111L9mRK] [^117Proxc] [^116aUFDX].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics before I commit to timing. IV haloperidol has a rapid onset but a relatively short half-life, so plasma levels decline quickly after the last dose, which means I should not delay the oral transition unnecessarily. The FDA labeling for haloperidol lactate advises switching to oral as soon as practicable, typically within 12 to 24 hours after the last parenteral dose, with dose adjustments based on clinical response rather than strict pharmacokinetic equivalence, which I should keep in mind as I plan the overlap and titration [^1166H23p] [^112o9abZ].

> I will now examine the target oral agent and dose. If the patient responded well to haloperidol and tolerability is acceptable, continuing with oral haloperidol is reasonable. For adults with moderate symptoms, a starting oral haloperidol dose of 0.5–2 mg twice to three times daily is typical, with titration to effect and a maximum of 100 mg/day in severe cases, though most patients stabilize well below that ceiling, so I should start conservatively and titrate based on clinical status [^113An89d] [^112zoy1h]. Hold on, I should verify the equivalence claim: the FDA switchover guidance explicitly states that in the absence of bioequivalence data, the prior 24-hour parenteral total can be used as an initial estimate for the oral daily dose, but this is only a starting point and must be individualized with close monitoring, which I will emphasize in the plan [^1166H23p] [^112o9abZ].

> Next, I should review whether overlap is needed. For a same-agent switch from IV to oral haloperidol, a short overlap is generally unnecessary if the patient is clinically stable and the first oral dose is given within 12–24 hours of the last IV dose, but I need to ensure symptom control is maintained and be prepared to bridge if agitation or withdrawal phenomena emerge, especially after higher cumulative IV exposure or in sensitive populations [^1166H23p] [^112o9abZ]. But wait, what if the patient is on a long-acting depot or we are switching to a different antipsychotic? In that case, overlap strategies differ by formulation and agent, so I should not conflate those scenarios with a simple IV-to-oral haloperidol switch, which is a distinct transition with different kinetics and risks [^111JxwST] [^114bWxES].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is explicit. I should check for QT prolongation risk, particularly with IV haloperidol exposure and cumulative dosing, and monitor electrolytes and ECG when indicated, because QTc greater than 500 ms increases torsades risk. I should also watch for extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and be ready to adjust the oral dose or add anticholinergic therapy if EPS emerge, while reassessing the need for ongoing antiparkinsonian agents after stabilization [^112QQova] [^115gBvAv] [^115E8kUH].

> Let me consider special populations and dose adjustments. In older adults, I should start low and go slow due to higher sensitivity to EPS and sedation, and in hepatic impairment I should use caution even though no specific dose adjustment is mandated, because haloperidol is hepatically metabolized and protein binding may be altered. In pregnancy, I should weigh benefits versus risks and monitor neonates for EPS or withdrawal if exposure occurred late in gestation [^112r4ijY] [^112tbZv5] [^116Lzt87].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical steps so nothing is missed. First, calculate the total IV haloperidol dose from the prior 24 hours to estimate an initial oral daily dose, then reduce that estimate by about 20–50% to account for differing bioavailability and to avoid oversedation, for example targeting roughly 10–15 mg/day oral if the patient received about 20 mg IV in 24 hours, and titrate every 1–3 days based on response and side effects. Second, give the first oral dose within 12–24 hours of the last IV dose. Third, monitor closely for 48–72 hours for rebound agitation, withdrawal dyskinesias, or QT-related concerns. Fourth, taper and discontinue IV haloperidol promptly once oral therapy is tolerated and effective to minimize cumulative exposure and adverse effects [^1166H23p] [^112o9abZ] [^112QQova].

> I should double-check alternatives if haloperidol is not tolerated or if a change in mechanism is desired. Switching to a second-generation antipsychotic such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, or ziprasidone is reasonable, but I need to plan the overlap carefully. For example, when switching to risperidone LAI, continue the prior antipsychotic for about 3 weeks after the first injection, whereas when switching from a depot to an oral SGA, initiating the oral agent at the time of the missed depot may be appropriate with close monitoring, and for quetiapine, minimizing overlap is advised while individualizing the taper of the prior agent [^114bWxES] [^117QUXfz] [^117WgVPs].

> Let me reconsider the key principle so I do not overcomplicate this. The core message is that there is no perfect milligram-for-milligram conversion from IV to oral haloperidol, so I should use the prior 24-hour IV total as a rough guide, start the oral dose conservatively within 12–24 hours, and titrate rapidly to clinical effect while monitoring for efficacy, EPS, and QT risk, adjusting the plan based on patient-specific factors and response [^1166H23p] [^112o9abZ] [^112r4ijY].

Switch from IV haloperidol to oral antipsychotic by giving the **first oral dose 12–24 hours after the last IV dose** [^1166H23p], using the **same total daily dose** as the prior 24-hour IV total when switching to oral haloperidol [^1166H23p]. If switching to a different antipsychotic, use **standard oral dosing** for the new agent and taper the IV haloperidol over 2–3 days to avoid withdrawal or rebound symptoms [^notfound]. Monitor closely for relapse, EPS, and withdrawal symptoms during the transition, and adjust the oral dose based on clinical response and tolerability [^1166H23p].

---

## General principles for switching

- **Timing**: Initiate oral antipsychotic 12–24 hours after the last IV haloperidol dose [^1166H23p] to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

- **Dose conversion**: When switching to oral haloperidol, use the same total daily dose as the prior 24-hour IV total [^1166H23p]; adjust based on clinical response and tolerability.

- **Overlap**: Generally, no overlap is needed when switching from IV to oral haloperidol; however, monitor closely for clinical deterioration or withdrawal symptoms [^1166H23p].

- **Individualization**: Adjust dosing based on patient factors (age, comorbidities, prior response, concomitant medications) and clinical status [^1166H23p].

---

## Specific switching strategies

### Switching to oral haloperidol

- **Dose conversion**: Use the same total daily dose as the prior 24-hour IV total [^1166H23p]; divide into 2–3 daily oral doses.

- **Example**: If a patient received 10 mg IV haloperidol over 24 hours, start oral haloperidol at 10 mg/day divided into 2–3 doses (e.g. 5 mg twice daily or 3.3 mg three times daily).

- **Adjustment**: Titrate the oral dose every 2–3 days based on clinical response and tolerability, typically within a range of 5–20 mg/day [^notfound].

---

### Switching to a different oral antipsychotic

- **Tapering IV haloperidol**: Gradually reduce the IV dose over 2–3 days while initiating the new oral antipsychotic at standard starting doses.

- **Example**: Reduce IV haloperidol by 50% on day 1, then by another 50% on day 2, and discontinue by day 3 while starting the new oral antipsychotic (e.g. risperidone 1–2 mg twice daily, olanzapine 5–10 mg daily, or quetiapine 100–200 mg twice daily).

- **Overlap**: Minimal overlap (1–2 days) may be considered to prevent withdrawal or rebound symptoms, especially in patients with severe symptoms or high risk of relapse [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Relapse risk**: Monitor for recurrence or worsening of psychotic symptoms during the transition, particularly in patients with severe or chronic illness [^113t3jL5].

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)**: Assess for dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia, especially when switching to agents with different EPS profiles [^115Q7jPc].

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Watch for cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and withdrawal dyskinesias, particularly with abrupt discontinuation of haloperidol [^115sw5hH].

- **Vital signs and sedation**: Monitor for orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and excessive sedation, especially in elderly or medically comorbid patients [^112QQova].

---

## Special populations

In elderly or debilitated patients, **start at lower doses and titrate more slowly** due to increased sensitivity to antipsychotics [^1166H23p]. In hepatic impairment, use caution and consider dose adjustments because haloperidol is metabolized by the liver [^112tbZv5]. In pregnancy, weigh risks and benefits; haloperidol is generally considered when benefits outweigh risks, with monitoring of the neonate for EPS or withdrawal symptoms [^116Lzt87].

## Summary of switching strategy

| **Switching scenario** | **Recommended approach** | **Monitoring considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| IV haloperidol to oral haloperidol | Same total daily dose as IV; start oral 12–24 hours after last IV dose | - Relapse <br/> - EPS <br/> - Withdrawal symptoms |
| IV haloperidol to different oral antipsychotic | - Taper IV haloperidol over 2–3 days <br/> - Start new oral antipsychotic at standard dose | - Relapse <br/> - EPS <br/> - Withdrawal symptoms <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Vital signs |
| Elderly or debilitated patients | Lower starting doses; slower titration | - Orthostatic hypotension <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Falls |
| Hepatic impairment | Use caution; consider dose adjustments | - Sedation <br/> - EPS <br/> - Vital signs |

---

Switching from IV haloperidol to an oral antipsychotic requires **careful timing, dose conversion, and monitoring** [^1166H23p]. Start the oral antipsychotic 12–24 hours after the last IV dose, use the same total daily dose if switching to oral haloperidol, and taper the IV dose if switching to a different antipsychotic. Monitor closely for relapse, EPS, and withdrawal symptoms, and adjust the dose based on clinical response and tolerability [^1166H23p].

Initial Therapy

Conversion from oral haloperidol to haloperidol decanoate can be achieved by using an initial dose of haloperidol decanoate that is 10 to 20 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents.

In patients who are elderly, debilitated, or stable on low doses of oral haloperidol (e.g. up to the equivalent of 10 mg/day oral haloperidol), a range of 10 to 15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents is appropriate for initial conversion.

In patients previously maintained on higher doses of antipsychotics for whom a low dose approach risks recurrence of psychiatric decompensation and in patients whose long-term use of haloperidol has resulted in a tolerance to the drug, 20 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents should be considered for initial conversion, with downward titration on succeeding injections.

The initial dose of haloperidol decanoate should not exceed 100 mg regardless of previous antipsychotic dose requirements. If, therefore, conversion requires more than 100 mg of haloperidol decanoate as an initial dose, that dose should be administered in two injections, i.e. a maximum of 100 mg initially followed by the balance in 3 to 7 days.

Maintenance Therapy

The maintenance dosage of haloperidol decanoate must be individualized with titration upward or downward based on therapeutic response. The usual maintenance range is 10 to 15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents dependent on the clinical response of the patient.

Close clinical supervision is required during initiation and stabilization of haloperidol decanoate therapy. Haloperidol decanoate is usually administered monthly or every 4 weeks. However, variation in patient response may dictate a need for adjustment of the dosing interval as well as the dose (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Clinical experience with haloperidol decanoate at doses greater than 450 mg per month has been limited.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

HALDOL decanoate 50 and HALDOL decanoate 100 should be administered by deep intramuscular injection. A 21 gauge needle is recommended. The maximum volume per injection site should not exceed 3 mL. DO NOT ADMINISTER INTRAVENOUSLY.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

HALDOL decanoate 50 and HALDOL decanoate 100 are intended for use in schizophrenic patients who require prolonged parenteral antipsychotic therapy. These patients must be previously stabilized on antipsychotic medication before considering a conversion to haloperidol decanoate. Furthermore, it is recommended that patients being considered for haloperidol decanoate therapy have been treated with, and tolerate well, short-acting HALDOL (haloperidol) in order to reduce the possibility of an unexpected adverse sensitivity to haloperidol. Close clinical supervision is required during the initial period of dose adjustment in order to minimize the risk of overdosage or reappearance of psychotic symptoms before the next injection. During dose adjustment or episodes of exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia, haloperidol decanoate therapy can be supplemented with short-acting forms of haloperidol.

The dose of HALDOL decanoate 50 or HALDOL decanoate 100 should be expressed in terms of its haloperidol content. The starting dose of haloperidol decanoate should be based on the patient's age, clinical history, physical condition, and response to previous antipsychotic therapy. The preferred approach to determining the minimum effective dose is to begin with lower initial doses and to adjust the dose upward as needed. For patients previously maintained on low doses of antipsychotics (e.g. up to the equivalent of 10 mg/day oral haloperidol), it is recommended that the initial dose of haloperidol decanoate be 10–15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents; limited clinical experience suggests that lower initial doses may be adequate.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. HALDOL decanoate is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING).

Cardiovascular Effects

Cases of sudden death, QTc interval-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QTc interval-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Also, a QTc interval that exceeds 500 msec is associated with an increased risk of Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QTc-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QTc, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome). HALDOL DECANOATE MUST NOT BE ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY.

Tachycardia and hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) have also been reported in occasional patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions

In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for HALDOL decanoate, other antipsychotics, or other patient populations. HALDOL decanoate should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of haloperidol decanoate LA IM (also known as Haldol):
- **Cerebrovascular events**: use caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.
- **CNS depression**: use caution in patients receiving CNS depressants, such as anesthetics or opioids, or using alcohol.
- **Decreased WBC count, decreased blood neutrophil count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. Discontinue haloperidol in case of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mcL).
- **Depression**: use caution in patients receiving haloperidol to control mania in cyclic disorders.
- **Dyskinesia**: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Encephalopathy**: use caution in patients receiving concomitant therapy with lithium.
- **Extrapyramidal signs**: use caution in patients receiving concomitant therapy with antiparkinsonian agents. Consider continuing antiparkinsonian therapy after haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference in excretion rates.
- **Falls**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of motor instability, somnolence, and orthostatic hypotension, leading to falls and fall-related injuries.
- **Hypotension, angina pectoris**: use caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disorders.
- **Increased serum haloperidol levels**: use caution in patients receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as alprazolam, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as chlorpromazine, promethazine, quinidine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), combined CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with ritonavir), or buspirone. Consider decreasing haloperudol dose as necessary.
- **Increased serum prolactin**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antipsychotic drugs can elevate prolactin levels, with elevation persisting during chronic administration.
- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Discontinue haloperidol immediately if neuroleptic malignant syndrome develops.
- **Neurotoxicity**: use caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis.
- **Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes**: use caution in patients receiving higher than recommended doses of haloperidol, intravenous haloperidol, as well as in patients with other QT-prolonging conditions, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, underlying cardiac abnormalities, familial long QT syndrome, hypothyroidism, or concomitant therapy with other QT-prolonging agents.
- **Seizure**: use caution in patients with a history of seizures, EEG abnormalities, or receiving anticonvulsant medications.
- **Somnolence, motor impairment**: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- **Tardive dyskinesia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia, especially in elderly women.

Usage in Pregnancy

Rats or rabbits administered oral haloperidol at doses of 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg, which are approximately 0.2 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day based on mg/m2body surface area. showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality. No fetal abnormalities were observed at these doses in rats or rabbits.

Cleft palate has been observed in mice administered oral haloperidol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, which is approximately 0.1 times the MRHD based on mg/m2body surface area.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of HALDOL along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not established with these cases. Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to HALDOL, haloperidol decanoate should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.

Non-Teratogenic Effects

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including haloperidol) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

HALDOL decanoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

Since haloperidol is excreted in human breast milk, infants should not be nursed during drug treatment with haloperidol decanoate.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of haloperidol decanoate in children have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women (see WARNINGS, Tardive Dyskinesia). Also, the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in geriatric patients generally warrants the use of lower doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 mg to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory. The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.

Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Switchover Procedure

An oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable. In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested. For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the patient's clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose.

### A quantitative systems pharmacology study on optimal scenarios for switching to paliperidone palmitate once-monthly [^1118XCa8]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic formulations are increasingly used for improving patient compliance and long-term outcomes. Transitioning to LAIs raises questions regarding how optimum efficacy can be rapidly achieved while minimizing potential efficacy and safety concerns related to overlapping plasma levels of prior treatments and the new LAI. Ideally, randomized clinical trials would provide guidance regarding transition algorithms, but the number of studies and sample size required to address relevant questions makes this approach unachievable. We have used quantitative systems pharmacology, a clinically calibrated, mechanism-based computer model for schizophrenia to identify optimal switching scenarios to injectable paliperidone palmitate once-monthly (PP1M) from oral antipsychotics. We show that starting PP1M 1day after the last oral medication dose or 4weeks after the last LAI injection provides optimal benefit-risk compared to a delayed PP1M start after 1week with either a 1- or 2-week overlap with oral paliperidone. Although a similar or better therapeutic effect can be achieved within 2weeks for oral medications and LAI haloperidol decanoate and 8weeks for LAI aripiprazole, we identified a potential transient undertreatment liability in all cases except for risperidone. Switching from oral olanzapine may lead to a small reduction of antipsychotic efficacy in some patients. Switching to PP1M decreases extrapyramidal symptom liability in most cases, but increased dopamine D 2 receptor inhibition (except for haloperidol) might potentially increase prolactin synthesis. Overall, these results suggest time-windows for which the treating clinician must be most vigilant for potential efficacy and safety signals when switching to PP1M.

### Effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial [^11467dfe]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are used to reduce medication nonadherence and relapse in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The relative effectiveness of long-acting injectable versions of second-generation and older antipsychotics has not been assessed.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate with the older long-acting injectable antipsychotic haloperidol decanoate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multisite, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2011 to July 2013 at 22 US clinical research sites. Randomized patients (n = 311) were adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically assessed to be at risk of relapse and likely to benefit from a long-acting injectable antipsychotic.

Interventions

Intramuscular injections of haloperidol decanoate 25 to 200 mg or paliperidone palmitate 39 to 234 mg every month for as long as 24 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Efficacy failure, defined as a psychiatric hospitalization, a need for crisis stabilization, a substantial increase in frequency of outpatient visits, a clinician's decision that oral antipsychotic could not be discontinued within 8 weeks after starting the long-acting injectable antipsychotics, or a clinician's decision to discontinue the assigned long-acting injectable due to inadequate therapeutic benefit. Key secondary outcomes were common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of efficacy failure for paliperidone palmitate compared with haloperidol decanoate (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65–1.47). The number of participants who experienced efficacy failure was 49 (33.8%) in the paliperidone palmitate group and 47 (32.4%) in the haloperidol decanoate group. On average, participants in the paliperidone palmitate group gained weight and those in the haloperidol decanoate group lost weight; after 6 months, the least-squares mean weight change for those taking paliperidone palmitate was increased by 2.17 kg (95% CI, 1.25–3.09) and was decreased for those taking haloperidol decanoate (-0.96 kg; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.04). Patients taking paliperidone palmitate had significantly higher maximum mean levels of serum prolactin (men, 34.56 µg/L [95% CI, 29.75–39.37] vs 15.41 µg/L [95% CI, 10.73–20.08]; P < .001, and for women, 75.19 [95% CI, 63.03–87.36] vs 26.84 [95% CI, 13.29–40.40]; P < .001). Patients taking haloperidol decanoate had significantly larger increases in global ratings of akathisia (0.73 [95% CI, 0.59–0.87] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.31–0.59]; P = 0.006).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, use of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate did not result in a statistically significant difference in efficacy failure, but was associated with more weight gain and greater increases in serum prolactin, whereas haloperidol decanoate was associated with more akathisia. However, the CIs do not rule out the possibility of a clinically meaningful advantage with paliperidone palmitate.

### An acute oral intoxication with haloperidol decanoate [^117FXH6q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Haloperidol decanoate is a typical antipsychotic drug used as maintenance therapy for schizophrenia and mood disorders formulated as an ester for intramuscular injection. Cases of oral haloperidol decanoate intoxications have not been described in literature. In this report, we present for the first time a case of an oral ingestion of haloperidol decanoate of a young woman who presented to the emergency department following an intentional oral ingestion of 1 ampoule of haloperidol decanoate 100mg. At presentation, she had a bilateral rest tremor of both hands and mild hypothermia. No other obvious signs of an intoxication were observed. She was treated with a single dose of activated charcoal and laxative and was admitted to the intensive care for rhythm monitoring and observation. During the night the QTc interval increased to 453ms, but stayed within the normal range. Haloperidol plasma levels increased as well, but also stayed within therapeutic ranges. These findings indicate that treatment with oral activated charcoal was sufficient to prevent any serious events.

### Effectiveness of switching from long-acting injectable fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^114jMyNE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This multisite randomized trial addressed risks and benefits of staying on long-acting injectable haloperidol or fluphenazine versus switching to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres.

Method

From December 2004 through March 2008, adult outpatients with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking haloperidol decanoate (n = 40) or fluphenazine decanoate (n = 22) were randomly assigned to stay on current long-acting injectable medication or switch to risperidone microspheres and followed for 6 months under study protocol and an additional 6 months naturalistic follow-up. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to examine the primary outcome (time to treatment discontinuation), and random regression models were used to examine secondary outcomes.

Results

Groups did not differ significantly in time to treatment discontinuation through 6 months of protocol-driven treatment. When the 6-month naturalistic follow-up period was included, time to treatment discontinuation was significantly shorter for individuals assigned to switch than for individuals assigned to stay (10% of stayers discontinued versus 31% of switchers; P = 0.01). Groups did not differ with respect to psychopathology, hospitalizations, sexual side effects, new-onset tardive dyskinesia, or new-onset extrapyramidal symptoms. However, those randomized to switch to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres had greater increases in body mass (increase of 1.0 body mass index [BMI] versus decrease of -0.3 BMI; P = 0.00) and prolactin (maximum increase to 23.4 ng/mL versus decrease to 15.2 ng/mL, P = 0.01) compared to those randomized to stay.

Conclusion

Switching from haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate to risperidone microspheres resulted in more frequent treatment discontinuation as well as significant weight gain and increases in prolactin.

### Switching antipsychotic therapy: what to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes [^115sw5hH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the "withdrawal triad", comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.

### Haloperidol decanoate [^1159MBz9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rifampin: In a study of 12 patients with schizophrenia coadministered oral haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol levels were decreased by a mean of 70% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In 5 other patients with schizophrenia treated with oral haloperidol and rifampin, discontinuation of rifampin produced a mean 3.3-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations.

Carbamazepine: In a study in 11 patients with schizophrenia coadministered haloperidol and increasing doses of carbamazepine, haloperidol plasma concentrations decreased linearly with increasing carbamazepine concentrations.

During combination treatment with inducers of CYP3A4, it is recommended that patients be monitored and the haloperidol decanoate dose increased or the dosage interval adjusted, as deemed necessary. After withdrawal of the CYP3A4 inducer, the concentration of haloperidol may gradually increase and therefore it may be necessary to reduce the dose of haloperidol decanoate, or adjust the dosage interval.

Effect of Haloperidol on Other Drugs

Haloperidol is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine or imipramine) may increase when they are co-administered with haloperidol.

### A review of agitation in mental illness: treatment guidelines and current therapies [^113mVdJG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation is an important therapeutic target in the acute and/or emergent setting, as well as for longer-term care of patients with psychiatric illness.

Method

Select reviews and guidelines published (from 2000 to 2006) on the treatment of agitation in various psychiatric disorders were evaluated.

Results

After maximizing the safety of all individuals in the presence of an acutely agitated patient, initial therapy generally involves verbal deescalation. Pharmacologic management of acute agitation relies on typical antipsychotics, particularly haloperidol; benzodiazepines; and atypical antipsychotics. The selection of a specific agent (or combination of agents) should be guided by etiologic considerations, efficacy of the drug(s), side effects, potential drug interactions, and drug formulation. Seclusion or restraints are treatments of last resort due to safety issues.

Conclusion

Compared with conventional antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), preliminary evidence indicates that atypical antipsychotics effectively reduce agitation, are better tolerated, and have fewer side effects. After an acute episode, atypical agents also help ease the transition from intramuscular to oral medication to promote ongoing treatment.

Changing LAIs - Risks and Benefits

Clinicians receiving patients on fluphenazine LAI should be conscious of the data as outlined above, as well as the risks and benefits of switching antipsychotics. Patient education about the available options and shared decision-making will be key to determining whether a change of antipsychotic formulation aligns with the patient's values. Note that even if second-generation antipsychotic medications are not an option due to resource constraints, there is not a clear cost superiority of fluphenazine LAI over haloperidol LAI. In addition, haloperidol LAI can be given at longer intervals, reducing system costs and staff burden. The risk of destabilization when switching medications in a stable patient should be considered as well as discussed with the patient; some patients may prefer to stay with the medication they are familiar with. One study specifically noted that patients whose psychosis had been stabilized with fluphenazine LAI were less likely to be switched to a second-generation antipsychotic than other similar patients. A last consideration is the lack of robust, tested protocols for switching between long-acting injectable formulations; the switching strategy should be guided by balancing the severity of the patient's psychotic episodes with the general side effect burden.

As noted above, not all long-acting injectables have the same dosing interval – although clinically, the intervals are often adjusted to target refractory symptoms. The half life of fluphenazine decanoate is roughly 1 week, and it is most frequently given as an injection every 2 weeks. There are reports that fluphenazine reaches peak serum levels rapidly, although the exact rate varies considerably in the literature. One experimental paper from 1979 noted peak serum levels were reached between 1 and 8 h after injection, with significant variation between patients. Another experimental paper from 1985 noted peak serum levels occurring generally in less than 24 h, again with a very significant variation between patients. This phenomenon has been noted essentially since the approval of the LAI. The specific applications of this phenomenon vary between clinicians, with some reporting no need for oral overlap - especially in cases of likely patient non-adherence - while others recommend an oral overlap during the first two weeks after initiation. There have been no well-controlled studies of either technique, although a retrospective data analysis noted heterogeneity in clinician application of oral overlap. The biweekly dose of fluphenazine decanoate given is 1.25 times the daily oral dose. A q4week depot version of fluphenazine exists, but the risks of this enanthate formulation included high risk of depression, EPS, and possibly hypotension and other serious cardiac side effects. To briefly compare to other LAI options discussed above, only the risperidone formulation traditionally requires a q2week injection frequency; haloperidol is also dissolved in oil and therefore these first-generation LAIs are more painful to inject.

### A post hoc analysis of transitioning to oral treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol after 24-hour intramuscular treatment in acutely agitated adult patients with schizophrenia [^116nDkr7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia might require treatment with IM antipsychotics, followed by a transition to oral medication.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between 24-hour IM and transitional oral dosages of 2 antipsychotic medications, olanzapine and haloperidol.

Methods

This post hoc analysis used data from a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy of olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo in acutely agitated inpatients aged ≥ 18 years with schizophrenia conducted at hospitals in 13 countries. Patients received 1 to 3 IM injections of olanzapine 10 mg or haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours (IM phase), followed by 4 days of oral treatment with 5 to 20 mg/d of either antipsychotic (oral phase). Study patients were grouped according to which drug they received, and subgrouped based on whether they received a single or multiple IM injections. Rates of transition to lower (5–10 mg/d) versus higher (15–20 mg/d) dosages were compared within and between treatments.

Results

Data from 236 patients were analyzed (olanzapine, 121 patients [76 men, 45 women; mean (SD) age, 38.4 (12.2) years; mean (SD) weight, 74.9 (18.5) kg]; haloperidol, 115 patients [80 men, 35 women; mean (SD) age, 38.0 (10.2) years; mean (SD) weight, 75.4 (18.7) kg]). At the end of the IM phase, the rate of haloperidol patients who were transitioned to lower oral doses was significantly higher in the single-injection subgroup compared with the multiple-injection subgroup (P = 0.03); this difference was not found in the group receiving olanzapine. At day 4 of oral treatment, the rates of patients in the olanzapine and haloperidol groups who were transitioned to higher oral doses were significantly higher in the single-injection subgroups compared with the multiple-injection subgroups (P = 0.002 and = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

In this study, the proportion of agitated patients with schizophrenia who transitioned to higher dosages (15–20 mg) of olanzapine or haloperidol by day 4 of the oral switch was significantly greater in patients who were previously treated with a single IM injection of olanzapine (10 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 mg).right.

In general, there are few problems with switching from one antipsychotic to another, but they do occur. In deciding to switch, Ganguli et al.'s study suggests that maintaining the full dose of the initial antipsychotic until the second drug has been titrated to its full dose is the preferred strategy.

Taking the example of haloperidol (figure 2 and table 3a), it is notable that linear dose reductions from therapeutic doses of 4 mg produce increasingly large reductions in percentage points of D 2 dopamine antagonism: 3.5 percentage points (4 to 3 mg), 6.1 percentage points (3 to 2 mg), 13.7 percentage points (2 to 1 mg), and 55.7 percentage points (1 to 0 mg; figure 2b and table 3a). It is, therefore, likely that discontinuation studies employing linear dose reductions, as recommended in some older guidelines, will be more likely to induce withdrawal reactions (including, potentially, withdrawal psychosis) because reductions in D 2 antagonism become increasingly large, causing greater likelihood of dopaminergic rebound.

Indeed, even reductions from 0.5 mg of haloperidol (the smallest available tablet) to 0 mg will produce a reduction in D 2 antagonism of 40.0 percentage points, and reduction from 0.25 mg (half the smallest tablet) to 0 mg will produce a 25.5 percentage point reduction (larger than the change from 20 to 2 mg [19.6 percentage points]); this may account for the relative ease of reductions at higher doses of antipsychotic and the difficulties in tapering at lower doses. In one recent study, there was no significant increase in relapse rate when patients reduced their dose by 40%compared with the significant chance of early relapse when patients discontinue their entire dose. When interpreting PET data, it should be noted that there is a degree of individual variability in D 2 receptor binding and response across studies.

In this context, it is notable that a handful of studies have suggested that low doses of medication are effective in maintaining patients with psychotic disorders. For example, very low doses of depot antipsychotic (2.5–10 mg of fluphenazine decanoate every 2 weeks) were as effective in preventing a relapse as the standard recommended doses, 5–10 times that amount; in another study, 1 mg of haloperidol or less was effective in symptom reduction in FEP in the majority of patients.

### A multidose study of haloperidol decanoate in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia [^116teUkn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Maintenance medication is critical in the prevention of psychotic relapse and rehospitalization among patients with schizophrenia. Given potential adverse effects, identification of the minimum effective dose is clinically important.

Method

A multicenter, double-blind study was conducted to determine rates of symptomatic exacerbation and adverse effects in 105 outpatients with schizophrenia randomly assigned to four different fixed doses of haloperidol decanoate and treated for 1 year or until relapse. The doses used were 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg given intramuscularly once per month.

Results

Rates of symptomatic exacerbation were 15% in the 200-mg group, 23% with 100 mg, 25% with 50 mg, and 60% with 25 mg. No significant differences in outcome were found between the groups treated with 200, 100, and 50 mg. Among the patients who completed the trial with no symptomatic exacerbation, there were no differences between dose groups on measures of psychopathology at the final rating point.

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that the 200-mg/month dose of haloperidol decanoate is associated with the lowest rate of symptomatic exacerbation (15%) with minimal increased risk of adverse effects or subjective discomfort in comparison to 100 or 50 mg. At the same time, the rates of worsening with 100 mg (23%) and 50 mg (25%) were not significantly greater than that seen with 200 mg. These results provide some guidance as to effective dose ranges of haloperidol decanoate.

### Commentary on strategies for switching antipsychotics [^115umMvX]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Both the new generation of antipsychotics and the more traditional antipsychotic drugs produce an important and meaningful improvement in patients with schizophrenia, but most patients are neither cured nor free of symptoms. As a consequence, it is common to switch from one drug to another in the hope of obtaining a better response. All antipsychotic drugs produce some side effects, so switching can also be a tolerance issue. There are reports in the literature on the tactics of switching: abrupt discontinuation, cross tapering, starting a patient on a new drug while continuing with the old drug until the new drug has reached a steady state, or some variation on these tactics. In this issue, Ganguli et al. have carried out a randomized switching study, the data from which indicates the tactics that might be optimal. We put this paper into context, provide a critique and describe indications for switching.

### A comparison of the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus haloperidol during transition from intramuscular to oral therapy [^115Q7jPc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia who receive intramuscular (IM) medications typically are switched to oral (PO) antipsychotic maintenance therapy.

Objective

The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus those of haloperidol during transition from IM to PO therapy. We used additional data from a previously reported trial to test the hypothesis that the reduction in agitation achieved by IM olanzapine 10 mg or IM haloperidol 7.5 mg would be maintained following transition to 4 days of PO olanzapine or PO haloperidol (5–20 mg/d for both). We also hypothesized that olanzapine would maintain its more favorable extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) safety profile.

Methods

This was a multinational (hospitals in 13 countries), double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Acutely agitated inpatients with schizophrenia were treated with 1 to 3 IM injections to olanzapine 10 mg or haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours and were entered into a 4-day PO treatment period with the same medication (5–20 mg/d for both). The primary efficacy measurement was reduction in agitation, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) score. Adverse events and scores on EPS rating scales were assessed.

Results

A total of 311 patients (204 men, 107 women; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [11.6] years) were enrolled (131, 126, and 54 patients in the olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively). In all, 93.1% (122/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 92.1% (116/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the IM period and entered the PO period; 85.5% (112/131) of olanzapine-treated patients and 84.1% (106/126) of haloperidol-treated patients completed the PO period. IM olanzapine and IM haloperidol effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours (mean [SD] PANSS-EC change, -7.1 [4.81 vs -6.7 [4.3], respectively). Reductions in agitation were sustained throughout the PO period with both study drugs (mean [SD] change from PO period baseline, -0.6 [4.8] vs -1.3 [4.4], respectively). During PO treatment, haloperidol-treated patients spontaneously reported significantly more acute dystonia than olanzapine-treated patients (4.3%[5/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.026) and akathisia (5.2% [6/116] vs 0% [0/122], respectively; P = 0.013). Significantly more haloperidol-treated patients than olanzapine-treated patients met categorical criteria for treatment-emergent akathisia (18.5% [17/92] vs 6.5% [7/107], respectively; P = 0.015).

Conclusions

In the acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia in this study, both IM olanzapine 10 mg and IM haloperidol 7.5 mg effectively reduced agitation over 24 hours. This alleviation of agitation was sustained following transition from IM therapy to 4 days of PO treatment (5–20 mg/d for both). During the 4 days of PO treatment, olanzapine-treated patients did not spontaneously report any incidences of acute dystonia, and olanzapine had a superior EPS safety profile to that of haloperidol. The combination of IM and PO olanzapine may help improve the treatment of acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation? [^111VeNGG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

LAI Trends Over Time

Although there is no publicly accessible way to globally track prescribing trends for various formulations of antipsychotic injectables, multiple articles have noted an overall trend away from first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) LAI prescriptions. The putative cause for this transition is the improved side effect profiles of newer agents, which are presumed to lead to better adherence to treatment plans. One 2017 study by Haddad & Olajide specifically analyzed extant data for the interval between 2002 and 2008. During this period, there was an overall decrease in prescription of fluphenazine LAI, within the context of a general trend away from FGA LAIs due to the increasing availability and usage of risperidone LAI formulations. A 2023 article by Yasui-Furukori et al. reviewed data on a single patient cohort between 2001 and 2021. In this analysis, there was a clear trend demonstrating reduction in FGA LAIs with a commensurate increase in usage of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) LAIs. However, the authors noted that patients who had been initially stabilized on a first-generation antipsychotic were less likely to be transitioned to a second-generation antipsychotic.

Side Effects

As noted above, concern about side effects and resulting non-adherence was considered a driver of the transition from FGAs to SGAs in LAI prescribing trends. The data specifically comparing fluphenazine to other antipsychotics in terms of side effects, especially the LAI formulation, is surprisingly thin given the long history of fluphenazine's use for treatment of schizophrenia. However, articles that discuss sedation, mood, anticholinergic effects, corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation and other cardiac effects, EPS, weight gain, and overall tolerability of fluphenazine were identified. Unfortunately, data obtained from trials of PO medication is difficult to generalize to LAI formulations of the same medication; for example, a large 2021 analysis of antipsychotics by Eugene et al. showed that haloperidol LAI was significantly less sedating than an equivalent dose of oral haloperidol. The same analysis rated oral fluphenazine as among the most sedating antipsychotics, but excluded fluphenazine LAI due to lack of comparative data.

### Paliperidone palmitate in non-acute patients with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with risperidone long-acting therapy or frequently used conventional depot antipsychotics [^116WmDD7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients

Eligible participants were males and females aged ⩾18 years with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, being non-acute but symptomatic. Patients had to be on an adequate therapeutic dose of another LAT and clinically stable (change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity [CGI-S] ≤ 1) in the 4 weeks before enrolment, and had previously been treated with either RLAT or one of the following conventional depot APs: Hal-Dec, flupentixol decanoate [Fpt-Dec], Flu-Dec, or zuclopenthixol decanoate [Zuc-Dec]. A patient's previous treatment was considered unsuccessful due to one or more of the following criteria: lack of efficacy (baseline [BL] Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total score ⩾70 or ⩾2 items scoring ⩾4 in the PANSS positive or negative subscale or ⩾3 items scoring ⩾4 in the PANSS general psychopathology subscale), lack of tolerability or safety (the presence of clinically relevant side effects), lack of compliance, or the patient's wish. An additional key inclusion criterion was that at the discretion of the investigator the patient may benefit from a switch of AP medication to PP.

A psychiatric diagnosis due to direct pharmacological effects of a substance or a general medical condition led to exclusion from the study, as did a history or current symptoms of tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome; pregnancy or breast feeding; and known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to risperidone or paliperidone or its excipients. Patients who were AP treatment-naive; receiving clozapine during the last 3 months prior to the start of the study; or considered to be at imminent risk of suicide even after clinical intervention were also excluded from the study. Patients with a current substance use or abuse, with the exception of intravenous drug use, were eligible for enrolment and no exclusions were applied based on body mass index (BMI).

### Long-term maintenance therapy with quetiapine versus haloperidol decanoate in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^112pEmyi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the long-term efficacy and tolerability of oral quetiapine with those of intramuscular haloperidol.

Method

Patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder requiring long-term antipsychotic treatment were randomly assigned to open-label oral quetiapine or intramuscular haloperidol decanoate for 48 weeks. Clinicians were instructed to target dosing at 500 mg/day of quetiapine or 200 mg of haloperidol decanoate every 4 weeks. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was used to assess efficacy; the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale were used to assess safety and tolerability. For statistical analyses, a general linear mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of covariance was used, with change scores for dependent variables computed with the baseline score as covariate. Data were collected from 1998 to 2001.

Results

Thirty-five patients were enrolled, but 6 did not participate after being informed of their treatment assignment; 4 of the 6 withdrawals were assigned to haloperidol decanoate. Mean doses at week 48 were 493 mg/day of quetiapine (N = 16) and 170 mg/28 days of haloperidol decanoate (N = 9). Survival analysis showed no between-group differences in estimates of the number of patients remaining exacerbation-free over time. Both drugs were efficacious, but quetiapine was significantly better than haloperidol decanoate in controlling negative symptoms (p < .05). The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was low in both groups; patients receiving quetiapine showed significantly greater improvement in rigidity and akathisia (p < .05).

Conclusion

Oral quetiapine was as efficacious as intramuscular haloperidol in preventing symptom exacerbation over 48 weeks in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms, especially rigidity and akathisia. Quetiapine was more efficacious than haloperidol decanoate in treating negative symptoms.

### Haloperidol (oral) versus olanzapine (oral) for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [^112z5RQL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is often a severe and disabling psychiatric disorder. Antipsychotics remain the mainstay of psychotropic treatment for people with psychosis. In limited resource and humanitarian contexts, it is key to have several options for beneficial, low-cost antipsychotics, which require minimal monitoring. We wanted to compare oral haloperidol, as one of the most available antipsychotics in these settings, with a second-generation antipsychotic, olanzapine.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of haloperidol compared to olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia study-based register of trials, which is based on monthly searches of CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, ISRCTN, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed and WHO ICTRP. We screened the references of all included studies. We contacted relevant authors of trials for additional information where clarification was required or where data were incomplete. The register was last searched on 14 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing haloperidol with olanzapine for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in global state, relapse, clinically important change in mental state, extrapyramidal side effects, weight increase, clinically important change in quality of life and leaving the study early due to adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently evaluated and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome (NNTB or NNTH) with 95% CI. For continuous data, we estimated mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. For all included studies, we assessed risk of bias (RoB 1) and we used the GRADE approach to create a summary of findings table.

Main Results

We included 68 studies randomising 9132 participants. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in clinically important change in global state (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 6 studies, 3078 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in relapse (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.02; 7 studies, 1499 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Haloperidol may reduce the incidence of clinically important change in overall mental state compared to olanzapine (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.81; 13 studies, 1210 participants; low-certainty evidence). For every eight people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience this improvement. The evidence suggests that haloperidol may result in a large increase in extrapyramidal side effects compared to olanzapine (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.28 to 5.02; 14 studies, 3290 participants; low-certainty evidence). For every three people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one additional person would experience extrapyramidal side effects. For weight gain, the evidence suggests that there may be a large reduction in the risk with haloperidol compared to olanzapine (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; 18 studies, 4302 participants; low-certainty evidence). For every 10 people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience weight increase. A single study suggests that haloperidol may reduce the incidence of clinically important change in quality of life compared to olanzapine (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 828 participants; low-certainty evidence). For every nine people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience clinically important improvement in quality of life. Haloperidol may result in an increase in the incidence of leaving the study early due to adverse effects compared to olanzapine (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.47; 21 studies, 5047 participants; low-certainty evidence). For every 22 people treated with haloperidol instead of olanzapine, one fewer person would experience this outcome. Thirty otherwise relevant studies and several endpoints from 14 included studies could not be evaluated due to inconsistencies and poor transparency of several parameters. Furthermore, even within studies that were included, it was often not possible to use data for the same reasons. Risk of bias differed substantially for different outcomes and the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low. The most common risks of bias leading to downgrading of the evidence were blinding (performance bias) and selective reporting (reporting bias).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low for the main outcomes in this review, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference between haloperidol and olanzapine in terms of clinically important global state and relapse. Olanzapine may result in a slightly greater overall clinically important change in mental state and in a clinically important change in quality of life. Different side effect profiles were noted: haloperidol may result in a large increase in extrapyramidal side effects and olanzapine in a large increase in weight gain. The drug of choice needs to take into account side effect profiles and the preferences of the individual. These findings and the recent inclusion of olanzapine alongside haloperidol in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines should increase the likelihood of it becoming more easily available in low- and middle- income countries, thereby improving choice and providing a greater ability to respond to side effects for people with lived experience of schizophrenia. There is a need for additional research using appropriate and equivalent dosages of these drugs. Some of this research needs to be done in low- and middle-income settings and should actively seek to account for factors relevant to these. Research on antipsychotics needs to be person-centred and prioritise factors that are of interest to people with lived experience of schizophrenia.

Fig. 3.
Provisional recommendations on the management of clozapine discontinuation symptoms. Patients may experience one or more clozapine-withdrawal discontinuation symptoms.

Finally, the third step considers reinitiating antipsychotic treatment. Where feasible, treatment should be clozapine, however in situations where this is not possible, an antipsychotic previously known to be effective and well-tolerated by the patient is recommended. To ensure that a therapeutic level is achieved, measuring antipsychotic plasma levels is advisable (for clozapine as well as non-clozapine antipsychotic medication). If switching to an alternative antipsychotic, a gradual cross-taper should be considered, taking into account potential drug interactions.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^112Y3hQW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Long-acting antipsychotic medication injections are thought to help improve medication adherence in schizophrenia. Theoretical advantages of long-acting antipsychotic injections over oral medications include guaranteed delivery of medication, reliable monitoring of treatment adherence, and an increased opportunity for the treatment team to intervene as soon as a patient misses a dose. Clinical research, and expert opinionsupport use of long-acting injection antipsychotic medications as maintenance treatment for patients with a history of medication nonadherence.

Approximately 15% of schizophrenia patients in maintenance antipsychotic treatment receive depot preparations. In one recent study, 29.9% of patients with schizophrenia and a recent history of antipsychotic nonadherence were currently being prescribed a long-acting injection antipsychotic medication. In the United States, psychiatrists tend to select long-acting injection medications for patients who have persistent psychotic symptoms, and who frequently receive more than one concurrent antipsychotic medication. Use of depot antipsychotic medications may be increased among African Americans, and patients with substance use problems.

Three antipsychotic medications are currently available in the United States as long-acting injections: fluphenazine decanoate (FD) or enanthate, haloperidol decanoate (HD), and long-acting injectable risperidone (LAR). These medications differ from one another in their pharmacokinetic–and side-effectprofiles. Little is known about the characteristics and service use patterns of patients who are treated with these medications in community practice.

In the current report, we use a large administrative database to compare and contrast the characteristics of schizophrenia patients starting FD, HD, and LAR and assess the continuity of their antipsychotic treatment. We also describe the use of oral antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications, treatment for selected comorbid conditions, and service use before, during, and after treatment with long-acting antipsychotic medications.

### Paliperidone palmitate in non-acute patients with schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with risperidone long-acting therapy or frequently used conventional depot antipsychotics [^116bguDC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

In this patient population, PP was generally safe and well tolerated, with no new safety signals compared with previous RCTs. Switching from a conventional depot AP to PP in this trial was associated with a clinically meaningful improvement of EPMS. This is of relevance because patients are often reluctant to take LATs due to the risk of EPMS. In addition, reducing EPMS also decreases the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia. In contrast to patients switched from Hal-Dec and Fpt-Dec, who showed significant improvement across all four domains of treatment satisfaction, patients switched from Flu-Dec and Zuc-Dec showed significant improvement in side effects and convenience, whereas those patients switching from RLAT the observed improvement was statistically significant only in side effect score. When switching from RLAT to PP, the results may in part reflect the distinct pharmacokinetic profiles of PP and RLAT, whereby there is a transient decrease in plasma levels approximately 8–10 weeks following the last RLAT injection in those patients switched to PP. In individual patients, this transient decrease may be associated with a transient worsening of symptoms. In such a case of clinical deterioration, temporary treatment, for example with an oral antipsychotic, may be clinically indicated.

Methods

This study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023391352). The study was conducted in accordance with 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISMA) (Supplementary Table S1) and 'Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology' (MOOSE) checklist (Supplementary Table S2), following 'EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines'.

Search strategy and selection criteria

A systematic literature search was carried out by two independent researchers (C. A. and B.P.). Web of Science database (Clarivate Analytics) was searched, incorporating the Web of Science Core Collection, the BIOSIS Citation Index, the KCI-Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE®, the Russian Science Citation Index, and the SciELO Citation Index as well as Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases, from inception until January 12th, 2023.

The following keywords were used: '(Antipsychotic OR neuroleptic OR aripiprazole OR bromperidol OR clopenthixol OR flupenthixol OR fluphenazine OR fluspirilene OR haloperidol OR iloperidone OR olanzapine OR paliperidone OR penfluridol OR perphenazine OR pipothiazine OR risperidone OR zuclopenthixol) AND (enanthate OR decanoate OR long-acting injection OR lai OR microsphere OR once monthly OR palmitate OR pamoate)'.

2.9 Switching from Antipsychotics

There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to quetiapine extended-release tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine extended-release tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal syndrome medication should be re-evaluated periodically.

### Switching antipsychotic medications to reduce adverse event burden in schizophrenia: establishing evidence-based practice [^114JxFk1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this project was to provide evidence-based guidance concerning when and how it is appropriate to undertake elective changes in antipsychotic medications in order to reduce adverse effects, with a focus on those adverse effects associated with increased long-term health risks. This project extends the results of the National Institute of Mental Health-funded 2009 Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) psychopharmacologic treatment recommendations. The authors reviewed the literature on switching antipsychotics, focusing on randomized controlled trials published since the 2009 Schizophrenia PORT. The studies reviewed support a recommendation that an elective switch from higher to lower metabolic risk antipsychotics can produce weight and lipid benefits without significant risk of clinical deterioration. Evidence also suggests that certain antipsychotic switches may improve other adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and prolactin elevation. In deciding to make an elective change of antipsychotic medication, it is important to conduct a careful risk/benefit assessment with the patient. Before initiating a switch, patients should be educated about what to expect during the process. Studies also support gradual discontinuation of the current medication in order to minimize problems early in the switching process.

### Bromperidol decanoate (depot) for schizophrenia [^111hmUNP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia. Long-acting depot injections of drugs such as bromperidol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of depot bromperidol versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.

Search Strategy

For this 2011 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (February 2011).

Selection Criteria

We sought all randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot bromperidol, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations. Primary outcomes were clinically significant change in global function, service utilisation outcomes (hospital admission, days in hospital), relapse.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this 2011 update MP independently extracted data, CEA carried out the reliability check. We calculated fixed-effect risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and calculated weighted or standardised means for continuous data. Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). Analysis was by intention-to-treat.

Main Results

We have included no new trials in this 2011 update (4 RCTs, total n = 117). A single, small study of six months' duration compared bromperidol decanoate with placebo injection. Similar numbers left the study before completion (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.6) and there were no clear differences between bromperidol decanoate and placebo for a list of adverse effects (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR akathisia 2.0 CI 0.21 to 18.69, RR increased weight 3.0 CI 0.14 to 65.9, RR tremor 0.33 CI 0.04 to 2.69). When bromperidol decanoate was compared with fluphenazine depot, we found no important change on global outcome (n = 30, RR no clinical important improvement 1.50 CI 0.29 to 7.73). People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had fewer relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate, but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group more frequent than those taking other depot preparation due to any cause (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 2.17 CI 1.00 to 4.73). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17).

Authors' Conclusions

Minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well-conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^114bWxES]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued

There are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment. When restarting patients who have had an interval off treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA, supplementation with oral RISPERDAL (or another antipsychotic medication) should be administered.

2.6 Switching from Other Antipsychotics

There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL CONSTA, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. Previous antipsychotics should be continued for 3 weeks after the first injection of RISPERDAL CONSTA to ensure that therapeutic concentrations are maintained until the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site has begun [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients who have never taken oral RISPERDAL, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral RISPERDAL prior to initiating treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA. As recommended with other antipsychotic medications, the need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically.

### Fluphenazine decanoate (depot) and enanthate for schizophrenia [^1112Fj2m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intramuscular injections (depot preparations) offer an advantage over oral medication for treating schizophrenia by reducing poor compliance. The benefits gained by long-acting preparations, however, may be offset by a higher incidence of adverse effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluphenazine decanoate and enanthate versus oral anti-psychotics and other depot neuroleptic preparations for individuals with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (February 2011 and October 16, 2013), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on people with schizophrenia comparing fluphenazine decanoate or enanthate with placebo or oral anti-psychotics or other depot preparations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reliably selected, assessed the quality, and extracted data of the included studies. For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. We used the mean difference (MD) for normal continuous data. We excluded continuous data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%. Tests of heterogeneity and for publication bias were undertaken. We used a fixed-effect model for all analyses unless there was high heterogeneity. For this update. we assessed risk of bias of included studies and used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

This review now includes 73 randomised studies, with 4870 participants. Overall, the quality of the evidence is low to very low. Compared with placebo, use of fluphenazine decanoate does not result in any significant differences in death, nor does it reduce relapse over six months to one year, but one longer-term study found that relapse was significantly reduced in the fluphenazine arm (n = 54, 1 RCT, RR 0.35, CI 0.19 to 0.64, very low quality evidence). A very similar number of people left the medium-term studies (six months to one year) early in the fluphenazine decanoate (24%) and placebo (19%) groups, however, a two-year study significantly favoured fluphenazine decanoate (n = 54, 1 RCT, RR 0.47, CI 0.23 to 0.96, very low quality evidence). No significant differences were found in mental state measured on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or in extrapyramidal adverse effects, although these outcomes were only reported in one small study each. No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with placebo reported clinically significant changes in global state or hospital admissions. Fluphenazine decanoate does not reduce relapse more than oral neuroleptics in the medium term (n = 419, 6 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.75 to 2.83, very low quality evidence). A small study found no difference in clinically significant changes in global state. No difference in the number of participants leaving the study early was found between fluphenazine decanoate (17%) and oral neuroleptics (18%), and no significant differences were found in mental state measured on the BPRS. Extrapyramidal adverse effects were significantly less for people receiving fluphenazine decanoate compared with oral neuroleptics (n = 259, 3 RCTs, RR 0.47 CI 0.24 to 0.91, very low quality evidence). No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with oral neuroleptics reported death or hospital admissions. No significant difference in relapse rates in the medium term between fluphenazine decanoate and fluphenazine enanthate was found (n = 49, 1 RCT, RR 2.43, CI 0.71 to 8.32, very low quality evidence), immediate- and short-term studies were also equivocal. One small study reported the number of participants leaving the study early (29% versus 12%) and mental state measured on the BPRS and found no significant difference for either outcome. No significant difference was found in extrapyramidal adverse effects between fluphenazine decanoate and fluphenazine enanthate. No study comparing fluphenazine decanoate with fluphenazine enanthate reported death, clinically significant changes in global state or hospital admissions.

Authors' Conclusions

There are more data for fluphenazine decanoate than for the enanthate ester. Both are effective antipsychotic preparations. Fluphenazine decanoate produced fewer movement disorder effects than other oral antipsychotics but data were of low quality, and overall, adverse effect data were equivocal. In the context of trials, there is little advantage of these depots over oral medications in terms of compliance but this is unlikely to be applicable to everyday clinical practice.

### Haloperidol decanoate [^116Lzt87]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Usage in Pregnancy

Rats or rabbits administered oral haloperidol at doses of 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg, which are approximately 0.2 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day based on mg/m2body surface area, showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality. No fetal abnormalities were observed at these doses in rats or rabbits. Cleft palate has been observed in mice administered oral haloperidol at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, which is approximately 0.1 times the MRHD based on mg/m2body surface area.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not established with these cases. Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate should be used during pregnancy or in women likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus.

Non-Teratogenic Effects

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including haloperidol) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

Haloperidol decanoate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

Since haloperidol is excreted in human breast milk, infants should not be nursed during drug treatment with haloperidol decanoate.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of haloperidol decanoate in children have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women (see WARNINGS, Tardive Dyskinesia). Also, the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in geriatric patients generally warrants the use of lower doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the diagnosis and Management of the adult psychiatric patient in the emergency department [^1168nj7A]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Emergency department agitation management — 2006 pharmacologic recommendations — states the following directives: "Use a benzodiazepine (lorazepam or midazolam) or a conventional antipsychotic (droperidol or haloperidol) as effective monotherapy for the initial drug treatment of the acutely agitated undifferentiated patient in the ED"; "(2) If rapid sedation is required, consider droperidol instead of haloperidol"; "(3) Use an antipsychotic (typical or atypical) as effective monotherapy for both management of agitation and initial drug therapy for the patient with known psychiatric illness for which antipsychotics are indicated"; and "(4) Use a combination of an oral benzodiazepine (lorazepam) and an oral antipsychotic (risperidone) for agitated but cooperative patients". The Level C recommendations were as follows: "The combination of a parenteral benzodiazepine and haloperidol may produce more rapid sedation than monotherapy in the acutely agitated psychiatric patient in the ED".

### Depot bromperidol decanoate for schizophrenia [^117KXPoe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia. Long-acting depot injections of drugs such as bromperidol decanoate are extensively used as a means of long-term maintenance treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of depot bromperidol versus placebo, oral antipsychotics and other depot antipsychotic preparations for people with schizophrenia in terms of clinical, social and economic outcomes.

Search Strategy

Relevant trials were identified by searching Biological Abstracts (1982–1999), Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 1999), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 1999), EMBASE (1980–1999), MEDLINE (1966–1999) and PsycLIT (1974–1999). References of all identified trials were inspected and Janssen-Cilag was contacted in order to identify more trials. An update search was undertaken in October 2003. The Schizophrenia Groups trials register is based on regular searches of BIOSIS Inside; CENTRAL; CINAHL; EMBASE; MEDLINE and PsycINFO; the hand searching of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. A full description is given in the Group's module.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials focusing on people with schizophrenia where depot bromperidol, oral antipsychotics or other depot preparations were sought. Primary outcomes were death, clinically significant change in global function, mental state, relapse, hospital admission, adverse effects and acceptability of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and cross-checked. Fixed effects relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. Weighted or standardised means were calculated for continuous data. Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was calculated. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.

Main Results

Four controlled clinical trials were included (total n = 117). We identified a single small study of six months duration comparing bromperidol decanoate with placebo injection. Similar numbers left the study before completion (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR 0.4 CI 0.1 to 1.6) and there was no clear differences between bromperidol decanoate and placebo for a list of adverse effects (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR akathisia 2.0 CI 0.21 to 18.69, RR increased weight 3.0 CI 0.14 to 65.9, RR tremor 0.33 CI 0.04 to 2.69). When bromperidol decanoate was compared with fluphenazine depot we found no important change on global outcome (n = 30, RR no clinical important improvement 1.50 CI 0.29 to 7.73). People allocated to fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate had less relapses than those given bromperidol decanoate (n = 77, RR 3.92 Cl 1.05 to 14.60, NNH 6 CI 2 to 341). People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group with the same frequency as those allocated other depots (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 1.92 CI 0.8 to 4.6). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n = 47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n = 97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01). The incidence of movement disorders was similar in both depot groups (n = 77, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.47 to 1.17).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently, minimal poorly reported trial data suggests that bromperidol decanoate may be better than placebo injection but less valuable than fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. If bromperidol decanoate is available it may be a viable choice, especially when there are reasons not to use fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate. Well-conducted and reported randomised trials are needed to inform practice in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.

### Intramuscular ziprasidone: moving beyond the conventional in the treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia [^115N3ee5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The appropriate management of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder requires effective, safe antipsychotic agents for use across a continuum of treatment, from control of acute psychotic episodes to prevention of relapse. Intramuscular (IM) formulations are the method of choice for administering antipsychotics to schizophrenic patients who require emergency treatment but cannot take oral medication. Atypical antipsychotics are now widely acknowledged as the first-line choice for the management of patients with schizophrenia. However, use of these agents in acutely agitated psychotic patients has been limited by the lack of an IM formulation. Ziprasidone is the first, and currently only, atypical antipsychotic to be available in a rapid-acting IM formulation. This review focuses on studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of IM ziprasidone. In agitated psychotic patients, IM ziprasidone reduces agitation as early as 15 minutes after administration, with improvement sustained for ≥ 4 hours. In patients with acute psychosis, with or without agitation, IM ziprasidone has been demonstrated to be superior to IM haloperidol in improving overall symptom severity. During the critical IM-to-oral transition, efficacy and tolerability are maintained with ziprasidone. IM ziprasidone represents an important advance over older, conventional IM agents in the treatment of the acutely ill patient with schizophrenia.

### Strategies for dosing and switching antipsychotics for optimal clinical management [^112nrTkC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Optimal clinical management of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be achieved through careful antipsychotic dosing and, if necessary, switching to another well-chosen antipsychotic using suitable switching strategies. For severely ill patients treated in clinical practice, adequate dosing may not result from following the relatively low dosing levels and abrupt titration schedules typically used in clinical registration trials. Data from recent effectiveness trials, naturalistic studies, and the Roadmap Expert Consensus Survey provide evidence of specific dose levels and titration schedules for antipsychotic agents that may be appropriate in clinical practice. Discontinuation and frequent switching of medication are common among patients treated with antipsychotics, but data suggest that an adequate trial of the first antipsychotic medication should be undertaken before switching to another antipsychotic medication. Making a decision to switch from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics should involve consideration of variables relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment. Switching can improve efficacy and tolerability but may also result in predictable side effects or withdrawal symptoms, including weight gain and metabolic effects as well as effects associated with prolactin changes. Many side effects that occur during switching are attributable to receptor profiles and antimuscarinic or antihistaminic blockade. Individualized switching strategies that include careful choice of medication, dose, and titration and tapering schedules; management of symptoms; and patient psychoeducation can reduce or treat side effects, increasing the likelihood of a successful switch and greater adherence and efficacy.

### Haloperidol, clonidine and resolution of delirium in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study [^111Ya684]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was transitioning from delirium on any given day (day X) to an awake state without delirium on the following day (day X + 1). Secondary outcomes were delirium duration (in days), number of delirium and ventilation days, length of stay in the ICU and hospital (in days), and ICU mortality. Delirium duration was the number of consecutive days that a patient was classified as delirious or unarousable during the first delirium episode in the ICU. As delirium may fluctuate over time and as patients may transition between delirium and unarousable states during a delirium episode, we defined a delirium episode as ended if the patient was awake without delirium for at least two consecutive days.

### The crossover approach to switching antipsychotics: what is the evidence? [^114V9E67]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently use a crossover approach in switching antipsychotics, although historically there has been a lack of data addressing the question of switch strategies. To establish if there is now empiric evidence that may guide clinicians in this regard, a MEDLINE search to April 2004 was carried out to identify published, randomized and controlled trials that have addressed this topic. A total of 404 articles were identified in the search, which resulted in the identification of four reports meeting the criteria. The four studies evaluated switching strategies to one of three atypical antipsychotics: aripiprazole, olanzapine (two reports), and ziprasidone. The switching process itself could be subdivided as follows: discontinuation (abrupt vs. gradual); and, replacement (abrupt vs. gradual). Meta-analyses confirmed a lack of difference in outcome, regardless of approach. While a crossover approach does not appear to increase adverse events, the available empiric evidence does not support its clinical superiority on various outcome measures. The existing data therefore argue against the position that a crossover approach in switching antipsychotics represents a 'safer' means of preventing clinical deterioration during the switch.

2.9 Switching
from Antipsychotics

There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to quetiapine extended-release tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine extended-release tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal syndrome medication should be re-evaluated periodically.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^113sr21u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the introduction of chlorpromazine and haloperidol seven decades ago, the number of drugs for psychosis has steadily increased with new drug entities and formulations resulting in dozens of treatment options for schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Competent use of drugs for psychosis requires clinical experience and knowledge of sound dosing practices. Such practice routinely includes dose increases to achieve symptomatic and functional improvement, gradual dose reduction to find tolerable and effective maintenance doses, and switching among agents and formulations as occurs in 15%–20% of patients treated with drugs for psychosis each year. Remarkably, however, consensus remains elusive on how to dose individual drugs for psychosis, including changing from one to an approximately equivalent dose of another, especially with newer agents. Establishing clinically equivalent dose estimates and dosing recommendations contributes to optimizing the use of drugs for psychosis in clinical practice, informing practice guideline development, and designing and interpreting clinical research.

Methods of estimating dosing equivalencies and establishing dosing recommendations have limitations and can yield values that vary substantially. Equivalent doses for many older drugs for psychosis, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, were supported by dose–effect relationships based on laboratory pharmacodynamic data, such as in vitro affinity at cerebral dopamine receptors. This preclinical approach does not account for important inter-species and individual differences in the disposition and pharmacokinetics of drugs for psychosis. Moreover, this approach assumes that laboratory pharmacodynamic dose–response relationships are directly related to clinical dose effects. Manufacturers may tend toward conservative dosing using small doses necessary to distinguish their product from placebo while limiting the risk of adverse effects. Attempts to estimate dosing equivalencies based on flexible dosing trials have been criticized for overestimating effective doses. Estimates based on trials involving multiple fixed-dose arms are informative but rare and often lack head-to-head comparisons with products of different manufacturers, thereby resulting in major gaps in data and equivalency estimates with wide confidence intervals.

### Haloperidol discontinuation for people with schizophrenia [^112ni8x7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia is a disabling serious mental illness that can be chronic. Haloperidol, one of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs, is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia but can have adverse side effects. The effects of stopping haloperidol in people with schizophrenia who are stable on their prescription are not well researched in the context of systematic reviews.

Objectives

To review the effects of haloperidol discontinuation in people with schizophrenia who are stable on haloperidol.

Search Methods

On 20 February 2015, 24 May 2017, and 12 January 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials including trial registers.

Selection Criteria

We included clinical trials randomising adults with schizophrenia or related disorders who were receiving haloperidol, and were stable. We included trials that randomised such participants to either continue their current treatment with haloperidol or discontinue their haloperidol treatment. We included trials that met our selection criteria and reported usable data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently checked all records retrieved from the search and obtained full reports of relevant records for closer inspection. We extracted data from included studies independently. All usable data were dichotomous, and we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a fixed-effect model. We assessed risk of bias within the included studies and used GRADE to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 232 participants comparing haloperidol discontinuation with haloperidol continuation. Discontinuation was achieved in all five studies by replacing haloperidol with placebo. The trials' size ranged between 23 and 87 participants. The methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were poorly reported. Participants allocated to discontinuing haloperidol treatment were more likely to show no improvement in global state compared with those in the haloperidol continuation group (n = 49; 1 RCT; RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.20; very low quality evidence: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited due to relevant methodological shortcomings of included trials). Those who continued haloperidol treatment were less likely to experience a relapse compared to people who discontinued taking haloperidol (n = 165; 4 RCTs; RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.74; very low quality evidence). Satisfaction with treatment (measured as numbers leaving the study early) was similar between groups (n = 43; 1 RCT; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.28; very low quality evidence). No usable mental state, general functioning, general behaviour or adverse effect data were reported by any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides limited evidence derived from small, short-term studies. The longest study was for one year, making it difficult to generalise the results to a life-long disorder. Very low quality evidence shows that discontinuation of haloperidol is associated with an increased risk of relapse and a reduction in the risk of 'global state improvement'. However, participant satisfaction with haloperidol treatment was not different from participant satisfaction with haloperidol discontinuation as measured by leaving the studies early. Due to the very low quality of these results, firm conclusions cannot be made. In addition, the available studies did not report usable data regarding the adverse effects of haloperidol treatment. Considering that haloperidol is one of the most widely used antipsychotic drugs, it was surprising that only a small number of studies into the benefit and harm of haloperidol discontinuation were available. Moreover, the available studies did not report on outcomes that are important to clinicians and to people with schizophrenia, particularly adverse effects and social outcomes. Better designed trials are warranted.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^112ccsa9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study compares 3 cohorts of patients with schizophrenia before, during, and after initiating treatment with fluphenazine decanoate (FD), haloperidol decanoate (HD), or long-acting injectable risperidone (LAR).

Methods

Administrative data are analyzed from California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) beneficiaries with schizophrenia who initiated FD, HD, or LAR treatment. Patients were required to have been continuously enrolled in Medi-Cal for 180 days before and 180 days after the start of the new episode of long-acting antipsychotic therapy.

Results

There were few demographic and clinical differences among patients initiating FD, HD, and LAR. During the 180 days before starting long-acting injections, most patients initiating FD (53.5%), HD (58.5%), and LAR (61.2%) received oral antipsychotic medications for < 80% of the days in this period (medication possession ratio: < 0.80). The mean duration of depot treatment episodes was 58.3 days (SD = 53.6) for FD, 71.7 days (SD = 56.4) for HD, and 60.6 days (SD = 48.8) for LAR (F = 18.3, df = 2, 2694, P < .0001, HD > FD). Few patients who started on FD (5.4%), HD (9.7%), or LAR (2.6%) continued for at least 180 days. Most patients in each group (FD [77.4%], HD [78.9%], and LAR [75.5%]) received oral antipsychotic medications during the 45 days after discontinuing long-acting injections. Coprescription with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines was common.

Conclusions

Patients treated with long-acting antipsychotic injections tend to have complex pharmacological regimens and recent medication nonadherence. A great majority of patients initiating long-acting antipsychotic medications discontinue use within the first few months of treatment.

### Intramuscular ziprasidone compared with intramuscular haloperidol in the treatment of acute psychosis. ziprasidone I.M. study group [^111TtBZa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Background

This 7-day, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international study compared the efficacy and tolerability of intramuscular (i.m.) ziprasidone with haloperidol i.m. and the transition from i.m. to oral treatment in hospitalized patients with acute psychotic agitation (related to DSM-III-R diagnoses).

Method

Patients received up to 3 days of flexible-dose ziprasidone i.m. (N = 90) or haloperidol i.m. (N = 42) followed by oral treatment to day 7. After an initial ziprasidone i.m. dose of 10 mg, subsequent i.m. doses of 5 to 20 mg could be given every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 80 mg) if needed, followed by oral ziprasidone, 80–200 mg/day. Haloperidol i.m. doses of 2.5 to 10 mg were given on entry, followed by 2.5 to 10 mg i.m. every 4 to 6 hours (maximum daily dose = 40 mg) if needed, then by oral haloperidol, 10–80 mg/day.

Results

The mean reductions in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, BPRS agitation items, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale scores were statistically significantly greater (p < .05, p < .01, and p < .01, respectively) after ziprasidone i.m. treatment compared with haloperidol i.m. treatment. Further reductions in these scores also occurred in both groups following transition to oral treatment. Ziprasidone was associated with a lower incidence of movement disorders and a reduced requirement for anticholinergic medication during both i.m. and oral treatment compared with haloperidol. Movement disorder scale scores improved with ziprasidone i.m. and oral treatment, but deteriorated with haloperidol. Other adverse events were rare with both treatments.

Conclusion

Ziprasidone i.m. was significantly more effective in reducing the symptoms of acute psychosis and was better tolerated than haloperidol i.m., particularly in movement disorders. The transition from ziprasidone i.m. to oral ziprasidone was effective and well tolerated.

### Use and discontinuation rates of long-acting injectable antipsychotics between race / ethnicity in older adults using medicaid databases [^116YaVLh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Several factors can impact adherence in chronic disorders. Specifically, a lack of health insurance, cost of treatment, polypharmacy, multiple comorbidities, and functional decline may influence adherence among older adults. In addition, disease severity and progression can potentially play a significant role in treatment adherence. Non‐adherence can result in lower efficacy and can lead to various complications including greater healthcare costs, relapse, and rehospitalization. For example, a study assessing medication adherence in patients (50–75 years of age) with severe mental illness found nonadherence was associated with lack of medication supervision, decreased community functioning, negative attitudes toward medication, and decreased medication management. A systematic review stated an increased risk of relapse, hospitalizations, and suicide as a result of poor medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia. Overall, the studies concluded novel methods are needed to improve medication adherence in mental health.

Long‐acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics were created to potentially address non‐adherence in patients with schizophrenia. Historically, LAI antipsychotics traditionally consisted of two LAI first‐generation antipsychotics (i.e. fluphenazine decanoate, and haloperidol decanoate). After a few decades, LAI second‐generation antipsychotics have become available. These agents range in formulation type (e.g. aripiprazole lauroxil vs. aripiprazole monohydrate), time between injections (e.g. 2 vs. 4 weeks), side effect profile, initiation (e.g. need for oral overlap), and administration site. Studies in adults suggest LAI antipsychotics may support adherence, persistence, and longer time to discontinuation compared to oral antipsychotics. Among older adults with schizophrenia, a retrospective study suggested LAI antipsychotics decreased rehospitalization visits compared to oral antipsychotics within 1 year of discharge.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^113t3jL5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD schizophrenia guideline — management after inadequate response to antipsychotic therapy states that the Work Group suggests using another agent when patients do not respond to an initial course of treatment, rather than augmentation with a second agent and combination pharmacotherapy. We suggest a trial of another antipsychotic medication for individuals with schizophrenia who do not respond to (or tolerate) an adequate trial of an antipsychotic medication. Before determining treatment failure and using another agent, ensuring an adequate treatment trial of a sufficient dose over a long enough duration is important, and ensuring acceptable antipsychotic adherence before switching agents is important, unless the patient is experiencing intolerable side effects, with changing agents requiring close monitoring because relapse or withdrawal symptoms can occur. Variations exist in methods of switching a patient from one antipsychotic to another, with little evidence to suggest one method is superior to another, and studies not included in the evidence base indicate antipsychotic polypharmacy has been associated with increased risk and severity of side effects and treatment non-adherence.
