## Question

What about ED side effects of fenastride, and is it really irreversible side effects of it?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether finasteride causes erectile dysfunction and whether those effects are irreversible. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for finasteride-associated sexual dysfunction. Then, I should verify how often these effects persist after stopping the drug. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and reconcile conflicting data. Finally, I will translate this into practical counseling and management recommendations, including what to do if persistent symptoms occur.

> Let me first confirm the clinical signal. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that finasteride increases the risk of sexual adverse effects, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculatory changes, with the clearest signal in men treated for BPH and a smaller, sometimes nonsignificant signal in men treated for androgenetic alopecia, where absolute rates are lower and placebo rates are higher [^76820073] [^86ae241c].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and time course. In BPH trials, new sexual adverse events occur in roughly 15% on finasteride vs 7% on placebo in year 1, with most of the excess risk concentrated early and attenuating over time; by years 2–4, new sexual AEs are similar between groups, and discontinuation for sexual reasons is uncommon, around 3–4% in large studies [^599dcd6a] [^244b54ff]. In hair-loss trials, sexual AEs are less frequent, with about 3.8% on finasteride vs 2.1% on placebo in pooled 12-month data, and most resolve with continuation or after stopping therapy [^86ae241c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about persistence. I initially thought "about 20% of users develop persistent ED", but wait, I should double-check that figure; the 20% estimate comes from a small, uncontrolled series of men with persistent symptoms, not from the general user population, and it reflects selection and recall bias rather than incidence, so I should correct that misstatement now [^5ff353f9]. The best available population data do not show a significant increase in incident ED with finasteride 1 mg for alopecia, suggesting that persistent ED is not common in routine clinical use, though rare reports do exist and warrant counseling [^6a4fe6ef].

> Next, I should review the evidence for persistent or "irreversible" sexual dysfunction after discontinuation. Case series and surveys describe a constellation of persistent sexual, neuropsychiatric, and physical symptoms labeled post-finasteride syndrome, but these are largely retrospective, uncontrolled, and vulnerable to ascertainment and nocebo effects; importantly, there are no robust prospective studies demonstrating causality or establishing prevalence, and major guidelines remain skeptical pending higher-quality data [^3bf03759] [^5ff353f9] [^930101c7]. I need to ensure I emphasize that while patient-reported persistence is real and distressing, causality and frequency remain uncertain from a scientific standpoint [^930101c7].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Finasteride reduces DHT by about 70% and increases testosterone by about 10–20%, which can acutely affect nitric oxide–mediated erectile physiology and libido; theoretically, neurosteroid changes (e.g., allopregnanolone) and central nervous system effects have been proposed to explain persistence, but these remain hypotheses supported mainly by animal models and small human studies, not definitive clinical evidence [^c1caf199] [^1aedcee5] [^dfaf72ec]. Let me reconsider: while biologically plausible, translation to clinical permanence is not established, so I should frame this as a potential, not proven, mechanism [^930101c7].

> But wait, what if the nocebo effect inflates reports? A randomized BPH study showed that informing patients about sexual side effects increased reporting from 15% to 44%, and pharmacovigilance analyses show a marked rise in postmarketing reports after 2012, consistent with stimulated reporting rather than a true increase in incidence; this helps explain why persistent symptom reports cluster in time with public awareness campaigns and labeling changes [^443c8535] [^494aa094] [^fad33a67]. I should confirm that this does not negate patient experiences, but it does temper estimates of true risk and persistence [^930101c7].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance to anchor counseling. The AUA advises that sexual adverse effects occur in a minority, are more common early, often attenuate with continued use, and typically resolve after discontinuation; they note that persistent sexual dysfunction after stopping 5-ARIs is not demonstrated by reliable research, though rare reports exist, and recommend shared decision-making with explicit counseling about risks and uncertainties [^76820073] [^930101c7]. The FDA labeling acknowledges reports of sexual dysfunction continuing after discontinuation but emphasizes that causality and frequency are uncertain, reinforcing the need to discuss this possibility without overstating risk [^b3da8978] [^f5abfedc].

> Let me translate this into practical counseling. For most men, finasteride-related sexual dysfunction is uncommon, typically mild, and reversible with dose cessation, with resolution timelines ranging from weeks to months in trials; persistent symptoms beyond 3–6 months are rare and should prompt evaluation for alternative etiologies such as mood disorders, endocrine issues, vascular disease, or other medications, while acknowledging that a small subset report chronic symptoms compatible with post-finasteride syndrome, for which evidence-based treatments are limited and management is supportive [^599dcd6a] [^86ae241c] [^24e56f8c]. I should confirm that patients are counseled upfront about sexual side effects, the possibility of persistence, and the plan if symptoms occur, aligning with shared decision-making principles [^c5b86b30].

> Finally, I need to ensure management advice is actionable. If sexual symptoms emerge, options include dose reduction, drug holiday, or discontinuation, with reassurance that most recover; for persistent ED, standard ED therapies such as PDE5 inhibitors may be used, and in selected men with concomitant testosterone deficiency, combining a PDE5 inhibitor with testosterone may improve outcomes, though testosterone alone is not effective for ED; in complex or refractory cases, consider referral to urology or sexual medicine for comprehensive assessment and supportive care [^f36c9bd6] [^0f3772ba] [^d5b2cbca]. I should double-check that patients are also screened for depression, anxiety, and relationship factors, as these commonly coexist and can perpetuate sexual dysfunction even after the drug is stopped.

Finasteride can cause **erectile dysfunction (ED)** in a minority of users, with a typical incidence of 3–8% in clinical trials [^86ae241c] and higher in some observational studies [^notfound]. Most cases are **reversible after stopping the drug**, usually resolving within weeks to months [^599dcd6a]. A small subset reports persistent ED after discontinuation, often termed post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) [^3bf03759]; however, high-quality evidence for permanence is limited, and causality remains debated [^930101c7]. Persistent symptoms may reflect ongoing neurohormonal changes or psychogenic factors, and management is supportive, including PDE5 inhibitors and counseling [^f36c9bd6].

## Incidence of erectile dysfunction with finasteride

Clinical trial data show ED rates of 3–8% with finasteride, typically resolving after discontinuation [^86ae241c] [^599dcd6a]. Observational studies suggest a broader range, with some reporting **higher incidences**, likely reflecting differences in populations, ascertainment, and confounding [^cd0f76bb].

---

## Reversibility of erectile dysfunction after discontinuation

Most ED cases resolve after stopping finasteride, often within weeks to months [^599dcd6a]. Persistence beyond 3 months is uncommon but reported, particularly in younger men using low-dose finasteride for hair loss [^3bf03759].

---

## Evidence for persistent erectile dysfunction (post-finasteride syndrome)

Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) describes persistent sexual dysfunction, including ED, after stopping finasteride [^3bf03759]. The evidence base is limited: most data come from small case series, surveys, and pharmacovigilance reports, with **no large prospective studies** confirming causality or prevalence [^930101c7]. Mechanistic hypotheses include persistent changes in neurosteroids (e.g. allopregnanolone), androgen signaling, or epigenetic effects, but these remain unproven in humans [^1aedcee5] [^dfaf72ec].

---

## Factors influencing reversibility

Several factors may influence whether ED persists after stopping finasteride:

- **Age**: Younger men may be more likely to report persistent symptoms, though data are limited [^494aa094].
- **Duration of use**: Longer exposure may increase risk of persistent symptoms, but evidence is inconclusive [^5ff353f9].
- **Dose**: Lower doses (1 mg) are more often associated with persistent symptoms in reports, possibly due to selection or reporting bias [^930101c7].
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, and nocebo effects may contribute to persistence [^443c8535].

---

## Clinical management of persistent erectile dysfunction

For persistent ED after finasteride, management is supportive and symptom-targeted:

- **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5is)**: First-line therapy for ED, effective in many cases [^f36c9bd6].
- **Hormonal evaluation**: Consider testosterone assessment, especially if symptoms suggest hypogonadism [^0f3772ba].
- **Psychological support**: Counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy may help address anxiety, depression, or nocebo effects [^notfound].
- **Alternative therapies**: Limited evidence supports acupuncture, herbal remedies, or lifestyle changes; use cautiously and discuss risks [^792c03c9].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Finasteride can cause ED in a minority of users, and most cases resolve after stopping the drug. Persistent ED (PFS) is reported but remains **controversial and poorly characterized**; high-quality evidence for permanence is lacking [^930101c7]. Clinicians should counsel patients about potential sexual side effects, monitor for persistent symptoms, and offer supportive management, including PDE5 inhibitors and psychological support [^c5b86b30].

### Persistent sexual side effects of finasteride: could they be permanent? [^5ff353f9]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Finasteride has been associated with sexual side effects that may persist despite discontinuation of the medication. In a clinical series, 20% of subjects with male pattern hair loss reported persistent sexual dysfunction for ≥ 6 years, suggesting the possibility that the dysfunction may be permanent. These subjects also reported a wide range of symptoms including changes in cognition, ejaculate quality, and genital sensation. Other medications have been associated with irreversible neurological effects, such as phenothiazines with tardive dyskinesias.

Aim

To prospectively study whether the persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride resolve or endure over time.

Methods

Subjects (N = 54) with persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride were reassessed after 9–16 months (mean 14 months). All subjects were otherwise healthy young men without any baseline sexual dysfunction, medical conditions, psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications prior to taking finasteride for male pattern hair loss.

Main Outcome Measure

Scores from the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX).

Results

The participation rate was 81%. At reassessment persistent sexual side effects continued to be present in 96% of subjects. According to the ASEX scores, 89% of subjects met the definition of sexual dysfunction. Neither the length of finasteride use nor the duration of the sexual side effects correlated to changes in scores of sexual dysfunction.

Conclusion

In most men who developed persistent sexual side effects (≥ 3 months) despite the discontinuation of finasteride, the sexual dysfunction continued for many months or years. Although several rat studies have shown detrimental changes to erectile function caused by 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, the persistent nature of these changes is an area of active research. Prescribers of finasteride and men contemplating its use should be made aware of the potential adverse medication effects.

Sexual function

Perhaps the most controversial area with regards to the nonprostate-related effects of DHT in male health is in the area of sexual function, particularly with respect to the reversibility, or lack thereof, of sexual side effects that are attributed to the 5AR-Is. Multiple large studies have reported sexual dysfunction in men with BPH taking finasteride or dutasteride, including three large, placebo-controlled studies. Overall, use of 5AR-Is is associated with a 5% to 9% prevalence of new-onset erectile dysfunction and decreased libido. These data strongly point to a role for endogenous DHT in the maintenance of normal sexual and ejaculatory function and sexual desire. And, in fact, this has been shown to be true in healthy young men where serum DHT concentration was revealed to be the sole independent predictor of orgasm frequency, a surrogate for overall male sexual function.

The impact of reductions in serum DHT in younger men, who may be using 5AR-Is for MAA, is more controversial. In particular, some retrospective analyses and case series have suggested that sexual side effects in younger men taking 5AR-Is are irreversible; however, it should be noted that such analyses may suffer from recall bias, and all lack a placebo control, so the findings should be treated with caution until appropriately designed trials are conducted. Of note is one placebo-controlled trial in healthy young men that revealed small changes in sexual function and semen parameters (but not fertility) with both finasteride and dutasteride over 1 year. But all of these changes reverted to baseline 6 months after drug cessation. The role of estrogens in sexual desire and erectile function in men was recently highlighted in an elegant study from Finkelstein et al. Studies of exogenous DHT are largely consistent with these findings and show that DHT maintains or improves sexual function, including a minor role (secondary to T) in maintenance of normal erectile function. However, possibly through decreases in serum estradiol concentrations, elevated DHT may not help to maintain sexual desire. Notably, inclusion of dutasteride with T replacement did not alter sexual function in older men with low T. In summary, endogenous DHT appears to play a role in the maintenance of normal sexual function, including libido, in younger and older men. We have not identified any literature to suggest modest or even substantial increases in circulating DHT have a negative impact on male sexual function.

### Finasteride 5 mg and sexual side effects: how many of these are related to a nocebo phenomenon? [^443c8535]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual adverse experiences such as erectile dysfunction (ED), loss of libido, and ejaculation disorders have been consistent side effects of finasteride in a maximum percentage of 15% after 1 year of therapy. Such data could be seen as far from reality, if compared to a higher percentage that may be found in any common clinical practice.

Aim

This study aims to explain the dichotomy between literature's data and clinical practice data.

Methods

One hundred twenty patients with a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), sexually active and with an International Index of Erectile Function-erectile function (IIEF-EF) domain ≥ 25 were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg concealed as an "X compound of proven efficacy for the treatment of BPH" for 1 year with (group 2) or without (group 1) counseling on the drug sexual side effect. The phrase used to inform group 2 patients was "… it may cause erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, problems of ejaculation but these are uncommon".

Main Outcome Measures

The estimation of side effect was conducted at 6 and 12 months using the male sexual function-4 (MSF-4 item) questionnaire and a self-administered questionnaire.

Results

One hundred seven patients completed the study. Group 2 patients (N = 55) reported a significant higher proportion of one or more sexual side effects as compared to group 1 (N = 52) (43.6% vs. 15.3%) (P = 0.03). The incidence of ED, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorders were 9.6, 7.7, and 5.7% for group 1, and 30.9, 23.6, and 16.3% for group 2, respectively (P = 0.02, P = 0.04, and P = 0.06).

Conclusion

In the current study, blinded administration of finasteride was associated with a significantly higher proportion of sexual dysfunction in patients informed on sexual side effects (group 2) as compared to those in which the same information was omitted (group 1) (P = 0.03). A scenario similar to group 2 of the current study is likely to occur in clinical practice, where the patient is counseled by the physician and has access to the drug information sheet. The burden of this nocebo effect (an adverse side effect that is not a direct result of the specific pharmacological action of the drug) has to be taken into account when managing finasteride sexual side effects.

### Persistent sexual side effects of finasteride for male pattern hair loss [^3bf03759]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Finasteride has been associated with reversible adverse sexual side effects in multiple randomized, controlled trials for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (MPHL). The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom and the Swedish Medical Products Agency have both updated their patient information leaflets to include a statement that "persistence of erectile dysfunction after discontinuation of treatment with Propecia has been reported in post-marketing use".

Aim

We sought to characterize the types and duration of persistent sexual side effects in otherwise healthy men who took finasteride for MPHL.

Methods

We conducted standardized interviews with 71 otherwise healthy men aged 21–46 years who reported the new onset of sexual side effects associated with the temporal use of finasteride, in which the symptoms persisted for at least 3 months despite the discontinuation of finasteride.

Main Outcome Measures

The types and duration of sexual dysfunction and the changes in perceived sexual frequency and sexual dysfunction score between pre- and post-finasteride use.

Results

Subjects reported new-onset persistent sexual dysfunction associated with the use of finasteride: 94% developed low libido, 92% developed erectile dysfunction, 92% developed decreased arousal, and 69% developed problems with orgasm. The mean number of sexual episodes per month dropped and the total sexual dysfunction score increased for before and after finasteride use according to the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (P < 0.0001 for both). The mean duration of finasteride use was 28 months and the mean duration of persistent sexual side effects was 40 months from the time of finasteride cessation to the interview date. Study limitations include a post hoc approach, selection bias, recall bias for before finasteride data, and no serum hormone levels.

Conclusion

Physicians treating MPHL should discuss the potential risk of persistent sexual side effects associated with finasteride.

### Why odds ratios can Be tricky statistics: the case of finasteride, dutasteride, and sexual dysfunction [^83a92a2b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Finasteride and dutasteride are 5α-reductase inhibitor drugs that are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in men with BPH show that these drugs impair libido and cause erectile dysfunction. Meta-analyses of the RCTs confirm the findings, estimating odds ratio (OR) values for these adverse effects at around 1.50. A problem with meta-analyses that do not report absolute risks with drug vs placebo and that extract ORs instead of relative risks (RRs) from RCT data is that it is hard for the reader to know how to interpret the findings and communicate them to patients. Had the RR been 1.50, the reader would conclude that the risk with drug is 50% higher than the risk with placebo; this is easily understood because the risk with placebo would be available from the RCTs. In contrast, an OR of 1.50 means that the odds with drug are 50% higher than the odds with placebo; understanding this requires a knowledge of what the odds with placebo are as well as an understanding of what odds mean. Odds are not as easily understood as risks are. Odds are numerically different from risks, and the OR is numerically different from the RR. The difference between the OR and the RR is numerically small when the risks are similar in the two groups and also when the risks are dissimilar but the risk is small in the group of interest. The difference between the OR and the RR becomes increasingly large when the risks are dissimilar in the two groups and when the risk in the group of interest is not small. Smallness of risk, in this context, has been conservatively stated as 10%, but it could be possible to use a higher cutoff, such as 20%. Other issues related to risk, odds, RR, and OR are also discussed.

### Adverse side effects of 5 α-reductase inhibitors therapy: persistent diminished libido and erectile dysfunction and depression in a subset of patients [^c1cd956f]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

5α-reductase inhibitors (5α-RIs), finasteride and dutasteride, have been approved for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, with marked clinical efficacy. Finasteride is also approved for treatment of hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). Although the adverse side effects of these agents are thought to be minimal, the magnitude of adverse effects on sexual function, gynecomastia, depression, and quality of life remains ill-defined.

Aim

The goal of this review is to discuss 5α-RIs therapy, the potential persistent side effects, and the possible mechanisms responsible for these undesirable effects.

Methods

We examined data reported in various clinical studies from the available literature concerning the side effects of finasteride and dutasteride.

Main Outcome Measures

Data reported in the literature were reviewed and discussed. Results. Prolonged adverse effects on sexual function such as erectile dysfunction and diminished libido are reported by a subset of men, raising the possibility of a causal relationship.

Conclusions

We suggest discussion with patients on the potential sexual side effects of 5α-RIs before commencing therapy. Alternative therapies may be considered in the discussion, especially when treating androgenetic alopecia.

### Post-finasteride syndrome-a true clinical entity? [^b1159580]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This review critically examines Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS), a condition eventually reported by men who have used finasteride for androgenetic alopecia or benign prostatic enlargement and experienced persistent adverse effects after discontinuation. We explore the clinical manifestations, including sexual dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and physical changes, that collectively challenge both diagnosis and management. This review evaluates the evidence for PFS, discusses potential mechanisms including neurobiological alterations, genetic predispositions, and addresses the controversies surrounding its existence and recognition by the medical community. Emphasis is placed on the role of patient education and the need for thorough risk assessment before prescribing finasteride. Although contrasting data from literature, men treated with finasteride could develop a plethora of non-neglectable physical and psychological symptoms identifying PFS. A multidisciplinary approach to research, policy-making, and patient advocacy is essential to better understand, diagnose, and manage PFS, underlining the necessity for greater awareness and scientific inquiry into this contentious and impactful syndrome.

### Beliefs and counseling practices among dermatologists regarding sexual and other adverse effects of finasteride [^23fd06a0]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride may cause low libido and erectile dysfunction and the product label of finasteride also includes post-marketing reactions of sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, as well as male infertility and depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beliefs and counseling practices among dermatologists regarding adverse effects of finasteride. Anonymous paper surveys were personally distributed to 122 attendees at two annual major dermatology meetings. The participation rate was 82% with 47% women and 77% residents of the United States. 51% of respondents believed that finasteride could cause sexual side effects and 18% believed that it could cause persistent sexual side effects. Fewer than a quarter believed that finasteride could cause depression or lower sperm counts. When initiating finasteride, 69% of respondents counseled at least half of their patients about potential sexual side effects with 52% for persistent sexual side effects and 30% for depression. This study identifies the need for greater awareness of the potential adverse effects of finasteride and identifies opportunities for improvement in counseling practices that reflect finasteride's product labeling.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^cf72062e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dutasteride is a 5α‐reductase inhibitor (5‐ARI) used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Treatment with 5‐ARI, including dutasteride and finasteride, in men has been associated with adverse events (AE) related to sexual function, such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. 1 There have been reports of persistent, irreversible sexual AE with finasteride 2, 3, 4 but causality remains uncertain and it is unknown whether this also occurs with dutasteride. Furthermore, sexual AE with dutasteride are not well‐characterized in men with AGA, who are generally younger (aged 18–50 years) than men with BPH (generally aged ≥ 45 years).

This study assessed sexual AE following dutasteride treatment over 24 and 48 weeks in men with AGA.

### Post-finasteride syndrome: a surmountable challenge for clinicians [^d885af21]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.

### Global online interest in finasteride sexual side effects [^fad33a67]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior literature has suggested that finasteride may negatively impact men's sexual health. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided a warning on finasteride drug labels to incorporate sexual side effects such as reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate global online interest in finasteride sexual side effects, their penetrance and variation, and how they compared overtime. We also aimed to evaluate the influence of the FDA label warnings on web-based searches for finasteride side effects. We utilized Google search engine from January 2004 to December 2020 to include separate trends from web searches of "Propecia", "Propecia side effects", "finasteride", "finasteride side effects", and "post-finasteride syndrome" compared amongst the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. We performed join-point regression analysis. We compared the annual relative search volume (ARSV) and annual percentage change (APC) to evaluate for loss or gain of interest in the respective key terms. We determined that the average ARSV for "finasteride" was 14.8% in 2004 and increased significantly to 57.3% in 2020 (APC: +9.25%, 95% CI 8 to 10.5, p < 0.001). Likewise, there was significant increased interest in "finasteride side effects" (APC: +20.7, p < 0.001) and "post-finasteride syndrome" (APC: +29.2; p < 0.001) in the United States overtime. Finally, when we compared trends before and after the FDA warnings, the average ASRV of "finasteride", "finasteride side effects", and "post-finasteride syndrome" all increased significantly (p = 0.001, p = 0.014, p < 0.001), respectively. Thus, it is evident that there is a global web-based interest in finasteride and its sexual health side effects, particularly after the FDA warning in 2011. There is boosted public awareness, and thus providers should have more detailed and careful conversations with patients prior to starting a 5α-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride.

### 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and erectile dysfunction: the connection [^8b760b1d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common problem affecting middle-aged and elderly men. First-line medical therapy includes alpha 1blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), such as finasteride and dutasteride. 5ARI use has been associated with adverse sexual outcomes, including erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD), and decreased libido.

Aim

To clarify the association between sexual adverse effects (AEs) and 5ARIs through review of literature concerning 5ARIs and to review the proposed mechanisms of these effects.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review, using MEDLINE and PUBMED search engines, was conducted for all publications concerning 5ARIs and sexual AEs.

Main Outcome Measure

Sexual adverse effects, such as ED, EjD, and decreased libido, were the measured outcomes of this literature review.

Results

Sexual AEs are reported in clinical trials at rates of 2.1% to 38%. The most common sexual AE is ED, followed by EjD and decreased libido. These effects occur early in therapy and attenuate over time. A proposed mechanism for sexual dysfunction involves decreased nitric oxide synthase activity due to decreased dihydrotestosterone.

Conclusions

The connection between 5ARIs and sexual dysfunction is apparent upon review of the literature. Though theories have been proposed, little is known about the exact mechanisms behind 5ARI-related sexual dysfunction. Since the connection between 5ARIs and sexual AEs is established in the literature, future research should be directed toward deciphering the pathophysiologic mechanisms. When more basic science knowledge is attained in this area, the focus can shift toward prevention and treatment.

### Finasteride [^244b54ff]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study)

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions.

Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was ≥ 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

### Effect of 5 α-reductase inhibitors on sexual function: a meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^cd0f76bb]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

5α-Reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are widely used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA).

Aim

To review all the available data on the effect of 5ARIs on sexual function and assess whether 5ARIs increase the risk of sexual dysfunction.

Methods

A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search was limited to articles published in English and up to October 2015. Article selection proceeded according to the search strategy based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses criteria. Data were analyzed using Stata 12.0. A fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall combined risk estimates. Publication bias was assessed using Begg and Egger tests.

Main Outcome Measures

Sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido.

Results

After screening 493 articles, 17 randomized controlled trials with 17,494 patients were included. Nine studies evaluated the efficacy of 5ARIs in men with BPH. The other eight reported using 5ARIs in the treatment of men with AGA. The mean age of participants was 60.10 years across all studies. We included 10 trials (6,779 patients) on the efficacy and safety of finasteride, 4 trials (6,222 patients) on the safety and tolerability of dutasteride, and 3 trials (4,493 patients) using finasteride and dutasteride for AGA. The pooled relative risks for sexual dysfunction were 2.56 (95% CI = 1.48–4.42) in men with BPH and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.85–1.72) in men with AGA; those for erectile dysfunction were 1.55 (95% CI = 1.14–2.12) in men with BPH and 0.66 (95% CI = 0.20–2.25) in men with AGA; and those for decreased libido were 1.69 (95% CI = 1.03–2.79) in men with BPH and 1.16 (95% CI = 0.50–2.72) in men with AGA. Estimates of the total effects were generally consistent with the sensitivity analysis. No evidence of publication bias was observed.

Conclusion

Evidence from the randomized controlled trials suggested that 5ARIs were associated with increased adverse effects on sexual function in men with BPH compared with placebo. However, the association was not statistically significant in men with AGA. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are indicated to study further the mechanism and effects of 5ARIs on sexual function.

### A clinical guide to rare male sexual disorders [^24e56f8c]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Conditions referred to as 'male sexual dysfunctions' usually include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and male hypogonadism. However, some less common male sexual disorders exist, which are under-recognized and under-treated, leading to considerable morbidity, with adverse effects on individuals' sexual health and relationships. Such conditions include post-finasteride syndrome, restless genital syndrome, post-orgasmic illness syndrome, post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sexual dysfunction, hard-flaccid syndrome, sleep-related painful erections and post-retinoid sexual dysfunction. Information about these disorders usually originates from case-control trials or small case series; thus, the published literature is scarce. As the aetiology of these diseases has not been fully elucidated, the optimal investigational work-up and therapy are not well defined, and the available options cannot, therefore, adequately address patients' sexual problems and implement appropriate treatment. Thus, larger-scale studies - including prospective trials and comprehensive case registries - are crucial to better understand the aetiology, prevalence and clinical characteristics of these conditions. Furthermore, collaborative efforts among researchers, health-care professionals and patient advocacy groups will be essential in order to develop evidence-based guidelines and novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively address these disorders. By advancing our understanding and refining treatment strategies, we can strive towards improving the quality of life and fostering healthier sexual relationships for individuals suffering from these rare sexual disorders.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^9af39fa6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common side effects with finasteride monotherapy are: trouble getting or keeping an erection (impotence), decrease in sex drive, decreased volume of ejaculate, ejaculation disorders, and enlarged or painful breast. You should promptly report to your doctor any changes in your breasts such as lumps, pain or nipple discharge.

Call your healthcare provider if you get any side effect that bothers you or one that does not go away.

Uncommon side effects with tadalafil, an active ingredient in ENTADFI include:

An erection that won't go away (priapism). If you get an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. Priapism must be treated as soon as possible or lasting damage can happen to your penis, including the inability to have erections.

Color vision changes, such as seeing a blue tinge (shade) to objects or having difficulty telling the difference between the colors blue and green.

In rare instances, men taking PDE5 inhibitors (oral erectile dysfunction medicines, including tadalafil) reported a sudden decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes. It is uncertain whether PDE5 inhibitors directly cause the vision loss. If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including ENTADFI, and call a healthcare provider right away.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (PLESS)

In PLESS, 1524 patients treated with PROSCAR and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions.

Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was ≥ 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2–4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions

The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and PLESS were similar.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

- hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face)

- testicular pain

- hematospermia

- sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown.

- male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown.

- depression

- male breast cancer.

The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

- orgasm disorders

### Finasteride in the treatment of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review of randomised trials [^6ce52143]. BMC Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects older men. This systematic review determined efficacy and adverse effects of finasteride.

Review Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, reference lists of reports, and reviews were searched for randomised, double-blind trials of finasteride in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Outcomes included symptom score, urinary flow rate, prostate volume, discontinuation, and adverse effects. Relative risk and NNT or NNH were calculated for dichotomous data. Sensitivity analyses assessed influences of baseline symptom severity, initial prostate volume, a dominating trial, and previous interventions.

Results

Three trials had active controls and 19 had placebo. In placebo-controlled trials, 8820 patients received finasteride 5 mg and 5909 placebo over 3–48 months. Over 48 months finasteride produced greater improvements in total symptom score, maximum urinary flow rate, and prostate volume. Significantly more sexual dysfunction, impotence, ejaculation disorder and decreased libido occurred with finasteride at 12 months; the NNH for any sexual dysfunction at 12 months was 14. Significantly fewer men treated with finasteride experienced acute retention or had surgery at 24 or 48 months than with placebo; at 12 months the NNT was 49 (31 to 112) to avoid one acute urinary retention and 31 (21 to 61) to avoid one surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed benefit with finasteride 5 mg to be constant irrespective of the initial prostate volume.

Conclusions

Information from many patients in studies of high quality showed beneficial effects of finasteride in terms of symptoms, flow rate and prostate volume. More utility would result if patient centred outcomes were reported in dichotomous form.

### The post-finasteride syndrome: possible etiological mechanisms and symptoms [^abd490a9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Finasteride and dutasteride, synthetic 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are recommended in many guidelines for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms and alopecia despite a variety of side effects like sexual, neurological, psychiatric, endocrinological, metabolic and ophthalmological dysfunctions and the increased incidence of high grade prostate cancer. The sexual side effects are common during the use of the drug but in a small subgroup of patients, they can persist after stopping the drug. This so-called post-finasteride syndrome has serious implications for the quality of life without a clear etiology or therapy. Three types of 5α-reductases are present in many organs in- and outside the brain where they can be blocked by the two 5ARIs. There is increasing evidence that 5ARIs not only inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate and the scalp but also in many other tissues. The lipophilic 5ARIs can pass the blood-brain barrier and might block many other neurosteroids in the brain with changes in the neurochemistry and impaired neurogenesis. Further research and therapeutic innovations are urgently needed that might cure or relieve these side effects. More awareness is needed for physicians to outweigh these health risks against the benefits of 5ARIs.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^76820073]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha reductase inhibitor sexual function effects — finasteride: In MTOPS, declines in overall sexual function were noted in all arms, including placebo, with a small but statistically significant deterioration in ejaculatory function above placebo for men on finasteride and combination therapy; combination therapy also showed significant worsening in EF and sexual problem assessment, while doxazosin did not differ from placebo in ejaculatory domains. Previous randomized, placebo‑controlled analyses indicate that in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment, patients on finasteride experience ED, libido disturbances, and ejaculatory problems at about twice the rate of placebo, after which rates are often similar. In PLESS, sexual adverse events were more frequent with finasteride (15%) than placebo (7%) during the first year (p < 0.001), with no between‑group difference in new sexual adverse events during years 2 through 4 (7% in both groups); discontinuation due to sexual adverse events occurred in 4% with finasteride versus 2% with placebo, and amongst men with bothersome ED from 5‑ARI therapy, cessation of drug may allow them to return to the baseline rates of ED.

### Finasteride and bicalutamide as primary hormonal therapy in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate [^7f9e6e3b]. Annals of Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Medical or surgical castration is effective in advanced prostate cancer but with profound side-effects, particularly on sexual function. Effective, less toxic therapies are needed. This study examined whether the addition of finasteride to high-dose bicalutamide enhanced disease control, as measured by additional decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Patients and Methods

Forty-one patients with advanced prostate cancer received bicalutamide (150 mg/day). Finasteride (5 mg/day) was added at first PSA nadir. Serum PSA was measured every 2 weeks until disease progression. Questionnaires were administered to assess sexual function.

Results

Median follow-up is 3.9 years. At the first PSA nadir, median decrease in PSA from baseline was 96.5%. Thirty of 41 patients (73%) achieved a second PSA nadir and median decrease of 98.5% from baseline. Median time to each nadir was 3.7 and 5.8 weeks, respectively. Median time to treatment failure was 21.3 months. Toxicities were minor, including gynecomastia. Seventeen of 29 (59%) and 12 of 24 (50%) men had normal sex drive at baseline and at second PSA nadir, respectively. One-third of men had spontaneous erection at both time points.

Conclusion

Finasteride provides additional intracellular androgen blockade when added to bicalutamide. Duration of control is comparable to castration, with preserved sexual function in some patients.

### Impact of treatment of BPH on sexuality [^507394bb]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can have a profound affect on a patient's quality of life and sexual function and is considered by patients to be one of the most important aspects affected by the disease. Different treatments can produce a variable response in terms of the patient's quality of life, including sexual activity and satisfaction. Varying rates of erectile dysfunction (ED) and retrograde ejaculation following surgery for BPH have been reported. In general, the incidence of these side-effects is less after minimally invasive therapies, such as interstitial laser coagulation and transurethral microwave therapy, but the data available are limited. The lowest rates of sexual dysfunction are reported with medical therapies. The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, finasteride, can result in ED in 5–9% of patients and ejaculation disorders in 0.8–2.0%. With the exception of tamsulosin, alpha(1) blockers are associated with a low rate of sexual dysfunction. No cases of ED have been reported with alfuzosin and abnormal ejaculation with terazosin or alfuzosin is negligible. Indeed, early research suggests a beneficial effect of alpha(1) blockers on sexual function. In addition to information on the efficacy of a particular therapy, patients should be informed of side effects, in particular those relating to sexual function, in order that they can make informed treatment decisions.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^930101c7]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) evidence appraisal: PFS is a controversial and poorly-defined constellation of chronic 5-ARI-induced sexual, physical, and psychological symptoms that putatively persist after discontinuation of the 5-ARI. Concerns regarding PFS prompted the FDA to amend the labels for 5-ARI with a warning of its risks, and the robustness of the data justifying this change, which is based on anecdotal patient-reported outcomes rather than prospective trials, remains unclear. Dutasteride, which has activity at more 5-ARI receptors than finasteride, has largely not been implicated, and dose response association with finasteride does not seem present as the 1mg dose has been more closely linked to PFS than the more potent 5mg dose. The significant increases in reporting after the first published reports of PFS in 2012 (with no signal before 2012) points towards stimulated reporting. In general, current data on PFS draw primarily from case reports rather than prospective trials, and it is the assessment of the Panel that much of these data are susceptible to bias. Overall, the existence of persistent sexual dysfunction following cessation of 5-ARI is currently not demonstrated by reliable scientific research; there are no properly designed studies that report a significant association, and if the Bradford-Hill criteria are applied, they do not support an inference of causality with neither a strong nor consistent association reported. As for biological gradient, it is difficult to understand how 1 mg of finasteride may cause persistence when the 5 mg dose of the same drug is much less likely, and DHT levels return to normal within four weeks after cessation of finasteride use, which implies no persistent effect through a mechanism involving suppressed serum DHT levels.

### Treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia and its impact on sexual function [^12f41e8a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disorder in older men and may be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction. Men who present with symptomatic BPH and LUTS are at increased risk for sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD).

Objective

This review describes treatment options recommended by the 2003 American Urological Association (AUA) guideline panel for the relief of LUTS associated with BPH, with a focus on the effects of each treatment on ED and EjD.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified via MEDLINE searches of all English-language articles published from January 1984 to January 2005 using the following search terms: benign prostatic hyperplasia and sexual dysfunction, lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, dutasteride, finasteride, transurethral resection of prostate, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Data on the effects of BPH treatments on sexual function were extracted from the articles and summarized. Because properly designed, adequately powered, direct-comparator studies have not yet been conducted, the AUA's report provides the most comprehensive analyses regarding the efficacy and safety of the current BPH treatment options.

Results

LUTS are an independent risk factor for sexual dysfunction in aging men, even after controlling for age and comorbidities. Although surgery, minimally invasive therapies, and pharmacologic therapies can all improve LUTS and the peak urinary flow rate, some can cause or exacerbate ED (incidence rates: surgery, 10%; minimally invasive therapies, 1%-3%; pharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy, 3%-10%) and EjD (incidence rates: surgery, 65%; minimally invasive therapies, 4%-16%; pharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy, 0%-10%). Among pharmacologic therapies for BPH, the frequency of EjD appears to be greater with tamsulosin (10%) than with other alpha(1)-blockers (0%-1%) or the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (4%), based on data from a single-arm meta-analysis conducted by the AUA.

Conclusion

Sexual function should be assessed and discussed with the patient when contemplating the appropriate management strategy for LUTS associated with BPH, as well as when evaluating the patient's response to treatment.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

 Females

Finasteride is not indicated for use in females.

 Males

Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

There have been postmarketing reports of male infertility and/or poor seminal quality; normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects included in a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1480 and 105 subjects were 65 and over and 75 and over, respectively. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Caution should be exercised in the administration of finasteride in those patients with liver function abnormalities, as finasteride is metabolized extensively in the liver [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Sexual dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^61d8d8ef]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Sexuality is an essential aspect of a couple's relationship and has a significant impact on life satisfaction. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition that commonly affects older men and is often associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction. Men with moderate-to-severe LUTS are at increased risk for sexual dysfunction, including moderate-to-severe erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD), and hypoactive desire (HD). The results of several recent large-scale studies have shown a consistent and strong relationship between LUTS and both ED and EjD. It appears that the pathophysiological mechanisms of LUTS and the related prostatic enlargement of BPH as well as certain treatments for this condition may have an impact on both the erection and ejaculation components of the sexual response. Validated questionnaires that assess sexual function provide clinicians with valuable information to help guide treatment selection decisions. Effective medical therapies for LUTS associated with BPH include alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists (i.e., alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin) and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (i.e., finasteride and dutasteride). The side effects of these medications, including sexual dysfunction, are important distinguishing features. The successful management of patients with LUTS associated with BPH should include assessments of sexual function and monitoring of medication-related sexual side effects. For men with LUTS and sexual dysfunction, an appropriate integrated management approach, based on each patient's symptoms and outcome objectives, is warranted.

### Long-term 6-year experience with finasteride in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1946ce3d]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the 6-year clinical trial data with finasteride. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a chronic and progressive disease and therefore assessment of long-term safety and efficacy is important.

Methods

The North American and International Phase III Finasteride trials enrolled symptomatic men with enlarged prostate glands. The initial 1-year placebo-controlled study was followed by a 5-year open-label extension. In total, 6-year finasteride data were available in 487 patients originally randomized to finasteride, and 5-year data were available on 238 patients originally randomized to placebo.

Results

After 6 years of treatment with finasteride 5 mg, the mean quasi-American Urological Association Symptom Score improved by 4.0 points, the median prostate volume decreased by 24%, and the mean maximal urinary flow rate increased by 2.9 mL/s (P < 0.001 for all parameters). Long-term finasteride treatment was well tolerated, with a low incidence of drug-related sexual adverse events occurring during the first year and even fewer occurrences during the 5-year open extension.

Conclusions

Treatment with finasteride leads to durable improvement in urinary tract symptoms, flow rate, and prostate volume, with no increase in the prevalence of drug-related adverse events over time.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^543e0eb3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How Should I Take ENTADFI?

Take ENTADFI exactly as your healthcare provider prescribes it.
ENTADFI should be taken without food.
If you take too much ENTADFI, call your healthcare provider or emergency room right away.
Do not take ENTADFI more than one time each day.
Take one ENTADFI capsule every day at about the same time of day.
If you miss a dose, you may take it when you remember but do not take more than one dose per day.
Do not share ENTADFI with anyone else; it was prescribed only for you.

What Should I Avoid While Taking ENTADFI?

Do not use erectile dysfunction (ED) medicines or ED treatments while taking ENTADFI (unless you discuss with your healthcare provider).
Do not drink too much alcohol when taking ENTADFI (for example, 5 glasses of wine or 5 shots of whiskey). Drinking too much alcohol can increase your chances of getting a headache or getting dizzy, increasing your heart rate, or lowering your blood pressure.

What Are The Possible Side Effects Of ENTADFI?

See "What Is The Most Important Information I Should Know About ENTADFI?"

The most common side effects with tadalafil, an active ingredient in ENTADFI, are: headache, indigestion, back pain, muscle aches, flushing, and stuffy or runny nose. These side effects usually go away after a few hours. Men who get back pain and muscle aches usually get it 12 to 24 hours after taking ENTADFI. Back pain and muscle aches usually go away within 2 days.

Numerous robust analyses of randomized, placebo‑controlled trials have shown an improvement in standardized symptom scores superior to placebo, with improvements of 3 to 4 points observed and maintained for 6 to 10 years of follow‑up. Given the slow onset of action of this class, other medication classes may lead to more immediate relief, and patients should be counseled on a slower improvement in symptoms if men are treated with 5‑ARI alone.

The Proscar Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS) was a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of finasteride 5 mg in 3040 men, aged 45 to 78 years, with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, enlarged prostates, and no evidence of prostate cancer. Patients completed a questionnaire at screening regarding their history of sexual dysfunction. During treatment, spontaneously self-reported sexual AEs were recorded.

Results

At screening, 46% of patients in each treatment group reported some history of sexual dysfunction. During year 1 of the study, 15% of finasteride-treated patients and 7% of placebo-treated patients had sexual AEs that were considered drug related by the investigator (P < 0.001). During years 2 to 4, no between-group difference was noted in the incidence of new sexual AEs (7% in each group). The drug-related sexual AE profile for finasteride was similar for men with or without a history of sexual dysfunction. Sexual AEs resolved while continuing therapy in 12% of finasteride patients and 19% of placebo patients. Only 4% of finasteride and 2% of placebo patients discontinued the study because of sexual AEs. In men who discontinued with a sexual AE, 50% and 41% experienced resolution of their sexual AE after discontinuing finasteride or placebo therapy, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with placebo, men treated with finasteride experienced new drug-related sexual AEs with an increased incidence only during the first year of therapy.

### Sexual function in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia: results of a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of tadalafil coadministered with finasteride [^3d127e34]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tadalafil (TAD) 5mg coadministered with finasteride (FIN) 5mg significantly improves lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic enlargement. However, its effects on erectile/sexual function have yet to be fully described.

Aim

Assess the effects of TAD/FIN coadministration (compared with placebo [PBO]/FIN) on erectile and sexual function in sexually active men with LUTS and prostatic enlargement secondary to BPH with or without baseline comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED).

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled study of 695 men (610 sexually active; 450 with baseline ED; 404 sexually active with baseline ED) conducted at 70 sites in 13 countries. TAD 5mg or PBO once daily coadministered with FIN 5mg once daily for 26 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) domain and single-item scores; proportions of patients who demonstrated minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) in IIEF-Erectile Function domain scores (IIEF-EF; MCID defined as ≥ 4-point improvement); and sexual dysfunction adverse events (AEs).

Results

Compared with PBO/FIN, TAD/FIN resulted in improvements for all IIEF domain and single-item scores assessed among patients with baseline ED (P ≤ 0.002 for all measures) and among patients without baseline ED (P ≤ 0.041 for all measures). Compared with PBO/FIN, significantly larger percentages of sexually active men with baseline ED treated with TAD/FIN achieved an IIEF-EF MCID after 4, 12, and 26 weeks of therapy (P < 0.001 for odds ratio comparisons between TAD/FIN and PBO/FIN at all 3 three postbaseline timepoints). The incidence of sexual AEs was low: five TAD/FIN patients and seven PBO/FIN patients reported sexual AEs, including ED, decreased/lost libido, and ejaculation disorders.

Conclusions

TAD/FIN coadministration for the treatment of men with LUTS and prostatic enlargement secondary to BPH concurrently leads to statistically significant improvements in erectile/sexual function and is well-tolerated, regardless of the presence/absence of ED at treatment initiation.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus

Physicians should inform patients that women who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. If a woman who is pregnant or may potentially be pregnant comes in contact with crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Patients should be informed that there was an increase in high-grade prostate cancer in men treated with 5α-reductase inhibitors indicated for BPH treatment, compared to those treated with placebo in studies looking at the use of these drugs to prevent prostate cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Sexual Adverse events

Physicians should inform the patients that PROPECIA may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculation disorder, including decreased ejaculate volume.

Additional Instructions

Physicians should instruct their patients to promptly report any changes in their breasts such as lumps, pain or nipple discharge. Breast changes including breast enlargement, tenderness and neoplasm have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Physicians should instruct their patients to read the patient package insert before starting therapy with PROPECIA and to read it again each time the prescription is renewed so that they are aware of current information for patients regarding PROPECIA.

### A review of the FAERS data on 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: implications for postfinasteride syndrome [^494aa094]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify reports made to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), create a demographic of patient reports, and examine the cluster of symptoms to correlate consistency of postfinasteride syndrome (PFS) complaints. PFS is a provisional diagnosis encompassing a cluster of sexual, physical, and psychological and/or neurologic symptoms associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use that emerge or continue after discontinuation of medication.

Materials and Methods

FAERS dataset of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from April 2011 to October 2014 was obtained. Each FAERS report had 16 categories for completion, but not every report was fully completed. Statistical analysis compared variables of interest between the 2 doses of finasteride (1 mg vs 5 mg).

Results

From FAERS, 2048 monotherapy cases were identified: 1581 of finasteride 1 mg, 240 of finasteride 5 mg, and 226 of unreported doses. Possibly related to labeling changes, from 2011 to 2014, there was a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) reported involving 1 mg dosing. Finasteride use was reported with many sexual AEs including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory complaints. Other common AEs included dermatologic, metabolic, and psychological and/or neurologic complaints. There were more AE reports with the 1 mg dose than the 5 mg dose. One case of dutasteride reported back pain, not generally attributed to PFS.

Conclusion

FAERS data suggests that finasteride exposure is reported with a diverse collection of symptoms, particularly in younger men on 1 mg dosage compared to older men on 5 mg. Many of these complaints fall well out of the realm of previously established AEs from long-term controlled studies.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^4030ea12]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Treatment with 5α‐reductase inhibitors has been associated with sexual adverse events such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) and decreased libido. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate adverse events related to sexual function, based on their frequency, duration, persistence and associated treatment discontinuations, in men treated with dutasteride for androgenetic alopecia. Participants were randomized to receive double‐blind dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks, followed by open‐label dutasteride 0.5 mg for an additional 24 weeks. Sexual adverse events were followed up until resolution or for up to 24 weeks after the last dose. Overall, 117 men, 23–50 years of age, were randomized. The incidence of sexual adverse events was approximately twofold higher in the dutasteride group (16%) than the placebo group (8%) during the double‐blind period; the overall incidence of sexual adverse events was lower (5%) during the open‐label period. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and considered treatment‐related. The adverse events resolved while on study treatment or after the end of treatment and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. A limitation of this study was the small sample size. The sexual adverse events of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders reported in this study were expected and reversible.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Studies for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss

In three controlled clinical trials for PROPECIA of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking PROPECIA (n = 945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n = 934).

Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in ≥ 1% of patients treated with PROPECIA or placebo are presented in Table 1.

Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p = 0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to ≤ 0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA.

In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment.

In the clinical studies with PROPECIA, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo.

### Risk of erectile dysfunction associated with use of 5-α reductase inhibitors for benign prostatic hyperplasia or alopecia: population based studies using the clinical practice research datalink [^6a4fe6ef]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risk of erectile dysfunction in men who used 5-α reductase inhibitors to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia or alopecia.

Design

Cohort studies with nested case-control analyses.

Setting

UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

Population

Two populations of men free of risk factors for erectile dysfunction and other sexual dysfunction or its treatment: men aged 40 or more with benign prostatic hyperplasia who received a prescription for a 5-α reductase inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride) or α blocker, or both, and men aged 18–59 with alopecia.

Exposures

In the benign prostatic hyperplasia study, exposures were classified as 5-α reductase inhibitors only, 5-α reductase inhibitors+α blockers, or α blockers only. In the alopecia study, exposures were finasteride 1 mg or no treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Cases were men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction or treatment (procedure or prescription for a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor) during follow-up. We calculated incidence rates and adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We also conducted nested case-control analyses to control for major confounders, and calculated adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

In the population with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 71849), the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased with use of 5-α reductase inhibitors only (incidence rate ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.99; odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.03) or 5-α reductase inhibitors+α blocker (1.09, 0.99 to 1.21, 0.92; 0.80 to 1.06) compared with α blockers only, and remained null regardless of number of prescriptions or timing of use. The risk of erectile dysfunction increased with longer duration of benign prostatic hyperplasia, regardless of exposure. For the alopecia population (n = 12346), the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1 mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia (1.03, 0.73 to 1.44; 0.95, 0.64 to 1.41).

Conclusion

5-α reductase inhibitors do not seem to significantly increase the risk of incident erectile dysfunction, regardless of indication for use. Risk of erectile dysfunction increased with longer duration of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^0288a632]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of finasteride PO (also known as Proscar, Proscar):
- **Decreased serum PSA**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as finasteride reduces serum PSA levels even in the presence of prostate cancer. Measure baseline PSA at least 3 months after initiating finasteride and monitor periodically thereafter. Evaluate for prostate cancer in case of any increase from the lowest PSA level, even if the values are still within the normal range.
- **High-grade prostate cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving finasteride. Assess for other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms before initiating finasteride, recognizing that BPH and prostate cancer may coexist.

 Effect on Prostate Volume

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with finasteride who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study. Finasteride decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 cc at baseline to 45.8 cc at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 cc to 58.5 cc) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). (See Figure 4.)

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40 to 50 cc. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.

 Prostate Volume in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study

Prostate Volume as a Predictor of Therapeutic Response

A meta-analysis combining 1-year data from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of similar design, including 4491 patients with symptomatic BPH, demonstrated that, in patients treated with finasteride, the magnitude of symptom response and degree of improvement in maximum urinary flow rate were greater in patients with an enlarged prostate at baseline.

### Finasteride [^3ede5a83]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients in a long-term efficacy and safety study had moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (mean of approximately 15 points on a 0 to 34 point scale). Patients randomized to finasteride who remained on therapy for 4 years had a mean (± 1 SD) decrease in symptom score of 3.3 (± 5.8) points compared with 1.3 (± 5.6) points in the placebo group. (See Figure 1.) A statistically significant improvement in symptom score was evident at 1 year in patients treated with finasteride vs placebo (–2.3 vs –1.6), and this improvement continued through Year 4.

 Figure 1

 Symptom Score in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in a long-term efficacy and safety study. Although an early improvement in urinary symptoms was seen in some patients, a therapeutic trial of at least 6 months was generally necessary to assess whether a beneficial response in symptom relief had been achieved. The improvement in BPH symptoms was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.

 Effect on Acute Urinary Retention and the Need for Surgery

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, efficacy was also assessed by evaluating treatment failures. Treatment failure was prospectively defined as BPH-related urological events or clinical deterioration, lack of improvement and/or the need for alternative therapy. BPH-related urological events were defined as urological surgical intervention and acute urinary retention requiring catheterization. Complete event information was available for 92% of the patients. The following table (Table 5) summarizes the results.

### Finasteride (Propecia) [^f5abfedc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer.

Sexual Function Questionnaire

A sexual function questionnaire was self-administered by patients participating in the two vertex baldness trials to detect more subtle changes in sexual function. At Month 12, statistically significant differences in favor of placebo were found in 3 of 4 domains (sexual interest, erections, and perception of sexual problems). However, no significant difference was seen in the question on overall satisfaction with sex life.

In one of the two vertex baldness studies, patients were questioned on non-scalp body hair growth. PROPECIA did not appear to affect non-scalp body hair.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PROPECIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face);

Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain; hematospermia.

Neoplasms: male breast cancer;

Breast disorders: breast tenderness and enlargement;

Nervous System/Psychiatric: depression, suicidal ideation and behavior.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^18d8a391]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In the current study, most sexual AE resolved while participants remained on treatment. The four AE ongoing at the end of treatment resolved within 6 weeks after the last dose of dutasteride. The sexual AE profile of dutasteride treatment for male lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH has been consistent in previous randomized control trials. 9, 10 Interestingly, most sexual AE occur in the first 6 months of dutasteride treatment in BPH clinical trials 9, 10 and the likelihood of patients experiencing such AE even decreases over time. Furthermore, it has previously been reported in the combAT study 9 that impotence was the most frequently reported sexual AE in patients with BPH who received treatment with dutasteride. In a study of patients with androgenetic alopecia (ARI114264 study), sexual AE resolved while on treatment in six participants and resolved within 6 months after the end of treatment in 13 participants. 8 The resolution pattern of sexual AE in the AGA population of the current study seems to be analogous to the findings previously reported. These results also support the reversibility of sexual AE that occur with dutasteride treatment.

The majority of impotence AE (9/12 participants) were reported at a single study center; thus, variability in reporting sexual AE also appears to be influenced by a human component. The inter‐site and inter‐study variability could be linked to the nocebo phenomenon, where occurrence of symptoms is related to a patient's negative expectations. 11, 12 This phenomenon was shown in a randomized controlled study evaluating sexual dysfunction during treatment with finasteride for BPH. The rate of sexual dysfunction was higher in participants who were informed of possible sexual AE than in those who were not informed (44% vs 15%). 13 The authors concluded that the physician–patient relationship was fundamental with respect to reporting of sexual AE. A similar phenomenon has been documented in studies of atenolol for coronary heart disease. 12

### Efficacy and safety of the coadministration of tadalafil once daily with finasteride for 6 months in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^33af1847]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Medical treatment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia is 5α-reductase inhibitor monotherapy or coadministration with an α-blocker. We assessed the effects of tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg during 26 weeks on lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual symptoms.

Materials and Methods

In an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel study of men 45 years old or older who were 5α-reductase inhibitor naïve and had an I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) of 13 or greater and prostate volume 30 mL or greater, 350 were treated with placebo/finasteride and 345 received tadalafil/finasteride for 26 weeks. Changes in lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia were assessed with the I-PSS, erectile dysfunction improvements were assessed with the IIEF-EF (International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function) in sexually active men and safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events.

Results

Least squares mean changes from baseline in I-PSS after 4, 12 and 26 weeks of tadalafil/finasteride coadministration were -4.0, -5.2 and -5.5, respectively. Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -2.3, -3.8 and -4.5 (p ≤ 0.022 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). I-PSS subscores (storage and voiding) and quality of life index were also numerically improved with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration. Least squares mean changes from baseline in IIEF-EF with tadalafil/finasteride coadministration were 3.7 after 4 weeks, and 4.7 after 12 and 26 weeks. Corresponding values for placebo/finasteride coadministration were -1.1, 0.6 and -0.0 (p < 0.001 at all visits favoring tadalafil/finasteride coadministration). Tadalafil/finasteride coadministration was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild/moderate.

Conclusions

The coadministration of tadalafil/finasteride provides early improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic enlargement. Tadalafil/finasteride coadministration also improves erectile function in men who have comorbid erectile dysfunction.

### Prospective randomized study of sexual function in men taking dutasteride for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia [^7bd5a7dd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants were sexually active men aged 18–50 years with AGA who had been in a stable heterosexual relationship for 6 months prior to screening and expected to maintain that relationship throughout the study. Exclusion criteria are described in Appendix S1.

This international, multicenter, parallel‐group study comprised a 4‐week participant‐blinded placebo run‐in period and a 24‐week double‐blind (DB) treatment period where participants were randomized (1:1 ratio) using a centralized computer system to once‐daily dutasteride 0.5 mg or placebo. This was followed by a 24‐week open‐label (OL) active treatment period in which all participants received once‐daily dutasteride 0.5 mg, and a 4‐week post‐treatment follow‐up visit (Fig. S1). Participants with an ongoing sexual AE at the end of the treatment period and those who discontinued study treatment due to an AE related to sexual function entered a targeted follow‐up period until resolution of the sexual AE or 24 weeks after the last dose of the study treatment, whichever occurred first.

The primary objective was to evaluate the frequency, duration and persistence of AE related to sexual function (decreased libido, impotence and ejaculation disorders), and associated treatment discontinuations in men treated with dutasteride for AGA. A protocol amendment changed the primary objective from change in sexual function (measured by the International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF] – Erectile Function domain [EF]) to the incidence of sexual AE. The amendment also added the 24‐week OL period to extend monitoring of on‐treatment AE reversibility.

Other objectives included overall safety; changes in sexual function, measured by the IIEF questionnaire; participant‐perceived changes in sexual function, measured by global assessment questions; participant satisfaction with hair growth with dutasteride treatment for male AGA, measured by the Hair Growth Satisfaction Scale; and participant‐perceived impact of alopecia on health‐related quality of life (QoL), measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Additional details regarding these assessment tools and the statistical analyses can be found in Appendix S1.

This study (NCT02014584; registered 12 December 2013) was approved by the applicable institutional review board/ethics committee (registration date, 21 March 2014; registration no. 201401094MSB) for each country and study center. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation.

Pharmacotherapy for men experiencing erectile dysfunction has undergone dramatic advances over the past 5 years with the introduction of an effective oral agent. Sildenafil has increased the pool of couples seeking treatment for this important health issue as well as expanding the numbers of physicians treating it. Research into the growing field of erectile dysfunction is expanding at a rapid pace. Independent investigators worldwide now regularly contribute to our body of scientific knowledge. Novel oral therapies targeted at specific points along the erectile cascade are undergoing pre-clinical and early phase registration trials with the promise of rapid action, extended duration of responsiveness and an improved side effect profile. In this review, we have highlighted recent information on the next generation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and summarized the evolving research into centrally acting agents, which may lead to effective combination therapy.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^8c1c70d1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer

Patients should be informed that there was an increase in high-grade prostate cancer in men treated with 5α-reductase inhibitors indicated for BPH treatment, including PROSCAR, compared to those treated with placebo in studies looking at the use of these drugs to prevent prostate cancer [see Indications and Usage (1.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Exposure of Females — Risk to Male Fetus

Physicians should inform patients that females who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant should not handle crushed or broken PROSCAR tablets because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to the male fetus. PROSCAR tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. If a female who is pregnant or may potentially be pregnant comes in contact with crushed or broken PROSCAR tablets, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Additional Instructions

Physicians should inform patients that the volume of ejaculate may be decreased in some patients during treatment with PROSCAR. This decrease does not appear to interfere with normal sexual function. However, impotence and decreased libido may occur in patients treated with PROSCAR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Physicians should instruct their patients to promptly report any changes in their breasts such as lumps, pain or nipple discharge. Breast changes including breast enlargement, tenderness and neoplasm have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Physicians should instruct their patients to read the patient package insert before starting therapy with PROSCAR and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed so that they are aware of current information for patients regarding PROSCAR.

### Are finasteride-related penile curvature / Peyronie's disease adverse event reports worthy of further clinical investigation? Disproportionality analysis based on both the food and drug administration (FDA) and the European medicines agency (EMA) pharmacovigilance databases [^59c99540]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A limited number of studies have described patients on finasteride showing findings which were consistent with Peyronie's disease (PD). We aimed to detect a pharmacovigilance signal of possible association between finasteride and PD-related clinical features. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried to identify the ten drugs which were associated the most with the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded as "penile curvature" and/or "Peyronie's disease". A similar analysis, including the same drugs, was carried out for the EMA (European Medicines Agency) EudraVigilance (EV) database. Descriptive data have been analyzed, and Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs) have been computed against the other nine drugs of the database. Overall, 860 reports of "penile curvature" and/or "Peyronie's disease", were identified in the FAERS database, 214 of which (24.9%) were associated with finasteride. Most reports (56.9%) were submitted by healthcare professionals. Where a treatment-indication was stated, the vast majority of reports (176/210; 83.8%) were associated with androgenetic alopecia. The outcome of most ADRs was "serious" (82.2%), with 96 ADRs resulting in levels of permanent disability. For 97/214 individual cases, penile curvature/PD reports were not part of a syndromic cluster suggestive of post-finasteride syndrome (PFS). The PRR resulted 6.6 (95% CI: 5.6–7.8) and 11.8 (95% CI: 9.08–15.33), respectively, in the FAERS and in the EV databases. Notwithstanding the related limitations and biasing factors of pharmacovigilance studies based on spontaneous reporting, the PRR values here identified should be interpreted as strong signals of disproportionality. These findings, per se, are however not useful to confirm any causal association. Clinical studies are needed to investigate on the possible role for finasteride in causing PD-related clinical features, an hypothesis which remains highly speculative due to the very questionable quality of present data.

### Tadalafil (N / a) [^b478930c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Tadalafil tablets are phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors indicated for the treatment of:

erectile dysfunction (ED) (1.1)
the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (1.2)
ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH (ED/BPH) (1.3)

If tadalafil tablets are used with finasteride to initiate BPH treatment, such use is recommended for up to 26 weeks (1.4).

1.1 Erectile Dysfunction

Tadalafil tablets are indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).

1.2 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Tadalafil tablets are indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

1.3 Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Tadalafil tablets are indicated for the treatment of ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH (ED/BPH).

1.4 Limitation of Use

If tadalafil tablets are used with finasteride to initiate BPH treatment, such use is recommended for up to 26 weeks because the incremental benefit of tadalafil tablets decreases from 4 weeks until 26 weeks, and the incremental benefit of tadalafil tablets beyond 26 weeks is unknown [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

### Prostate cancer chemoprevention: update of the prostate cancer prevention trial findings and implications for clinical practice [^f6696707]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

This article updates the findings of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) based on recent publications and reviews of the PCPT. New evidence shows that finasteride reduces the overall risk of prostate cancer by 30% and reduces the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer, including high-grade tumors. For tumors with Gleason scores of ≤ 6, men in the finasteride arm had a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 34% (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.80; P ≤ 0.0001); tumors with Gleason scores of ≥ 7 had an RRR of 27% (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–0.96; P = 0.02). The effect of finasteride on sexual function appears to be minimal as men on finasteride had an average 3.21 point increase on the 100 point Sexual Activity Scale compared with men on placebo. With an excellent safety profile and minimal side effects, men aged 55 years or older should be informed of the opportunity to reduce their risk of prostate cancer with finasteride.

### The relationship among lower urinary tract symptoms, prostate specific antigen and erectile dysfunction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: results from the proscar long-term efficacy and safety study [^d4552fb9]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the associations among lower urinary tract symptoms, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with benign prostatic enlargement enrolled in the Proscar (Merck, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study.

Materials and Methods

The Proscar Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study was a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study that enrolled 3,040 men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and an enlarged prostate gland. Two questions assessed ED. A logistic regression model, including the effect of patient age, was used to examine the relationships among quasi-American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS), PSA, and ED at baseline. Changes in ED scores from baseline to study closeout were analyzed with ANOVA.

Results

A total of 2,981 patients had baseline data available for analysis. Mean age was 64 years, mean quasi-AUASS was 15, mean PSA was 2.8 ng/ml and mean prostate volume was 55 cm. At baseline every 1 point increase in quasi-AUASS was associated with a 2% increased risk of ED even after controlling for age (p < 0.001). At 48 months in placebo but not in finasteride treated men a 1-unit decrease in quasi-AUASS was associated with a slight but statistically significant decrease in ED. No association existed between increasing PSA and ED on baseline or longitudinal analysis.

Conclusions

We found a moderately strong association between baseline quasi-AUASS and the ED rate in men with an enlarged prostate, a finding that was supported by longitudinal data in the placebo arm. The absence of a relationship between PSA and ED highlights the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of benign prostatic hyperplasia related sexual dysfunction.

- depression

- decrease in sex drive that continued after stopping the medication

- in rare cases, male breast cancer has been reported.

You should discuss side effects with your doctor before taking finasteride tablets USP and anytime you think you are having a side effect. These are not all the possible side effects with finasteride tablets USP. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at: 1-800-FDA-1088.

 What you need to know while taking finasteride tablets USP:

- You should see your doctor regularly while taking finasteride tablets USP. Follow your doctor's advice about when to have these checkups.

- Checking for prostate cancer. Your doctor has prescribed finasteride tablets USP for BPH and not for treatment of prostate cancer — but a man can have BPH and prostate cancer at the same time. Your doctor may continue checking for prostate cancer while you take finasteride tablets USP.

- About Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). Your doctor may have done a blood test called PSA for the screening of prostate cancer. Because finasteride tablets USP decreases PSA levels, you should tell your doctor(s) that you are taking finasteride tablets USP. Changes in PSA levels will need to be evaluated by your doctor(s). Any increase in follow-up PSA levels from their lowest point may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if the test results are still within the normal range. You should also tell your doctor if you have not been taking finasteride tablets USP as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more information, talk to your doctor.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^b84fb516]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Implications of study results

Treating asymptomatic patients is not an uncommon approach in medicine. Primary prevention with drugs is used to prevent cardiovascular complications and to reduce the risk of cardiac events. While not as lethal, the 10 year cumulative risk of acute urinary retention is estimated to be twice that of stroke or myocardial infarction. Further, research has found an episode of urinary retention to have a substantial impact on patients' health related quality of life. Lower urinary tract symptoms affect almost three quarters men in their 60s, and direct costs in the US exceed $1bn a year, excluding outpatient prescription costs. For men found to have a large prostate gland during routine rectal examination or imaging, this information may be used to select those for whom preventive medication may improve their quality of life and also yield economic benefits.

The trade-offs to the patient in this scenario are the side effects and cost of treatment. Side effects (table 3) include erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and gynaecomastia. Despite a greater patient preference against sexual side effects among those with mild symptoms, trade-off questionnaires suggest men prefer 5α reductase inhibitors compared with no treatment or α blockers. The concern over risk of high grade prostate cancer remains an issue of controversy, though the incidence of high grade cancer seems to be lower relative to small prostate glands. The current drug costs of dutasteride per patient in the UK are £238 a year (€281, $365), with total direct costs estimated at £325 per year. A recent cost effectiveness study suggested that lifelong monotherapy with dutasteride in unselected patients has a cost per QALY gained of €7274. Our data suggest that its preventive use in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostates would have a lower cost per QALY, given the similar relative risk reduction used in this cost analysis and the significantly higher incidence of complications related to benign prostatic hyperplasia in our study population. By comparison, the estimated cost of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the NHS was £2080, and the estimated cost of one admission for acute urinary retention was £1040. However, cost effectiveness research to assess the use of dutasteride as a preventive agent in this population is unlikely to occur given that its patent expires in 2013. While some patients will not generally be receptive to preventive drug treatment, the magnitude of risk reduction seen in our study warrants further study of patient preferences for choosing optimal management. Certainly, the potential relative harms to each patient need to be discussed and weighed against the expected potential benefits.

### The effect of 5 α-reductase inhibition with dutasteride and finasteride on semen parameters and serum hormones in healthy men [^482d95d1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Dutasteride and finasteride are 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) that dramatically reduce serum levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Objective

Because androgens are essential for fertility, we sought to determine the impact of 5ARI administration on serum testosterone (T), DHT, and spermatogenesis. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 99 healthy men randomly assigned to receive dutasteride (D; 0.5 mg) (n = 33), finasteride (F; 5 mg) (n = 34), or placebo (n = 32) once daily for 1 yr.

Main Outcome Measures

Blood and semen samples were collected at baseline and 26 and 52 wk of treatment and 24 wk after treatment and were assessed for T, DHT, and semen parameters.

Results

D and F significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed serum DHT, compared with placebo (D, 94%; F, 73%) and transiently increased serum T. In both treatment groups, total sperm count, compared with baseline, was significantly decreased at 26 wk (D, -28.6%; F, -34.3%) but not at 52 wk (D, -24.9%; F, -16.2%) or the 24-wk follow-up (D, -23.3%; F, -6.2%). At 52 wk, semen volume was decreased (D, -29.7%; F, -14.5%, significantly for D) as was sperm concentration (D, -3.2%; F, -7.4%, neither significant). There was a significant reduction of -6 to 12% in sperm motility during treatment with both D and F and at follow-up. Neither treatment had any effect on sperm morphology.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the decrease in DHT induced by 5ARIs is associated with mild decreases in semen parameters that appear reversible after discontinuation.

### Allopregnanolone: an overview on its synthesis and effects [^1aedcee5]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Another interesting example of alteration in ALLO levels is represented by post‐finasteride syndrome (PFS). Finasteride (commercially named Propecia or Proscar) is an inhibitor of two isoforms of the 5α‐R (ie, type 1 and 2), although it has higher affinity for type 2 in humans. Approved in 1997 for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia at 1 mg day ‐1, this drug has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in the progression of baldness and the stimulation of new hair growth.5α‐R inhibitors have generally been described as well‐tolerated and relatively safe drugs; however, recent observations have led to a more critical re‐evaluation of these concepts (Figure 2). Indeed, 5α‐R inhibitors not only induced side effects during the treatment, but also they may persist after drug discontinuation inducing the so named PFS. Among these serious adverse side effects, there are sexual side effects (ie, low libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased arousal and difficulty in achieving orgasm), depression, anxiety and cognitive complaints. Data obtained in PFS patients show a decrease in the plasma levels of ALLO. It is interesting to note that, also in an experimental model of PFS, the plasma levels of this neuroactive steroid were decreased. This alteration was associated with a decrease in ALLO levels in the cerebral cortex, where a decrease in the gene expression of GABA A receptor α4 and β3 subunits was observed(Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels are decreased in plasma of PFS patients, as well as in its experimental model. In the male rat, the levels, as well as the GABA A receptor composition, are also modified in the cerebral cortex. For details, see text.

### Evaluation of long-term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system [^e74814c2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Progression after peak efficacy

Based on the IGA score, 26 (20.6%) patients experienced progression of alopecia after peak improvement during the treatment period. According to the BASP classification, the proportion of these patients was significantly different between the three types (Fig. 5, P = 0.000). Six patients in the V type (10.3%) experienced progression after improvement; one patient (1.7%) after 2 years, two patients (3.4%) after 3 years and three patients (5.2%) after 5 years of starting the treatment. Six patients of the F type (16.2%) experienced progression of alopecia after initial improvement; one patient (2.7%) after 2 years, two patients (5.4%) after 3 years and three patients (8.1%) after 5 years of starting the treatment. Conversely, there was no case showing the progression of alopecia after peak improvement in the basic type.

Adverse events

According to the review of patients' medical records, 12 patients (9.5%) experienced adverse events during the treatment period. Among them, 10 patients (7.9%) reported sexually related symptoms: four (3.1%) with decreased libido, three (2.4%) with erectile dysfunction and three (2.4%) with decreased semen volume or watery semen. Additionally, liver function abnormality (n = 1, 0.8%), gastrointestinal trouble (n = 1, 0.8%) and gynecomastia (n = 1, 0.8%) were also reported. Six cases (4.8%) developed adverse events within the first 6 months of the treatment period. Most of the adverse events were mild and subsided spontaneously without treatment. One case with abnormality of liver function and two cases with sexual dysfunction stopped the treatment temporally (1–3 months).

### Could erectile dysfunction be a side effect of CGRP inhibition? A case report [^82338d02]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case report raises the question whether erectile dysfunction could be linked to the CGRP inhibiting effect of galcanezumab. In this case, the reversibility of erectile dysfunction after cessation of galcanezumab treatment hints towards a causal association between the use of galcanezumab and erectile dysfunction. Although the patient used metoprolol, if needed, for the treatment of palpitations, we assume it is unlikely that this medication could have triggered or altered his erectile dysfunction. Indeed, he had only taken one tablet on one single day during the entire episode of the erectile dysfunction. Therefore, we believe that no correlation exists with the onset of his erectile dysfunction.

Galcanezumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody which targets CGRP and, therefore, prohibits binding of CGRP to its receptor. It has demonstrated its efficacy in both episodic and chronic migraine patients. Moreover, a recently published phase 3b multicenter trial, CONQUER, demonstrated that galcanezumab was superior and safe compared to placebo in migraine patients in whom previous standard-of-care preventive medication was not effective. Besides, it has been shown to be an effective prophylaxis in patients suffering from episodic cluster headache.

Few serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in these trials (below 2%), and most of adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate. The most common AEs which were significantly more often reported in galcanezumab versus placebo users include: injection site reaction, including erythema and pruritus, and upper respiratory tract infection. However, clinical trials are powered to detect differences in efficacy rather than AEs between the two arms. Besides, men are typically underrepresented in migraine trials considering the higher prevalence of migraine in women. Therefore, it is of importance to monitor AEs of new drugs in real-life settings, when possible with a more active approach toward known or potential adverse effects. For example, reduction of erectile function may not be reported spontaneously.

From a theoretical perspective, male erectile dysfunction or impotence is a conceivable side effect associated with blockade of the actions of CGRP. CGRP is an ubiquitous and potent vasodilator, which – besides its role in the migraine pathophysiology – is involved in mammalian penile erection.

### The gut-microbiota-brain axis: focus on gut steroids [^dfaf72ec]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON GUT STEROIDS AND MICROBIOTA

6.1 The case of finasteride

Finasteride (or Propecia) is a drug prescribed for androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a disorder characterized by high DHT levels that lead to miniaturization of the hair bulb and hair loss. The drug mechanism of action consists of the inhibition of the enzyme 5α‐R2, which mainly converts T into DHT in the skin. Apparently safe and effective, during the treatment, some patients experience fluctuations of mood, anxiety and depressive states associated with erectile dysfunction and low libido, which negatively affect their lives. Patients, who manifest persistent side effects after finasteride suspension are collectively named as post‐finasteride syndrome (PFS) patients. A clinical study reported that in PFS patients, persistent alterations of steroid levels both in plasma and in cerebral spinal fluid were associated with andrological and psychiatric features. In addition, as demonstrated in the PFS animal model, this drug treatment and withdrawal induced altered levels of steroids not only in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid but also in the brain. Interestingly, a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis of fecal samples from PFS patients detected a specific modification in gut microbiota community composition, suggesting a potential role in the etiopathology of this syndrome. Specifically, the α‐diversity was significantly lower in the PFS group versus healthy controls, suggesting a reduction in the richness of fecal samples with a specific taxonomic profile. In agreement, gut microbiota alterations have been reported in an experimental model of PFS. The effect of finasteride treatment and its withdrawal were also evaluated on the gut steroid levels. As previously reported, finasteride treatment not only decreased DHT levels as expected but also the levels of its active androgen metabolite 3α‐diol with a significant increase in T levels. Of note, a significant reduction in ALLO was observed in the colon of PFS rats, which persisted even after 1 month of withdrawal. In addition, the persistent decrease in ALLO levels was instead associated with an increase in PREG levels, suggesting a local relationship between these two steroid molecules.

### Long-term (7 to 8-year) experience with finasteride in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^4a4ab957]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of finasteride, a specific type II 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, on symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate volume, and urinary flow during a 7 to 8-year period.

Methods

A total of 190 men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and enlarged prostates entered one of two Phase II double-blind 3 to 6-month studies. Of these, 156 patients continued taking open-label finasteride, and more than 70 patients completed 7 to 8 years of treatment. The symptoms were scored using a patient self-administered modified Boyarsky symptom questionnaire. Prostate volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography, and the maximal urinary flow rate was assessed noninvasively.

Results

Treatment with finasteride for 7 to 8 years led to sustained improvement in symptoms, reduction in prostate volume (28% from baseline), and increased urinary flow (median 2.5 mL/s from baseline). Decreases in dihydrotestosterone (86%) and prostate-specific antigen (54%) levels were also maintained. Long-term finasteride treatment was safe and generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with finasteride was well tolerated and resulted in durable symptom relief and improvement in prostate volume and urinary flow.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^58144174]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients in PLESS had moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (mean of approximately 15 points on a 0–34 point scale). Patients randomized to PROSCAR who remained on therapy for 4 years had a mean (± 1 SD) decrease in symptom score of 3.3 (± 5.8) points compared with 1.3 (± 5.6) points in the placebo group. (See Figure 1 .) A statistically significant improvement in symptom score was evident at 1 year in patients treated with PROSCAR vs placebo (–2.3 vs –1.6), and this improvement continued through Year 4.

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in PLESS. Although an early improvement in urinary symptoms was seen in some patients, a therapeutic trial of at least 6 months was generally necessary to assess whether a beneficial response in symptom relief had been achieved. The improvement in BPH symptoms was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.

Effect on Acute Urinary Retention and the Need for Surgery

In PLESS, efficacy was also assessed by evaluating treatment failures. Treatment failure was prospectively defined as BPH-related urological events or clinical deterioration, lack of improvement and/or the need for alternative therapy. BPH-related urological events were defined as urological surgical intervention and acute urinary retention requiring catheterization. Complete event information was available for 92% of the patients. The following table (Table 5) summarizes the results.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha‑reductase inhibitors (5‑ARI) — dosing, PSA threshold, and pharmacology are as follows: providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5‑ARI response, and a minimum threshold PSA 1.5ng/mL is advised when initiating therapy; approved doses are finasteride 5 mg daily and dutasteride 0.5 mg tablet daily. Finasteride inhibits 5‑AR type II while dutasteride inhibits types I and II; serum dihydrotestosterone reduction is approximately 70% with finasteride versus approximately 95% with dutasteride, with prostate tissue reductions approximately 80% (finasteride) and approximately 94% (dutasteride). The serum half‑life of finasteride ranges from six to eight hours, whereas that of dutasteride is five weeks.

Cyproterone acetate

Cyproterone acetate (CPA), a steroidal anti-androgen, acts by blocking androgen receptors and causes a centrally mediated reduction in testicular secretion of androgens by suppressing LH. There is scarce evidence for its use and only a single case report by Alshahrani is available in the current literature. He reported that a three-week course of 50 mg CPA daily, subsequently reduced to a once-a-week 50 mg dose helped to prevent further IP episodes for the next two years. In this case the patient had a normal erection with minimal side effect, though adverse effects can occur which include reduced libido, gynaecomastia, a loss of normal functional erections, hot flushes and more rarely cardiovascular disturbances, thromboembolism. Meningioma has also been reported, but the risk is increased with higher cumulative doses.

With the potential for serious adverse events related to the side-effect profile of CPA, its use is largely limited to short treatment durations in the well-informed and agreeable patients.

5-α reductase inhibitors

Testosterone within the body is converted to its more potent form dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-α reductase (5AR) which are inhibited by finasteride and dutasteride. Both are associated with side-effects such as gynaecomastia, ED, reduced libido and low mood among others.

Rachid-Filho et al. used finasteride in 35 SCD patients with SP occurring more than twice a week of at least 40 minutes duration. They used a finasteride reduction treatment regime of 5 mg once-a-day (OD) for 40 days then 3 mg OD for following 40 days then 1 mg OD for the final 40 days and reported a reduction in the frequency of SP episodes from a mean of 22.7 down to 2.1 episodes over 120 days. Similarly, a retrospective study by Baker et al. assessed the effectiveness of dutasteride in preventing SP in 13 patients, of which only 4 had SCD. They found 3/4 (75%) SCD patients compared to 2/9 (22%) of non- SCD required progression to aggressive treatments such as androgen deprivation therapy and penile prosthesis, suggesting dutasteride may be more efficacious for non-SCD patients. However, as the study was significantly underpowered, no strong conclusions could be drawn about the clinical utility of dutasteride in SCD.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In volunteer trials, single doses of dutasteride up to 40 mg (80 times the therapeutic dose) for 7 days have been administered without significant safety concerns. In a clinical trial, daily doses of 5 mg (10 times the therapeutic dose) were administered to 60 subjects for 6 months with no additional adverse effects to those seen at therapeutic doses of 0.5 mg.

There is no specific antidote for dutasteride. Therefore, in cases of suspected overdosage, symptomatic and supportive treatment should be given as appropriate, taking the long half-life of dutasteride into consideration.

### Longitudinal analysis of sexual function reported by men in the prostate cancer prevention trial [^16b51dbb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of finasteride in preventing prostate cancer in 18,882 men aged 55 years or older. The PCPT offered an opportunity to prospectively study the effects of finasteride and other covariates on sexual dysfunction.

Methods

We assessed sexual dysfunction in 17,313 PCPT participants during a 7-year period. A battery of questionnaires assessed sexual dysfunction (Sexual Activity Scale score); age; race; SF-36 Mental Health Inventory-5, Physical Function, and Vitality scores; body mass index; smoking status; and the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Assessments began at month 6 after random assignment and included the Sexual Activity Scale score at randomization as a covariate. Two-sided general t tests, with a cutoff of P value less than .05, were used to determine the statistical significance for mixed model effects with correlated random time slopes and intercepts. The changing impact of covariates on sexual dysfunction was also assessed at 6 months, 3.5 years, and 6.5 years after randomization.

Results

Finasteride increased sexual dysfunction only slightly and its impact diminished over time; the increase in the Sexual Activity Scale score relative to placebo of 3.21 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.83 to 3.59 points; P < .001) at the first assessment decreased to 2.11 points (95% CI = 1.44 to 2.81 points; P < .001) at the end of study. These Sexual Activity score values were small on a scale of 0–100, the range observed in the study, and in comparison with individual variation. After adjustment for all covariates, mean sexual dysfunction increased in both arms from baseline (6 months after randomization) by 1.26 Sexual Activity points (95% CI = 1.16 to 1.36 points; P < .001) per year, corresponding to a cumulative increase of 8.22 points (95% CI = 7.52 to 8.92 points; P < .001) over the study period.

Conclusions

The effect of finasteride on sexual functioning is minimal for most men and should not impact the decision to prescribe or take finasteride.

### The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer [^1456acf8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Androgens are involved in the development of prostate cancer. Finasteride, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase, inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the primary androgen in the prostate, and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

Methods

In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, we randomly assigned 18,882 men 55 years of age or older with a normal digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 3.0 ng per milliliter or lower to treatment with finasteride (5 mg per day) or placebo for seven years. Prostate biopsy was recommended if the annual PSA level, adjusted for the effect of finasteride, exceeded 4.0 ng per milliliter or if the digital rectal examination was abnormal. It was anticipated that 60 percent of participants would have prostate cancer diagnosed during the study or would undergo biopsy at the end of the study. The primary end point was the prevalence of prostate cancer during the seven years of the study.

Results

Prostate cancer was detected in 803 of the 4368 men in the finasteride group who had data for the final analysis (18.4 percent) and 1147 of the 4692 men in the placebo group who had such data (24.4 percent), for a 24.8 percent reduction in prevalence over the seven-year period (95 percent confidence interval, 18.6 to 30.6 percent; P < 0.001). Tumors of Gleason grade 7, 8, 9, or 10 were more common in the finasteride group (280 of 757 tumors [37.0 percent], or 6.4 percent of the 4368 men included in the final analysis) than in the placebo group (237 of 1068 tumors [22.2 percent], P < 0.001 for the comparison between groups; or 5.1 percent of the 4692 men included in the final analysis, P = 0.005 for the comparison between groups). Sexual side effects were more common in finasteride-treated men, whereas urinary symptoms were more common in men receiving placebo.

Conclusions

Finasteride prevents or delays the appearance of prostate cancer, but this possible benefit and a reduced risk of urinary problems must be weighed against sexual side effects and the increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer.

In clinical studies, single doses of finasteride up to 400 mg and multiple doses of finasteride up to 80 mg/day for three months did not result in adverse reactions. Until further experience is obtained, no specific treatment for an overdose with finasteride can be recommended.

Significant lethality was observed in male and female mice at single oral doses of 1500 mg/m2(500 mg/kg) and in female and male rats at single oral doses of 2360 mg/m2(400 mg/kg) and 5900 mg/m2(1000 mg/kg), respectively.

### Could erectile dysfunction be a side effect of CGRP inhibition? A case report [^8c956df1]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, we suggest that clinicians pay attention to the occurrence of erectile dysfunction as a potential side effect of (prophylactic) antimigraine drugs which target CGRP or its receptor, namely gepants and monoclonal antibodies (including galcanezumab). In patients with this potential side effect, especially when no other plausible explanation for their impotence is found, we recommend that a causal relationship is explored further by stopping the administration of the antimigraine drug. In addition, further studies are warranted to relate this potential side effect to CGRP levels in plasma, assessed longitudinally before, within and after the therapy – although systemic levels are not necessarily completely indicative for locally released CGRP. Finally, a screening and cardiovascular follow-up of migraine patients with established erectile dysfunction after these antimigraine drugs might be recommended in view of the relationship between erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. While the burden of migraine should definitely not be overlooked, attention should be also paid to the influence of erectile dysfunction as a possible side effect on the quality of life in male patients. Yet, in this respect, we want to emphasize that the first step would be to conduct further research to either confirm or refute a causal relationship between these antimigraine drugs and erectile dysfunction, which cannot be established based on this single report.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^9159259b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — finasteride outcomes and recommendation: (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The Proscar Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled U.S. trial, randomized more than 3,000 men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and an enlarged prostate on digital rectal examination (DRE) to finasteride 5 mg/day or placebo; over the 4-year study period, 10% of the 1,516 men on placebo underwent surgery for BPH versus 5% of the 1,524 men on finasteride (a 55% reduction), and acute urinary retention (AUR) developed in approximately 7% versus approximately 3% (a 57% reduction). Finasteride produced a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with a 3.3-fold reduction versus a 1.3 reduction on placebo, improved urinary flow rates, and significantly (p < 0.001) reduced prostate volume; the study suggests that long-term medical therapy could impact the natural history of BPH as manifested by AUR and surgery.

### Controversies in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia: the history of finasteride [^9032028d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Male androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects up to 60% of men by the age of 50. Currently, there are only two approved drugs for the treatment of male AGA: topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. Topical minoxidil is readily available over the counter and has a well-established safety record. However, following 24weeks of treatment, less than 40% of men respond to the drug. Additionally, due to the topical route of administration, compliance with minoxidil remains low. In contrast, oral finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in arresting hair loss in more than 80% of patients following 12months of treatment. However, controversy surrounding potential adverse sexual side effects has negatively affected public perception of the drug and may significantly reduce the number of patients that can benefit from the drug.

### Finasteride (Proscar) [^c1caf199]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of PROSCAR produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of PROSCAR at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10–20% but remained within the physiologic range. In a separate study in healthy men treated with finasteride 1 mg per day (n = 82) or placebo (n = 69), mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.

In patients receiving PROSCAR 5 mg/day, increases of about 10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but levels remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with PROSCAR did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected.

In patients with BPH, PROSCAR has no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine. No clinically meaningful effect was observed on the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.

Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α-reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH.

In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1–100 mg/day) for 7–10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of PSA was also decreased.

In healthy male volunteers treated with PROSCAR for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.

Fig 1 Absolute rates and relative risk reduction for acute urinary retention, surgery related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, and clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia among 1617 asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate glands who were randomised to treatment with dutasteride or placebo

In our time-to-event analysis, 426 patients had two consecutive International Prostate Severity Scale (IPSS) scores ≥ 4 points greater than baseline score. Figure 2shows the time to first event indicating progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (acute urinary retention, surgery related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract infection, or symptomatic progression) for both groups. The hazard ratio for clinical progression among those randomised to dutasteride was 0.673 (P < 0.001) relative to placebo. Other significant predictors of reaching the composite end point were baseline prostate volume (hazard ratio 1.007, P = 0.008), baseline IPSS score (hazard ratio 0.958, P = 0.046), and baseline urinary flow rate (hazard ratio 0.966 P < 0.001).

### Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7a312167]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms (intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library (which includes CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Heath Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and which includes EMBASE and MEDLINE), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) and Google Scholar for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated, urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of ≤ 1 year (short term) and > 1 year (long term).

Main Results

Finasteride consistently improved urinary symptom scores more than placebo in trials of > 1 year duration, and significantly lowered the risk of BPH progression (acute urinary retention, risk of surgical intervention, ≥ 4 point increase in the AUASI/IPSS). In comparison to alpha-blocker monotherapy, finasteride was less effective than either doxazosin or terazosin, but equally effective compared to tamsulosin. Both doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more likely than finasteride to improve peak urine flow and nocturia, versus finasteride. Versus tamsulosin, peak urine flow and QoL improved equally well versus finasteride. However, finasteride was associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention compared to doxazosin, but not to terazosin, while finasteride and doxazosin were no different for risk of acute urinary retention. Two small trials reported no difference in urinary symptom scores between finasteride and tamsulosin. Finasteride + doxazosin and doxazosin monotherapy improved urinary symptoms equally well (≥ 4 point improvement). For finasteride, there was an increased risk of ejaculation disorder, impotence, and lowered libido, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, finasteride had a lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension, and versus terazosin, finasteride had a significant, lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension.

Authors' Conclusions

Finasteride improves long-term urinary symptoms versus placebo, but is less effective than doxazosin. Long-term combination therapy with alpha blockers (doxazosin, terazosin) improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy. Finasteride + doxazosin improves symptoms equally - and clinically - to doxazosin alone. In comparison to doxazosin, finasteride + doxazosin appears to improve urinary symptoms only in men with medium (25 to < 40 mL) or large prostates (≥ 40 mL), but not in men with small prostates (25 mL). Comparing short to long-term therapy, finasteride does not improve symptoms significantly better than placebo at the short term, but in the long term it does, although the magnitude of differences was very small (from < 1.0 point to 2.2 points). Doxazosin improves symptoms better than finasteride both short and long term, with the magnitude of differences ∼2.0 points and 1.0 point, respectively. Finasteride + doxazosin improves scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term, with mean differences ∼2.0 points for both time points. Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin improves scores equally for short and long term. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, which has higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder. Finasteride significantly reduces asthenia, postural hypotension, and dizziness versus terazosin. Finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride + terazosin.

Effect on Prostate Volume

In PLESS, prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with PROSCAR who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study. PROSCAR decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 cc at baseline to 45.8 cc at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 cc to 58.5 cc) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). (See Figure 4 .)

Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in PLESS. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40–50 cc. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.

Prostate Volume as a Predictor of Therapeutic Response

A meta-analysis combining 1-year data from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of similar design, including 4491 patients with symptomatic BPH, demonstrated that, in patients treated with PROSCAR, the magnitude of symptom response and degree of improvement in maximum urinary flow rate were greater in patients with an enlarged prostate at baseline.

### Could erectile dysfunction be a side effect of CGRP inhibition? A case report [^aac7d87d]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, antimigraine drugs targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway have been approved for clinical use as preventive migraine medication.

Case Report

We present a case of a 54-year-old male migraine patient, who reported erectile dysfunction as a possible side effect of treatment with galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide. His potency recovered after treatment discontinuation.

Discussion

As calcitonin gene-related peptide is involved in mammalian penile erection, erectile dysfunction is a conceivable side effect associated with calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibition. Postmarketing surveillance will elucidate the actual incidence of erectile dysfunction in patients using these new antimigraine drugs, and determine whether a causal relationship between calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibition and erectile dysfunction exists. This would be relevant not only because of the direct sexual consequences of erectile dysfunction, but also considering the potential cardiovascular consequences of calcitonin gene-related peptide (receptor) blockade and the association of both migraine and erectile dysfunction with cardiovascular disease.

Conclusion

Erectile dysfunction might be an overlooked, but reversible side effect in male migraine patients using monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway, including galcanezumab. This paper may raise clinical awareness and suggest that this potential side effect needs to be studied further.
