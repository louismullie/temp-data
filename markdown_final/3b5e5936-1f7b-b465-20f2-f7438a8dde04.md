## Question

Best antibiotic for acute sinusitis in elderly patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best antibiotic for acute sinusitis in an elderly patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis versus viral or noninfectious causes. Then, I should verify whether watchful waiting is appropriate or if antibiotics are indicated now. Next, I will consider age-related risk factors that modify antibiotic choice and dosing. After that, I need to select the first-line agent and dose, including whether to use amoxicillin alone or amoxicillin–clavulanate. Finally, I should confirm duration, monitoring, and what to do if there is no improvement, while double-checking for penicillin allergy and drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults, because I need to ensure we are treating true ABRS and not a viral URI. ABRS is presumed when symptoms persist without improvement for at least 10 days, or worsen after initial improvement within 10 days, or are severe at onset with fever 39°C or higher plus purulent nasal discharge or facial pain for at least 3–4 consecutive days, and I should explicitly exclude complications or alternative diagnoses before labeling this as uncomplicated ABRS [^9201df28] [^e3747a0e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should verify whether watchful waiting is appropriate here. Current guidelines recommend watchful waiting without antibiotics as an acceptable initial strategy for uncomplicated ABRS when follow-up is assured, with a typical window of 3–5 days from diagnosis before reconsidering antibiotics, and this applies to older adults as well unless they have severe disease or high-risk features, so I need to check severity, comorbidities, and reliability of follow-up before deciding [^f2161b54] [^84d62a4c] [^cffbd70f].

> Next, I should review age-related modifiers. Being older than 65 years increases the risk of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, so I need to consider broader coverage and, in some cases, higher dosing; I initially thought this meant all patients over 65 should automatically get high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate, but wait, let me verify the nuance here, because IDSA places age ≥ 65 among factors prompting consideration of high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate, whereas the AAO-HNS update emphasizes amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line for most adults and reserves high-dose regimens for selected high-risk scenarios, so I should align the choice with severity, recent antibiotics, and local resistance patterns rather than age alone [^68047c96] [^77ac194a] [^e674ee33] [^5044ac90].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. For most adults with uncomplicated ABRS, amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate for 5–7 days is recommended, with amoxicillin favored when illness is mild to moderate and there are no recent antibiotics or high-risk features, and amoxicillin–clavulanate favored when there are risk factors for resistance, moderate to severe infection, or comorbidities; I should confirm that this applies to older adults as well, and yes, the AAO-HNS update supports 5–7 days of amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line for most adults, including older adults, with shared decision-making about watchful waiting versus immediate therapy [^e674ee33] [^ba999865] [^46755339].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for resistant pneumococcus or has severe infection? In that scenario, I should consider high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate, specifically amoxicillin 2 g with clavulanate 125 mg twice daily, which IDSA supports for adults with severe infection, recent beta-lactam exposure, or in regions with high endemic rates of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae; I need to ensure renal function is adequate before using higher doses and monitor tolerability, especially for gastrointestinal adverse effects [^68047c96] [^77ac194a].

> Let me think about duration, because overtreatment is common. I should confirm that 5–7 days is sufficient for most adults; indeed, multiple high-quality sources endorse 5–7 days instead of 10 days, noting similar clinical success and fewer adverse events with shorter courses, so I will target 5–7 days unless the patient is severely ill or improving slowly, in which case extending toward 7–10 days may be reasonable with reassessment [^e674ee33] [^c3b2a7aa] [^9b709bd3].

> I should double-check penicillin allergy before finalizing. If there is a true immediate hypersensitivity, doxycycline is a reasonable alternative for adults, whereas macrolides should be avoided due to high resistance in S. pneumoniae and safety concerns; if there is a non–type I allergy, a cephalosporin may be considered, but I need to confirm the allergy phenotype and local resistance patterns before choosing [^0f250053] [^cb74a15f].

> Next, I should review monitoring and what to do if the patient does not improve. If there is clinical worsening or no improvement after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy, I need to reassess the diagnosis, consider complications, and switch therapy; options include high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate if not already used, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if there is no alternative, recognizing the FDA boxed warnings and reserving fluoroquinolones for patients with no suitable alternatives; I should also consider imaging or ENT referral if symptoms persist beyond 21–28 days or if complications are suspected [^c02e2d71] [^7fa8adcc] [^9aea67a4].

> Putting this together for a typical elderly patient with uncomplicated, mild to moderate ABRS and no recent antibiotics or high-risk features, I would recommend watchful waiting with close follow-up, and if antibiotics are chosen or if symptoms persist or worsen, amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily or 875 mg twice daily for 5–7 days is appropriate; if there are risk factors for resistance, moderate to severe disease, or comorbidities, I would use amoxicillin–clavulanate 500/125 mg three times daily or 875/125 mg twice daily for 5–7 days, reserving high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate for severe infection or high-risk scenarios and ensuring renal dosing adjustments as needed [^e674ee33] [^46755339] [^68047c96].

---

For elderly patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, **amoxicillin–clavulanate is first-line** [^e674ee33] because it covers common pathogens and beta-lactamase producers, with a 5–7 day course to balance efficacy and minimize adverse effects [^c3b2a7aa]. Use **high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate (2 g/125 mg PO BID)** if there is severe infection, recent beta-lactam use, or high local resistance risk [^68047c96] [^77ac194a]. For penicillin allergy, doxycycline is preferred; avoid fluoroquinolones unless no alternatives exist due to safety concerns [^0f250053] [^9aea67a4]. Monitor closely for adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal upset and C. difficile, and reassess at 3–5 days if no improvement [^c02e2d71].

---

## Recommended first-line antibiotic therapy

- **Amoxicillin–clavulanate**: Preferred first-line therapy for elderly patients with ABRS [^e674ee33] [^ba999865].
- **Rationale**: Covers Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase producers [^notfound].
- **Dosage**: 500/125 mg PO TID or 875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days [^e674ee33] [^c3b2a7aa].

---

## Indications for high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate

High-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate (2 g/125 mg PO BID) is indicated for elderly patients with any of the following:

- **Severe infection**: Systemic toxicity (fever ≥ 39°C) or threat of suppurative complications [^68047c96] [^77ac194a].
- **Recent antibiotic use**: Beta-lactam therapy within the past month [^68047c96] [^77ac194a].
- **High resistance risk**: Local prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae ≥ 10% [^68047c96] [^77ac194a].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy for penicillin allergy

For patients with a true penicillin allergy, **doxycycline** is the preferred alternative [^0f250053]. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are **not recommended** for routine first-line therapy due to significant adverse effects and should be reserved for patients with no alternatives [^9aea67a4].

---

## Clinical considerations in elderly patients

- **Adverse effects**: Elderly patients have a higher risk of gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and C. difficile infection; monitor closely [^c3b2a7aa].
- **Drug interactions**: Review medications for potential interactions, especially with warfarin, digoxin, and diuretics.
- **Renal function**: Adjust dosing based on creatinine clearance to avoid accumulation and toxicity [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess at **3–5 days**; if there is no improvement, confirm the diagnosis, exclude other causes, and consider changing therapy or obtaining cultures [^c02e2d71] [^7fa8adcc]. Educate patients on expected course, adverse effects, and when to seek care for worsening symptoms [^5f8aa2d7].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated ABRS in elderly | Amoxicillin–clavulanate | 500/125 mg PO TID or 875/125 mg PO BID | 5–7 days [^e674ee33] [^c3b2a7aa] |
| Severe infection or high resistance risk | High-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate | 2 g/125 mg PO BID | 5–7 days [^68047c96] [^77ac194a] |
| Penicillin allergy | Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID | 5–7 days [^notfound] |

---

Amoxicillin–clavulanate is **first-line** for elderly patients with ABRS, with high-dose reserved for severe infection or high resistance risk; monitor closely for adverse effects and reassess at 3–5 days if no improvement.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^f8df4b9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to see whether or not the treatment was a failure. In meta-analysing the placebo-controlled studies, the data across antibiotic classes were combined. Primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow up.

Main Results

Fifty-seven studies were included in the review; six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days follow up. These studies found a slight statistical difference in favor of antibiotics, compared to placebo, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98). However, the clinical significance of the result is equivocal, also considering that cure or improvement rate was high in both the placebo group (80%) and the antibiotic group (90%). Based on six studies, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of total cure, there was significant difference in favor of antibiotics compared to placebo with a pooled RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.84) at 7 to 15 days follow up. None of the antibiotic preparations was superior to each other.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. However, 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improve within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population level.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^c0975a90]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^f7f6a5e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^250c0f9f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^385f5219]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^72938921]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^f2161b54]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — initial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states: "Clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up", and "The duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made". Evidence qualifiers include "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A", "Level of Confidence in Evidence: Medium", and "Policy level: Recommendation". The update specifies "reduced watchful waiting to 3 to 5 days duration from time of diagnosis", while prior guidance "endorsed watchful waiting without an antibiotic… even when signs and symptoms had persisted for 10 days or longer". Patient preference has a "Large role for shared decision-making for watchful waiting vs. antibiotic therapy". Exceptions include "Complicated sinusitis, immune deficiency, or coexisting bacterial illness", and the clinician should consider age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, co-morbid conditions, and factors suggesting "severe" disease when assessing suitability; the guideline notes "the strengthening of the recommendation of watchful waiting to the default initial therapy", with allowance to differ "when the clinician believes that 'severe' disease requires antibiotic therapy".

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^f347cf0c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^cf95e123]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^546dbd37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes, for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics (n of 17), where n is the number of trials. Most trials were conducted in otolaryngology settings. Only 8 trials described adequate allocation and concealment procedures; 20 were double-blind. Compared to control, penicillin improved clinical cures [relative risk (RR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.96]. Treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly improve cure rates (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 6.53) but there was significant variability between studies. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. Comparisons between classes of antibiotics showed no significant differences: newer non-penicillins versus penicillins (RR for cure 1.07; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17); newer non-penicillins versus amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR for cure 1.03; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, dropouts due to adverse effects were significantly lower for cephalosporin antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73). Relapse rates within one month of successful therapy were 7.7%.

Reviewer's Conclusions

For acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Clinicians should weigh the moderate benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotic selection for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) indicates that if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. Recommendation.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^00962b5c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^05bcd911]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^4912c1a7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Antibiotic therapy duration in US adults with sinusitis | Less is more… [^3b1ddaf3]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sinusitis is the most common condition for which outpatient antibiotic therapy is prescribed in the United States. 1 Sinusitis antibiotic stewardship efforts have largely focused on whether to prescribe antibiotics and on the selection of appropriate antibiotics. 1, 2 When antibiotics are indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, the Infectious Diseases Society of America evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of therapy for patients with a low risk of antibiotic resistance who have a favorable response to initial therapy. 3 Guideline-concordant treatment duration may represent a stewardship opportunity. More than two-thirds of antibiotic courses and 91% of nonazithromycin antibiotic courses prescribed for the treatment of acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, even though the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5 to 7 days of therapy for uncomplicated cases.

3 Notably, no penicillin or tetracycline prescriptions were for 5-day courses, and only 5% of antibiotic prescriptions were for 7-day courses of penicillins, tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones. Although 7- to 10-day courses are recommended for patients at high risk or who have experienced failure of initial treatment, 3 it is unlikely that such cases represent most patients in our study. Earlier work has shown that 90% of patients with sinusitis that is treated with antibiotics do not require additional antibiotic therapy. 4 Shorter durations of antibiotic therapy for sinusitis have been associated with similar outcomes and fewer drug-related adverse events compared with longer durations.
5. Greater than 20% of prescriptions were for a 5-day course of azithromycin, a course that clinicians and patients often find convenient.

However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America explicitly recommends against the use of azithromycin for the treatment of sinusitis because of its known association with the development of drug resistance. 3 In addition, because of high and persistent concentrations of azithromycin in tissue, 5 days of azithromycin therapy approximates 10 days of erythromycin therapy; therefore, a shorter course of treatment with azithromycin does not involve a shorter duration of antibiotic exposure.
6. Outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs can optimize infection management by ensuring guideline-concordant treatment, including the use of minimum effective durations of antibiotic therapy. The durations of most courses of antibiotic therapy for adult outpatients with sinusitis exceed guideline recommendations, which represents an opportunity to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics when therapy with antibiotics is indicated.

Each year, around 20 in every 1,000 people in the UK consult their GP about a suspected sinus infection,1 which means that each GP sees an average of about 50 such cases annually.2 Although most people recover from acute sinusitis with or without treatment within 10 days of seeing a GP,2 it is estimated that around 92% of those who consult their GP with a sinus infection are prescribed an antibacterial.1 Here we review the management of patients with acute sinusitis, and the place of antibacterial and other treatments.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^8695a992]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^b79a5be6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Antibiotics for adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^688a248f]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary-care physicians continue to overprescribe antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis because distinction between viral and bacterial sinus infection is difficult. We undertook a meta-analysis of randomised trials based on individual patients' data to assess whether common signs and symptoms can be used to identify a subgroup of patients who benefit from antibiotics.

Methods

We identified suitable trials — in which adult patients with rhinosinusitis-like complaints were randomly assigned to treatment with an antibiotic or a placebo — by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, and reference lists of reports describing such trials. Individual patients' data from 2547 adults in nine trials were checked and re-analysed. We assessed the overall effect of antibiotic treatment and the prognostic value of common signs and symptoms by the number needed to treat (NNT) with antibiotics to cure one additional patient.

Findings

15 patients with rhinosinusitis-like complaints would have to be given antibiotics before an additional patient was cured (95% CI NNT[benefit] 7 to NNT[harm] 190). Patients with purulent discharge in the pharynx took longer to cure than those without this sign; the NNT was 8 patients with this sign before one additional patient was cured (95% CI NNT[benefit] 4 to NNT[harm] 47). Patients who were older, reported symptoms for longer, or reported more severe symptoms also took longer to cure but were no more likely to benefit from antibiotics than other patients.

Interpretation

Common clinical signs and symptoms cannot identify patients with rhinosinusitis for whom treatment is clearly justified. Antibiotics are not justified even if a patient reports symptoms for longer than 7–10 days.

Read the full recommendation which includes a treatment algorithm and more information about antibiotic choices. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections in adults: background [^32f8eea8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^6757e8cb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^2141c357]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis update — evidence for placebo versus antibiotic therapy and delayed prescription: In an RCT of delayed versus immediate or no antibiotic treatment in 405 adults with acute uncomplicated respiratory infections (20% with acute rhinosinusitis), delayed strategies resulted in similar symptom burden and duration but significantly reduced antibiotic use and associated adverse events; a systematic review of 11 studies confirmed these findings, and another review included 15 RCTs with the caveat that only ~50% of clinically diagnosed ABRS had positive bacterial cultures, while in adults spontaneous recovery with placebo or no treatment is common (46% after 1 week and 64% after 2 weeks), serious complications are rare (0.57–5.89 per 10,000 cases), antibiotic treatment provides only marginal benefit (NNTB = 18), and adverse events are more frequent with antibiotics (13 per 100 more compared to placebo or no treatment, NNTH = 8).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^84d62a4c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — initial management of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states that clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up, and that the duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made. Recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c3b2a7aa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — antibiotic duration and adverse events: the guideline recommends 5 to 7 days of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected ABRS instead of 5 to 10 days, citing a systematic review finding no difference in clinical success for antibiotics given for 3 to 7 days versus 6 to 10 days and similar success when 5 days were compared with 10 days; adverse events are common with antibiotic therapy with an average event rate of 15% to 40%, and antibiotic therapy increases adverse event rate on average by 10% to 12% over placebo with an odds ratio of 1.8 to 2.1; the incidence of adverse events is lower when antibiotics are given for 5 days instead of 10 days (odds ratio, 0.79), so short courses should be considered for patients with less severe illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^cffbd70f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis update — criteria to start antibiotics after watchful waiting: Prolonged duration of symptoms without improvement increases the likelihood of bacterial presence, and a decision to initiate antibiotic therapy may be considered if the patient's clinical condition worsens or fails to improve after 3 to 5 days of watchful waiting.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e3747a0e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult rhinosinusitis scope and definitions — the target patient for this guideline is aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, where rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is defined as rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension of inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity at the time of diagnosis. Rhinosinusitis may be classified by duration as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if less than 4 weeks' duration, or as CRS if lasting more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations; ARS may be classified further by presumed etiology into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), and distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. When patients have 4 or more annual episodes of ABRS, without persistent symptoms in between, the condition is termed recurrent ARS (RARS). Nearly all experts agree that CRS begins after 12 weeks duration, and we agree with other guideline groups that define ARS as up to 4 weeks' duration; very limited data are available on rhinosinusitis lasting 4 to 12 weeks, sometimes called subacute rhinosinusitis, and we do not distinguish rhinosinusitis in this time frame as an explicit entity in the guideline with decisions individualized.

The CONSORT flow diagram in Figure 1 shows patient enrollment and progress through the study. Of 669 patients 18 years or older treated with antibiotics for acute sinusitis, we enrolled 157 and excluded 512. The reasons for exclusion are listed in Figure 1.

Figure 1.
CONSORT Flow Diagram: Patients Treated for Acute Sinusitis

IDSA indicates Infectious Disease Society of America.

Of the 157 patients enrolled, the mean age was 48.5 (range, 18.7–84.0) years, and 117 (74.5%) were women. Seventy-nine patients were randomized to the standard-dose arm (60 women [76.0%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [16.2] years) and 78 to the high-dose arm (57 women [73.1%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [15.8] years). The other baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The only significant differences between treatment groups were a longer mean [SD] duration of illness in those randomized to the standard dose (17.1 [2.7] days) than the high dose (13.9 [1.4] days) and a higher percentage with allergic rhinitis in the standard-dose group (21 [26.6%] vs 10 [12.8%]). In line with the progressive loss to follow-up and the incomplete collection of data, the results in Table 2 provide the actual numerator and denominator for each outcome.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^ce066305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in the elderly: effect of a multidimensional educational intervention [^289ebadb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure and improve antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in the elderly.

Design

Prospective, nonrandomized controlled trial.

Setting

Ambulatory office practices in Denver metropolitan area (n = 4 intervention practices; n = 51 control practices).

Participants

Consecutive patients enrolled in a Medicare managed care program who were diagnosed with ARIs during baseline (winter 2000/2001) and intervention (winter 2001/2002) periods. A total of 4,270 patient visits were analyzed (including 341 patient visits in intervention practices).

Intervention

Appropriate antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance educational materials were mailed to intervention practice households. Waiting and examination room posters were provided to intervention office practices.

Measurements

Antibiotic prescription rates, based on administrative office visit and pharmacy data, for total and condition-specific ARIs.

Results

There was wide variation in antibiotic prescription rates for ARIs across unique practices, ranging from 21% to 88% (median = 54%). Antibiotic prescription rates varied little by patient age, sex, and underlying chronic lung disease. Prescription rates varied by diagnosis: sinusitis (69%), bronchitis (59%), pharyngitis (50%), and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection (26%). The educational intervention was not associated with greater reduction in antibiotic prescription rates for total or condition-specific ARIs beyond a modest secular trend (P = 0.79).

Conclusion

Wide variation in antibiotic prescription rates suggests that quality improvement efforts are needed to optimize antibiotic use in the elderly. In the setting of an ongoing physician intervention, a patient education intervention had little effect. Factors other than patient expectations and demands may play a stronger role in antibiotic treatment decisions in elderly populations.

### Antibiotic prescribing for nonbacterial acute upper respiratory infections in elderly persons [^fa40d7fc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURIs) requires a better understanding of the factors associated with this practice.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing for nonbacterial AURIs and whether prescribing rates varied by physician characteristics.

Design

Retrospective analysis of linked administrative health care data.

Setting

Primary care physician practices in Ontario, Canada (January-December 2012).

Patients

Patients aged 66 years or older with nonbacterial AURIs. Patients with cancer or immunosuppressive conditions and residents of long-term care homes were excluded.

Measurements

Antibiotic prescriptions for physician-diagnosed AURIs. A multivariable logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to examine whether prescribing rates varied by physician characteristics, accounting for clustering of patients among physicians and adjusting for patient-level covariates.

Results

The cohort included 8990 primary care physicians and 185 014 patients who presented with a nonbacterial AURI, including the common cold (53.4%), acute bronchitis (31.3%), acute sinusitis (13.6%), or acute laryngitis (1.6%). Forty-six percent of patients received an antibiotic prescription; most prescriptions were for broad-spectrum agents (69.9% [95% CI, 69.6% to 70.2%]). Patients were more likely to receive prescriptions from mid- and late-career physicians than early-career physicians (rate difference, 5.1 percentage points [CI, 3.9 to 6.4 percentage points] and 4.6 percentage points [CI, 3.3 to 5.8 percentage points], respectively), from physicians trained outside of Canada or the United States (3.6 percentage points [CI, 2.5 to 4.6 percentage points]), and from physicians who saw 25 to 44 patients per day or 45 or more patients per day than those who saw fewer than 25 patients per day (3.1 percentage points [CI, 2.1 to 4.0 percentage points] and 4.1 percentage points [CI, 2.7 to 5.5 percentage points], respectively).

Limitation

Physician rationale for prescribing was unknown.

Conclusion

In this low-risk elderly cohort, 46% of patients with a nonbacterial AURI were prescribed antibiotics. Patients were more likely to receive prescriptions from mid- or late-career physicians with high patient volumes and from physicians who were trained outside of Canada or the United States.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^a084cb14]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find a benefit to patients of treating clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis with high-dose rather than standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. This finding is disappointing because the IDSA-recommended standard dosehas a limited effect (vs placebo). This outcome is also surprising in light of the promising results of the previous trial.

Why would we get such very different results? First, the current trial suffered from an incomplete collection of data (although mostly for the secondary outcomes). Yet these missing data cannot explain such a pronounced lack of benefit. A best-case analysis of the missing primary outcomes made only a modest difference. We found no important changes in baseline characteristics in the participants who remained at the end of days 3 and 10, and it seemed futile to continue recruitment to achieve the planned number of participants. Second, the 2 groups were not completely similar at baseline. Standard-dose participants reported a longer average duration of illness; therefore, more of them might have had spontaneous improvement unrelated to antibiotic dose by the end of day 3. However, the actual impact of duration of illness appeared to be minimal. In addition, even if an effect of allergic rhinitis in diminishing the response to antibiotics had been found, it would have reduced primary outcomes in more participants in the standard-dose group. Third, one or both of the studies may have suffered from a randomly skewed, nonrepresentative sample of participants. Whatever the explanation, the addition of the current participants to those from our previous study reduced the benefit of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate to statistical nonsignificance.

Three secondary findings are of interest. First, the frequency of diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections was quite high, even though most cases were mild. Second, patients who reported they were prone to adverse effects were more likely to experience them. Whether or not this outcome represented a self-fulfilling prophecy, this information would seem important when discussing with patients the pros and cons of antibiotic treatment. Third, the large number of patients with presumed penicillin allergy (Figure 1) underlines the need for more widespread testing for penicillin allergy. As shown in multiple studies, most of these patients do not have, or no longer have, an allergy to penicillin and can benefit from having the option of treatment with a penicillin.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^f702da10]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3–4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^dded5e71]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past 2 decades, and ABRS accounted for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995, ranking as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms of at least 10 days duration. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include: severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, an age < 5 years and attendance in day care centers. The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be considered dependable in this role. Rather, newer antibiotics may be called on to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^2d0778f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Upper respiratory infections [^5a66eba3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that > 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines serve to aid practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains regarding the disparity of guideline recommendations as well as some recommendations being outdated. This review presents 3 illustrative case studies designed to provide some clarity with regard to these guidelines. Case 1 is a typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous 2 weeks. Case 2 is a more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy that ultimately requires referral to an otolaryngologist. Case 3 is an atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan. It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide some helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^18c65919]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

Design

For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective".

Measurements and Main Results

For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics was cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

Conclusions

Use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary prescriptions. If this resulted in increased antibiotic resistance, costs would substantially rise and efficacy would fall. Newer, expensive antibiotics are of limited value. Additional testing is not cost-effective. Further studies are needed to find an accurate, low-cost diagnostic test for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^6e6c4945]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c02e2d71]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic Therapy for ABRS Following Initial Treatment Failures — In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), if a patient on antibiotics worsens or fails to improve within 3 to 5 days, drug-resistant infection should be considered and therapy switched with reevaluation; when changing therapy, clinicians should consider initial coverage limits, as amoxicillin-treated patients commonly have beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (60%), M. catarrhalis (58.3%), or penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (72%). Resistance can be significant, with minimum inhibitory concentration at least 2-fold higher observed in 49% of patients. For multidrug-resistant pathogens, options would include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g per day amoxicillin equivalent) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternative agents are available, but given the FDA black box warning regarding fluoroquinolones, the decision to use this class should be carefully thought out; oral cephalosporins and macrolides are predicted to offer inadequate coverage for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Safety and follow-up are emphasized: patients who fail antibiotics with a worsening pattern should be examined for complications and, if concerning findings are present, an urgent referral to an otolaryngologist or emergency department is warranted and CT sinuses, or MRI is indicated; a follow-up plan should be made between clinicians and patients.

### Patterns of care before and after the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline [^cb8a76c7]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Determine if patterns of care for acute sinusitis have changed after the publication of the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study with historical controls.

Methods

Cases of adult acute sinusitis occurring in 2005–2006 (before guideline publication) and 2009–2010 (> 1 year after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Changes in the rates of analgesic recommendations, oral antibiotic prescriptions, and choice of antibiotic therapy were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations.

Results

An estimated 18.1 ± 1.8 million cases of adult acute sinusitis were studied before (7.9 ± 0.9 million visits for 2005–2006) and after (10.2 ± 1.5 million visits for 2009–2010) guideline publication. Recommendation rates for analgesics did not change significantly (18.9% before vs. 23.0% after, P = 0.470). The proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics increased after guideline publication (75.5% before vs. 85.7% after, P = 0.021). In keeping with guideline recommendations, the proportion of patients treated with amoxicillin as the agent of choice when antibiotics are prescribed increased from 8.1% to 29.4% after guideline publication (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Care patterns for the medical treatment of acute adult sinusitis have changed after guideline publication, with an increase in oral antibiotic prescription rates in cases of acute sinusitis and increase in the use of amoxicillin as the first-line antimicrobial agent. The latter is strongly in keeping with guideline recommendation. Clinicians' espousal of the analgesic recommendations likely needs improvement to better comply with guideline recommendations.

### Impact of first-line vs second-line antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis [^b7076a30]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Studies suggest little benefit in relief of acute sinusitis symptoms from the use of newer and more expensive (second-line) antibiotics instead of older and less expensive (first-line) antibiotics. However, researchers have failed to include development of complications and cost of care in their analyses.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and cost of first-line with second-line antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis in adults.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study using a pharmaceutical database containing demographic, clinical (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision), treatment, and charge information for 29 102 adults with a diagnosis of acute sinusitis receiving initial antibiotic treatment between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997.

Main Outcome Measures

Absence of additional claim for an antibiotic in the 28 days after the initial antibiotic, presence of a claim for a second antibiotic, serious complications of sinusitis, and direct charges and use for the acute sinusitis treatment.

Results

There were 17 different antibiotics prescribed in this study. The majority (59.5%) of patients received 1 of the first-line antibiotics. The overall success rate was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.0%-90.8%). The success rate for the 17 329 patients who received a first-line antibiotic was 90.1% and for the 11 773 patients who received a second-line antibiotic was 90.8%, a difference of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.01%-1.40%; P < .05). There were 2 cases of periorbital cellulitis, one in each treatment group. The average total direct charge for patients receiving a first-line antibiotic was $68.98 and a second-line antibiotic was $135.17, a difference of $66.19 (95% CI, $64.95-$67.43; P < .001). This difference was due entirely to the difference in charge of antibiotics and not other charges, such as professional fees, laboratory tests, or emergency department visits.

Conclusions

Patients treated with a first-line antibiotic for acute uncomplicated sinusitis did not have clinically significant differences in outcomes vs those treated with a second-line antibiotic. However, cost of care was significantly higher for patients treated with a second-line antibiotic.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

Participants

Patients 18 years or older who presented to the office with sinus symptoms and whom the clinicians chose to treat with antibiotics were eligible if, in the judgment of the treating clinician, they fit one of the IDSA diagnostic categories for acute bacterial sinusitis and if they had no exclusion criterion. The 3 IDSA categories are (1) persistent symptoms of rhinitis, purulent secretions, and/or pain in the face or teeth without improvement (lasting for ≥ 10 days), (2) severe symptoms or signs of fever of at least 102 °F and nasal discharge or facial pain (lasting for ≥ 3–4 days), or (3) worsening symptoms or signs characterized by a new onset of fever, headache, or increase in nasal discharge following a typical viral upper respiratory illness that lasted 5 to 6 days and was initially improving (double sickening).

Patients were excluded if they (1) were allergic or intolerant to any penicillin or to amoxicillin and clavulanate; (2) had experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction to any beta-lactam; (3) had an elevated risk of carrying amoxicillin-resistant bacteria because they had received amoxicillin, penicillin, or another beta-lactam within the past month or were known to have had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; (4) had chronic or recurrent sinus problems, defined as persistent symptoms of sinus congestion not attributed to nasal allergies, for 8 weeks or moreor 2 or more episodes of antibiotic-treated sinusitis in the past 3 months; (5) were judged to need high-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate or levofloxacin or be sent to the emergency department because of signs of severe infection or compromised immunity; (6) were cognitively impaired and, therefore, unable to give reliable symptom ratings; (7) were pregnant or nursing; (8) had conditions with warnings about amoxicillin, namely, current mononucleosis, chronic kidney disease with a glomerular filtration rate lower than 30, hepatic impairment, history of antibiotic-associated colitis, or use of allopurinol; or (9) had been previously enrolled in the current study.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^ce855849]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results

Between 2013 and 2015, 931 015 consultations for the 13 included indications led to antibiotic prescriptions. This subset — which focused on common conditions, but excluded chronic and recurrent cases, repeat prescriptions, and antibiotic prophylaxis — covered about 20% of total antibiotics being prescribed (for any condition) during the study period. The most common indications were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%), cellulitis (54 610, 5.9%), and acute cystitis (53 010, 5.7%). Durations of antibiotic treatment for the included indications showed poor guideline adherence for several indications (fig 1 and supplementary figs S1-S8).

Fig 1
Durations of antibiotic prescriptions for various indications

For all conditions grouped together, about 1.3 million days beyond the durations recommended by guidelines (table 2), which remained the same during 2013–15.

Table 2
Percentage of antibiotics with a duration exceeding guideline recommendations for all patients and antibiotics

COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Most of the excess days were due to respiratory indications (table 2). Antibiotic treatments for respiratory indications, including otitis media, accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations (table 2). A notable exception was acute sinusitis, for which only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions were longer than the seven days recommended by the PHE 2013 guidance. For some indications, guidelines recommend longer durations for patients who are more unwell, such as those with pneumonia and a CRB65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years and older) score of 1 or 2, or a range of appropriate durations (supplementary table S1). A much smaller proportion of patients received antibiotic prescriptions exceeding these upper boundaries (table 2 and supplementary table S3).

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^6ca9c7b5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Trends and frequencies of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis outpatient visits in adults [^f6d504c5]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to analyze the trends and frequency in which recommended first-line therapy, amoxicillin with or without clavulanate, was prescribed for acute sinusitis based on current otolaryngology and other gold standard guidelines, as well as analyze differences in prescription behaviors of otolaryngologists compared with non-otolaryngologists for outpatient adult acute sinusitis visits.

Methods

Weighted patient data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were analyzed to calculate visit rates and trends of antibiotic prescriptions for adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis from 2007 to 2019. Visits with multiple prescribed antibiotics or concomitant diagnoses requiring antibiotics were excluded. Each visit was classified based on the type of antibiotic prescribed.

Results

Acute sinusitis was diagnosed in 0.63% of all outpatient visits from 2007 to 2019 (95% confidence interval: 0.56%-0.71%). Amoxicillin had the greatest increase in prescription frequency (13.4%), whereas macrolides had the largest decrease in prescription frequency (13.9%). Among adult acute sinusitis outpatient visits in which antibiotics were prescribed, recommended first-line antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin alone was prescribed in 40.4% of visits. The most common antibiotic prescribed was amoxicillin-clavulanate at otolaryngologist visits (20.5%) and macrolides at non-otolaryngologist visits (26.0%). A greater proportion of otolaryngologist visits resulted in no antibiotics prescribed for acute sinusitis (36.8% vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Otolaryngologists engage in watchful waiting more than non-otolaryngologists. Broader dissemination of existing guidelines for acute sinusitis treatment to non-Otolaryngologist (ENT) primary care specialties that take care of acute sinusitis to improve antibiotic stewardship and appropriate antibiotic selection is needed.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^4a04e655]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

### Acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^10bb4109]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Subtypes of rhinosinusitis include acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis is further specified as bacterial or viral. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, decongestants, and saline nasal irrigation is appropriate in patients who present with nonsevere symptoms (e.g., mild pain, temperature less than 101°F [38.3°C]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are recommended in patients with symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that do not improve after seven days, or that worsen at any time. Limited evidence supports the use of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with acute rhinosinusitis. Radiographic imaging is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography of the sinuses should not be used for routine evaluation, although it may be used to define anatomic abnormalities and evaluate patients with suspected complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Rare complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include orbital, intracranial, and bony involvement. If symptoms persist or progress after maximal medical therapy, and if computed tomography shows evidence of sinus disease, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted.

### Antibiotics for sinusitis… [^4d6980e8]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Don't routinely prescribe antibiotics for acute mild-to-moderate sinusitis unless symptoms last for ten or more days OR symptoms worsen after initial clinical improvement. Most sinusitis in the ambulatory setting is due to a viral infection that will resolve on its own. Despite consistent recommendations to the contrary, antibiotics are prescribed in over 80% of outpatient visits for acute sinusitis. Sinusitis accounts for 16 million office visits and $5. 8 billion in annual health care. Sources: AAO-HNSF Updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses in primary care. Annually, it accounts for 15% to 20% of adult antibiotic prescriptions and costs more than $20 million in patient visits.

Current recommendations strongly support not prescribing antibiotics within the first week of illness for mild to moderate sinusitis. A meta-analysis published in 2012 in the Archives of Internal Medicine states that some randomized controlled trials showed that patients assigned to antibiotics had a 7% to 14% higher rate of improvement in symptoms. However, these researchers concluded that the potential harms from use of antibiotics to manage sinusitis, including adverse effects, increased risk of antibiotic resistance, and cost, clearly outweigh the potential minor benefits. A Cochrane review compiled data from 59 studies that involved the use of a variety of antibiotics to manage simple maxillary sinus infection in primary care settings. Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo showed that, in most cases, symptoms improved within two weeks, regardless of whether the participant received an antibiotic or not.

The review found that, in addition to patient-related adverse effects, antibiotic use poses the risk of increased resistance to antibiotics among community-acquired pathogens.

Acute bacterial sinusitis — Rationale for 72-hour reassessment is supported by randomized controlled trial outcomes: "Wald et al41 found that 18 of 35 patients (51%) receiving placebo demonstrated symptomatic improvement within 3 days of initiation of treatment; only an additional 3 patients receiving placebo (9%) improved between days 3 and 10". "In the same study, 48 of 58 patients (83%) receiving antibiotics were cured or improved within 3 days; at 10 days, the overall rate of improvement was 79%, suggesting that no additional patients improved between days 3 and 10". Additionally, "In a more recent study, 17 of 19 children who initially failed initial therapy with either antibiotic or placebo demonstrated failure to improve within 72 hours".

### Acute sinusitis in children: do antibiotics have any role? [^4ad6bfc1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Bacteria can be recovered from paranasal sinuses in the majority of patients given the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), and bacteriologic cure can be achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. The critical question is whether bacteriologic cure correlates with meaningful clinical endpoints such as clinical improvement, reduction in recurrent disease, or prevention of complications. Of the 4 pediatric placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PCRCTs), 2 suggest superiority of antibiotic treatment and 2 suggest lack of superiority. PCRCTs in adults are mixed as to clinical benefit. Pediatric and adult meta-analyses demonstrate modest benefit of antibiotic therapy and rates of spontaneous recovery without antibiotics of 60–65%. Although retrospective studies indicate that some patients who develop orbital or neurologic complications of sinusitis were pre-treated with antibiotic therapy, a low rate of complications precludes determination of whether antibiotic treatment prevents complications in some proportion of patients. Like the literature evidence, expert guideline recommendations are mixed. Although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting, the limited data suggest that antibiotics probably do have a role in the treatment of pediatric ABS. The most compelling rationale is prevention of serious complications, but proof for this rationale is lacking.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^1d7920a8]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^85b082f7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part I. evaluation [^0862f8b3]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although often caused by viruses, it sometimes is caused by bacteria, a condition that is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis difficult. Because two thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infection improve within seven d antibiotic therapy should be reserved for use in patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement. Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography has a role in the care of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^cb74a15f]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Older adults were more likely than younger adults and children to receive antibiotics without diagnostic documentation of an appropriate indication and were far more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly macrolides. Azithromycin was prescribed to nearly one-quarter of adults aged 50 years or older with an ARI, regardless of diagnosis, laboratory testing, symptom duration, or medical history, including to 58% of those older adults given a prescription who lacked an indication for antibiotic treatment. Azithromycin also accounted for more than one-quarter of prescriptions among those adults diagnosed as having pharyngitis and sinusitis, even though it is not the first-line agent for either condition. A concerning increase in macrolide use for these conditions has been previously noted in both adults and children. Choosing a macrolide when amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is the recommended first-line antibiotic is a potential patient safety issue; GAS and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are more likely to be resistant to macrolides than to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. While all antibiotics have potential risks, macrolides have also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^d205041e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes using χ 2 tests, Fisher exact tests, and t tests as appropriate for differences in proportions and means. We reported 95% CIs and P values for the differences in proportions between the 2 groups, and we reported standard deviations (SDs) for the means for the groups as well as 95% CIs and P values for the differences between these means. We used the statistical software Stata, version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC) for analysis and assessed statistical significance at the.05 level.

To look for potential confounding factors, we analyzed the effect on the primary outcome of any significant differences between groups in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In our unplanned interim analysis, we did a best-case analysis for participants lost to follow-up, classifying those missing in the high-dose arm as a GRI 5 or 6 and in the standard-dose arm as a GRI less than 5. After the decision to stop the trial, we investigated futility further by calculating, under different assumptions, the conditional power of finding the proposed 18% increase in positive outcomes in the high-dose group if we would continue to the planned enrollment of 115 in each group.

We had planned to do repeat analyses by combining the participants in this study and those in the second time period of the initial study (because the methodology was the same). Given the negative results of the current study, however, we looked only at the primary efficacy outcome.

### Amoxicillin for acute rhinosinusitis: a randomized controlled trial [^64e2eac2]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence to support antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis is limited, yet antibiotics are commonly used.

Objective

To determine the incremental effect of amoxicillin treatment over symptomatic treatments for adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adults with uncomplicated, acute rhinosinusitis were recruited from 10 community practices in Missouri between November 1, 2006, and May 1, 2009.

Interventions

Ten-day course of either amoxicillin (1500 mg/d) or placebo administered in 3 doses per day. All patients received a 5- to 7-day supply of symptomatic treatments for pain, fever, cough, and nasal congestion to use as needed.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was improvement in disease-specific quality of life after 3 to 4 days of treatment assessed with the Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 (minimally important difference of 0.5 units on a 0–3 scale). Secondary outcomes included the patient's retrospective assessment of change in sinus symptoms and functional status, recurrence or relapse, and satisfaction with and adverse effects of treatment. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interview at days 3, 7, 10, and 28.

Results

A total of 166 adults (36% male; 78% with white race) were randomized to amoxicillin (n = 85) or placebo (n = 81); 92% concurrently used 1 or more symptomatic treatments (94% for amoxicillin group vs 90% for control group; P = 0.34). The mean change in Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 scores was not significantly different between groups on day 3 (decrease of 0.59 in the amoxicillin group and 0.54 in the control group; mean difference between groups of 0.03 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.19]) and on day 10 (mean difference between groups of 0.01 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.15]), but differed at day 7 favoring amoxicillin (mean difference between groups of 0.19 [95% CI, 0.024 to 0.35]). There was no statistically significant difference in reported symptom improvement at day 3 (37% for amoxicillin group vs 34% for control group; P = 0.67) or at day 10 (78% vs 80%, respectively; P = 0.71), whereas at day 7 more participants treated with amoxicillin reported symptom improvement (74% vs 56%, respectively; P = 0.02). No between-group differences were found for any other secondary outcomes. No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Among patients with acute rhinosinusitis, a 10-day course of amoxicillin compared with placebo did not reduce symptoms at day 3 of treatment.

Trial Registration

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^730db7e4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of participants in each group assigning a GRI of 5 or 6 ("a lot better" or "no symptoms") at the end of 3 days of treatment. The secondary efficacy outcomes were the percentage in each group assigning a GRI of 5 or 6 at day 10 and the mean extent of improvement of the total SNOT-16 score at days 3 and 10. The total SNOT-16 score was the sum of all 16 symptoms rated on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe problem), with a possible range of 0 to 48. The primary adverse effect outcome was a score of 3 (severe) for diarrhea at day 3 or 10.

Sample Size

The previous studyfound that 34% of the participants in the standard-dose group reported a GRI of 5 or 6 at the end of 3 days. We estimated that a sample size of 115 in each group would give us 80% power to detect an increase of 18 percentage points in the GRI among those in the high-dose group (ie, an increase to 52%, as reported previously) with an α of.05 for a 2-sided test. We aimed, therefore, to enroll 240 patients (anticipating 10 dropouts before day 3).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^d48c30b5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and macrolide therapy — are characterized by limited evidence for antibiotics in AE-CRS, with only one small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial reporting similar overall improvement in 2 weeks for amoxicillin–clavulanate twice-daily (n = 21) versus placebo (n = 11), both groups receiving saline rinses and topical steroids, and the study powered to detect a 10% difference at the 14 day mark; a retrospective study found no difference in quality of life between culture-driven versus empiric antibiotics, although long-term endoscopy scores improved with culture-driven therapy; current guidance notes the evidence does not strongly support antibiotics in AE-CRS and makes no specific recommendations. Macrolide antibiotics — a special circumstance — have short-term use not generally recommended for acute sinusitis, but long-term use may be considered for patients with non-type 2 CRS; only 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized long-term trials exist, with roxithromycin significantly improving symptoms and nasal endoscopy in CRSsNP, whereas a 12-week course of weekly azithromycin failed to show end-of-course improvement but 12 weeks post-completion 50% reported improvement or cure versus 9% with placebo; studies suggest that in CRS without nasal polyposis, with near-normal eosinophil counts, and resistant to corticosteroid therapy, macrolides may be a therapeutic option.

Results

Patient Enrollment

Enrollment was slower than expected for 3 reasons: (1) the diversion of many patients to urgent care providers; (2) the need to warn patients of the risk of severe diarrhea found in the previous study; and (3) the onset of COVID-19, which led to many virtual sick visits and fewer outpatient visits overall. In addition, we had an unexpectedly high rate of failure to obtain primary outcome information (21 of 157 enrolled [13.4%]) as a result of 7 participants who dropped out before day 3, 13 who could not be contacted, and 1 who neglected to provide a global rating. Before continuing the study, our statistician (A. A.) performed an unplanned interim analysis to check for futility and found that the primary outcome in the high-dose arm was inferior to that in the standard-dose arm and that it would be futile to expect to find either a clinically or a statistically significant benefit. As a result, we stopped the trial in May 2020.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^96aaa703]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^5f8aa2d7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) patient information — symptom course, watchful waiting, and antibiotics: Most patients with ABRS feel better within 7 days and by 15 days about 90% are cured or improved. Watchful waiting means delaying antibiotic treatment of ABRS for up to 5 days after diagnosis, with a prescription to be filled only if not better after 5 days or if worse at any time. Both watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy are proven ways to treat ABRS, and antibiotics only slightly increase symptom relief with about 10–15 people must use antibiotics to get 1 more person better after 7–15 days; antibiotics have side effects including rash, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, and causing resistant germs. If antibiotics are used, they are usually given for 10 days; ask your doctor about a 5–7 day course of antibiotics since side effects are less common. For symptomatic relief, nasal steroid sprays can reduce symptoms after 15 days of use but the benefit is small (about 14 people must use them to get 1 person better), decongestant nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row, and antihistamines and oral steroid medicines should not be used routinely.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (moxifloxacin) [^9aea67a4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.5 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Moxifloxacin Injection is indicated in adults (18 years of age or older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.13)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve Moxifloxacin Injection for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.6 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin Injection is indicated in adults (18 years of age or older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.13)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve Moxifloxacin Injection for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin injection and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Culture and Susceptibility Testing

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to moxifloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Therapy with moxifloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^17b4307a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

ABRS severity and timing thresholds — escalation considerations: It is the opinion of the GUG that waiting more than 15 to 20 days from symptom onset before a trial of antibiotic therapy is not in the patient's best interest if symptoms are worsening or not improving. Severe disease was characterized by high fever (39°C or 102°F) and purulent nasal discharge lasting at least 3–4 consecutive days. Clinical manifestations suggestive of suppurative complications of ABRS with extension beyond the sinuses or odontogenic source require immediate antibiotic treatment or referral to an otolaryngologist and are excluded from this statement.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1f3e40ce]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) — diagnostic criteria and antibiotic course include that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is diagnosed in patients with URIs persisting longer than 10 to 14 days, and appropriate criteria for the diagnosis are symptoms of rhinosinusitis for 10 to 14 days, symptoms of a cold that improve and then worsen over a 7- to 10-day period, or severe symptoms of acute sinus infection. A 10 to 14 day course is generally adequate for acute disease, although shorter courses may be adequate with some antibiotics, and if there is no improvement in 3 to 5 days, then an alternative antibiotic should be considered. There is both clinical and experimental evidence that allergic rhinitis (AR) might predispose patients with ARSs, and in young adults with ABRS, there is a reported incidence of AR ranging from 25% to 31%.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^d29ac3b6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

This study assessed the extent to which the duration of antibiotic prescriptions, for a wide range of common infections, follow guidelines in English primary care. In contrast with a recent US study only focusing on acute sinusitis, we were able to account for comorbidities and previous use of drugs that potentially influence the duration of prescriptions. We found similar results when restricting to healthy patients without comorbidities or past use of immunosuppressive drugs or corticosteroids, suggesting that comorbidities do not play a major part in the decision process about the duration of the antibiotic prescribed. Similarly, we did not find large differences in antibiotic prescriptions between children and adults. This provides further support for the argument that treatment durations are not increased because individual patient factors indicated a clinical need for prolonged treatment.

We only assessed whether the durations of antibiotic prescriptions followed guidelines and not whether antibiotics should have been completely avoided. Previous work showed that a substantial proportion of prescriptions for acute cough and bronchitis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, and impetigo in primary care are unnecessary. Therefore, for these conditions the total number of days of unnecessary antibiotic use will be higher than estimated here. For example, if 77% of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis were inappropriate, the percentage of days of antibiotic treatment not following guidelines would increase from 7.1% to 81.1% for this indication. Antibiotics might also be unnecessary for community acquired pneumonia, for which it has been estimated that up to 25% of cases are caused by viruses without a bacterial coinfection. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between patients with community acquired pneumonia requiring antibiotics and those who can safely be treated without antibiotics in the primary care setting. Similarly, in suspected urinary tract infection, significant bacteriuria (> 10 3) colony forming unit (CFU)/mL has been found in only 25–65% of patients aged less than 65 years given antibiotic treatment. In older adults, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common and does not require antibiotic treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^fee02bb9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis — management of incomplete response and escalation: For resolved uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, no further evaluation is needed, but for partial response clinicians should continue antibiotic treatment for another 10 to 14 days or consider a different antibiotic. For poor response, which worsens after 3 to 5 days, consider broadening microbial coverage or switch to a different antimicrobial that covers resistant bacteria, and rhinosinusitis that fails to improve after 21 to 28 days of initial antibiotic treatment might be due to pathogens not adequately covered by prior antibiotics, nasal polyps, tumor, or noncompliance. Reinforce comfort and prevention measures, consider a sinus CT scan if not already done with more detailed evaluation of underlying risk factors, and consider consultation with an allergist‑immunologist or an otolaryngologist for immunodeficiency, unusual pathogens, allergic factors, or structural abnormalities.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, first-line, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to administer a β-lactam agent (amoxicillin/clavulanate) over respiratory fluoroquinolones for initial empiric antimicrobial therapy of ABRS.
