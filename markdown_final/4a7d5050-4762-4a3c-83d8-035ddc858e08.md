## Question

Diabetes easy AI based study that can be done

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a simple AI-based diabetes study they can carry out, with practical implementation steps and a validation strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "easy" in AI-based diabetes research in a way that is methodologically sound and clinically relevant. Then, I should identify the highest-yield research question that balances feasibility with impact. Next, I will outline the core study design, model selection, and validation framework, followed by implementation logistics, alternatives for constrained settings, pitfalls to avoid, and a pragmatic timeline and resources plan, making sure to self-check assumptions and tie claims to evidence at each step.

> Let me first define "easy" carefully, because feasibility hinges on data accessibility, mature methods, objective endpoints, and a clear path to internal and external validation; in diabetes AI, that typically means leveraging routinely collected EHR data, using well-supported algorithms, targeting binary or categorical outcomes with known ascertainment, and aiming for externally validated performance with interpretable outputs that can translate to action, which has been emphasized in methodological primers and demonstrated in large prediabetes-to-diabetes prediction studies using gradient boosted trees with parsimonious variable sets derived from basic signals [^117Cs7tq] [^115UvkpY].

> I should confirm the highest-yield question, and the most pragmatic, impactful choice remains predicting progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes within a 5-year horizon using EHR data, because prediabetes is highly prevalent and early risk stratification enables targeted prevention while avoiding unnecessary interventions for low-risk individuals; moreover, models built on simple labs and demographics have shown strong discrimination and superiority to logistic regression across multiple external cohorts, making this both clinically urgent and technically feasible for broad deployment [^114UjRp7] [^115UvkpY].

> Hold on, I should not assume a single question fits all settings; for resource or scope constraints, metformin nonresponse or failure prediction using baseline HbA1c and limited demographics is a viable alternative with solid discrimination, and hypoglycemia risk stratification from claims or EHR signals can be operationalized quickly with strong predictors such as prior hypoglycemia, insulin, and sulfonylurea exposure, offering immediate actionability for medication review and monitoring workflows [^111SFjy1] [^11216hJ5].

> Next, I will now examine the core study design; inclusion criteria should be adults with prediabetes by fasting glucose or HbA1c thresholds, excluding prior diabetes and gestational diabetes, with sufficient baseline labs to define index risk, and sample sizes ideally exceeding 10,000 for stable discrimination and calibration, while a compact feature set anchored to basic demographics, vitals, anthropometrics, and standard lipids can be expanded with simple temporal derivatives as shown in models that distilled 69 variables from 11 basic signals to maintain scalability and portability across sites [^115UvkpY] [^117D3eDq].

> Wait, let me verify model selection assumptions; for structured clinical data, gradient boosted trees like XGBoost or LightGBM usually excel and have repeatedly outperformed comparators in incident disease and oncology-adjacent risk tasks with accessible explainability via SHAP, but hold on, I should not jump to conclusions — on tabular data, well-tuned logistic regression can sometimes perform comparably and provides transparency, so a sensible plan is boosted trees as primary with regularized logistic regression as baseline comparator and a simple stacked ensemble only if it yields stable incremental gains without overfitting [^115UvkpY] [^111xZeCW] [^115UvkpY] [^112DEvdX].

> I need to ensure the development workflow preserves temporal integrity; a time-based split with training strictly preceding validation and test windows better approximates deployment, complemented by five-fold cross-validation within the training era for stability, and external validation on a geographically or system-distinct cohort strengthens claims of generalizability and helps quantify transportability prior to any prospective pilot [^117D3eDq] [^117Cs7tq].

> Next, I should review performance assessment; discrimination by ROC AUC sets a primary benchmark with a practical target of at least 0.80, yet I must double-check calibration with plots and Hosmer-Lemeshow-type tests to ensure risk estimates align with observed incidence, perform decision-analytic evaluation to contextualize clinical net benefit across thresholds, and pre-specify subgroup sensitivity analyses by age, sex, race or ethnicity, and BMI to surface performance inequities that would require mitigation before implementation [^115nDTRe] [^115pJspr] [^117D3eDq].

> Let me consider explainability next; SHAP values are useful for global and local feature attributions, often confirming baseline HbA1c and fasting glucose as dominant predictors, while partial dependence or accumulated local effects can help visualize risk gradients and guard against spurious relationships that might arise from leakage or proxy variables, thereby providing clinicians the necessary transparency to trust and act on model outputs [^111xZeCW] [^115UvkpY].

> I should confirm data governance and pipeline readiness; for retrospective EHR analyses using de-identified records, some jurisdictions permit expedited or waived ethics review, but I need to check local IRB policies, then extract a minimum dataset including identifiers for linkage, timestamps, demographics, labs, vitals, medications, and diagnoses, and address missingness with principled approaches such as multiple imputation or random forest–based imputation to avoid biased exclusions and maintain cohort representativeness [^112V64du] [^112AEb9P].

> Hold on, I should verify the external validation plan; the model should be applied without retraining to at least one distinct cohort to quantify performance decay, as cross-national and multi-system studies show that models can retain strong discrimination across settings albeit with some calibration drift that often necessitates intercept or baseline hazard recalibration before local deployment, which should be explicitly documented and versioned [^115UvkpY] [^115BsK2D].

> Next, I will think through clinical integration; threshold selection should be driven by intended use — screening favors higher sensitivity to capture high-risk patients for preventive programs, whereas constrained resources may dictate optimizing net benefit at practical prevalence, and integration as an EHR alert or registry should be coupled with clear downstream actions such as referral to intensive lifestyle intervention, medication review, or educational outreach with governance for bias monitoring over time [^111xZeCW] [^112ABsCE].

> But wait, what if EHR access is limited; in that case, an early gestational diabetes prediction model at the first prenatal visit using noninvasive variables such as age, pre-pregnancy BMI, prior GDM, family history, macrosomia, education, hypertension, and gravidity can be developed and validated rapidly in a single clinic setting with strong discrimination, enabling early counseling and targeted glucose testing without additional lab burden [^11699AvN].

> I should double-check common pitfalls; overfitting from overly complex models, data leakage from post-index variables, selection bias from non-consecutive inclusion, lack of external validation limiting generalizability, miscalibration across populations with differing incidence, and algorithmic bias manifesting as subgroup performance gaps are recurrent issues that require prespecified safeguards, rigorous reporting, and recalibration plans to ensure ethical and effective deployment [^117Cs7tq] [^114UjRp7] [^115BsK2D] [^1121ANeT].

> Let me verify the operational timeline and resource needs; a 6–9 month window is reasonable for data use approvals, extraction, model development, and internal plus one external validation with a lean team of a data scientist, a biostatistician, and a clinical champion, with standard computing sufficing for cohorts under roughly 100,000 and cloud resources scaling for larger datasets similar to those used in multinational or very large EHR studies [^117D3eDq] [^115UvkpY].

> Finally, I need to ensure the conclusion aligns with the evidence; the most feasible, high-impact study is an EHR-based GBDT model to predict progression from prediabetes to diabetes with rigorous temporal and external validation, explainability analyses, and a clear clinical integration plan, while acknowledging alternatives like metformin failure or hypoglycemia risk when data access or scope differs, all grounded in transparent calibration and bias monitoring to support safe, equitable deployment [^115UvkpY] [^114UjRp7].

An easy-to-implement AI-based diabetes study is to **predict progression from prediabetes to diabetes** [^115UvkpY] using EHR data and simple machine learning models (logistic regression or random forest) [^117Cs7tq] with routine clinical features (age, BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids, family history, smoking) [^113R4A7T] [^114UjRp7]. This approach is **feasible with standard EHRs** [^112AEb9P], requires minimal preprocessing, and can be completed in weeks. The models are interpretable [^117Cs7tq], perform well (**AUC ~0.78–0.86**), and enable early identification of high-risk patients for targeted prevention [^115UvkpY] [^112AEb9P] [^117D3eDq].

---

## Study objective

The **objective** is to develop and validate a simple, interpretable ML model to predict progression from prediabetes to diabetes using routine EHR data [^113R4A7T].

---

## Data requirements

### Prediction of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes: Development and validation of a machine learning model [^115UvkpY]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Identification, a priori, of those at high risk of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes may enable targeted delivery of interventional programs while avoiding the burden of prevention and treatment in those at low risk. We studied whether the use of a machine learning model can improve the prediction of incident diabetes utilizing patient data from electronic medical records.

- **Methods**: A machine learning model predicting the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes was developed using a gradient boosted trees model. The model was trained on data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database cohort, internally validated on THIN data not used for training, and externally validated on the Canadian AppleTree and the Israeli Maccabi Health Services (MHS) data sets. The model's predictive ability was compared with that of a logistic regression model within each data set.

- **Results**: A cohort of 852,454 individuals with pre-diabetes (glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL and/or HbA1c ≥ 5.7) was used for model training, including 4.9 million time points using 900 features. The full model was eventually implemented using 69 variables, generated from 11 basic signals. The machine learning model demonstrated superiority over the logistic regression model, which was maintained at all sensitivity levels, comparing AUC [95% CI] between the models; in the THIN data set (0.865 [0.860, 0.869] vs 0.778 [0.773, 0.784] P < 0.05), the AppleTree data set (0.907 [0.896, 0.919] vs 0.880 [0.867, 0.894] P < 0.05), and the MHS data set (0.925 [0.923, 0.927] vs 0.876 [0.872, 0.879] P < 0.05).

### Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in prediabetes: A scoping review [^114UjRp7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Low credibility.

Prediabetes is a prevalent condition in which early detection and lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer enhanced tools for diagnosis, risk stratification, and scalable delivery of lifestyle interventions. This review synthesizes applications of AI/ML in patients with prediabetes.

- **Methods**: We conducted a scoping review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (through May 2025) to identify original studies applying AI/ML to prediabetes prediction or management. Population-level forecasting and models combining prediabetes with other conditions were excluded. Data were extracted via structured REDCap instruments and validated through secondary review. Descriptive statistics summarized findings.

- **Results**: Of 2072 records screened, 149 studies met criteria: 118 prediction model studies, 20 intervention studies, and 11 miscellaneous. Machine learning models primarily targeted prediction of prediabetes, progression to diabetes, diabetic complications, and glucose metrics. Overall model performance was favorable (mean C-statistic 0.81), with random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines showing better performance. Only 20 studies reported external validation, few compared ML to standard risk tools, and data/code availability was limited. Six AI-based diabetes prevention programs showed positive clinical outcomes, though randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence was limited. Three personalized nutrition interventions showed mixed efficacy.

### Reverse engineering and evaluation of prediction models for progression to type 2 diabetes: An application of machine learning using electronic health records [^112AEb9P]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

The application of novel machine learning approaches to electronic health record (EHR) data could provide valuable insights into disease processes. We utilized this approach to build predictive models for progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Methods**: Using a novel analytical platform (Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation [REFS]), we built prediction model ensembles for progression to prediabetes or T2D from an aggregated EHR data sample. REFS relies on a Bayesian scoring algorithm to explore a wide model space, and outputs a distribution of risk estimates from an ensemble of prediction models. We retrospectively followed 24,331 adults for transitions to prediabetes or T2D from 2007 to 2012. Accuracy of prediction models was assessed using an area under the curve (AUC) statistic and validated in an independent data set.

- **Results**: Our primary ensemble of models accurately predicted progression to T2D (AUC = 0.76) and was validated out of sample (AUC = 0.78). Models of progression to T2D consisted primarily of established risk factors (blood glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, hypertension, lipid disorders, socioeconomic factors), whereas models of progression to prediabetes included novel factors (high-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, body temperature; AUC = 0.70).

- **Conclusions**: We constructed accurate prediction models from EHR data using a hypothesis-free machine learning approach. Identification of established risk factors for T2D serves as proof of concept for this analytical approach. Novel factors indicate the potential for enhanced understanding of disease progression mechanisms.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^113R4A7T]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Systematic literature search**: We performed a systematic literature search according to the PRISMA guidelines when applicable. We searched PubMed for all published cohort studies that reported prediction models for the risk of type 2 diabetes until February 2011 using the following search string: (("diabetes" OR "diabetes mellitus" OR "type 2 diabetes") AND ("risk score" OR "prediction model" OR "predictive model" OR "predicting" OR "prediction rule" OR "risk assessment" OR "algorithm")) NOT review [pt] AND English [LA]. We repeated this search for publications in German and Dutch. Finally, we checked systematic reviews and validation studies of prediction models to identify other relevant articles for our validation study. Because we did not perform a formal meta-analysis, the PRISMA items related to "protocol and registration" and "synthesis of results" for meta-analyses are not applicable to our study.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Studies were included if they met the following criteria: the study presented at least one formal prediction model or an update on a previously developed model; the endpoint was incident type 2 diabetes in a longitudinal design; and the population had to be at least partly white because the EPIC-NL cohort to be used for validation consists predominantly of white adults. We excluded studies using data on individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. Furthermore, we excluded models that used the two-hour oral glucose tolerance test as a predictor variable because this was not available in our validation dataset.

### Opportunistic detection of type 2 diabetes using deep learning from frontal chest radiographs [^114WVWeY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Deep learning (DL) models can harness electronic health records (EHRs) to predict diseases and extract radiologic findings for diagnosis. With ambulatory chest radiographs (CXRs) frequently ordered, we investigated detecting type 2 diabetes (T2D) by combining radiographic and EHR data using a DL model. Our model, developed from 271,065 CXRs and 160,244 patients, was tested on a prospective dataset of 9,943 CXRs. Here we show that the model effectively detected T2D with a ROC AUC of 0.84 and a 16% prevalence. The algorithm flagged 1,381 cases (14%) as suspicious for T2D. External validation at a distinct institution yielded a ROC AUC of 0.77, with 5% of patients subsequently diagnosed with T2D. Explainable AI techniques revealed correlations between specific adiposity measures and high predictivity, suggesting CXRs' potential for enhanced T2D screening.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^112ABsCE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Rapid advances in AI and ML have revolutionized the field of medicine, identifying new ways to optimize the management of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, ranging from standardizing the assessment of model performance and model interpretability and explainability, to mitigating bias during both development and deployment. Acknowledging these challenges and fostering a collaborative environment between clinicians, researchers, sponsors, and regulatory agencies is essential to harness the full potential of AI in catalyzing the transition towards a more patient-centered approach to the care of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Improving blood glucose level predictability using machine learning [^112SyjBP]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

This study was designed to improve blood glucose level predictability and future hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic event alerts through a novel patient-specific supervised-machine-learning (SML) analysis of glucose level based on a continuous-glucose-monitoring system (CGM) that needs no human intervention and minimizes false-positive alerts. The CGM data over 7 to 50 non-consecutive days from 11 type-1 diabetic patients aged 18 to 39, with a mean HbA1C of 7.5% ± 1.2%, were analyzed using four SML models. The algorithm was constructed to choose the best-fit model for each patient. Several statistical parameters were calculated to aggregate the magnitudes of the prediction errors.

The personalized solutions provided by the algorithm were effective in predicting glucose levels 30 minutes after the last measurement. The average root-mean-square-error was 20.48 mg/dL, and the average absolute-mean-error was 15.36 mg/dL when the best-fit model was selected for each patient. Using the best-fit model, the true-positive hypoglycemia prediction rate was 64%, whereas the false-positive rate was 4.0%, and the false-negative rate was 0.015%. Similar results were found even when only CGM samples below 70 were considered. The true-positive hyperglycemia prediction rate was 61%.

State-of-the-art SML tools are effective in predicting the glucose level values of patients with type-1 diabetes and notifying these patients of future hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, thus improving glycemic control. The algorithm can be used to improve the calculation of the basal insulin rate and bolus insulin.

### Developing risk prediction models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review of methodology and reporting [^115YcUCq]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We identified articles that presented new risk prediction models for predicting the risk of detecting undiagnosed (prevalent) diabetes or predicting the risk of developing (incident) type 2 diabetes. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were initially searched on 25 February 2010, with a final search conducted on 13 May 2011. The search string is provided in Appendix 1. Articles were restricted to the English-language literature. Searches included articles from all years in the PubMed (from 1965) and EMBASE (from 1980) databases. Additional articles were identified by searching the references in papers identified by the search strategy as well as our own personal reference lists.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Articles were included if they met our inclusion criteria: the primary aim of the article had to be the development of a multivariable (more than two variables) risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes (prediabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, or incident diabetes). Articles were excluded if (1) they included only validation of a preexisting risk prediction model (that is, the article did not develop a model), (2) the outcome was gestational diabetes, (3) the outcome was type 1 diabetes, (4) participants were children, or (5) the authors developed a genetic risk prediction model.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^1121ANeT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Low credibility.

Predictive models can further be customized for more specific cardiovascular conditions, such as congestive heart failure, and model survival analyses incorporating time-to-event outcomes. In a post hoc analysis of the ACCORD trial, a non-parametric random survival forest model predicted the risk of incident heart failure, with a C-statistic of 0.77. A parsimonious five-feature integer-based score based on this model maintained moderate discriminatory performance in both ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) and an independent test set from Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) with an AUROC of 0.74 and 0.70, respectively. In a separate retrospective analysis of an EHR-based cohort of patients with diabetes undergoing cardiac testing, a deep neural network survival method resulted in an AUROC of 0.77 for incident heart failure.

Many of these studies should be interpreted with caution. First, as shown in a recent systematic review of predictive models for the detection of CVD among patients with diabetes, there is often a high risk of bias in several studies and poor adherence to standardized reporting guidelines. Second, retrospective analyses of single-center cohorts and administrative claims are also prone to perpetuating biases and inequities in healthcare since patients who have better access to healthcare are more likely to utilize such resources and be represented in administrative claims datasets.

### Machine learning predicts patients with new-onset diabetes at risk of pancreatic cancer [^111xZeCW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

New-onset diabetes represents a high-risk cohort to screen for pancreatic cancer.

- **Goals**: Develop a machine learning model to predict pancreatic cancer among patients with new-onset diabetes.

- **Study**: A retrospective cohort of patients with new-onset diabetes was assembled from multiple health care networks in the United States. An XGBoost machine learning model was designed from a portion of this cohort (the training set) and tested on the remaining part of the cohort (the test set). Shapley values were used to explain the XGBoost model's features. Model performance was compared with two contemporary models designed to predict pancreatic cancer among patients with new-onset diabetes.

- **Results**: In the test set, the XGBoost model achieved an area under the curve of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.85), compared with 0.63 and 0.68 for other models. Using cutoffs based on the Youden index, the sensitivity of the XGBoost model was 75%, the specificity was 70%, the accuracy was 70%, the positive predictive value was 1.2%, and the negative predictive value was > 99%. The XGBoost model obtained a positive predictive value of at least 2.5% with a sensitivity of 38%. The XGBoost model was the only model that detected at least 50% of patients with cancer one year after the onset of diabetes. All three models had similar features that predicted pancreatic cancer, including older age, weight loss, and the rapid destabilization of glucose homeostasis.

- **Conclusion**: Machine learning models isolate a high-risk cohort from those with new-onset diabetes at risk for pancreatic cancer.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^116LGCR9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Previous reviews have explored machine learning techniques in diabetes, yet with a substantially different focus. Sambyal et al. conducted a review on microvascular complications in diabetes, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. This review included 31 studies classified into three groups according to the methods used: statistical techniques, machine learning, and deep learning. The authors concluded that machine learning and deep learning models are more suited for big data scenarios and observed that the combination of models (ensemble models) produced improved performance.

Islam et al. conducted a review with a meta-analysis on deep learning models to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in retinal fundus images. This review included 23 studies, out of which 20 were also included for meta-analysis. For each study, the authors identified the model, the dataset, and the performance metrics, concluding that automated tools could perform DR screening.

Chaki et al. reviewed machine learning models in diabetes detection. The review included 107 studies, classified them according to the model or classifier, the dataset, the features selection with four possible kinds of features, and their performance. The authors found that text, shape, and texture features produced better outcomes. They also found that DNNs and SVMs delivered better classification outcomes, followed by RFs.

Finally, Silva et al. reviewed 27 studies, including 40 predictive models for diabetes. They extracted the technique used, the temporality of prediction, and the risk of bias.

### Application of machine learning models to evaluate hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes [^115TV31y]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Machine learning models built with real-world data can be informative tools for the development of value-based contracts. The models developed in this study accurately identified patients at risk of critical clinical outcomes, including hypoglycemia, while uncovering the primary risk factors of those outcomes in a real-world setting. The ability of Bayesian network models to extract and perform inference in high-dimensional data is essential for guiding clinical practice, where "black box" technology is untrustworthy and holistic approaches are merited. This study also demonstrated the potential economic impact of deploying machine learning models in practice by quantifying resource use and costs in patients with the highest predicted risk of hypoglycemia.

Indeed, targeted interventions towards high-risk patients may additionally benefit economic outcomes relevant to key stakeholders in competitive therapeutic areas like diabetes. As the healthcare industry moves toward value-based care reimbursement models, it becomes critical for pharmaceutical companies to work effectively with health plans by providing key insights into optimal treatment intervention strategies for members at risk of poor clinical and economic outcomes.

### Revolutionizing diabetes care: The role of artificial intelligence in prevention, diagnosis, and patient care [^114PDirH]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Millions of people worldwide have diabetes, a disease that is becoming more common and has substantial socioeconomic costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) improves diabetes management, diagnosis, and prevention. AI-powered tools enable early detection of diabetes and its complications, including diabetic retinopathy, using sophisticated algorithms and large-scale data analysis. Wearable devices and continuous glucose monitors, integrated with AI, facilitate personalized treatment plans and real-time insights, improving glycemic control and overall health outcomes. Advanced machine learning models demonstrate high accuracy in diagnosing and predicting diabetes, while automated insulin delivery systems and bolus calculators enhance insulin management, reducing risks of hypo- and hyperglycemia. Despite these advancements, challenges such as cost, accessibility, device interoperability, and ethical considerations persist.

The development of new digital biomarkers, individualized clinical metrics, and patient-centric solutions is critical for optimizing care. While AI holds immense promise in alleviating the global diabetes burden, addressing these limitations through sustained innovation and collaboration is essential. This review underscores the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing diabetes care, enabling advancement for enhanced prevention, precise diagnosis, and effective management strategies.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^111U38Pn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Low credibility.

Modern RCTs are both resource and time-intensive, particularly when evaluating the effects of novel therapies on major clinical endpoints. Federated analytic approaches that utilize large-scale, multinational, real-world databases, such as the Large-scale evidence generation and evaluation across a network of databases for type 2 diabetes mellitus (LEGEND-T2DM) initiative, are currently underway to enable comparative effectiveness analysis through both traditional and ML-driven big data approaches.

- **Causal inference from observational data**: This facet of research employs sophisticated methodologies to draw causal conclusions from data that is not derived from randomly controlled trials. The integration of machine learning (ML) with these databases facilitates a more comprehensive analysis of treatment outcomes, offering potential advancements in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Predicting response to bolus insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113NX4F5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model to classify people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) into expected levels of success upon bolus insulin initiation.

- **Methods**: Machine learning methods were applied to a large nationally representative insurance claims database from the United States (dNHI database; data from 2007 to 2017). We trained boosted decision tree ensembles (XGBoost) to assign people into Class 0 (never meeting HbA1c goal), Class 1 (meeting but not maintaining HbA1c goal), or Class 2 (meeting and maintaining HbA1c goal) based on the demographic and clinical data available prior to initiating bolus insulin. The primary objective of the study was to develop a model capable of determining at an individual level, whether people with T2D are likely to achieve and maintain HbA1c goals. HbA1c goal was defined at 1.0%.

- **Results**: Of 15,331 people with T2D (mean age, 53.0 years; SD, 8.7), 7,800 (50.9%) people met HbA1c goal but failed to maintain that goal (Class 1), 4,510 (29.4%) never attained this goal (Class 0), and 3,021 (19.7%) people met and maintained this goal (Class 2). Overall, the model's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was 0.79, with greater performance on predicting those in Class 2 (ROC = 0.92) than those in Classes 0 and 1 (ROC = 0.71 and 0.62, respectively). The model achieved high area under the precision-recall curves for the individual classes (Class 0, 0.46; Class 1, 0.58; Class 2, 0.71).

In conclusion, predictive modeling using routine healthcare data reasonably accurately classified individuals based on their likelihood to achieve and maintain HbA1c goals.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^115pJspr]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We assessed the performance of the models using measures of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination describes the ability of the model to distinguish those at high risk of developing diabetes from those at low risk. The discrimination was examined by calculating Harrell's C (comparable with the area under the ROC curve), accounting for censored data. Calibration indicates the ability of the model to correctly estimate the absolute risks and was examined by calibration plots. In a calibration plot, the predicted risk is plotted against the observed incidence of the outcome. Ideally, the predicted risk equals the observed incidence throughout the entire risk spectrum and the calibration plot follows the 45° line. The calibration plot was extended to a "validation" plot as a summary tool.

Appendix 2 gives more details on the information provided by this plot. Calibration was also tested with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic for time to event data. Follow-up of our cohort was almost complete until about eight years: 3% were censored at 5 years, 5% at 7.5 years, and 44.6% at 10 years. To account for censoring when obtaining the observed probabilities for assessing calibration over, say, 10 years of follow-up, we first calculated for each individual the linear predictor and subsequently the 10-year predicted outcome probability using the original survival models. This predicted probability was then divided into tenths, and we performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis per tenth, which accounts for the observed censoring. For each tenth, we obtained at the 10-year time point the observed outcome.

### A machine learning approach to predict foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes [^114kwr5J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

The study employed a cross-sectional design, with data collected between November 2023 and February 2024. It aimed to identify predictors of lower levels of foot care self-management in older adults with diabetes using a machine learning approach. The research was conducted and presented in line with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

- **Study setting and sample**: The study took place in a public hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, between November 2023 and January 2024. Patients admitted to the endocrinology and metabolic disorders department of the hospital were included. Convenience sampling was used to select participants. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 years or older, diagnosed with diabetes for at least six months, absence of cognitive disorders, and willingness to participate. Patients with a diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcers or a history of diabetic foot ulcers or amputation were excluded. Forty-two patients were excluded due to a history of diabetic foot ulcers. Two patients were excluded because of cognitive impairment; both were diagnosed with dementia by a neurologist, confirmed by electronic records.

Written permission was obtained from the medical research ethics committee of Uskudar University under protocol number 2023–54.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^111y7Ua1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The prediction of blood glucose (BG) levels is crucial for maintaining them within the normal range (70–120 mg/dL or 3.6–6.9 mmol/L). Maintaining BG levels at the desired level in diabetic individuals is challenging due to the precise glycemic control required when using bolus insulin injections, which may elevate the risk of hypoglycemic incidents. To assist in managing BG levels, closed-loop systems and computational methods have been developed.

Modeling and controlling are two primary challenges in comprehensive diabetes management. Modeling involves developing a precise BG forecasting model based on several variables, while controlling refers to applying the developed model to predict BG levels and propose recommendations. The algorithms utilized for BG prediction are crucial for developing closed-loop insulin delivery and decision support systems for controlling BG levels in diabetes. Multitask learning is an efficient method for leveraging data from numerous cases while still learning accurate personalized models. This approach demonstrated stable performance in predictive metrics at both long-term and short-term prediction horizons.

The predictive accuracy, as measured by RMSE, was 18.8, 25.3, 31.8, 41.2, and 47.2 mg/dL for 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120-minute prediction horizons, respectively, with approximately 93% clinically admissible predictions using the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (EGA). The results indicated the success of multitask learning compared to sequential transfer learning. In another study, a multisource…

### Evaluation of machine learning methods developed for prediction of diabetes complications: A systematic review [^115nDTRe]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). High credibility.

With the rising prevalence of diabetes, machine learning (ML) models have been increasingly used for the prediction of diabetes and its complications due to their ability to handle large complex data sets. This study aims to evaluate the quality and performance of ML models developed to predict microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications in an adult Type 2 diabetes population.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE®, Embase®, the Cochrane® Library, Web of Science®, and DBLP Computer Science Bibliography databases according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Studies that developed or validated ML prediction models for microvascular or macrovascular complications in people with Type 2 diabetes were included. Prediction performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AUC > 0.75 indicates clearly useful discrimination performance, while a positive mean relative AUC difference indicates better comparative model performance.

- **Results**: Of 13,606 articles screened, 32 studies comprising 87 ML models were included. Neural networks (n = 15) were the most frequently utilized. Age, duration of diabetes, and body mass index were common predictors in ML models. Across predicted outcomes, 36% of the models demonstrated clearly useful discrimination. Most ML models reported positive mean relative AUC compared with non-ML methods, with random forest showing the best overall performance for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. The majority (n = 31) of models demonstrated improved comparative performance.

### Prediction model for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its association with mortality using machine learning in three independent cohorts from South Korea, Japan, and the UK: A model development and validation study [^117D3eDq]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this study suggest that the early prediction of incident T2DM can significantly influence public health policy and clinical practice, particularly when designing targeted prevention strategies. The ability to predict the likelihood of incident T2DM within five years based on routine national health checkups offers a significant clinical benefit, as it allows for early preventive interventions that could drastically reduce the disease burden. Health systems, particularly in countries with a high T2DM incidence, could implement these predictive models as part of routine health checkups to identify high-risk individuals. Moreover, the strong association between T2DM risk and mortality enhances its utility in clinical decision-making, enabling more aggressive management of risk factors in those at elevated risk. Because the model has been validated across multiple countries, it holds great potential as a widely used platform, providing clinicians with valuable tools for both disease prevention and mortality reduction.

One of the key strengths of this study is the use of large-scale population-based cohorts from three countries, which enhances the generalizability of the findings. This study also benefits from rigorous external validation and the application of advanced ML techniques, contributing to the predictive models' robustness. However, findings from this study must be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the reliance on routinely collected health checkup data meant that some potentially relevant variables, such as genetic factors or detailed diet, were not included.

### Artificial intelligence in diabetes care: Applications, challenges, and opportunities ahead [^111C9Vdi]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming clinical medicine, and its potential impact on diabetes care is particularly noteworthy. In recent years, both traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning algorithms have been applied to improve screening for complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, macular edema, and neuropathy; predict disease progression risk; and enhance clinical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment optimization. AI-driven solutions are also emerging to identify noninvasive biomarkers for detecting diabetes and prediabetes, analyze the macronutrient content of meals using image-based deep learning methods, integrate novel risk prediction tools within electronic health records, and optimize automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.

These advancements hold promise for streamlining patient care, personalizing treatment plans, and ultimately improving clinical outcomes. In this narrative review, we examine the latest AI applications in diabetes care, exploring their capabilities, limitations, and the future directions necessary to realize their full potential to improve the care of people living with diabetes.

### Artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting cardio-cerebrovascular risk in type 2 diabetes: Concordance with clinical and instrumental assessments [^116f2bRG]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm in estimating the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).

- **Methods**: Medical records of 532 T2D patients from the Diabetology Unit in Padova, Italy, were analyzed using the Metaclinic AI Prediction Module, which estimates the probability of heart and cerebrovascular organ damage. For patients identified as "Very high" (n = 63) or "Low" (n = 122) risk for heart disease, additional clinical and instrumental data on their cardiac history were collected. The level of agreement between AI predictions and traditional clinical-instrumental diagnostics was assessed using Cohen's κ coefficient.

- **Results**: In the "Very high" risk group, the agreement between AI predictions and clinical diagnostics for heart disease was poor (κ = 0.00), while prediction for cerebrovascular disease showed excellent agreement (κ = 0.89). Similarly, in the "Low" risk group, agreement for heart disease remained poor (κ = 0.00), but agreement for cerebrovascular disease was again high (κ = 0.83).

- **Conclusions**: A marked difference was observed in the algorithm's performance. While the AI showed strong predictive ability for cerebrovascular complications, it failed to reliably predict heart disease risk. These results suggest that the algorithm may be clinically valuable for cerebrovascular risk assessment but needs refinement for cardiac prediction.

### Toward big data analytics: Review of predictive models in management of diabetes and its complications [^117CjtdB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetes is one of the top priorities in medical science and health care management, and an abundance of data and information is available on these patients. Whether data stem from statistical models or complex pattern recognition models, they may be fused into predictive models that combine patient information and prognostic outcome results. Such knowledge could be used in clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and public health management to improve patient care.

Our aim was to review the literature and give an introduction to predictive models in screening for and the management of prevalent short- and long-term complications in diabetes. Predictive models have been developed for management of diabetes and its complications, and the number of publications on such models has been growing over the past decade. Often, multiple logistic or a similar linear regression is used for prediction model development, possibly owing to its transparent functionality. Ultimately, for prediction models to prove useful, they must demonstrate impact; namely, their use must generate better patient outcomes. Although extensive effort has been put into building these predictive models, there is a remarkable scarcity of impact studies.

### Predictors of metformin failure: Repurposing electronic health record data to identify high-risk patients [^111SFjy1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Metformin is the first-line drug for treating diabetes but has a high failure rate. The objective of this study was to identify demographic and clinical factors available in the electronic health record (EHR) that predict metformin failure.

A cohort of patients with at least one abnormal diabetes screening test who initiated metformin was identified at three sites: Arizona, Mississippi, and Minnesota. We identified 22,047 metformin initiators (48% female, mean age of 57 ± 14 years), including 2,141 African Americans, 440 Asians, 962 Other/Multiracial, 1,539 Hispanics, and 16,764 non-Hispanic White people. Metformin failure was defined as either the lack of a target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (< 7%) within 18 months of index or the start of dual therapy. We used tree-based extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models to assess overall risk prediction performance and the relative contribution of individual factors when using EHR data for the risk of metformin failure.

In this large diverse population, we observed a high rate of metformin failure (43%). The XGBoost model that included baseline HbA1c, age, sex, and race/ethnicity corresponded to high discrimination performance (C-index of 0.731; 95% CI 0.722, 0.740) for the risk of metformin failure. Baseline HbA1c corresponded to the largest feature performance, with higher levels associated with metformin failure. The addition of other clinical factors improved model performance (0.745; 95% CI 0.737, 0.754, P < .0001).

In conclusion, baseline HbA1c was the strongest predictor of metformin failure, and additional factors substantially improved the model's predictive capability.

### Classification of hypoglycemic events in type 1 diabetes using machine learning algorithms [^114ADbiz]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

The results of the initial training of the algorithm indicate that the method developed in this study generalizes well to unseen data, given the fact that the initial validation was only conducted with 'unknown' patients. From a performance perspective, this strategy is a rather conservative approach, since the model is only evaluated based on its ability to classify new patients correctly. In real-world use, we would have a mix of known and unknown patients, as included in our 'benchmark' test. However, a broader test cohort is required to ensure model robustness and reliability in other patient populations in which the treatment regimens can differ.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^113PuZz6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The application of ML and DL models for the management, prediction, and detection of diabetes has seen significant advancements. Early diagnosis and forecasting of diabetes occurrence through the measurement of several baseline factors could diminish future complications. However, the slight incidence rate of diabetes presents a major challenge in accurately predicting the diabetic class as opposed to the non-diabetic one. To overcome this difficulty, various ML and DL algorithms have been developed, which are overviewed in the following sections for each diabetes type.

### Machine-learning-based early prediction of end-stage renal disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease using clinical trials data [^115YYLfQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Blood pressure lowering with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline-recommended treatments to slow the progression of DKD. However, individual patients show significant variation in disease progression, likely due to the complex, heterogeneous nature of the disease. There is a need for a robust and efficient tool to identify patients at the highest risk of developing ESRD and those who require stringent monitoring and treatment intensification.

In practice, albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the main predictors of the progression of DKD. However, a recent study suggests that the margin of error for all eGFR formulae is high, making it a less reliable tool for assessing overall renal function. The primary reason is that the coefficients used in eGFR formulae are population-based and less efficient at an individual level. Various renal risk scores have been developed using traditional epidemiological tools, such as Cox regression or logistic regression, for predicting ESRD. The last decade has seen a significant rise in computational processes for predictive analytics using machine-learning techniques. Unlike traditional statistical approaches where preselected clinical characteristics are used in the prediction, machine-learning techniques can automatically identify important characteristics to predict ESRD. Several methods have already been explored.

### Prediction models for risk of developing type 2 diabetes: Systematic literature search and independent external validation study [^115BsK2D]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Differences in the incidence of diabetes in our cohort and in the development populations led to significant deviation between observed risk in our cohort and predicted risk estimated by the prediction model. To reduce this source of miscalibration, we recalibrated each prediction model by adjusting the intercept for logistic regression models or the baseline survival function for survival regression models.

The original models were developed for different time periods of risk prediction, known as "prediction horizons" — for instance, some models estimate 5-year risk and others 10-year risk. We therefore assessed the performance of each model for prediction of risk at 5, 7.5, and 10 years to account for the different time periods. For example, for 5-year risk, we considered individuals as incident cases if they had developed diabetes within the first five years of follow-up. Participants who developed diabetes after more than five years of follow-up were included in 5-year predictions as non-cases. A similar approach was followed for 7.5 and 10-year predictions. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the prediction horizon for which each model was developed in case this differed from 5, 7.5, or 10 years.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^115BryyK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The overview of the published papers discloses that machine learning models can effectively improve the prediction and management of blood glucose and diabetes. However, they should be improved and surveyed in large datasets. A significant advantage of these models is that they can be used as an application on mobile or any other diabetes management device. This can help ensure the health of diabetic patients and also prevent further complications. Moreover, finding potential risk factors can help assess healthy subjects to prevent getting diabetes. It is predicted that the future prognosis of diseases and therapy lines depends on developing powerful machine learning methods.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^116JWY3m]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Over the last few years, humanity has achieved technological breakthroughs in computer science, material science, biotechnology, genomics, and proteomics. These disruptive technologies are shifting the paradigm of medical practice. In particular, artificial intelligence and big data are reshaping disease and patient management, shifting to personalized diagnosis and treatment. This shift enables public health to become predictive and preventive.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that aims to create computer systems that discover patterns in training data to perform classification and prediction tasks on new data. Machine learning puts together tools from statistics, data mining, and optimization to generate models.

Representational learning, a subarea of machine learning, focuses on automatically finding an accurate representation of the knowledge extracted from the data. When this representation comprises many layers (i.e. a multi-level representation), we are dealing with deep learning.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^117Cs7tq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Developing and evaluating clinical machine learning models requires an understanding of the principal tenets of model development and evaluation. This understanding is essential for interpreting the evidence. These concepts are broad, applicable across a range of clinical conditions and ML tasks, and represent the foundations of critical AI and ML appraisal.

- **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**: Though AI and ML are inextricably linked, they are not identical terms. Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes the ability of a machine to perform tasks that are typical of human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, problem-solving, or creative tasks like generating images and text. On the other hand, the process through which an AI system acquires this ability, learning and improving from experience and observed data to make predictions about new or unseen cases, is called Machine Learning (ML).

- **Model training**: The specific step during which a model learns from data is also known as training, whereas the respective dataset is referred to as the training set. Here, the model makes predictions and subsequently adjusts its parameters based on a metric that quantifies how good or bad the predictions are (loss function). It is typical during training for the model to be applied to an unseen group of observations (validation set) to get a more reliable assessment of performance on unseen data. Further testing in external sets drawn from geographically and temporally distinct populations can serve to solidify claims about external model validity.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^112Ru6q5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetes, as a metabolic illness, can be characterized by increased amounts of blood glucose. This abnormal increase can lead to detrimentally affect other organs, such as the kidneys, eyes, heart, nerves, and blood vessels. Therefore, its prediction, prognosis, and management are essential to prevent harmful effects and recommend more effective treatments. For these goals, machine learning algorithms have gained considerable attention and have been developed successfully. This review surveys the recently proposed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for the aforementioned objectives. The reported results indicate that ML and DL algorithms are promising approaches for controlling blood glucose and diabetes. However, they should be improved and employed in large datasets to affirm their applicability.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^1163gHQN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a severe, chronic disease that occurs when blood glucose levels rise above certain limits. Over recent years, machine and deep learning techniques have been employed to predict diabetes and its complications. However, researchers and developers still face two main challenges when building type 2 diabetes predictive models. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in previous studies regarding the techniques used, making it challenging to identify the optimal one. Second, there is a lack of transparency about the features used in the models, reducing their interpretability. This systematic review aimed to provide answers to these challenges. The review followed the PRISMA methodology, enriched with the one proposed by Keele and Durham Universities.

Ninety studies were included, from which the type of model, complementary techniques, dataset, and performance parameters were extracted. Eighteen different types of models were compared, with tree-based algorithms showing top performances. Deep neural networks proved suboptimal, despite their ability to handle big and dirty data. Balancing data and feature selection techniques proved helpful in increasing the model's efficiency. Models trained on tidy datasets achieved near-perfect results.

### Machine learning in precision diabetes care and cardiovascular risk prediction [^112DEvdX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Low credibility.

Key methodological considerations when interpreting ML models are essential to their effective use.

- **Finding the best algorithm**: In the ML literature, it is widely recognized that having a priori knowledge of an optimal algorithm is challenging for any given task. This assessment often depends on the underlying dataset and the performance metric utilized; however, for any given algorithm, performance may still vary with the tuning of model-specific hyperparameters. These are values used to control the training process that are external to the model and cannot be computed from the data.

- **Complex models vs. less complex models**: There is a common misconception that for any given dataset, complex models will always outperform less complex ones. This may be true for tasks involving unstructured data — in particular, biomedical images and videos — where deep learning (DL) models enable automatic learning and hierarchical combination of key spatial and temporal features, rather than relying on hand-engineered features. DL models are robust to variations, scalable, and transferrable across different tasks. However, for structured datasets, such as databases of clinical information used for predictive modeling, the performance of easily interpretable models, such as logistic regression, is often comparable to that of complex models like extreme gradient boosting or neural network methods.

- **Overfitting in complex models**: Complex models are susceptible to learning noise that may not generalize to new datasets (overfitting). In this context, careful consideration of the available data and training plan, such as cross-validation, as well as strict separation of training and testing datasets, is warranted to maximize external validity.

### A stacked ensemble machine learning approach for the prediction of diabetes [^117VdKnB]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes has become a leading cause of mortality in both developed and developing countries, impacting a growing number of individuals worldwide. As the prevalence of the disease continues to rise, researchers have diligently worked towards developing accurate diabetes prediction models. The primary aim of this study is to utilize a diverse set of machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of diabetes, particularly in females, at an early stage. By leveraging these methods, this research seeks to provide physicians with valuable tools to identify the disease early, enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

- **Methods**: In this study, some state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, such as random forest classifiers with gridsearchCV, XGBoost, NGBoost, Bagging, LightGBM, and AdaBoost classifiers, were employed. These models were chosen as the base layer of our proposed stacked ensemble model because of their high accuracy. Before feeding the data into the models, the dataset was preprocessed to ensure optimal performance and obtain improved results.

- **Results**: The accuracy achieved in this study was 92.91%, which demonstrates its competitiveness with the existing approaches. Moreover, the utilization of the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) facilitated the interpretation of machine learning models.

- **Conclusion**: We anticipate that these findings will be beneficial to healthcare providers, stakeholders, students, and researchers involved in diabetes prediction research and development.

### Not there yet: Using data-driven methods to predict who becomes costly among low-cost patients with type 2 diabetes [^111SADBi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of Medicare spending; predicting which individuals are likely to be costly is essential for targeting interventions. Approaches generally focus on composite measures, short time horizons, or patients who are already high utilizers, whose costs may be harder to modify. Thus, we used data-driven methods to classify unique clusters in Medicare claims for those who were initially low utilizers by their diabetes spending patterns in subsequent years and applied machine learning to predict these patterns.

- **Methods**: We identified beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes whose spending was in the bottom 90% of diabetes care spending in a one-year baseline period in Medicare fee-for-service data. We used group-based trajectory modeling to classify unique clusters of patients by diabetes-related spending patterns over a two-year follow-up. Prediction models were estimated with generalized boosted regression, a machine learning method, using sets of all baseline predictors, diabetes predictors, and predictors that are potentially modifiable through interventions. Each model was evaluated through C-statistics and 5-fold cross-validation.

- **Results**: Among 33,789 beneficiaries (baseline median diabetes spending: $4,153), we identified five distinct spending patterns that could largely be predicted; of these, 68.1% of patients had consistent spending, 25.3% had spending that rose quickly, and 6.6% of patients had spending that rose progressively. The ability to predict these groups was moderate (validated C-statistics: 0.63 to 0.87).

### Application of machine learning models to evaluate hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes [^11216hJ5]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to identify predictors of hypoglycemia and five other clinical and economic outcomes among treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using machine learning and structured data from a large, geographically diverse administrative claims database.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study design was applied to Optum Clinformatics claims data indexed on the first antidiabetic prescription date. A hypothesis-free, Bayesian machine learning analytics platform (GNS Healthcare REFS™: Reverse Engineering and Forward Simulation) was used to build ensembles of generalized linear models to predict six outcomes defined in patients' 1-year post-index claims history, including hypoglycemia, antidiabetic class persistence, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target attainment, HbA1c change, T2D-related inpatient admissions, and T2D-related medical costs. A unified set of 388 variables defined in patients' 1-year pre-index claims history constituted the set of predictors for all REFS models.

- **Results**: The derivation cohort comprised 453,487 patients with a T2D diagnosis between 2014 and 2017. Patients with comorbid conditions had the highest risk of hypoglycemia, including those with prior hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 25.61) and anemia (OR = 1.29). Other identified risk factors included insulin (OR = 2.84) and sulfonylurea use (OR = 1.80). Biguanide use (OR = 0.75), high blood glucose (> 125 mg/dL vs. < 100 mg/dL, OR = 0.47; 100–125 mg/dL vs. < 100 mg/dL, OR = 0.53), and missing blood glucose test (OR = 0.40) were associated with reduced risk of hypoglycemia.

### Machine learning and deep learning predictive models for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review [^1137baew]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

The 261 articles above were assessed for quality and classified into their corresponding subgroup for each quality question (Fig. 2).

- **Figure 2**: Percentage of each subgroup in the quality assessment. The criteria do not apply to two results for the quality assessment questions 1 and 3.

The first question classified the studies by the type of database used for building the models. The third subgroup represents the most desirable scenario. It includes studies where models were trained using features from electronic health records or a mix of datasets including lifestyle, socio-demographic, and health diagnosis features. There were 22, 85, and 154 articles in subgroups one to three, respectively.

The second question classified the studies by the type of model used. Again, the third subgroup represents the most suitable subgroup as it contains studies where a machine learning model was used to predict diabetes onset. There were 46 studies in subgroup one, 66 in subgroup two, and 147 in subgroup three. Two studies were omitted from these subgroups: one used a cancer-related model; another used a model of no interest to this review.

The third question clustered the studies based on their validation metrics. There were 25 studies in subgroup one (semi-supervised learning), 68 in subgroup two (only one validation metric), and 166 in subgroup three (validation parameters). The criteria are not applied to two studies as they used special error metrics, making it impossible to compare their models with the rest.

### Is handling unbalanced datasets for machine learning uplifts system performance? A case of diabetic prediction [^1115zpMd]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Healthcare is a sensitive sector, and addressing class imbalance in this domain is a time-consuming task for machine learning-based systems due to the vast amount of data. This study examines the impact of socioeconomic disparities on the healthcare data of diabetic patients to make accurate disease predictions.

- **Methods**: This study proposed a systematic approach of Closest Distance Ranking and Principal Component Analysis to handle the unbalanced dataset. A typical machine learning technique was utilized to analyze the proposed approach. The dataset of pregnant diabetic women is analyzed for accurate detection.

- **Results**: The results are analyzed using sensitivity, demonstrating that the minority class's lack of information makes it difficult to forecast outcomes. Conversely, the unbalanced dataset was treated using the proposed technique and evaluated with the machine learning algorithm, which significantly improved system performance.

- **Conclusion**: The performance of the machine learning-based system was significantly enhanced by processing the unbalanced dataset with the proposed technique and evaluating it with the machine learning algorithm. For the first time, an unbalanced dataset was treated with a combination of Closest Distance Ranking and Principal Component Analysis.

### An early prediction model for gestational diabetes mellitus created using machine learning algorithms [^11699AvN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

To investigate high-risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in early pregnancy, an analysis of demographic and clinical data was performed. The study aimed to develop a machine-learning-based prediction model to enhance early diagnosis and intervention.

A retrospective study was conducted involving 942 pregnant women. A stacking ensemble (machine learning [ML]) approach was applied to demographic and clinical variables, creating a predictive model for GDM. Model performance was evaluated through receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Risk stratification was performed using quartile-based probability thresholds, and predictive accuracy was validated using an independent dataset.

Significant predictors for GDM included age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), history of GDM, family history of diabetes, history of fetal macrosomia, education level, history of hypertension, and gravidity. These factors, which can be collected non-invasively at the first prenatal visit, formed the basis of a robust predictive model with an AUC of 0.89. The model demonstrated a strong ability to exclude GDM at a threshold of 28.53%.

The machine-learning-based prediction model effectively identifies populations at high risk for GDM before invasive testing and oral glucose tolerance test, facilitating early clinical intervention and resource optimization.

### Performance analysis and prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on lifestyle data using machine learning approaches [^113Tndvv]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a chronic, fatal disease affecting millions globally. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of the affected population among all types of diabetes. Many T2DM patients remain undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness and under-resourced healthcare systems. There is a dire need for a diagnostic and prognostic tool to assist healthcare providers, clinicians, and practitioners with early prediction. Such a tool could recommend lifestyle changes required to prevent the progression of diabetes. This research aims to develop a framework based on machine learning techniques using only lifestyle indicators to predict T2DM. Notably, the prediction model can be used without clinical lab visits and hospital readmissions.

A proposed framework is presented and implemented based on machine learning paradigms utilizing lifestyle indicators for improved prediction of T2DM. The research involved experts such as diabetologists, endocrinologists, dieticians, and nutritionists in selecting the contributing 1,552 instances and 11 lifestyle biological features to promote health and manage T2DM complications. The dataset was collected through surveys and Google Forms from various geographical regions.

Seven machine learning classifiers were employed: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB).

### Application of machine learning models to evaluate hypoglycemia risk in type 2 diabetes [^114fVM8x]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

One limitation of this study related to sample selection. The HbA1c target attainment outcome required at least one post-index laboratory measurement for HbA1c in addition to the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above. The change from baseline HbA1c outcome similarly required both pre- and post-index laboratory measurements for HbA1c, and additionally that patients' pre-index HbA1c level was at least 8%. As such, models built for these outcomes have slightly different study populations and should be interpreted accordingly.

A second limitation of this study relates to a fundamental aspect of predictive modeling; specifically, it cannot answer questions of a causal nature. This is especially true for administrative claims data, where medications, diagnoses, procedures, laboratory tests, etc. are heavily confounded by a variety of factors, notably:

- **Access to healthcare**: Proximity to medical facilities, cultural obstacles related to treatment, educational and socioeconomic status.
- **Bias on the part of the physician**: Past experiences with a particular treatment, history with a particular patient.
- **Patients' underlying disease severity**: Confounding by indication.
- **Non-random treatment assignment for novel therapies**: Channeling bias.
- **Healthy adherer bias**.

In the context of this study, antidiabetic prescriptions (such as insulin) can be stronger predictors of patients' underlying T2D severity than T2D diagnosis codes extracted from medical claims, as they represent a decision made on behalf of the provider to intensify treatment of the patient's T2D.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^111BLPQx]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

Metformin is the common first-line drug for the treatment of prediabetes and T2DM; however, it fails in the treatment of a third of cases. A machine learning model was developed to predict blood glucose control in patients who have consumed metformin after one year of therapy. Predictors were derived from four main features: baseline HbA1c level, comorbidities, demographic variables, and baseline metformin dosage.

A total of 20 base models containing a broad diversity of underlying methods, including RL both with and without regularization and/or stepwise feature selection, tree-based models, SVM, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and flexible discriminants, were constructed. The ensemble models comprised a non-linear stack of all base models, a linear stack of all base models, and a linear stack of a subset of maximally diverse models.

The basic approach underlying stacking trained a pool of base classifiers on a training set and then trained another classifier, named a combiner, on the predictions of the base classifiers. Various ML models were trained by employing variables existent at the time of metformin initiation for predicting the attainment and maintaining HbA1c < 7.0% after one year of treatment. AUC performances ranged from 0.58 to 0.75. The most important features were the baseline HbA1c, the presence of diabetes with complications, and the starting metformin dosage.

One of the main duties of precision medicine is developing Individualized Treatment Rules (ITRs) for patients with heterogeneous responses.

### Machine learning methods to predict diabetes complications [^1154j65A]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

One of the areas where artificial intelligence is having more impact is machine learning, which develops algorithms able to learn patterns and decision rules from data. Machine learning algorithms have been embedded in mining pipelines, which can combine them with classical statistical strategies to extract knowledge from data. Within the EU-funded MOSAIC project, a data mining pipeline has been used to derive a set of predictive models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complications based on electronic health record data of nearly one thousand patients.

- **Pipeline components**: The pipeline comprises clinical center profiling, predictive model targeting, predictive model construction, and model validation. After addressing missing data using random forest (RF) and applying suitable strategies to handle class imbalance, we used logistic regression with stepwise feature selection to predict the onset of retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy at different time scenarios: 3, 5, and 7 years from the first visit at the Hospital Center for Diabetes (not from the diagnosis).

- **Considered variables**: Considered variables include gender, age, time from diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, and smoking habit. Final models, tailored in accordance with the complications, provided an accuracy of up to 0.838. Different variables were selected for each complication and time scenario, leading to specialized models that are easy to translate into clinical practice.

### Machine learning techniques to predict the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy: a literature review [^114fsba4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a major public health challenge with widespread prevalence, often leading to complications such as diabetic nephropathy (DN) — a chronic condition that progressively impairs kidney function. In this context, it is important to evaluate if machine learning models can exploit the inherent temporal factor in clinical data to predict the risk of developing DN faster and more accurately than clinical models.

- **Methods**: Three different databases were used for this literature review: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. Only articles written in English and published between January 2015 and December 2022 were included.

- **Results**: We included 11 studies, from which we discuss a number of algorithms capable of extracting knowledge from clinical data, incorporating dynamic aspects in patient assessment, and exploring their evolution over time. We also present a comparison of the different approaches, their performance, advantages, disadvantages, interpretation, and the value that the time factor can bring to a more successful prediction of diabetic nephropathy.

- **Conclusion**: Our analysis showed that some studies ignored the temporal factor, while others partially exploited it. Greater use of the temporal aspect inherent in Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, together with the integration of omics data, could lead to the development of more reliable and powerful predictive models.

### Predicting 10-year risk of end-organ complications of type 2 diabetes with and without metabolic surgery: A machine learning approach [^1176xcaz]. Diabetes Care (2020). Low credibility.

To construct and internally validate prediction models that estimate the risk of long-term end-organ complications and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, a study was conducted to inform treatment decisions for patients and practitioners considering metabolic surgery.

A total of 2,287 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent metabolic surgery between 1998 and 2017 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System were propensity-matched 1:5 to 11,435 nonsurgical patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and type 2 diabetes who received usual care. Follow-up continued through December 2018. Multivariable time-to-event regression and random forest machine learning models were built and internally validated using fivefold cross-validation to predict the 10-year risk for four outcomes of interest. These prediction models were then used to construct user-friendly web-based and smartphone applications of Individualized Diabetes Complications (IDC) Risk Scores for clinical use.

The prediction tools demonstrated the discrimination ability based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (1 = perfect discrimination and 0.5 = chance) at 10 years in the surgical and nonsurgical groups, respectively: all-cause mortality (0.79 and 0.81), coronary artery events (0.66 and 0.67), heart failure (0.73 and 0.75), and nephropathy (0.73 and 0.76). When a patient's data are entered into the IDC application, it estimates the individualized 10-year morbidity and mortality risks with and without undergoing metabolic surgery.

### Artificial intelligence: The future for diabetes care [^1127fjf4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing field, and its applications to diabetes, a global pandemic, can reform the approach to diagnosis and management of this chronic condition. Principles of machine learning have been used to build algorithms that support predictive models for the risk of developing diabetes or its consequent complications. Digital therapeutics have proven to be an established intervention for lifestyle therapy in the management of diabetes. Patients are increasingly being empowered for self-management of diabetes, benefiting both themselves and healthcare professionals from clinical decision support. AI allows for continuous and burden-free remote monitoring of the patient's symptoms and biomarkers. Furthermore, social media and online communities enhance patient engagement in diabetes care. Technical advances have helped to optimize resource use in diabetes. Together, these intelligent technical reforms have produced better glycemic control, with reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose levels, glucose excursions, and glycosylated hemoglobin. AI will introduce a paradigm shift in diabetes care from conventional management strategies to building targeted data-driven precision care.

### Detection of diabetic patients in people with normal fasting glucose using machine learning [^113XvN3A]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

With the increase of data volume, machine learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize diabetes screening by enabling more accurate risk stratification and timely interventions. The performance of ML-based methods is influenced by the availability of the number of samples and features. For instance, the combination of ML techniques and electronic health record data could enhance the effectiveness of diabetes screening, improving patient outcomes. One of the challenging issues in utilizing ML techniques is selecting the most suitable method to achieve optimal performance on a given dataset. Nearly all machine learning techniques have been applied to diabetes risk prediction, while no single method consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets.

Dinh et al. reported that the model of predicting diabetes with eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) performed better than those of RF, SVM, and LR based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset. With the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD), which is a widely used dataset in diabetes recognition with machine learning, a study constructed 24 classifiers such as decision tree, LR, discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble learners. They found the best accuracy score of 77.9% was produced by the LR model. Jahangir and his colleagues devised an automatic multilayer perceptron model achieving an accuracy of 88.7% on PIDD, although they did not train other machine learning models using processed data. The difference in performance between these two studies may not solely…

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: A comprehensive review [^115LmRZg]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) measurements are sensitive to sensor faults, which can influence blood glucose (BG) prediction. A novel long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model was proposed, considering sensor error, for predicting BG levels. A Kalman smoothing method was employed to modify inaccurate CGM readings due to sensor faults. Various physiological information, including bolus insulin, carbohydrates from meals, Kalman-smoothed CGM data, and cumulative step counts within a constant time interval, were considered. The goal was to reduce the disparity between fingerstick blood glucose measurements and predicted CGM amounts.

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based sensors**: BLE-based sensors could be implemented to trace personal vital sign data. A personalized healthcare monitoring system employs real-time data processing, a BLE-based sensor device, and machine learning (ML)-based approaches to improve the self-management of chronic diabetes situations. BLEs were used to collect vital sign data, such as blood glucose, weight, heart rate, and blood pressure, from sensor nodes to smartphones. Real-time data processing was utilized to manage the large volume of continuously generated sensor data. The outcomes revealed that the suggested real-time data processing and commercial versions of BLE-based sensors were adequately effective in monitoring the vital sign data of diabetic patients. Furthermore, ML-based classification approaches were examined, demonstrating that a multilayer perceptron could provide early diabetes forecasting using sensor data as input with high accuracy.

### Metabolic and genetic markers improve prediction of incident type 2 diabetes: A nested case-control study in Chinese [^115JYxc7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that attempts to predict outcomes by extracting suitable variables from large datasets to build algorithms. Recently, machine learning approaches have been increasingly applied to the clinical epidemiology of diabetes, including risk stratification and personalized medicine decisions. Common machine learning methods include neural networks, boosting machines, and random forests. Tree-based machine learning often helps guide risk prediction and clinical interventions with higher sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, neural networking can be applied to medical image data. Interestingly, machine learning has been used in several -omics studies (genomic, metabonomic, and gut microbiome) along with traditional electronic medical records in diabetes. For example, plasma N-glycans were identified as biomarkers for future T2D risk through a machine learning approach in the EPIC-Potsdam cohort study. Several risk prediction models have been established for T2D. However, no study has focused on using metabolic information to predict T2D using a machine learning method in Chinese individuals of Han ethnicity.

We hypothesized that the combination of metabolic and genetic traits can improve the predictive value for T2D compared to traditional risk factors in the Chinese population. We designed a nested case-control study in the Wuxi Non-Communicable Diseases cohort (Wuxi NCDs cohort), using an untargeted metabonomic strategy and machine learning methods to identify metabolites related to future T2D risk.

### Artificial intelligence perspective in the future of endocrine diseases [^112jLGm4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in the diagnosis, prediction, and management of diseases. The transition from handwritten medical notes to electronic health records and the immense amount of digital data marked the beginning of the big data era in medicine. AI can enhance physician performance and assist in better clinical decision-making, a concept known as augmented intelligence.

The methods applied in the research of AI and endocrinology include machine learning, artificial neural networks, and natural language processing. Research in AI technology is making significant efforts to improve decision support systems for patient use. One of the best-known applications of AI in endocrinology is seen in diabetes management, which includes prediction, diagnosis of diabetes complications (measuring microalbuminuria, retinopathy), and glycemic control. Additionally, AI-related technologies assist in diagnosing other endocrine diseases such as thyroid cancer and osteoporosis. This review provides insight into the development of AI from a perspective focused on endocrinology.
