## Question

what woudl be next steps regarding this FINDINGS:

Lower Thorax: There is mild atelectasis. There is similar bullous change. A moderate hiatal hernia is again visualized.
Liver: Stable tiny likely hepatic cysts, too small to characterize. The liver is otherwise homogeneous without suspicious focal lesions. The liver surface is smooth without significant nodularity.
Gallbladder and Biliary tree: Small enhancing polyps are suggested associated with the gallbladder measuring up to 6 mm. Future ultrasound correlation can be considered for follow-up.

Spleen: The spleen enhances normally.
Pancreas: There is now a cystic lesion in the mid pancreatic body measuring up to 7 mm, indeterminant. Future MR/ CT correlation can be considered with dedicated pancreatic protocol. Differential includes an IPMN cyst.

Adrenal Glands: Stable appearance. Mild adrenal thickening.
Kidneys and Ureters: There is this appearance likely with bilateral parapelvic cysts. No definite hydronephrosis.
Bowel: There is extensive fecal material throughout the colon. There is fecal material distending the rectum in particular. This can be consistent with constipation. There is also colonic diverticulosis. The appendix is not well visualized. There are no suspicious inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant.

Peritoneal/Retroperitoneal Spaces: No large ascites.
Pelvic organs: Bladder is unremarkable.
Lymph Nodes: No significant lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal wall: Appears intact.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next steps for an incidental 7 mm pancreatic cyst (with IPMN in the differential), accompanying 6 mm gallbladder polyps, and other incidental findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to prioritize the findings by malignant potential. Then, I should verify the correct risk stratification framework for the pancreatic cyst (Fukuoka/IAP vs ACG vs AGA vs ACR) and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will determine the best immediate imaging step and timing. After that, I should lay out surveillance intervals and triggers for escalation, including EUS-FNA and MDT referral. Finally, I need to address the gallbladder polyps and the other benign-appearing findings, and close with patient communication and a concrete follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm prioritization by clinical significance. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: among the multiple report findings, the 7 mm pancreatic cyst is the only one with potential (albeit very low) malignant risk and therefore deserves top priority, the 6 mm gallbladder polyps come next given standard surveillance pathways, and the remaining items (mild atelectasis, hiatal hernia, tiny hepatic cysts, parapelvic cysts, diverticulosis/constipation) are typically benign or managed symptomatically rather than via oncologic surveillance frameworks.

> Now, I need to check the correct risk stratification for this pancreatic cyst. At 7 mm, with no described mural nodules, solid components, or main pancreatic duct dilation, and no symptoms or CA 19–9 elevation reported, this falls into a low-risk category by the Fukuoka/IAP construct (no high-risk stigmata or worrisome features) and aligns with conservative management in ACG and AGA guidance, but I should confirm duct communication on MRCP to assess for BD-IPMN versus another cyst type [^114wBdTL] [^111qLifA].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal imaging modality and reconcile guideline nuances. ACG recommends MRI with MRCP as the test of choice for characterization because of superior delineation of ductal communication and lack of radiation, which fits our need to clarify whether this is a BD-IPMN, while ACR Appropriateness Criteria emphasize MRI/MRCP particularly for cysts 2.5 cm or larger or when there are suspicious features; the cyst here is only 7 mm, but it was detected on a nondedicated study and needs proper baseline characterization, so MRI/MRCP remains reasonable and nonurgent in this low-risk scenario [^111qLifA] [^111fdF7B] [^111VeHdH].

> I will now examine timing and technical considerations for MRCP. Let me think about whether to add secretin; secretin-enhanced MRCP can improve visualization of subtle ductal communication and small branch-duct involvement, which is precisely the uncertainty here, so I should consider it if available, schedule MRI/MRCP in about 3–6 months to establish a high-quality baseline, and ensure measurement reproducibility to support surveillance going forward [^113qi2cV] [^111qLifA].

> Next, I should review surveillance intervals if MRI/MRCP confirms low-risk features. ACG uses cyst size to guide intervals and, for very small presumed BD-IPMN or MCN without worrisome features, supports surveillance with lengthening intervals after initial stability; European guidance often begins with a 6-month check then annually thereafter, so hold on, I should verify which to apply here; given 7 mm size and very low risk, a pragmatic ACG-aligned approach is MRI/MRCP at 12 months and, if stable, then every 2 years, with earlier escalation if any worrisome feature appears or growth exceeds meaningful thresholds, and surveillance can be discontinued if the patient is no longer a surgical candidate or per individualized shared decision-making [^117Rd3iY] [^112RxEmR] [^116oJy42].

> I need to ensure I am not over-calling indications for EUS-FNA. The AGA recommends EUS-FNA only when there is a solid component, main duct dilation, or cyst diameter ≥ 3 cm, and ASGE/ACG similarly reserve EUS-FNA or MDT discussion for high-risk stigmata or worrisome features; at 7 mm with no such features, EUS-FNA is not indicated now, but I should double-check for any interval development of nodularity, MPD dilation > 5–7 mm, rapid growth > 3 mm/year, or concerning cytology should sampling ever be performed [^112jrR4m] [^114TSvo9] [^111rc63Y].

> Let me quantify the absolute malignancy risk to ground counseling. In long-term data, incidental cysts < 2 cm carry a pancreatic cancer incidence of approximately 0.9 cases per 1,000 patient-years, which is similar to background risk, reinforcing that surveillance rather than invasive intervention is appropriate here; but wait, I should verify contemporary surveillance cohorts too — more recent analyses confirm low annual growth and rare malignancy, with risk tied more to development of high-risk stigmata than to small size alone [^114Vsziq] [^1129qVF5].

> I will now examine thresholds for multidisciplinary referral and potential surgery. I should confirm that MDT engagement is reserved for main-duct involvement, cysts ≥ 3 cm, mural nodules/solid components, obstructive jaundice, significantly dilated MPD, or worrisome cytology; in a 7 mm lesion without these features, MDT is not needed now, but I need to ensure a low threshold for referral if any Fukuoka "worrisome" or "high-risk" criterion subsequently appears [^111rc63Y] [^114wBdTL] [^114595aH].

> Let me consider the gallbladder polyp next. Although my primary task centers on the pancreatic cyst, 6 mm gallbladder polyps are generally managed with ultrasound surveillance rather than immediate cholecystectomy in average-risk adults, so I should arrange a baseline RUQ ultrasound and interval follow-up if stable; I should confirm institutional protocols and patient-specific risk factors when setting intervals, keeping this separate from the pancreatic cyst pathway and ensuring the patient understands the distinct rationales for each incidental finding [^notfound].

> I should also address the other incidental findings pragmatically. Mild atelectasis commonly needs only clinical correlation, hiatal hernia can be managed symptomatically with acid suppression and referral if severe, and tiny hepatic and parapelvic cysts typically require no specific follow-up; I need to document these clearly to avoid unnecessary alarm while focusing structured surveillance on the pancreas and appropriately monitoring the gallbladder polyps.

> Next, I should review communication and shared decision-making. I will reassure the patient that the malignancy risk for a 7 mm pancreatic cyst is extremely low and that surveillance aims to detect rare changes early while minimizing overtesting; hold on, I should verify I balance risk and burden — editorials emphasize centering patient comorbidity and preferences to avoid overtreatment of small asymptomatic cysts, so I will provide a written plan, discuss stopping rules, and set reminders to reduce anxiety and missed follow-ups [^114Vsziq] [^11643Fw3].

> Finally, I need to ensure a concrete plan and documentation. I will obtain a dedicated pancreas MRI/MRCP (consider secretin) in 3–6 months to establish a high-quality baseline, continue with MRI/MRCP at 12 months and then every 2 years if stable, escalate to EUS-FNA and MDT if any high-risk or worrisome feature emerges, arrange RUQ ultrasound for gallbladder polyp surveillance per local protocol, place problems and surveillance intervals in the EMR, and set automated reminders for imaging and clinic follow-up; this aligns surveillance intensity with risk and preserves options should the risk profile change [^111qLifA] [^117Rd3iY] [^112RxEmR].

Next steps: **MRI/MRCP with pancreatic protocol** [^111qLifA] within 3–6 months to characterize the 7-mm pancreatic cyst and assess for ductal communication [^113qi2cV] or mural nodules [^114595aH]. If worrisome features are present, proceed to **EUS-FNA** [^111rc63Y] with cyst fluid analysis (CEA [^113MuFJb], cytology, KRAS/GNAS [^112X2Mgm]). For 6-mm gallbladder polyps, obtain **ultrasound** in 6–12 months and consider cholecystectomy if they grow, become symptomatic, or exceed 10 mm. For hepatic or renal cysts, **no immediate intervention is needed**; manage constipation with dietary measures and follow diverticulosis as clinically indicated.

## Pancreatic cystic lesion (7 mm, indeterminate, possible IPMN)

### Recommended next steps

- **MRI/MRCP with pancreatic protocol** [^111qLifA] — Obtain within 3–6 months to assess cyst morphology, ductal communication [^113qi2cV], and mural nodules [^111qNyoF].

- **EUS-FNA** [^114TSvo9] — If MRI/MRCP shows worrisome features [^111rc63Y] (mural nodule, main duct > 5 mm, or rapid growth), perform EUS-FNA with cyst fluid CEA [^113MuFJb], cytology, and KRAS/GNAS mutation analysis [^112X2Mgm].

- **Surveillance** [^112RxEmR] — If no worrisome features, repeat MRI/MRCP in 12–24 months [^117Rd3iY]; if stable, extend intervals [^111qLifA] [^114Vsziq].

---

## Gallbladder polyps (up to 6 mm)

### Recommended next steps

Perform **ultrasound follow-up** in 6–12 months to monitor for growth or new features. A **surgical consultation** is appropriate to consider cholecystectomy if polyps grow, become symptomatic, or exceed 10 mm.

---

## Hepatic cysts (tiny, likely benign)

### Recommended next steps

For stable, tiny hepatic cysts, **no immediate intervention** is needed, as they typically require no further workup. Consider **optional follow-up** with ultrasound in 12–24 months if clinically indicated.

---

## Renal parapelvic cysts (bilateral)

### Recommended next steps

For stable parapelvic cysts without hydronephrosis, **no immediate intervention** is required. Consider **optional follow-up** with renal ultrasound in 12–24 months if clinically indicated.

---

## Constipation and colonic diverticulosis

### Recommended next steps

Implement **dietary management** with increased fiber, fluids, and activity to help relieve constipation. Arrange **clinical follow-up** to monitor symptoms, with colonoscopy considered if indicated.

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Finding** | **Recommended next steps** |
|-|-|
| Pancreatic cyst (7 mm) | - MRI/MRCP in 3–6 months <br/> - EUS-FNA if worrisome features [^111rc63Y] <br/> - Surveillance if stable [^117Rd3iY] |
| Gallbladder polyps (6 mm) | - Ultrasound in 6–12 months <br/> - Cholecystectomy if growth or symptoms |
| Hepatic cysts (tiny) | - No immediate intervention [^113Bdw8x] <br/> - Optional ultrasound in 12–24 months |
| Renal parapelvic cysts | - No immediate intervention <br/> - Optional ultrasound in 12–24 months |
| Constipation/diverticulosis | - Dietary management <br/> - Clinical follow-up |

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pancreatic cyst [^1151q34o]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Incidental pancreatic cysts are increasingly detected on imaging studies performed for unrelated indications and may be incompletely characterized on these studies. Adequate morphological characterization is critical due to the small risk of malignant degeneration associated with neoplastic pancreatic cysts, as well as the risk of associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For all pancreatic cysts, both size and morphology determine management. Specifically, imaging detection of features, such as pancreatic ductal communication and the presence or absence of worrisome features or high-risk stigmata, have important management implications.

The recommendations in this publication determine the appropriate initial imaging study to further evaluate a pancreatic cyst that was incidentally detected on a nondedicated imaging study. The recommendations are designed to maximize the yield of diagnostic information in order to better risk-stratify pancreatic cysts and assist in guiding future management.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Preoperative GNAS and KRAS testing in the diagnosis of pancreatic mucinous cysts [^112X2Mgm]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

The management guidelines for pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) are based on the assumption that mucinous cysts can be accurately distinguished from other pancreatic cystic lesions. Previous studies using surgical material have identified mutations in GNAS and KRAS in pancreatic mucinous neoplasms. Yet, the diagnostic utility of testing for both genes in pancreatic cyst fluid obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) remains unclear.

- **Experimental design**: GNAS and KRAS testing was performed on EUS-FNA pancreatic cyst fluid from 91 pancreatic cysts: 41 IPMNs, 9 IPMNs with adenocarcinoma, 16 MCNs, 10 cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET), 9 serous cystadenomas (SCA), 3 retention cysts, 2 pseudocysts, and 1 lymphoepithelial cyst.

- **Results**: Mutations in GNAS were detected in 16 (39%) IPMNs and 2 (22%) IPMNs with adenocarcinoma. KRAS mutations were identified in 28 (68%) IPMNs, 7 (78%) IPMNs with adenocarcinoma, and 1 (6%) MCN. Mutations in either gene were present in 34 (83%) IPMNs, 8 (89%) IPMNs with adenocarcinoma, and 1 (6%) MCN. No mutations were found in cystic PanNETs, SCAs, retention cysts, pseudocysts, and a lymphoepithelial cyst. GNAS and KRAS mutations had 100% specificity [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83–1.00] but 65% sensitivity (95% CI, 0.52–0.76) for mucinous differentiation. Among IPMNs, mutations in either gene had 98% specificity (95% CI, 0.86–1.00) and 84% sensitivity (95% CI, 0.70–0.92).

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111qLifA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACG 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining MRI or MRCP as the test of choice due to their noninvasiveness, lack of radiation, and greater accuracy in assessing communication between the main pancreatic duct and the cyst, which is characteristic of side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111rc63Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, specifically in relation to fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the ACG 2018 guidelines recommend performing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with or without FNA and/or referring patients to a multidisciplinary pancreatic group for further evaluation. This is advised for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or mucinous cystic neoplasms presenting with any of the following features:

- **Symptoms or signs**: Jaundice secondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, or significantly elevated serum CA 19–9.

- **Imaging findings**: The presence of a mural nodule or solid component either within the cyst or in the pancreatic parenchyma, dilation of the main pancreatic duct greater than 5 mm, or a focal dilation of the pancreatic duct concerning for main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, or an obstructing lesion. Additionally, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms measuring 3 cm or more in diameter require attention.

- **Cytologic findings**: High-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas: Differential diagnosis and cytologic-histologic correlation [^111SUDvo]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are very common, and their detection is increasing with the advances in imaging techniques. Because of the major implications for management, distinguishing between neoplastic and nonneoplastic PCLs is critical. Neoplastic cysts with potential to progress into cancer include mucinous PCLs (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms) and nonmucinous cysts (solid pseudopapillary tumors, serous cystic neoplasms, and neuroendocrine tumors with cystic degeneration). Nonneoplastic cysts with no risk of malignant transformation include pseudocysts, retention cysts, lymphoepithelial cysts, cystic pancreatic lymphangioma, and duplication cyst/ciliated foregut cysts. The role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) cytology with cyst fluid analysis in the diagnosis of PCLs has evolved during the last decade; however, a definitive diagnosis on cytologic specimens is hampered by the sparse cellularity and can be challenging. EUS-FNA can play an important role to differentiate low-risk from high-risk pancreatic cysts and to distinguish between patients with cysts who need clinical follow-up versus those who require surgery.

- **Objective**: To provide an integrative approach to diagnose pancreatic cystic lesions using EUS-FNA cytology and cyst fluid analysis, along with clinical, radiologic, histologic, genetic, and molecular characteristics.

- **Data sources**: The review and analysis of the latest literature describing pancreatic cystic lesions.

Accurate diagnosis of PCLs requires an integrative approach, combining various diagnostic techniques to improve patient outcomes.

### Multidisciplinary management strategy for incidental cystic lesions of the pancreas [^111kALz4]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

At our institution, incidental pancreatic cysts are frequently identified in asymptomatic patients undergoing routine imaging for staging of nonpancreatic malignancies. Management of these patients is unclear because a small but significant number of incidental pancreatic cysts are malignant.

- **Study design**: Our institutional database was reviewed for patients with ICD-9 codes for pancreatic cysts from 1980 to 2005. Clinicopathologic factors, including CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) characteristics and management strategies, were analyzed.

- **Results**: Over 25 years, 942 patients were identified with pancreatic cysts. Excluding those with symptoms or pseudocysts, 350 patients remained with incidental pancreatic cysts. Mean overall survival was 41.4 months (mean follow-up 32.7 months). Forty-one patients underwent resection, of whom 38 (92.7%) had premalignant or malignant pathology. Univariate analysis of variables predicting a pathologic premalignant or malignant diagnosis identified pancreatic neck or body location as significant factors.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that most incidental pancreatic cysts can be managed nonoperatively using a selective strategy based on detailed review of CT imaging and EUS findings.

### Update on pancreatic cyst fluid analysis [^111HpnP6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL) are being detected with increasing frequency due to the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. In a recent study, up to 13.5% of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging for reasons unrelated to the pancreas were found to have a pancreatic cyst.

PCL represent a wide variety of lesions, including congenital, inflammatory, and neoplastic cysts. The World Health Organization includes intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN), solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN), and serous cystic tumors (SCT) in the neoplastic category. IPMN and MCN together are known as mucinous cysts and, along with SPN, have malignant potential. SCT are benign lesions and, along with pseudocysts, retention cysts, and lymphoepithelial cysts, have no malignant potential, making surgical resection and surveillance unnecessary. Branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN), while possessing malignant potential, have been suggested to be indolent compared to their main duct counterpart. The variety of PCL and their varied potential for malignant degeneration makes their management tedious. Guidelines have been suggested to assist in the management of pancreatic cystic lesions, which include resection and surveillance recommendations. These recommendations rely on an accurate diagnosis of cyst type as well as assessing the presence or absence of malignancy, which, in reality, can be very challenging.

While dramatically increasing the detection of pancreatic cysts, cross-sectional imaging has been found to be inaccurate for the…

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Current evidence and guidelines [^112EdNmY]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic cysts that include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystic neoplasms, and other rare cystic lesions, all with different biological behaviors and variable risk of progression to malignancy. As more pancreatic cysts are incidentally discovered on routine cross-sectional imaging, optimal surveillance for patients with PCN is becoming an increasingly common clinical problem, highlighting the need to balance cancer prevention with the risk of surgical overtreatment.

This review summarizes the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of PCN, including the quality of available evidence. It also discusses the most important differences between the PCN guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association, the International Association of Pancreatology, and the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, including diagnostic and follow-up strategies and indications for surgery. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with PCN are addressed.

### Management of patients with pancreatic cysts: Analysis of possible false-negative cases of malignancy [^1116mtoe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the results described herein indicate that in the absence of frank cytologic malignancy following EUS-FNA, IMP can guide physician management of pancreatic cysts by increasing confidence that observation is a safe and more appropriate management strategy in the majority of patients, allowing longer surveillance intervals than suggested by Fukuoka guidance. IMP also identifies patients at high risk for malignancy for cysts of all sizes that merit EUS-FNA on clinical or imaging criteria, thereby providing reliable evidence that surgical consultation or close surveillance is needed when cytology results are insufficient.

IMP does so with high sensitivity for malignancy, which can be further enhanced by considering possible EUS-FNA sampling limitations and high-risk clinical circumstances. Adjunctive IMP testing could therefore help to limit false-positive diagnoses and reduce the risk of FN diagnoses determined by guideline criteria alone. When used in the clinic, IMP is a useful diagnostic tool that aids the management of pancreatic cysts by limiting overtreatment and surveillance of inconsequential disease while enabling early detection of malignancy.

### Prevalence of incidental pancreatic cysts in the adult population on MR imaging [^116dmizZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

The reporting of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions on cross-sectional imaging studies has dramatically increased over the last few years. However, the prevalence of incidental pancreatic cysts in the adult population is unknown. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of incidentally detected pancreatic cysts in the adult population undergoing abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

- **Methods**: MR imaging examinations of 616 consecutive patients obtained between January 2001 and February 2002 were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists. The following information was recorded: the total number of pancreatic cysts; the maximum diameter, location, and characteristics of the largest cyst; documentation of the cyst(s) within the radiology report; and characteristics of the cyst(s) at imaging follow-up.

- **Results**: Incidental pancreatic cysts were present in 13.5% (83/616) of patients, with 60% of the cysts being solitary and 88% of the cysts being simple. The mean and median diameters of the largest cyst were 7.4 mm (2–24 mm) and 6 mm, respectively. Both the prevalence of pancreatic cysts and the mean size of the largest cyst increased with age (P = 0.007, r = 0.893 and P = 0.003, r = 0.929, respectively). Only 31% (26/83) of incidental pancreatic cysts were documented in the radiology report. The mean size of reported pancreatic cysts was larger than those cysts that were not reported (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of incidentally detected pancreatic cysts on MR imaging is 13.5% and increases with age. A majority of these cysts are not reported in the radiology reports.

### Incidence of pancreatic cancer during long-term follow-up in patients with incidental pancreatic cysts smaller than 2 cm [^114Vsziq]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

To assess the long-term malignancy risk of incidental small pancreatic cysts, a HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved, retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted. The long-term incidence of pancreatic cancer was compared between patients with and without small pancreatic cysts. Patients with incidental pancreatic cysts measuring ≥ 0.5 and < 2.0 cm in maximal diameter, detected on MRI performed between 1999 and 2011, represented the "small pancreatic cyst" group. Patients who underwent MRI between 2005 and 2011 and had no reported pancreatic cysts represented the comparison "no cyst" group.

- **Results**: The "small pancreatic cyst" group included 267 patients, ages 63.4 ± 11.8 years, 166/267 (62%) women, with a mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 4.3 years, median 9.2 years. The "no cyst" group included 1,459 patients, ages 64.6 ± 12 years, 794/1,459 (54%) women, with a mean follow-up of 7.0 ± 4.2 years, median 7.8 years (p = 0.12, 0.02, < 0.001, respectively). In the "small pancreatic cyst" group, 2/267 (0.7%) patients developed pancreatic cancer at a separate location from the known cyst, with a cancer rate of 0.9 (95% CI 0.1–3.1) cases per 1,000 patient-years. In the "no cyst" cohort, 18/1,459 (1.2%) patients developed pancreatic cancer, with a cancer rate of 1.8 (95% CI 1.2–3.1) cases per 1,000 patient-years (p = 0.6). The all-cause mortality was similar in both groups: 57/267 (21%) vs. 384/1,459 (26%) (p = 0.09).

- **Conclusion**: The long-term risk of pancreatic malignancy in asymptomatic patients with incidental pancreatic cysts less than 2 cm is 0.9 cases per 1,000 patient-years of follow-up.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas: Changes in the presentation and management of 1,424 patients at a single institution over a 15-year time period [^114CtDaN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are being identified more frequently, and a selective approach to resection is now recommended. The aim of this study was to assess the change in presentation and management of pancreatic cystic lesions evaluated at a single institution over 15 years.

- **Study design**: A prospectively maintained registry of patients evaluated between 1995 and 2010 for the ICD-9 diagnosis of pancreatic cyst was reviewed. The 539 patients managed from 1995 to 2005 were compared with the 885 patients managed from 2005 to 2010.

- **Results**: A total of 1,424 patients were evaluated, including 1,141 with follow-up greater than 6 months. Initial management (within 6 months of first assessment) was operative in 422 patients (37%) and nonoperative in 719 patients (63%). Operative mortality in patients initially submitted to resection was 0.7% (n = 3). Median radiographic follow-up in patients initially managed nonoperatively was 28 months (range 6 to 175 months). Patients followed radiographically were more likely to have cysts that were asymptomatic (72% versus 49%, p < 0.001), smaller (1.5 versus 3 cm, p < 0.001), without solid component (94% versus 68%, p < 0.001), and without main pancreatic duct dilation (88% versus 61%, p < 0.001). Changes prompting subsequent operative treatment occurred in 47 patients (6.5%), with adenocarcinoma identified in 8 (17%) and pancreatic endocrine neoplasm in 4 (8.5%). Thus, of the 719 patients initially managed nonoperatively, invasive malignancy was identified in 12 (1.7%), with adenocarcinoma seen in 1.1%.

- **Conclusion**: Cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly identified, necessitating a careful evaluation and management strategy.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas [^117D2PU4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Simple algorithm for follow-up and treatment**: A simplified algorithm for the follow-up and treatment of pancreatic cystic lesions is provided in accordance with recent AGA guidelines. Abbreviations include MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), EUS (endoscopic ultrasound), and FNA (fine-needle aspiration).

The sensitivity of cytology varies depending on the expertise of the endoscopist and cytologist. Sometimes, cytology specimens are false negative due to sampling error. To increase diagnostic accuracy to up to 80–90%, cytology should be complemented with measurements of CEA, amylase levels, and mucin stain. CEA measurement in the fluid is particularly helpful to distinguish serous from mucinous lesions, though some overlap may exist. A CEA level of 400 ng/mL provides almost 100% specificity in diagnosing mucinous cystic neoplasms from pseudocysts. However, infected pseudocysts may also exhibit elevated fluid CEA levels. High cystic fluid amylase levels are observed in cysts that communicate with the pancreatic ducts, such as pseudocysts and IPMNs. Combining all these factors can usually lead to the correct diagnosis.

Cystic fluid from EUS-FNA is prioritized for CEA, amylase, mucin stain, and cytologic analysis. FNA is crucial even for classically benign-appearing lesions to rule out malignant potential. It is not advised for probable malignant lesions for which surgery is already scheduled. However, the discovery of malignant or mucinous cytology and an elevated fluid CEA may sometimes encourage further decision-making.

### Prevalence of incidental pancreatic cyst on upper endoscopic ultrasound [^116oHcDL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

PCLs are frequently detected incidentally in patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging investigations for other medical indications. Given the malignant potential of some PCLs, incidental detection should be carefully evaluated. PCLs have a broad differential diagnosis, from non-neoplastic (e.g. pseudocyst, lymphoepithelial cyst, retention cyst) to neoplastic cystic lesions (e.g. serous cystic tumor, MCN, IPMN, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm). Solid tumors can also present with necrotic cystic degeneration. Thus, identifying an increasing number of pancreatic cysts in asymptomatic patients has become a clinical challenge.

The majority of incidentally discovered cysts are small and could be BD-IPMNs. Although a cyst with invasive carcinoma is uncommon in patients with an asymptomatic pancreatic cyst, particularly those less than 10 mm in size, follow-up is still recommended. Therefore, it is essential to know the expected PCL prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. The number of patients with incidentally discovered cysts who subsequently develop a clinically significant lesion, especially pancreatic adenocarcinoma, remains to be identified. Little is known about the natural history of these patients, and the data in the literature are contradictory. Although IPMN and MCN are recognized precursor lesions of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a majority of incidentally identified pancreatic cysts are typically small BD-IPMNs that fail to meet the criteria for resection.

Some studies showed that small asymptomatic cysts can be safely followed; conversely, other surgical series suggest otherwise.

### Role of pancreatic juice cytology in the preoperative management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas in the era of international consensus guidelines 2012 [^114ABEuo]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Routine endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) for pancreatic juice cytology (PJC) during the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is not recommended in the international consensus guidelines 2012. The aim of the present study was to investigate the roles of PJC in relation to the new stratification of clinical findings in the consensus guidelines 2012.

- **Methods**: Medical records of 70 consecutive patients who underwent preoperative PJC, subsequent pancreatectomy, and a pathological diagnosis of IPMN were reviewed. The diagnostic ability of PJC to detect malignant lesions was calculated by the stratification of clinical findings.

- **Results**: Forty patients had malignant lesions, including 29 with malignant IPMN, 10 with concomitant pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and one with both. The accuracies of PJC in all 70 patients and in 59 patients with IPMN alone were 77% and 80%, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy of PJC in patients with "worrisome features" were 100% and 94%, respectively. Eight of 11 patients with concomitant pancreatic adenocarcinoma had non-malignant IPMN without risk factors, and 3 significant lesions could be diagnosed only by ERP/PJC. In addition, the management plan based on imaging study changed from observation to resection in two patients who had the single "worrisome feature" of branch duct IPMN and positive PJC results. As a result, PJC altered the management plan in 5 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Pancreatic juice cytology potentially has important roles in determining the adequate treatment choice in patients with IPMNs with "worrisome features".

### Diagnostic and radiological management of cystic pancreatic lesions: important features for radiologists [^115YRN4Y]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Cystic pancreatic neoplasms are often an incidental finding, with their frequency increasing. Understanding of such lesions has improved in recent years, yet the numerous types of lesions can hinder differential diagnosis. These include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), serous cystic neoplasms (SCN), and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). Knowledge of their histological and radiological structure, along with distribution concerning localization, age, and sex, assists in differentiating these tumors from common pancreatic pseudocysts. Several types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms may undergo malignant transformation, necessitating differentiated radiological management. This review aims to develop a broader understanding of the pathological and radiological characteristics of cystic pancreatic neoplasms and provides a guideline for everyday practice based on concepts in the radiological management of these lesions.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^11151TMD]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Acinar cell cystic neoplasm (ACCN) is a very uncommon benign cystic lesion characterized by serous content and prominent acinar cell differentiation of the epithelial lining, unrelated to the major ductal system. Its exact nature is still unclear. Initially described as a non-neoplastic entity, such as a developmental anomaly or post-obstructive glandular dilatation and referred to as "acinar cystic transformation" (ACT), subsequent studies considered it a neoplastic lesion. Therefore, further studies are necessary to clearly demonstrate a dystrophic versus neoplastic origin.

ACCN can manifest as unilocular and, more frequently, multilocular cysts that typically lack solid areas of papillary projections. These cysts can either be confined to an anatomic region or diffusely involve the entire gland. It can occur in a wide range of ages with a striking female predominance and causes clinical symptoms in half of the cases, particularly abdominal pain.

Preoperative diagnosis is usually based on a combination of clinical features and radiological findings, but it is often difficult due to similarities with other cystic pancreatic lesions. In particular, radiological findings of unilocular ACCN overlap with those of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) and macrocystic serous cystadenoma (SCN). The main differential diagnosis of multilocular ACCN is intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).

Delavaud et al. demonstrated four radiological findings significantly associated with ACCN: five or more cysts, clustered peripheral small cysts, the presence of cyst calcifications, and the absence of communication with the main pancreatic duct.

### Nonsurgical management of asymptomatic incidental pancreatic cysts [^114hX8mW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The detection of cystic lesions in the pancreas is becoming more frequent, with many being considered premalignant, leading to the recommendation of pancreatic resection. This study aimed to assess the natural course of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts and their malignant potential.

- **Methods**: All patients referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) due to pancreatic cystic lesions between 1994 and 2003 were included. A total of 135 patients underwent EUS because of pancreatic cysts. However, 23 patients were excluded because they were symptomatic or had pancreatic pseudocysts. The remaining 112 patients were diagnosed with true pancreatic cysts. Fourteen of these were referred for surgery based on either unfavorable EUS morphology or fine-needle aspiration results. In 4 (29%) of the 14 surgical specimens, histology revealed malignancy. An additional 8 patients with serous cystadenoma and pseudocysts were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 90 patients, defined as having indeterminate or mucinous cysts, were managed conservatively.

- **Results**: The follow-up period lasted between 12 and 180 months (mean, 48 ± 33 months). Malignancy was diagnosed in only 1 patient after 7 years of follow-up evaluation. None of the 57 patients available for clinical follow-up became symptomatic. The size of the cyst remained unchanged in 45 patients, increased in 2, and resolved in 9. Thirty-three patients were followed up through the Israel Registry, with 31 being alive and 2 having died from unrelated causes.

The data suggest that a considerable number of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts can be managed non-surgically due to their low malignancy potential over an extended follow-up period.

### A combined DNA/RNA-based next-generation sequencing platform to improve the classification of pancreatic cysts and early detection of pancreatic cancer arising from pancreatic cysts [^112fK1Jo]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are a diverse group of lesions with variable clinical, imaging, and pathologic features. Broadly, cysts can be subdivided into non-neoplastic and neoplastic categories. Non-neoplastic cysts include pseudocysts, retention cysts, and others arising from chronic pancreatitis. The neoplastic cysts consist of cystic neoplasms without malignant potential, noninvasive cystic precursors to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), malignant cystic neoplasms, and cystic degeneration of solid malignancies.

Serous cystadenomas (SCAs) are neoplastic cysts that can grow large but have no malignant potential. In contrast, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), and intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms (IOPNs) are noninvasive cystic neoplasms that may progress to invasive PDAC and are thus referred to as "cystic precursor neoplasms". Due to their histologic features, IOPNs are universally regarded to harbor at least high-grade dysplasia. Cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (cPanNETs) are malignant cystic neoplasms, whereas solid pancreatic malignancies can also present as cystic lesions, such as PDAC.

Given the wide array of entities, frequent detection of a cyst by imaging presents a clinical conundrum. In the preoperative setting, classifying a cyst can be difficult. Many neoplastic cysts, such as IPMNs and SCAs, and even non-neoplastic cysts, can clinically mimic one another. This issue becomes more challenging when attempting to identify high-grade dysplasia and early PDAC (advanced neoplasia).

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111tNKDT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study lie in its effective representation of real-life patient care at four separate institutions, making the results both clinically useful and generalizable. Referral bias was minimized as the cohort included patients from a large, integrated healthcare system and a tertiary academic referral center. Cyst types were classified using clinical and EUS information, which is easily attainable by most clinicians during the diagnostic workup of incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic lesions. The large group of non-operatively managed patients and long-term follow-up facilitated a detailed description of the natural history of presumptive BD-IPMN.

In summary, this study supports the use of the Fukuoka "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features" criteria to stratify the malignant potential of cysts consistent with BD-IPMN. Surveillance of benign-appearing cysts that lack Fukuoka criteria, or high-risk features as identified by the AGA 2015 guidelines, is recommended because they pose little to no risk to the patient. Most patients who develop pancreatic cancer in BD-IPMN have at least one Fukuoka criterion and are typically diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within a year of the cyst being detected. However, patients not diagnosed with cancer within the first year remain at risk for developing pancreatic cancer over time, even those who did not initially present with Fukuoka criteria at the time of the initial EUS. Therefore, surveillance should continue for patients with presumptive BD-IPMN.

### Secretin-stimulated MR cholangiopancreatography: spectrum of findings in pancreatic diseases [^113qi2cV]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) are common lesions frequently detected incidentally in clinical practice. Surgical treatment is generally reserved for symptomatic lesions or those with a high risk of malignancy, as indicated by pre-operative diagnostic assessments. Main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN) is more often associated with malignant transformation compared to branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN). Due to this high malignant potential, surgical resection is generally recommended for MD-IPMN, whereas BD-IPMN is managed more conservatively with imaging surveillance, especially in asymptomatic patients with cysts smaller than 3 cm and without worrisome features for malignancy, such as mural nodules or thick, enhancing walls.

BD-IPMN may exhibit a more segmental cystic appearance, which can mimic other pancreatic cystic neoplasms, such as non-neoplastic cysts. The primary diagnostic challenge is distinguishing IPMN from benign cystic neoplasms like serous cystadenomas. Visualizing the communication between the BD-IPMN and the pancreatic duct system is a crucial feature that helps differentiate IPMNs from cystic lesions of other etiologies. MRCP utilizes the nearly stationary fluid in the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems as an intrinsic contrast medium. The administration of secretin enhances the detailed evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic ductal anatomy in IPMNs by improving contrast.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^114595aH]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

As pancreatic cyst incidence rises, likely due to the ubiquitous increase in cross-sectional imaging, their management presents multiple challenges for both the practitioner and patient. It is critical that all pancreatic cysts are appropriately characterized, as treatment decisions depend on an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic modalities such as cytology, biopsy, and cyst fluid biomarkers allow for definitive diagnosis of virtually all lesions. Some cysts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and cystic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, have malignant potential and must be surveyed. Other cysts, such as serous cystadenomas and pancreatic fluid collections, do not have malignant potential.

- **Surveillance strategies**: These vary widely depending on cyst type and size. While multiple medical societies advocate surveillance, their published surveillance guidelines are heterogeneous. Cysts with high-risk stigmata or worrisome features are usually resected, depending on the patient's surgical fitness. In patients unfit for resection, newer endoscopic ablative techniques are advocated.

- **Controversial aspects**: These include whether surveillance can be stopped, how surveillance should be performed, and the extensive financial burden cyst management places on the health care system. Further study into the natural history of cystic lesions, including definitive determination of the rate of malignant transformation for each cyst type, is essential.

### Update on pancreatic cyst fluid analysis [^115iEEsq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL) may be incidentally detected in up to 13.5% of patients. These represent a wide variety of lesions, including mucinous cysts — such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) — that have malignant potential. The difficulty in identifying the various PCL and their unpredictable potential for malignant degeneration makes their management cumbersome. The diagnostic evaluation of PCL often includes EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for cyst fluid analysis. Cyst fluid can be analyzed for tumor markers, cytology, mucins, DNA analysis, and amylase.

- **Tumor markers**: Pancreatic cyst CEA level is considered the most accurate tumor marker for diagnosing mucinous cysts. Approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mL of cyst fluid is required to run the test, and a cut-off of 192 ng/mL can be expected to capture approximately 75% of mucinous cysts.
- **KRAS mutation**: The presence of a KRAS mutation is very specific for a mucinous cyst but lacks sensitivity.
- **Cytology**: Cytology is especially helpful in diagnosing malignancy, typically in the presence of a solid component in the cyst.

Newer markers to improve diagnostic accuracy are on the horizon, but clinical studies are awaited.

### Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Management and unanswered questions [^116cYg6T]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of persons aged 70 years or older are now diagnosed with pancreatic cysts, but it is not clear which ones require additional analysis, interventions, or follow-up. Primary care doctors rely on gastroenterologists for direction because no one wants to miss a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Meanwhile, there is pressure to limit the use of diagnostic tests and reduce costs.

We review the different cystic neoplasms of the pancreas and diagnostic strategies based on clinical features and imaging data. We discuss surgical and nonsurgical management of the most common cystic neoplasms, based on the recently revised Sendai guidelines. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (particularly the branch duct variant) is the lesion most frequently identified incidentally.

We report what is known about its pathology, its risk of developing into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the pros and cons of guidelines for management, and the potential role of endoscopic ultrasound in determining cancer risk. We also review surgical treatment and strategies for surveillance of pancreatic cysts.

### Progression of incidental intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas in liver transplant recipients [^112jWvDT]. Pancreas (2016). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are premalignant pancreatic cysts commonly found incidentally. Immunosuppression accelerates carcinogenesis. Thus, we aimed to compare IPMN progression in liver transplant (LT) recipients on chronic immunosuppression to progression among an immunocompetent population.

We retrospectively assessed adult LT recipients between 2008 and 2014 for imaging evidence of IPMN. Diagnosis of IPMN was based on history, imaging, and cyst fluid analysis. The immunocompetent control group consisted of nontransplant patients from our pancreatic cyst surveillance program with IPMN under surveillance for greater than 12 months between 1997 and 2013. Four hundred fifty-four patients underwent LT in the study period and had cross-sectional imaging.

The prevalence of suspected IPMN was 6.6% (30 of 454). Compared with 131 controls, the transplant cohort was younger, with increased prevalence of diabetes and smoking. The prevalence of other risk factors for IPMN progression (history of pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer) was similar. After an average follow-up of 31 months, most cysts increased in diameter, with a similar increase of dominant cyst (0.4 cm vs 0.5 cm; P = 0.6). The type of immunosuppression was not associated with the increased rate of cyst growth.

Our findings suggest that LT recipients with incidental IPMN can be managed under similar guidelines as immunocompetent patients.

### Pancreatic cysts - Part 1: Using the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines for the management of pancreatic cysts - A practical approach [^116gccvy]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The recent publication of evidence-based guidelines by the American Gastroenterological Association for the management of incidental pancreatic cysts has stimulated considerable discussion among clinicians and researchers. The guidelines examined the evidence in an accompanying technical review, defining diagnostic approaches and the natural history of cysts. Recognizing that the risk of malignant degeneration of these cystic neoplasms has been overestimated, the guidelines boldly increased thresholds for endoscopic ultrasound imaging and cyst fluid sampling, while proposing a reduced frequency of surveillance compared to previous expert consensus recommendations. A practical approach to using these guidelines in daily clinical practice is discussed, emphasizing that an individualized approach is often required for this diverse and common clinical problem.

### Prevalence of incidental pancreatic cyst on upper endoscopic ultrasound [^1176rYC4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an operator-dependent procedure. However, in experienced hands, it allows for comprehensive exploration of the pancreas with higher resolution than other imaging techniques, especially for small lesions. One prospective study conducted blinded comparisons of standardized pancreatic protocol CT, secretin-enhanced MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and EUS for high-risk individuals' screening. The results demonstrated that EUS and secretin-enhanced MRI were superior to CT for detecting small, predominantly cystic, pancreatic lesions.

EUS, MRI/MRCP, and CT identified pancreatic lesions in 42.6%, 33.3%, and 11% of screened high-risk individuals, respectively. In another study, EUS identified synchronous pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) that were not appreciated by initial cross-sectional imaging. Therefore, we could expect that, in subjects without known or suspected pancreatic diseases, the prevalence of EUS-identified pancreatic cysts should be equal to or higher than the prevalence found in studies using MRI.

A recent prospective study that included patients with a history of pancreatitis found that only 9.4% had cysts identified with EUS, which was indicated for conditions unrelated to pancreatic diseases. EUS was indicated in 20% of the cases for chronic abdominal pain. Nevertheless, the proportion of cysts found with EUS was similar to that in other studies using MRI. In our study, patients with a history of acute pancreatitis and chronic pain of probable pancreatic origin, as well as those with known pancreatic alterations, were excluded.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113pQs91]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) are frequently casual findings in radiological examinations performed for other reasons in patients with unrelated symptoms. As they require different management according to their histological nature, differential diagnosis is essential. The radiologist plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of these lesions as imaging is able to correctly characterize most of them and thus direct a correct management approach.

The first step for a correct characterization is to look for a communication between the CPLs and the main pancreatic duct. It is essential to evaluate the morphology of the lesions. Age, sex, and a history of previous pancreatic pathologies provide important information for differential diagnosis.

As some CPLs with different pathologic backgrounds can show the same morphological findings, differential diagnosis can be difficult. Thus, the final diagnosis may require other techniques, such as endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration, and endoscopic ultrasound-through the needle biopsy. Multidisciplinary management is important for correct management.

### Association between advances in high-resolution cross-section imaging technologies and increase in prevalence of pancreatic cysts from 2005 to 2014 [^114ddJzc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Increasingly, pancreatic cysts are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging for nonpancreatic reasons. It is unclear whether this increase is caused by improved detection by progressively more sophisticated cross-sectional imaging techniques or by a true increase in prevalence. We aimed to determine the prevalence of incidental pancreatic cysts in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for nonpancreatic indications on successive, increasingly sophisticated MRI systems. We also compared prevalence based on the demographic characteristics of the patients.

- **Methods**: We collected data from MRIs performed at the Mayo Clinic in Florida during the sample months of January and February, from 2005 to 2014. Each patient's clinical chart was reviewed in chronological order to include the first 50 MRIs of each year (500 total). Patients were excluded if they had pancreatic disease including cysts, pancreatic surgery, pancreatic symptoms, pancreatic indication for the imaging study, or previous abdominal MRIs. An expert pancreatic MRI radiologist reviewed each image, looking for incidental pancreatic cysts.

- **Results**: Of the 500 patients analyzed, 208 patients (41.6%) were found to have an incidental cyst. A significant relationship was observed between pancreatic cysts and patient age (P < .0001), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.001), and nonpancreatic cancer (P = 0.01), specifically nonmelanoma skin cancer (P = 0.03) or hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.02). The multivariable model showed a strong association between hardware and software developments in imaging.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^114wBdTL]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

IPMN has heterogeneous malignant potential, and thus, the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP), with the Fukuoka consensus in 2012, proposed two-tier criteria to predict malignancy.

- **Worrisome features**: The first tier represents imaging findings suggesting that the lesion is not yet malignant but could evolve into a malignant state. This necessitates further work-up by EUS to better risk-stratify the lesion and implement strict follow-up.

- **High-risk stigmata**: The second tier represents imaging findings suggesting the possibility that the lesion is malignant, thus requiring surgical resection if the patient is fit.

The 2012 Fukuoka consensus guidelines were widely accepted and had high sensitivity to predict invasive carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia; however, they had relatively low specificity, leading to a high number of unnecessary pancreatic resections. In 2017, a revised Fukuoka consensus was proposed, which requires future cohort studies to demonstrate whether the revised criteria increase specificity without compromising sensitivity.

At the time of writing, management of IPMN remains controversial. To simplify, according to the 2017 Fukuoka revised consensus, patients with IPMN with high-risk stigmata should undergo resection if fit, patients with IPMN with worrisome features need further work-up, and patients with IPMN without worrisome features require careful monitoring.

RESULTS

Subjects

As reported previously, clinical outcomes were available for 492 patients who lacked frank malignancy upon initial cytological analysis. All were included in this analysis: 338 women, 154 men; mean age at IMP testing 64.9 years. Pancreatic cyst clinical characteristics and classifications were reported previously. Patient outcomes were classified as benign or malignant based on subsequent surgical pathology (n = 209) or subsequent clinical course (n = 283). Pancreatic cyst classifications by surgical pathology with corresponding IMP diagnoses in patients with surgical outcomes is shown in Supplemental Table 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 1). In patients with outcomes determined by imaging, the median follow-up time was 3 years (range, 2 to 7.7 y).

### Frequent detection of pancreatic lesions in asymptomatic high-risk individuals [^114vNcWw]. Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a predisposing germline mutation. Screening can detect curable, noninvasive pancreatic neoplasms, but the optimal imaging approach is not known. We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using three imaging tests to screen asymptomatic, high-risk individuals (HRIs).

- **Methods**: We screened 225 asymptomatic adult HRIs at five academic US medical centers once, using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). We compared results in a blinded, independent fashion.

- **Results**: Ninety-two of 216 HRIs (42%) were found to have at least one pancreatic mass (84 cystic, 3 solid) or a dilated pancreatic duct (n = 5) by any of the imaging modalities. Fifty-one of the 84 HRIs with a cyst (60.7%) had multiple lesions, typically small (mean, 0.55 cm; range, 2–39 mm), in multiple locations. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions increased with age; they were detected in 14% of subjects younger than 50 years old, 34% of subjects 50–59 years old, and 53% of subjects 60–69 years old (P < .0001). CT, MRI, and EUS detected a pancreatic abnormality in 11%, 33.3%, and 42.6% of the HRIs, respectively. Among these abnormalities, proven or suspected neoplasms were identified in 85 HRIs (82 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and 3 pancreatic endocrine tumors). Three of five HRIs who underwent pancreatic resection had high-grade dysplasia in less than 3 cm intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

### The landmark series: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^112W6eFB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The prevalence in the general population is detailed in two key studies.

- **Study 1: Incidental pancreatic cystic neoplasms in an asymptomatic healthy population of 21,745 individuals**:
	- Chang et al. report on 25,300 healthy individuals undergoing abdominal computed tomography as part of a preventive screening campaign between 2003 and 2013 at Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center. To ensure that pancreatic cysts identified in the study were truly incidental, any patient with a history of pancreatic or gastrointestinal surgery was excluded, as were any patients with known or suspected pancreatic disease or abdominal symptoms. After imaging review by two specialized radiologists, any pancreatic cystic lesion over 5 mm in diameter was classified as either an IPMN, mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), or serous cystic neoplasm as appropriate. Of 21,745 patients included in the study, 457 (2.1%) incidental pancreatic cysts were identified, with a median size of 10 mm. The prevalence of pancreatic cystic lesions, and of IPMNs specifically, increased significantly with age, reaching 13.5% and 12.2%, respectively, in patients over 80 years of age.

- **Study 2: Prospective study on the incidence, prevalence, and 5-year pancreatic-related mortality of pancreatic cysts in a population-based study**:
	- Kromrey et al. included subjects who were enrolled in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Northeastern Germany to rate the prevalence of diseases and to study correlations between risk factors.

### Pancreatic incidentalomas: Investigation and management [^114fJLst]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The incidence of pancreatic incidentalomas (PIs) detected in otherwise asymptomatic patients is growing with the increasing quality and use of advanced imaging techniques. PI can present as isolated main pancreatic duct dilation or as a solid or cystic lesion. Although historically thought to be relatively rare, PIs are rather common, particularly cystic lesions of the pancreas, which can be detected in up to 49% of the general population. With the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer, PIs are an opportunity for prevention and early diagnosis, but when managed poorly, they can also lead to overtreatment and unnecessary morbidity.

The management of PI should begin with a dedicated pancreas protocol computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately characterize duct size, lesion characteristics, and establish an accurate baseline for subsequent follow-up. Diagnosis and subsequent management depend on the extent of main duct dilation and solid versus cystic appearance. Solid lesions are highly concerning for malignancy. Cystic lesions can be further categorized as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMNs) or mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), both of which harbour malignant potential, or as serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) that are benign. In this paper, we summarize the major challenges related to PI and present pragmatic suggestions for management.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^112TTaUq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are very common, with the majority incidentally identified. There are several types of pancreatic cysts; some can contain cancer or have malignant potential, whereas others are benign. However, even the types of cysts with malignant potential rarely progress to cancer. At present, the only viable treatment for pancreatic cysts is surgical excision, which is associated with high morbidity and occasional mortality. The small risk of malignant transformation, the high risks of surgical treatment, and the lack of high-quality prospective studies have led to contradictory recommendations for their immediate management and surveillance. This guideline provides a practical approach to pancreatic cyst management and recommendations for cyst surveillance for the general gastroenterologist.

### Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm masquerading as ampullary adenoma: A diagnostic puzzle [^114yEt87]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the most common pancreatic cystic lesion, remaining mostly asymptomatic. An atypical presentation of such a lesion, initially thought to be an ampullary adenoma, is presented herein. A 78-year-old white male with painless jaundice was treated in a tertiary hospital. Imaging and endoscopic investigations pointed towards an ampullary adenoma obstructing and causing dilatation of both bile and pancreatic ducts. Endoscopic papillectomy was carried out and histology revealed tubulovillous adenoma. Follow-up duodenoscopy three months later showed a lesion with mucus leaking from the pancreatic duct. Cytology revealed mucin-rich atypical cells, consistent with main-duct IPMN. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, finally revealing main-duct IPMN protruding through Vater's ampulla.

Cystic pancreatic lesions are increasingly found, and IPMN is the most common of these. On the other hand, the management of ampullary adenomas has been revolutionized by endoscopic treatment and the advent of endoscopic papillectomy, with expanding indications. Meticulous clinical and imaging workup of these patients is essential to avoid suboptimal treatment. IPMN should be included in the differential diagnosis of ampullary adenomas, especially in the presence of a grossly dilated pancreatic duct.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pancreatic cancer, specifically in relation to EUS-guided FNA for cystic lesions, the ASGE 2016 guidelines recommend performing EUS-guided FNA on any pancreatic cystic lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter. This recommendation also applies when cross-sectional imaging or EUS confirms the presence of an epithelial nodule, a dilated main pancreatic duct, or a suspicious mass lesion.

More importantly, the incorporation of PancreaSeq testing into IPMN-specific guidelines, such as those by the AGA guidelines and the IAP/Fukuoka guidelines, increased the sensitivities of detecting advanced neoplasia from 72% to 96% and 86% to 98%, respectively, whereas the specificities of both guidelines remained essentially the same. Considering the challenges of classifying pancreatic cysts within the preoperative setting, a separate analysis of mucinous cysts (IPMNs and MCNs) with advanced neoplasia also revealed an improvement in the sensitivities of the AGA guidelines (72% to 96%) and the IAP/Fukuoka guidelines (84% to 98%) when applying PancreaSeq testing data, while the specificities of both guidelines once again remained essentially the same.

The advantage of PancreaSeq testing is its high specificity for advanced neoplasia. In contrast, the AGA guidelines and the IAP/Fukuoka guidelines exhibit low-to-moderate specificity but moderate-to-high sensitivity. The low-to-moderate specificity of both guidelines is not surprising, as they rely on subjective and indirect features of advanced neoplasia, such as large (> 3.0 cm) pancreatic cyst size, main pancreatic duct dilatation, and the presence of a mural nodule on EUS. As reported in the AGA technical review, a cyst size of > 3.0 cm has a pooled sensitivity of 74% for malignancy but a poor pooled specificity of 49%. Main pancreatic duct dilatation and the presence of a mural nodule have pooled specificities of 80% and 91%, respectively, but poor pooled sensitivities of 32% and 48%, respectively.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^111qNyoF]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) are a heterogeneous group of frequently detected lesions with varying malignant potential and prognoses, necessitating different therapeutic and follow-up strategies. Therefore, it is fundamental to correctly characterize them. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequence is the most useful technique to detect imaging features helpful for lesion characterization.

The differential diagnosis of these cysts is based on factors such as the presence or absence of communication with the main pancreatic duct (MPD), their morphological features, location, and clinical history and demographic data. Once pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis (WON) have been excluded, a CPL communicating with the MPD is identified as an Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN). If not communicating, it could be a Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN), a Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm (MCN), or a Solid Pseudopapillary Neoplasm (SPN). Differential diagnosis, whether certain or presumptive, can be based on demographic data, the location of the lesion, and its morphological appearance.

In some cases, differential diagnosis remains challenging and may require Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA) and/or cyst-wall biopsy. MCNs and IPMN with high-risk stigmata must be resected if patients are fit for surgery. For patients with long life expectancy and IPMN with worrisome features, resection is suggested.

Patients with IPMN without high-risk stigmata and those who have undergone resection for an IPMN need follow-up until they are fit for surgery, to early detect malignant degeneration or concomitant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. When the diagnosis of a CPL remains indeterminate, it should be managed as an IPMN, as they are the most frequent CPLs with potential malignant behavior.

### Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: Retrospective analysis of natural history and efficacy of imaging surveillance guidelines [^1129qVF5]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

To assess the natural history of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) and the sensitivity of surveillance guidelines to detect malignancy, we performed a single-center retrospective analysis of incidental PCLs discovered between 2012 and 2017. Patients were identified by searching radiology reports for relevant keywords, then search results were manually reviewed to exclude patients with less than 5 years of follow-up, non-incidental PCLs, known pancreatic cancer, or pancreatitis. Baseline and follow-up imaging was reviewed to record size, growth (as defined by the American College of Radiology [ACR]), high-risk stigmata, and incidence of malignancy. Four major guidelines (International Consensus, European, ACR, and Canadian Association of Radiologists [CAR]) were retrospectively applied to assess sensitivity to detect invasive disease. Benign and malignant PCL outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test, and PCL growth was modeled with mixed-effects regression.

Four hundred forty-nine patients (67 ± 12 years, 284 women) with 556 PCLs were included. The natural growth of PCLs was 0.33 mm/year (0.26–0.40 mm 95% CI), which overlaps with significant growth thresholds for ACR and CAR guidelines. Over 21,996 patient-years of follow-up, nine patients developed pancreatic cancer (4.1 cases/10,000 patient-years). Malignancy was not associated with significant growth (4/9 vs. 107/547, p = 0.084), but was associated with high-risk stigmata (3/9 vs. 3/547, p < 0.001). Guideline sensitivities ranged from 33.3 to 66.7% (2–4/6 cases).

In conclusion, PCLs are common and their…

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, particularly concerning surveillance imaging, the ACG 2018 guidelines recommend using cyst size to guide surveillance intervals for presumed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or mucinous cystic neoplasms. This applies in the absence of features warranting increased surveillance or referral for further evaluation:

- **Symptoms**: Jaundice secondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, or elevated serum CA 19–9 when no benign cause for elevation is present.

- **Imaging findings**: Mural nodule or solid component within the cyst or pancreatic parenchyma, main pancreatic duct diameter of > 5 mm, change in main duct caliber with upstream atrophy, size > 3 cm, or an increase in cyst size > 3 mm/year.

- **Cytology**: High-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, specifically concerning cyst fluid analysis, ACG 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining cyst fluid CEA analysis to differentiate between intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms. However, it is important to recognize that this analysis cannot be used to identify intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms with high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^115ugYsq]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Segmental MD-IPMN is characterized by a segmental dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the body of the pancreas, appreciated during MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging. The MPD upstream shows signs of chronic obstructive pancreatitis, evidenced by finger-like dilatation of branch ducts, although the thickness of the pancreatic gland remains normal. After 20 months, the dilatation of the MPD upstream is no longer visible due to atrophy of the pancreatic gland.

The evolution of a mixed MD-IPMN is observed with dilatation of a branch duct in the tail of the pancreas and slight enlargement of the MPD in the same region. Over five years, this progresses to a diffuse dilatation of the MPD.

Mixed-type IPMN presents as a segmental or diffuse dilatation of MPD and branch ducts. However, branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) may cause dilatation of the MPD due to mucin overproduction, mimicking mixed-type IPMN.

BD-IPMN appears as either unifocal or multifocal cystic lesions that communicate with the MPD. These cysts can be unilocular or multilocular, with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Often, they are arranged in grape-like clusters and are separated by thin septa that typically enhance following contrast medium administration. Demonstrating the communication with the MPD is crucial for diagnosing BD-IPMN, making high-quality MRCP the most sensitive and important sequence in the MRI protocol.

Unifocal BD-IPMN is demonstrated by a cystic lesion with tiny septa in the head of the pancreas, as observed on T2w and MRCP. At T1w imaging, following paramagnetic contrast media injection, enhancement of the septa can be appreciated.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: Classification, diagnosis, and management [^113Bdw8x]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Focal cystic dilation with papillary mass (type 4 IPNBs)**: In type 4 IPNBs, mucin overproduction leads to increased intraductal pressure and aneurysmal biliary dilation or cystic dilation of peribiliary glands. These cystic-type IPNBs present as multilocular cystic masses with a "bunch of grapes" appearance and enhancing mural nodules. Type 4 IPNBs, which closely resemble MCNs, can be differentiated on the basis of communication between the cystic lesion and the bile ducts, best depicted on MRCP sequences. Similarly, MCNs in contrast to cystic-type IPNBs, are not accompanied by biliary dilation. Gadolinium-based agents, excreted into the lesion on the hepatobiliary phase, are quite helpful in this regard. Apart from MCNs, the differential diagnosis should include complicated hepatic cysts, localized Caroli disease, and more rare cystic hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, hepatic foregut cysts, mesenchymal hematomas, or teratomas.

- **Imaging description**:
	- **(A) T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance imaging**: A well-defined multilocular "bunch of grapes-type" intrahepatic mass is depicted, containing high-intensity fluid content and multiple internal septa.
	- **(B) Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)**: The multilocular cystic lesion shows thick internal septa with persistent delayed phase enhancement.
	- **(C) Coronal portal phase CT**: A well-defined multilocular cystic mass is depicted in the left liver lobe. This is in close proximity to the hypodense linear left intrahepatic biliary duct (arrow).

It should be noted that ductal invasion by HCC and intraductal hepatic metastases have to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas [^117AimDj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Different types of benign or malignant cystic lesions can be observed in the pancreas. Pancreatic cystic lesions are classified under pathology terms into simple retention cysts, pseudocysts, and cystic neoplasms. The non-neoplastic cysts are better divided histologically into epithelial cysts (with retention cysts being the most common) and non-epithelial ones (with pseudocysts being the most common). Distinguishing between the various types of lesions has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Cystic pancreatic lesions may be associated with systemic disease such as cystic fibrosis or von Hippel-Lindau disease. Pancreatic tumors can be identified in up to 80% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, as shown by intensive anatomic studies of the pancreatic tissue.

- **Retention cysts**: Retention cysts, also called true or simple cysts, are usually found incidentally during an imaging study and have no clinical significance. They are usually small and their wall is covered by normal epithelium with ductal and centroacinar cells. They are observed in 25% of patients with cystic fibrosis. No treatment is necessary for these benign cysts.

### Multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114eKZvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have gained recognition in recent years as premalignant precursors to pancreatic cancer, enabling early detection and often found incidentally at imaging. Accurate diagnosis and optimal, finely-tuned management of these lesions are important and require collaboration across various disciplines, including radiology, endoscopy, surgery, and pathology.

Several imaging modalities can adequately visualize these lesions, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are generally the first-line imaging modalities; endoscopic imaging, such as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, is beneficial when the former two modalities are equivocal.

Surgical candidates generally include patients with main duct lesions or branch duct lesions greater than 3 cm, or any possessing a solid component. A management algorithm indicating when surgery should be pursued is proposed. For nonsurgical and postsurgical patients, follow-up management is important to monitor growth and recurrence, and risks from repeated radiation exposure should be taken into account. Furthermore, issues of multifocality and increased predisposition of the pancreas to ductal adenocarcinoma must be addressed at follow-up evaluation. A follow-up management algorithm also is proposed in this review.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^114p9Gtg]? European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The pancreatic MRI closest to the date of surgery was chosen for analysis. Since our institution is a tertiary high-volume center, some patients were referred for evaluation for surgery with outside MRI examinations using MR equipment from different vendors, sequences, and technical parameters. Therefore, an institutional standard protocol for preoperative MRI was not available for this study. The minimum criteria for including a non-institutional MRI in the study were: (1) magnetic field strength ≥ 1.5 T; (2) availability of an axial and coronal T2-weighted sequence acquired with the single-shot technique (HASTE, Single-Shot Fast Spin Echo, or Single-Shot Turbo Spin Echo) or multi-shot PROPELLER technique; and (3) slice thickness and interslice gap not larger than 6 mm and 20%, respectively.

All MR images were evaluated on a picture archiving and communication system (Sectra Workstation, IDS7 version 23.1, Sectra AB) by two radiologists in consensus reading (R.P.M. and N.K. with 15 and 12 years of post-residency experience in abdominal imaging, respectively). One cyst per patient was chosen for analysis (the largest or the one with the most suspicion for malignancy appearance based on guidelines at the time of surgery).

- **Collected imaging parameters**: MPD main pancreatic duct, EEG European evidence-based guidelines, BD-IPMN branch-duct IPMN

From each patient's electronic medical record, the following clinical parameters were collected: age at surgery, gender, and presence of clinical features.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cysts: A white paper of the ACR Incidental Findings Committee [^113dKJNr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for managing pancreatic cysts that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update from the pancreatic component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Pancreas Subcommittee, which included abdominal radiologists, a gastroenterologist, and a pancreatic surgeon, developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion, and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches successively categorize pancreatic cysts based on patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an ascertainment of benignity and/or indolence, sufficient to discontinue follow-up, or a management recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected pancreatic cysts.

### Editorial: Management of the small asymptomatic pancreatic cyst: Somehow along the way we forgot about the patient [^11643Fw3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The incidentally identified pancreatic cyst is an increasing burden for both physicians and patients alike. Although we recognize that most of these lesions are benign and may not progress, a subset of these lesions are premalignant, may have frank cancer, and may progress over time. Most occur in older patients who have associated comorbidity. Recent studies highlight neoplastic features of these cysts that, when present, may warrant surgery or close long-term follow-up; however, there has been little study on the natural history factoring in patient comorbidity and pancreatic cancer-free survival. This retrospective cohort study underscores the importance of patient comorbidity in our management algorithm, and these data should prompt subsequent guidelines to factor in such comorbidity.

### Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm masquerading as ampullary adenoma: A diagnostic puzzle [^117Apv5L]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly found on imaging investigations, mostly on magnetic resonance scans. Most of these cysts are asymptomatic; however, symptoms such as pancreatitis episodes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice may arise according to the cyst's location, size, and nature. The fundamental question regarding the clinical management of a pancreatic cystic lesion lies in the malignant potential associated with this cyst. Several reviews and guidelines exist on the appropriate work-up and management of pancreatic cysts.

On the other hand, the management of ampullary adenomas has been revolutionized by endoscopic treatment and management, with the advent of endoscopic papillectomy (EP) and advances in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and ERCP. Treatment modalities for ampullary tumors have included pancreatoduodenectomy and transduodenal excision, which are surgical procedures, and endoscopic papillectomy. Ampullary adenomas seem to follow the well-established adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence; they are thus considered premalignant and warrant endoscopic or surgical resection. The indications for EP are under constant review and expanding, while size larger than 5 cm, ulceration, friability, or spontaneous bleeding are contraindications for EP. Intraductal extension is another contraindication for EP and can be assessed by EUS or ERCP. EUS performs similarly to ERCP in evaluating intraductal extension.

In the case presented above, obstructive jaundice and the endoscopic image of an ampullary mass suggested the diagnosis of ampullary adenoma.

### Single-operator peroral pancreatoscopy in the preoperative diagnostics of suspected main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: Efficacy and novel insights on complications [^112pHe8A]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly detected as the frequency of abdominal imaging rises, and the prevalence of such lesions strongly correlates with aging. The clinical challenge concerning pancreatic cysts lies in differentiating malignant, premalignant, and benign subtypes. Among cystic pancreatic lesions, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are a common entity. IPMNs harbor the potential to become malignant. The clinical management of IPMNs relies on consensus and/or evidence-based guidelines.

Worrisome features favoring surgery include main pancreatic duct (MD) dilatation, the presence of contrast-uptaking mural nodules, a cyst size exceeding 40 mm, symptoms such as new-onset diabetes mellitus or acute pancreatitis, and cyst growth exceeding 5 mm/year during follow-up. In the absence of worrisome features, close surveillance has been suggested. Correctly timed pancreatic resection for IPMN patients improves life expectancy. However, patients with IPMN should not be surgically over-treated since pancreatic resections also bear a considerable risk of postoperative short- and long-term complications.

Distinguishing IPMNs from other pancreatic cystic lesions through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans can be challenging, even if a multidisciplinary team (MDT) conference is consulted. Specifically, confirming MD involvement in IPMNs remains problematic. In addition, side-branch subtypes of IPMN (SB-IPMN) also carry a long-term risk of progressing into cancer. The use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for morphology is essential for accurate assessment.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^112RxEmR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Surveillance is essential for patients with BD-IPMN as disease progression is expected in about 10–15% of patients during a 3–5 year follow-up. Surveillance should also cover the entire pancreatic gland due to an increased risk of new-onset cancer. Patients with MD-IPMN and mixed-type (MT)-IPMN may experience disease progression, with factors such as diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts serving as predictors.

- **Clinical implications and follow-up**:
	- For patients with an IPMN without operative intervention indication, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year and annual follow-up thereafter is adequate when there are no risk factors warranting surgery. Any changes in clinical symptoms should prompt further investigations [GRADE 1B, strong agreement].

	- Patients with a relative indication for surgery, the elderly, and those with severe comorbidity should have a 6-month follow-up [GRADE 1B, strong agreement].

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgical intervention must be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, partial pancreatectomy for IPMN necessitates lifelong follow-up, as resection does not eliminate the risk completely.
