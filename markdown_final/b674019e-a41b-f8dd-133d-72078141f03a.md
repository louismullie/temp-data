## Question

A 7-month-old previously healthy, fully immunized infant is brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever (up to 39.5°C) and cough. On examination, the infant is well-appearing, alert, and interactive. Vital signs: HR 140 bpm, RR 38/min, SpO₂ 98% on room air, temperature 39.2°C. Chest auscultation reveals mild wheezing bilaterally, but no rales or focal findings. There is no hypoxia, tachycardia or tachypnea out of proportion to the fever, and no obvious source of infection on exam. The clinician considers ordering a chest X-ray.

Based on current guidelines, should a chest X-ray be obtained in this infant? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a chest X-ray should be obtained for a 7-month-old, well-appearing, fully immunized infant with 2 days of fever up to 39.5°C, cough, and bilateral wheeze, but no hypoxia, focal lung findings, or disproportionate tachypnea/tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and baseline risk. Then, I should verify which high-quality guidelines apply and what they recommend for well-appearing infants with fever and wheeze. Next, I will examine the specific clinical features that trigger imaging versus those that argue against it. Finally, I will consider exceptions, follow-up, and synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. At 7 months old, this infant is beyond the neonatal period and is fully immunized, which lowers the risk of invasive bacterial disease, including pneumococcal pneumonia, and places him in the 2-month to 2-year age group addressed by pediatric ED fever policies and primary care guidance, where routine chest radiography is not indicated in the absence of red flags [^c3acc7c4] [^c59258bb].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy explicitly recommends not obtaining a chest radiograph in well-appearing immunocompetent infants aged 2 months to 2 years who present with fever and wheeze or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis, which fits this presentation given the bilateral wheeze and otherwise reassuring exam [^c0d513eb] [^53605035]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of this recommendation; it is a Level C recommendation, but it aligns with broader pediatric guidance and is consistent with primary care recommendations to avoid imaging in wheeze suggestive of bronchiolitis or asthma [^c59258bb].

> I will now examine the clinical features that typically trigger chest radiography in this age group. Guidelines suggest considering a chest X-ray when there is cough with hypoxia, rales, high fever (often ≥ 39°C), fever duration beyond 48 hours, or tachycardia/tachypnea disproportionate to fever, none of which are present here; the infant is well-appearing, saturating 98% on room air, has no focal crackles, and the respiratory rate of 38/min is not disproportionate to a fever of 39.2°C, so these do not meet imaging triggers [^c3acc7c4] [^25c01220]. Wait, let me verify the fever duration; at 2 days, it does not meet the > 48-hour threshold that would prompt imaging in the absence of other concerning features [^25c01220].

> But wait, what if the wheeze is actually a sign of pneumonia rather than bronchiolitis? I should double-check the evidence base. Multiple studies and policies note that wheeze reduces the likelihood of radiographic pneumonia in young children, and in a Class III study of 126 patients aged 2 months to 2 years with wheeze, none had radiographic pneumonia, reinforcing that wheeze alone should not prompt chest radiography in this context [^04849ca5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of pneumonia on CXR in wheezing patients does not prove viral etiology, but it does support withholding imaging when the child is otherwise well-appearing and without hypoxia or focal findings [^04849ca5].

> Next, I should review the potential harms and lack of benefit. Routine chest radiography in uncomplicated bronchiolitis or viral wheeze does not improve clinical outcomes, exposes infants to radiation, increases costs, and can lead to incidental findings that drive unnecessary interventions; Choosing Wisely and Cochrane analyses similarly conclude no outcome benefit from routine CXR in acute lower respiratory infections, which supports a conservative approach here [^5fa2b0e4] [^f556e471]. I need to ensure I'm not missing a scenario where imaging changes management; in this case, there is no hypoxia, no focal consolidation, no concern for foreign body, and no failure of outpatient therapy, so imaging would be unlikely to alter treatment decisions today [^10f5a7e5].

> I should confirm exceptions and follow-up plans. If the infant deteriorates, develops hypoxia, persistent high fever beyond 48–72 hours, focal lung findings, or fails to improve as expected, then reassessment and chest radiography would be appropriate; similarly, if antibiotics are started and there is no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, repeat imaging is reasonable to evaluate for complications or alternative diagnoses [^10f5a7e5] [^dc2deb7f]. Let me reconsider whether any occult pneumonia risk factors are present; without leukocytosis or other predictors, and with the protective effect of wheeze, the pretest probability remains low, so observation with clear return precautions is appropriate [^04849ca5].

> Final recommendation: No, a chest X-ray should not be obtained now. The infant is well-appearing, fully immunized, has a 2-day febrile illness with cough and bilateral wheeze, no hypoxia, no focal lung findings, and no disproportionate tachypnea or tachycardia; current guidelines advise against chest radiography in this exact scenario, and the balance of benefits and harms favors supportive care with close follow-up and return precautions if red flags develop [^c0d513eb] [^53605035] [^c59258bb].

---

A chest X-ray is **not indicated** for this 7-month-old, well-appearing, fully immunized infant with fever, cough, and bilateral wheeze, as the presentation is consistent with viral bronchiolitis and there are no red flags (hypoxia, focal consolidation, or persistent symptoms) [^c0d513eb] [^53605035]. Chest radiography is **unnecessary** in uncomplicated bronchiolitis and does not change management; reserve imaging for hypoxia, focal lung findings, or lack of improvement after 48–72 hours of supportive care [^c59258bb] [^10f5a7e5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current pediatric guidelines provide clear recommendations on when to obtain a chest X-ray in infants with fever and cough:

- **ACEP guidelines**: Do not obtain a chest X-ray in well-appearing immunocompetent infants aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with wheezing or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis [^c0d513eb] [^53605035].

- **AAFP guidelines**: Avoid chest radiography for wheezing suggestive of bronchiolitis or asthma [^c59258bb].

- **IDSA/PIDS guidelines**: Chest imaging is not routinely recommended for uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia in children; obtain a chest X-ray if there is diagnostic uncertainty, hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress, or no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy [^10f5a7e5].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting non-imaging

Several studies and reviews highlight the limited utility of chest radiography in uncomplicated bronchiolitis or viral respiratory infections:

- **Cochrane review**: Routine chest radiography does not improve clinical outcomes in acute lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis, and may lead to unnecessary interventions [^f556e471].

- **Pediatric studies**: Chest radiography in bronchiolitis rarely reveals significant findings that alter management, especially in well-appearing infants without hypoxia or focal lung findings [^b5814e4d].

- **Occult pneumonia**: The incidence of occult pneumonia in well-appearing infants with fever and cough but without hypoxia or focal findings is low, further supporting the avoidance of routine chest radiography [^7c2fc78c].

---

## Potential risks and drawbacks of chest radiography

While chest radiography is generally considered safe, it is not without risks and drawbacks, particularly in young infants:

- **Radiation exposure**: Although minimal, cumulative radiation exposure should be avoided when possible, especially in young children [^notfound].

- **False positives**: Chest radiography may reveal incidental or nonspecific findings that can lead to unnecessary interventions, including inappropriate antibiotic use [^e588d5a3].

- **Resource utilization**: Unnecessary imaging increases healthcare costs and resource utilization without improving clinical outcomes [^f556e471].

---

## Clinical features indicating the need for chest radiography

Despite the general recommendation against routine chest radiography, certain clinical features may warrant imaging:

| **Clinical feature** | **Indication for chest x-ray** |
|-|-|
| Hypoxia (SpO₂ < 95%) | Yes |
| Significant respiratory distress (grunting, nasal flaring, severe retractions) | Yes |
| Focal lung findings (rales, consolidation) | Yes |
| Persistent fever or cough beyond 48–72 hours without improvement | Yes |
| Wheezing alone without other concerning features | No |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current guidelines and clinical evidence, a chest X-ray is **not indicated** for this 7-month-old infant with fever, cough, and bilateral wheeze, as the presentation is consistent with viral bronchiolitis and there are no red flags. Supportive care, close clinical observation, and follow-up are appropriate. Reserve chest radiography for hypoxia, focal lung findings, or persistent symptoms after 48–72 hours of supportive care [^c0d513eb] [^10f5a7e5].

### Which febrile children with sickle cell disease need a chest X-ray? [^3749b08a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy exists regarding which febrile children with sickle cell disease (SCD) should receive a chest x-ray (CXR). Our goal is to provide data informing the decision of which febrile children with SCD presenting to the emergency department (ED) require a CXR to evaluate for acute chest syndrome (ACS).

Methods

Retrospective chart review of children ages 3 months to 21 years with SCD presenting to the ED at one of two academic children's hospitals with fever ≥ 38.5°C between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Demographic characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and laboratory results were abstracted. The primary outcome was the presence of ACS. Binary recursive partitioning was performed to determine predictive factors for a diagnosis of ACS.

Results

A total of 185 (10%) of 1,837 febrile ED visits met ACS criteria. The current National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) consensus criteria for obtaining a CXR (shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, or rales) identified 158 (85%) of ACS cases, while avoiding 825 CXRs. Obtaining a CXR in children with NHLBI criteria or chest pain and in children without those symptoms but with a white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 18.75 × 10⁹/L or a history of ACS identified 181 (98%), while avoiding 430 CXRs.

Conclusion

Children with SCD presenting to the ED with fever and shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, rales, or chest pain should receive a CXR due to high ACS rates. A higher WBC count or history of ACS in a child without one of those symptoms may suggest the need for a CXR. Prospective validation of these criteria is needed.

Childhood community-acquired pneumonia in context

Globally there are 155 million cases of childhood pneumonia annually, and pneumonia results in the death of 2 million children younger than 5 years every year (20% of all deaths in this age group), making it the biggest single cause of childhood death. In the United Kingdom the annual incidence of attendance to hospital for pneumonia is 14.4 per 10,000 in children ages 0–16 years, and 33.8 per 10,000 for those ages < 5 years, with admission rates just slightly lower. In the developing world, one South African study indicated a pneumonia incidence of 0.27 episodes per child-year and a case–fatality ratio of 1% for cases admitted to a hospital.

The definition of community-acquired pneumonia in children is almost identical in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that has been acquired outside of the hospital". According to the British Thoracic Society it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (such as fever of > 38.5°C, cough and respiratory distress) in a previously healthy child, due to an infection which has been acquired outside the hospital".

Table 1
Summary of the British Thoracic Society, Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children

Urbankowska and colleagues claimed there are strong arguments in favor of performing diagnostic imaging in children with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. The main problem for clinicians is that even though the guidelines promote a clinical diagnosis, the signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections are relatively nonspecific. Under these conditions, the "need to prove the pneumonia" using some form of diagnostic imaging can be considered justified. Even though many radiographs performed might not meet the British Thoracic Society guidelines for performing chest radiographs in children with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, these radiographs might also represent only a minority of all children seen in the emergency department for suspected respiratory infection. This performance is likely to arise from the alternative guidance around fever without source, which states that in some children in whom a source cannot be identified a chest radiograph should be performed if there are any respiratory symptoms. In this context the rationale may be to exclude pneumonia as a cause. In contrast to the guidelines, which only advocate use of imaging in severe pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, it is the mild cases presenting to the emergency department with a less-reliable history and examination that lead clinicians to request chest radiographs more commonly to support their diagnosis. It was shown in one South African study that clinicians often mistakenly classify children with bronchiolitis episodes and those with reactive airway disease as having pneumonia. The large number of equivocal cases seen in the emergency department has resulted in the so-called point-of-care US, which has been developed to enable a rapid diagnosis of lung consolidation and the complications of pneumonia, facilitating fast decision-making. In the northern hemisphere, there is a marked seasonal pattern with winter preponderance for pneumococcal infection (December and January showing a peak 3–5 times higher than August) and this might drive referrals.

Tuberculosis (TB) considerations for children with cough in high-prevalence settings: For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries or settings, we suggest (a) that they be screened for TB regardless of cough duration (Grade 2C) and (b) the addition of active case finding to passive case finding because it may improve outcomes in patients with pulmonary TB (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, but CXRs should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough suspected to have pulmonary TB and at high risk of drug-resistant TB, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF assay, where available, replace sputum microscopy but sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing and CXRs should be performed when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, and/or weight loss, and who are at risk of pulmonary TB in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that they should have a CXR if resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Detection of occult pneumonia in a pediatric emergency department [^7c2fc78c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many children undergo chest radiography (CXR) in their evaluation of a febrile illness. Pneumonia without signs of respiratory distress or ausculatory findings has been previously described (termed occult pneumonia [OP]).

Objective

The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of OP among children who have CXR performed and to identify clinical predictors of OP.

Methods

A prospective observational study of children undergoing CXR for possible pneumonia was conducted. Standardized data forms were completed before the CXR. Univariate analysis and recursive partitioning were used to identify predictors of OP.

Results

Of 1866 patients enrolled, 308 had no evidence of respiratory distress or lower respiratory tract findings and were studied for OP. Twenty-one patients had radiographic OP (6.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0%-10.6%). Age, height of fever, duration or quality of cough, and pulse oximetry were not associated with OP. A decision rule based on fever for 1 day or longer or with a combination of fever for less than 1 day but worsening cough identifies patients at greater risk for OP (likelihood ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21–1.77). No patient with fever for less than 1 day and without any cough or without worsening cough had pneumonia (likelihood ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19–0.84).

Conclusions

Occult pneumonia was identified in 1 of 15 patients undergoing CXR without respiratory distress or ausculatory findings. Obtaining a CXR for the detection of OP in children without cough and with fever for less than 1 day in duration should be discouraged.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^0549d199]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines for imaging in suspected community-acquired pneumonia

National guidance on community-acquired pneumonia from the United Kingdom and the United States indicates that chest radiographs are not recommended routinely in uncomplicated cases. However, there are defined situations where chest radiographs might be helpful in making the diagnosis, such as when there is pyrexia with only mild respiratory symptoms. The main reason why chest radiography is not routinely recommended in the ambulatory setting is that there is no evidence of a substantial impact on clinical outcomes, which is also true for developing countries. This is because radiography cannot reliably differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia and therefore does not impact on choice of treatment with antibiotics.

Clinical practice and adherence to guidance is multifactorial and includes the clinical context (developed vs. developing world), the confidence of the attending physician, the changing incidence of complications (according to the success of immunisation programs), the availability of alternative imaging (and its relationship to perceived risks of radiation) and the reliability of the interpretation of imaging. The most recent British Thoracic Society guidance regarding community-acquired pneumonia is summarised in Table 1 alongside the clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months. It should be noted, however, that in creating these guidelines, when the evidence for the guidance is lacking, consensus is employed. In addition, guidelines are intended to be assistive, rather than directive, and therefore clinicians often operate outside the guidance in line with their clinical experience, e.g. it has been shown that junior doctors are more likely to use guidelines rigidly than more senior doctors, who tend to go on clinical intuition. In practice, chest radiographs are performed frequently for suspected pneumonia in children. An official British Thoracic Society audit identified that a chest radiograph had been performed to confirm the diagnosis in 90–94% of suspected community-acquired pneumonia cases and concluded that there was an over-reliance on investigations to diagnose pneumonia.

### Perinatal tuberculosis in a 73-day-old infant [^6db810fc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

A 73-day-old female infant presented with cough and fever. A chest roentgenogram showed a pneumonic patch, but empirical antibiotic treatment failed. The pathology of an excisional biopsy specimen confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. We emphasize that tuberculosis should be considered for neonates or infants with unresponsive pneumonia because delayed diagnosis is associated with a fatal outcome.

### Occult pneumonia in infants with high fever without source: a prospective multicenter study [^c041856e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of pneumonia in infants with high fever without source (FWS; temperature, ≥ 39.0 degrees C) and a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 20 × 10⁹/L (occult pneumonia) has been reported to be 20% before the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7). This is the main reason for carrying out chest x-ray (CXR) on infants with high FWS. The aims of this study were to establish the prevalence of occult pneumonia in well-appearing infants with high FWS (temperature, ≥ 39.0 degrees C) and a WBC count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L in the era of PCV7 and to analyze the value of WBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level as predictors of the risk of occult pneumonia in these patients.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a multicenter prospective study in 4 pediatric emergency departments including children younger than 36 months with FWS (temperature, ≥ 39.0 degrees C) and a WBC count higher than 20 × 10⁹/L on whom a CXR was performed in the absence of respiratory findings. Physicians completed a questionnaire when observing the infant, and the attending physician or, when in doubt, the radiologist interpreted the CXR. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted relative influences of the aforementioned factors on the prevalence of radiological pneumonia.

Results

During an entire year (September 2006 to September 2007), we included 188 infants (aged 1–36 months; 56.2% were males) with high FWS and a WBC count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L (range, 20–44.7 × 10⁹/L) on whom a CXR was performed. Of the 188 chest radiographs obtained, 37 (19.7%) were interpreted by the radiologist. Consolidation in the chest radiographs was detected in 25 (13.3%). The probability of an infant with high FWS and WBC of 20 x 10(9)/L or greater having pneumonia was related to 3 of the studied variables: age, ANC, and serum CRP level. The incidence of pneumonia increased with age (odds ratio [OR] of 2.62 for infants > 12 months; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04–6.60), CRP level greater than 100 mg/L (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.19–8.51), and ANC greater than 20 × 10⁹/L (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.37–9.06). White blood cell count was not predictive of occult pneumonia when ANC was taken into account.

Conclusions

In the era of PCV7, the incidence of pneumonia in infants younger than 36 months with high FWS and WBC count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L seems to be lower than that previously reported. However, this is not a uniform group because the incidence of pneumonia increases in infants older than 12 months and with higher ANC and serum CRP level.

### Diagnosis of childhood pneumonia: clinical assessment without radiological confirmation may lead to overtreatment [^8ea1b577]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Consensus guidelines discourage the use of routine radiologic confirmation of clinically diagnosed pneumonia in children. The goal of the present study was to assess the degree of antibiotic overtreatment resulting from this approach.

Design

This was a prospective data collection.

Setting

This was performed in 5 urgent care clinics in Jerusalem, Israel.

Participants

This study was composed of previously healthy children between 2 months and 18 years of age who presented with a chief complaint of fever, cough, or dyspnea between August 1, 2007, and March 15, 2008, by for whom chest x-rays were obtained because of clinical suspicion of pneumonia.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measure was percentage of children with clinical findings associated with pneumonia (hypoxia, tachypnea, rales, dyspnea) who did not have radiological findings of pneumonia.

Results

With the exception of wheezing, 55% to 65% of children with specific signs and symptoms did not have radiologic pneumonia. A similar range of children with a combination of the signs did not have radiologic pneumonia. For wheezing, alone or in combination, the percentages were higher. On multivariate analysis, only fever was found to be predictive of pneumonia. Wheezing was found to be negatively predictive.

Conclusions

Treatment of childhood pneumonia on the basis of clinical parameters alone with no chest x-ray confirmation may lead to a large portion of children receiving unnecessary antibiotic therapy. In an era when the emphasis is to decrease antibiotic resistance, radiological confirmation of pneumonia should be obtained when possible.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^e588d5a3]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The signs of community-acquired pneumonia might also be confusing. In the study by Zar and colleagues, 25% of chest radiographs for those admitted to hospital with pneumonia showed no radiologic signs of pneumonia. The inverse can also occur, in that radiographic infiltrates were reported on chest radiographs in 5–19% of children with fever in the absence of tachypnea, hypoxemia, respiratory distress or signs of lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiography is recommended in this scenario, despite the absence of tachypnea or respiratory distress, because fever and cough might represent occult pneumonia. However it is also possible that there is overcalling of pneumonia on radiographs, especially considering those reported as "radiographic infiltrates" rather than areas of "air–space consolidation".

The reported incidence of empyema, complicating up to 7% of community-acquired pneumonia, also needs to be factored into the decision-making strategy because early detection is important for improved outcomes, especially in environments where the means for treating such complications are limited. Again, in this context, chest US might be indicated rather than chest radiography.

In contexts where tuberculosis is a consideration, the guidelines recommend a chest radiograph for a child with symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia with or without tuberculosis contact. Chest radiographs form part of the diagnostic algorithm for tuberculosis, which can be undertaken at presentation or after failure to improve on antibiotic therapy. In countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence, tuberculosis is cultured in only 8% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia but probably affects a larger number of these children as a co-pathogen. In underserved settings, clinical signs are used for making a diagnosis of tuberculosis. In settings where radiologic investigations can be performed, the paucibacillary nature of tuberculosis in children has resulted in chest radiography remaining as one of the most utilised tools for making the diagnosis through the identification of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy accompanying a parenchymal consolidation or focus (Fig. 1).

### ACR appropriateness criteria fever without source or unknown origin-child [^5cc06c9a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The cause of fever in a child can often be determined from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; infections account for the majority of cases. Yet in 20%, no apparent cause can be found, designated as fever without source (FWS). The yield of chest radiography in children with FWS is low, and it is usually not appropriate. However, in children with respiratory signs, high fever (> 39°C), or marked leukocytosis (≥ 20,000/mm³), chest radiography is usually appropriate, as it has a higher yield in detecting clinically occult pneumonia. In newborns with FWS, there is higher risk for serious bacterial infection, and the routine use of chest radiography is controversial. In children with neutropenia, fever is a major concern. In some clinical circumstances, such as after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chest CT scan may be appropriate even if the results of chest radiography are negative or nonspecific, as it has higher sensitivity and can demonstrate specific findings (such as lung nodule and "halo sign") that can guide management. In a child with prolonged fever of unknown origin despite extensive medical workup (fever of unknown origin), diagnosis is usually dependent on clinical and laboratory studies, and imaging tests have low yield. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

A 4-month-old boy with past medical history of eczema presented with fever and cough; a chest radiograph showed lung consolidation, and he was initially treated with amoxicillin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. After several days, his fever persisted. He was also profoundly anemic. Antibiotic coverage was broadened because of the concern for resistant organisms; he began to improve and was discharged from the hospital. However, at 5 months of age, his fever returned, and he continued to demonstrate lung consolidation on chest radiograph. Additionally, he had lost weight and continued to be anemic. Splenic cysts were noted on abdominal ultrasound. He was diagnosed with an unusual etiology for his pneumonia and improved with the appropriate therapy. An underlying immunodeficiency was suspected, but initial testing was nondiagnostic. At 12 months of age, he presented with another infection, and the final diagnosis was made.

Progression of disease. A 3-year-old girl presented with 1-day history of fever and 2-day history of cough. Her vital signs, including oxygen saturation, were normal. Chest examination revealed no increased work of breathing and no adventitial sounds. She was discharged home with the diagnosis of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Instructions were given to follow-up if fever persisted for three or more days or if she developed increased work of breathing. She presented to the ED 4 days later with ongoing fever and worsening cough. Chest X-ray revealed right middle lobe pneumonia. Vital signs other than a mild tachypnoea were normal. She was started on oral antibiotics and discharged home.

In clinical practice

It is important to remember that practice guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia in children are designed to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate care for specific clinical circumstances. Harris et al. made the distinction between the developed and developing world regarding the use of chest radiographs in this context, in that community-acquired pneumonia presenting in the developed world can be verified by the radiologic finding of consolidation while in the developing world there might be difficulties in obtaining a radiograph. However with the institution of more radiographic equipment in developing countries, guidelines need to address the practice-related benefits of this imaging modality rather than its availability (Fig. 3). Time pressures facing clinicians at the front line, difficulties in distinguishing which children require admission, restricted bed numbers for admissions, imaging-resource limitations, perceptions regarding risk from procedures, novel imaging modalities and the probability of other causes for the child's presentation all need to be factored into a guideline. More important, the these factors can be location-specific, related to a specific period and changed according to successful immunisation campaigns, and also might depend on the changing likelihood of complications. Other drivers that often weigh in to actual practice, depending on the setting, include cost-effectiveness and the fear of litigation. Not all guidelines designed for the developed world can therefore be applied to the developing world and practice guidelines require regular review in the context of new information.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^66aa9dd3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### A 7-year-old with persistent fever and cough [^bb5557a7]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy, fully immunized 7-year-old girl presented with a 7-week history of daily fevers and a worsening cough with persistently elevated inflammatory markers. Before admission, she had an unrevealing outpatient workup by infectious disease, rheumatology, pulmonology, and otorhinolaryngology for her fever and other symptoms. Multiple courses of antibiotics had no effect, but brief courses of steroids seemed to modestly alleviate her symptoms. At an outside hospital, a computed tomography neck and chest scan revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She was subsequently transferred to the authors' institution. Her examination was notable for a febrile, tired-appearing girl in respiratory distress with a muffled voice and inspiratory stridor. Her laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with left shift, microcytic anemia, and hypoalbuminemia, as well as elevated inflammatory markers, ferritin, and fecal calprotectin. Her peripheral smear, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase were all within normal limits. Infectious study results, including blood and urine cultures, cytomegalovirus serologies, and Bartonella serologies were negative. On the second read of her outside computed tomography imaging, her lymphadenopathy was felt to be nonpathologic. Based on a recommendation by rheumatology, an ophthalmologic examination was obtained, which revealed bilateral anterior uveitis; however, rheumatologic laboratory test results returned negative. Her fevers continued, and inflammatory markers remained elevated despite antibiotics. On day 6 of hospitalization, she developed worsening respiratory distress, necessitating intubation and transfer to the ICU. Repeat laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed severe purulent tracheitis; however, throat cultures remained sterile. Her clinical deterioration without identification of an offending organism prompted additional evaluation for a systemic etiology.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^3559aa5e]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — cough in high TB prevalence settings: For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries, particularly in high risk groups (eg, inmates, people living with HIV [PLWHIV], or close contacts of pulmonary TB), we suggest that individuals with cough be evaluated for pulmonary TB (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough in high TB prevalence countries or settings, we suggest that they be screened for TB regardless of cough duration (Grade 2C). For patients with cough and at risk of pulmonary TB but at low risk of drug-resistant TB living in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF testing, when available, replace sputum microscopy for initial diagnostic testing, but chest x-rays should also be done on pulmonary TB suspects when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough suspected to have pulmonary TB and at high risk of drug-resistant TB (eg, those with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary TB, contacts of drug-resistant TB cases and/or living in countries with a high drug-resistant TB prevalence), we suggest that XpertMTB/RIF assay, where available, replace sputum microscopy but sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing and chest x-rays should be performed when feasible and where resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with cough with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis and/or weight loss, and who are at risk of pulmonary TB in high TB prevalence countries, we suggest that they should have a chest x-ray if resources allow (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

Diagnostic predictors — radiographic pneumonia among febrile young children: Physician diagnosis had low sensitivity (10% to 50%) and high specificity (90% to 100%). Decreased breath sounds, rales, or tachypnea were predictive with a sensitivity of 94%. Wheezing reduced likelihood; in a Class III study none of the 126 patients aged 2 months to 2 years who presented with wheezing had radiographic pneumonia. Tachypnea and lower chest indrawing predicted radiographic pneumonia with sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 80% to 98%) and specificity 44% (95% CI 40% to 53%). Regarding hypoxia, radiographic pneumonia was found in half of patients with an oxygen saturation of 96% or higher; other studies variably used thresholds including oxygen saturation ≤ 92%, 95%, and 96%, and SpO₂ less than 95% did not predict radiographic pneumonia in bronchiolitis, whereas temperature greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4°F) was the only positive predictor.

### Clinical predictors of occult pneumonia in the febrile child [^543b54f4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) for detecting occult pneumonia (OP) among pediatric patients without lower respiratory tract signs has been previously studied, but no predictors other than white blood cell count (WBC) and height of fever have been investigated.

Objectives

To identify predictors of OP in pediatric patients in the postconjugate pneumococcal vaccination era.

Methods

This was a retrospective cross sectional study that was conducted in a large urban pediatric hospital. Physician records of emergency department (ED) patients of age 10 years or less who presented with fever (38 degrees C) and had a CXR obtained for suspected pneumonia were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups: "signs of pneumonia" and "no signs of pneumonia" on the basis of the presence or absence of respiratory distress, tachypnea, or lower respiratory tract findings. Occult pneumonia was defined as radiographic pneumonia in a patient without signs of pneumonia.

Results

Two thousand one hundred twenty-eight patients were studied. Among patients categorized as having no signs of pneumonia (n = 1,084), 5.3% (95% CI = 4.0% to 6.8%) had OP. Presence of cough and longer duration of cough (greater than 10 days) had positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of 1.24 (95% CI = 1.15 to 1.33) and 2.25 (95% CI = 1.21 to 4.20), respectively. Absence of cough had a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.19 (95% CI = 0.05 to 0.75). The likelihood of OP increased with increasing duration of fever (LR+ for more than three days and more than five days of fever, respectively: 1.62; 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.31 and 2.24; 95% CI = 1.35 to 3.71). When obtained (56% of patients), WBC was a predictor of OP, with a LR+ of 1.76 (95% CI = 1.40 to 2.22) and 2.17 (95% CI = 1.58 to 2.96) for WBC of > 15,000/mm³ and > 20,000/mm³, respectively.

Conclusions

Occult pneumonia was found in 5.3% of patients with fever and no lower respiratory tract findings, tachypnea, or respiratory distress. There is limited utility in obtaining a CXR in febrile children without cough. The likelihood of pneumonia increased with longer duration of cough or fever or in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^0af632da]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe and critical illness.

Severe COVID-19 (Figure 1) is defined by symptoms of significant respiratory distress which in adults are tachypnea ≥ 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 300 mmHg, lung infiltrates > 50% within 24–48 hours, or clinical assessment of severe distress. This definition encompasses acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), defined by acute onset, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR. Through the course of the illness, most patients will develop a fever (77–98.6%) and cough (48.2–76%). Other common symptoms include myalgia or fatigue, which appear early in the illness and are seen in around 18–32.1% of cases, sore throat, and dyspnea. Fatigue may ultimately occur in up to 69.6% of patients through the course of the illness, but is nonspecific. Severe COVID-19 appears to be more common in men, with 54.3–68% of hospitalized patients in studies being males. It has likewise been associated with comorbidities; however, severe illness and death can occur in previously young, healthy individuals, including infants.

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific and disease presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death. Evidence so far suggests a milder course of disease in children and some asymptomatic cases, but with evidence of radiological lung changes in both categories. Cai et al reported a case series of 10 pediatric patients (aged 3 months–10 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 4 cities in China in February 2020. The symptoms reported were fever (8 patients), cough (6), sore throat (4), nasal congestion (3), and sneezing and rhinorrhea (2). None of the patients had dyspnea or diarrhea during the illness, and fever resolved after 24 hours. Chest X-ray revealed unilateral patchy infiltrate in 4 of 10 patients. Wei et al identified all hospitalized infants in China diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 8 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. Nine infected infants were identified (age range, 1–11 months) with symptoms reported as fever (4 infants), mild upper respiratory tract symptoms (2), no symptoms (1), and 2 with no information on symptoms available. None required intensive care or mechanical ventilation.

Asymptomatic infection in children is reported in 14 individual cases, reported in 5 separate papers. Notably, in an early report of a familial cluster in China, an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy was screened as part of the family cluster and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed radiological ground-glass lung opacities. In Singapore, a well 6-month-old infant with COVID-19 and high viral load was detected as part of a cluster and was also asymptomatic throughout admission. Asymptomatic cases are also reported in the English abstract of a Chinese paper, which reports clinical data and CT chest images of 15 children (aged 4–14 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Five children were febrile and 10 asymptomatic on first visit. The abstract reports radiological changes that are difficult to interpret: "For their first chest CT images, six patients had no lesions, while nine patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and two cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found".

### Recurrent febrile respiratory distress in infant: which diagnosis? [^b1527e70]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) of the lung is a rare congenital anomaly. CCAM diagnosis can be made by prenatal ultrasound or in postnatal cases with regard to respiratory distress or recurrent respiratory infections. We present, for diagnostic purposes, a case of a patient, aged 4 months who had suffered since birth from recurrent bronchopulmonary infections. He was hospitalised several times for febrile respiratory distress. Chest x-rays previously performed were interpreted as normal. A final radiograph indicated the diagnosis and it was confirmed by CT. Surgical resection was performed with a positive result. CCAM responds to the prenatal diagnosis and requires frequent ultrasound checks during pregnancy and allowing for optimal management. The radiological assessment leads to the diagnosis and addresses the treatment which is based on a surgical cure.

Acute cough with suspected pneumonia — diagnostic indicators and reference standard: Physician judgment alone frequently led to overestimation of the probability of pneumonia. Although individual signs and symptoms alone cannot rule in or rule out pneumonia, combinations of signs and symptoms can improve overall diagnostic accuracy, and the absence of any vital sign abnormalities has a high negative predictive value for ruling out pneumonia. However, even with the highest cutoff points for decision rules, the positive predictive value is rarely > 50%. Studies assessed clinical algorithms against chest radiography as the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis, although chest radiography is described as an imperfect gold standard because a significant proportion of pneumonia cases initially diagnosed based on higher-resolution imaging of the chest are not detected on chest radiographs.

### Case report: severe COVID-19 and dengue in an Indonesian infant [^6fb13b9e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe COVID-19 and severe dengue in an infant. Therefore, we need to confirm the clinical manifestations of both diseases because the case has been rarely reported.

COVID-19 is diagnosed based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory examination, and confirmed by RT-PCR examination. – In our case, the patient lived in a city with local transmission of COVID-19 with a positivity rate of 8.7% in July 2020. Taking available evidences into account, they indicate that infant was most likely to have COVID-19. We presumed that the patient might have been infected by the virus via community transmission because the mother always brought her to the trading stall. Even so, the tracing performed on her parents showed negative results of COVID-19.

The common manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient showed all those symptoms, accompanied by vomiting, which is often found in children with COVID-19 (Table 1), and also lymphopenia, low TLC, and NLR > 3.31 (Table 2). –, When admitted to the hospital, the chest CXR found an abnormality that is generally caused by the viral infection, so the radiology expertise's interpretation was viral bronchopneumonia. Computed tomography scan was not performed because of the unavailability of the resources. In a study of 7,780 pediatric patients, 76.4% and 81.1% had CXR and CT abnormality, respectively; CXR appearance of viral infection was observed in 105 of 501. Based on these various findings, we concluded the patient contracted COVID-19.

### Cough [^f5909817]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Infant fever-AAP… [^4ee06382]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Nearly two decades in the making, the American Academy of Pediatrics has published the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Well-Appearing Febrile Infants 8–60 Days Old. Infant Fever Overview. About 14 out of every 1, 000 healthy infants born full term develop a fever during the ages 8 days to 60 days old. While most fevers do not lead to severe illness, it can be challenging to immediately identify the cause of a baby's fever while avoiding unnecessary tests or hospitalizations. More than 10% of febrile infants are diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. The likelihood of a more invasive bacterial infection is much lower, with fewer than. 05% of infants developing meningitis, the most serious infection. Some other infections in young infants include pneumonia, sepsis and gastroenteritis.

AAP Recommendations In its clinical practice guideline, AAP addresses many questions raised in evaluating otherwise well-appearing infants between 8–60 days old who develop a fever at or above 100. 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on a comprehensive review of evidence, recommendations are provided for 3 age groups: 8–21 days, 22–28 days, and 29–60 days of age. For each age grouping, seven key action statements are provided: four deal with evaluation, one with initial treatment and two with further management. The guidelines provide a decision-making algorithm for each age group. Evaluation and Management of Well-Appearing Febrile Infants 8–60 Days Old.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### Pertussis symptoms in adolescents and children versus infants: the influence of vaccination and age [^4d4d42a4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

This study compared the influence of age and immunization status on symptoms in pediatric patients with pertussis. The files of 60 children, aged 7 to 18 years and 20 infants aged up to 6 months, admitted to our pediatric hospital with a diagnosis of pertussis were reviewed. There were no between-group differences in day and night cough or vomiting. The older group had a longer mean interval to diagnosis than the infants, and the infant group had more symptoms of whooping cough, facial redness during cough, cyanosis, a higher white blood count, a higher percentage of lymphocytes, and more abnormal chest X-rays. Statistically significant differences were found between vaccinated and unvaccinated older children for whooping cough and white blood cell count. Daytime and nighttime coughs are common symptoms of pertussis in all pediatric age groups, regardless of vaccination status. High white blood count is related to immunization status, and percentage of lymphocytes is related to age. In infants, symptoms are more grave but are typical, leading to early diagnosis.

CASE

History and Clinical Examination

A previously healthy 2-year-old girl was taken to her primary care physician on day 1 of symptom onset with a fever reaching 40 °C and mild diarrhea. On day 4, she was prescribed cefcapene pivoxil. She was referred to our hospital on day 8 with continued fever. There was no medical history of note, and her immunization history was up to date. There were no pets in the home, and she had no history of allergies. On admission, heart rate was 152 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, blood pressure was 115/98 mm Hg, body temperature was 38.0 °C and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Capillary refill time was normal. On physical examination, her general condition was rather poor. No cough or nasal discharge was noted. There was no conjunctival hyperemia, strawberry tongue or lip redness. Her pharynx was slightly reddened, but no cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. On chest auscultation, breath sounds were normal with no pulmonary rales. No heart murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft on palpation, and bowel peristalsis was normal. There was no redness at the bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination site. Three 3-mm papules were observed on the lower extremities and trunk.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 12.7 × 10⁹/L (normal 4.0–11.9), with 71% granulocytes and 25% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (normal 10.9–14.2), platelet count of 313 × 10⁹/L (normal 180–460), C-reactive protein level of 73.0 mg/L (normal ≤ 3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm/60 min (normal), serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 29 U/L (normal 24–50), alanine aminotransferase 11 U/L (normal 9–34), lactate dehydrogenase level of 353 U/L (normal 195–400) and serum creatinine level of 0.25 mg/dL (normal 0.17–0.45). Antigen tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and group A streptococcus were negative. Findings on a chest radiograph (X-ray) are shown in Figure 1.

### 2-year-old girl with fever and multiple nodular shadows on chest radiograph [^24ced6cd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient was discharged from the hospital in good general condition without fever 1 week after the biopsy. Six months later, there was a complete resolution of the nodular shadows on chest radiography, and there has been no recurrence of symptoms in the 3 years since her discharge from the hospital.

NSG is a rare disease that is included in the concept of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis proposed by Liebow in 1973. Histologically, NSG presents with epithelioid cell granulomas similar to those of sarcoidosis but is characterized by more extensive necrosis and granulomatous vasculitis than typical sarcoidosis. – There have been scattered reports of sarcoidosis from various countries, but few pediatric cases have been reported, with the youngest case described being 8 years old. In recent years, as for sarcoidosis, it has become clear that P. acnes DNA is present in large amounts in NSG lesions; immunostaining with PAB antibodies has a high positivity rate, suggesting that NSG is a type of sarcoidosis.

Cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fever, general malaise, and weight loss have been reported, but about 25% of patients are asymptomatic. Therefore, the disease is often discovered incidentally during a medical examination for another purpose. It has been reported that more than 80% of patients have extrapulmonary symptoms (skin, nerve and eye symptoms or liver dysfunction). In the present case, fever was present but there were no airway symptoms, and the diagnosis was based on findings on a chest X-ray obtained for investigation of fever of unknown origin. The disease resolved spontaneously, and although there have been reports of recurrence, the prognosis is reported to be good.

In summary, this report describes a child who presented to our hospital with an 8-day history of fever of unknown origin and was finally diagnosed as having NSG by endoscopic lung biopsy. To our knowledge, this case is the youngest to be reported anywhere in the world, and we anticipate that it will be educational for pediatricians.

### Evaluation of fever in infants and young children [^e9240aa4]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Febrile illness in children younger than 36 months is common and has potentially serious consequences. With the widespread use of immunizations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b, the epidemiology of bacterial infections causing fever has changed. Although an extensive diagnostic evaluation is still recommended for neonates, lumbar puncture and chest radiography are no longer recommended for older children with fever but no other indications. With an increase in the incidence of urinary tract infections in children, urine testing is important in those with unexplained fever. Signs of a serious bacterial infection include cyanosis, poor peripheral circulation, petechial rash, and inconsolability. Parental and physician concern have also been validated as indications of serious illness. Rapid testing for influenza and other viruses may help reduce the need for more invasive studies. Hospitalization and antibiotics are encouraged for infants and young children who are thought to have a serious bacterial infection. Suggested empiric antibiotics include ampicillin and gentamicin for neonates; ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for young infants; and cefixime, amoxicillin, or azithromycin for older infants.

CASE PRESENTATION

This is our first case of severe dengue in an infant with COVID-19. A 10-month-old girl, 7 kg, presented with fever, cough, and vomiting. She had no contact history with confirmed cases of COVID-19, but she resided in Bandung, a city with high local transmission of COVID-19. Her father works as a motorcycle taxi rider, and her mother trades in her stall. No influenza-like history in the family or neighbors. Before admission, she was treated with paracetamol for 2 days, but the fever still persisted. On the fourth day, the symptoms were accompanied by dyspnea.

On admission, the patient was alert, with a temperature of 38.5°C, respiratory rate of 60 rpm, pulse rate of 140 bpm, and SpO₂ 88% in room air. Chest indrawing and crackles were found. The blood count results are as follows: lymphopenia with a total lymphocyte count (TLC) of 796.8, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio 4.8, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) to 29 mg/dL. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed multiple small patches at peripheral and small nodules on perihelial and pericardial sites, which indicate interstitial processes on both the lungs (Figure 1A). She was suspected of having COVID-19 infection and then admitted to the isolation room. Binasal cannula oxygen therapy was given from day 1 to day 7, and also IV fluid (normal saline), paracetamol, antibiotic, and vitamin.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^fae3f331]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Objective assessments — arterial blood gases and chest X-ray: Arterial blood gas measurements are not routinely required; they should be considered for patients with PEF or FEV₁ < 50% predicted or for those who do not respond to initial treatment or are deteriorating, and supplemental controlled oxygen should be continued while blood gases are obtained. During an asthma exacerbation PaCO₂ is often below normal (< 40 mmHg); PaO₂ < 60 mmHg (8 kPa) and normal or increased PaCO₂ (especially > 45 mmHg, 6 kPa) indicate respiratory failure. Chest X-ray is not routinely recommended; in adults it should be considered if a complicating or alternative cardiopulmonary process is suspected (especially in older patients) or for patients not responding to treatment where a pneumothorax may be difficult to diagnose clinically, and in children routine check X-ray is not recommended unless there are physical signs suggestive of pneumothorax, parenchymal disease or an inhaled foreign body; features associated with positive chest X-ray findings in children include fever, no family history of asthma, and localized lung examination findings.

Figure 2
This graph displays to which degree 10/25 London hospital local CPGs were compliant with the recommended management steps of the gold-standard NICE NG143 guideline for infants under 3 months. NG143 recommends RS as per the green, amber red traffic-light system and all infants < 3 months fall under the red RS, all < 3 months should have an FBC, CRP, bloods culture and urine culture; CXR and stool culture if clinically indicated with respiratory signs or diarrhoea, respectively; LP to be performed and parenteral antibiotics to be administered if: < 1 m, 1–3 months and unwell, 1–3 months with WCC < 5×10⁵/L or WCC > 15×10⁵/L. There should be no contraindications to LP and LP should ideally be performed prior to administration of antibiotics. NG143 recommends IV acyclovir if febrile and signs suggestive of HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) encephalitis and gives the clinician the autonomy regarding the decision to admit or ambulate the infant. CPGs, clinical practical guidelines; CRP, C reactive protein; CXR, chest X-ray; FBC, full blood count; LP, lumbar puncture; NG143, national guideline 143; RS, risk stratification, WCC, white cell count.

In the UK, there is also the ' British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) pathway' specifically for infants < 3 months, which differs from NG143 in which it recommends LP and parental antibiotics for infants with comorbidities, posing a high risk of SBIs, or for those with a positive blood culture and raised CRP or absolute neutrophil count. It also gives advice on recently immunised infants. None of the CPGs followed the BSAC pathway.

In conclusion, all CPGs are based on NG143, but often give more cautious advice, exposing more infants to LPs and parental antibiotics with the potential for adverse effects and resource exhaustion. Differences in guidelines could lead to significant variations of care and outcomes for febrile infants between London hospitals. The REACH febrile infant regional evaluation study is currently exploring this.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^37423888]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Clinical factors associated with chest imaging findings in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis [^b5814e4d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations against routine imaging, chest radiography (CXR) is frequently performed on infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. We conducted a review of 811 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis to identify clinical factors associated with imaging findings. CXR was performed on 553 (68%) infants either on presentation or during hospitalization; 466 readings (84%) were normal or consistent with viral illness. Clinical factors significantly associated with normal/viral imaging were normal temperature (odds ratio = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.03–2.67) and normal oxygen saturation (odds ratio = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.1–2.83) on presentation. Afebrile patients with normal oxygen saturations were nearly 3 times as likely to have a normal/viral CXR as patients with both fever and hypoxia. Our findings support the limited role of radiography in the evaluation of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis, especially patients without fever or hypoxia.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^8beef1ee]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: an update [^40451229]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Classification of pneumonia

In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for classifying and treating childhood pneumonia were revised. Children presenting with cough or difficulty in breathing were classified into 3 diagnostic categories (pneumonia, severe pneumonia or no pneumonia) according to clinical features. Pneumonia is defined as tachypnea and/or chest indrawing in a child older than 2 months. Severe pneumonia is defined as cough or difficulty breathing with at least one of the following: (i) central cyanosis or oxygen saturation < 90% on pulse oximetry, (ii) severe respiratory distress (grunting, very severe chest indrawing), or (iii) any general danger sign (inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or unconscious, convulsions). Children without signs of pneumonia or severe pneumonia are classified as no pneumonia: cough or cold. Abnormal oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry predicts oral antibiotic failure. Children with pneumonia seen at outpatient settings without the capacity to perform appropriate investigations such as pulse oximetry, nutritional assessment or HIV testing may need referral.

Chest imaging

Chest X-ray remains the primary imaging modality for pneumonia (Fig. 1). The WHO developed standardized criteria for interpretation of chest radiographs in bacterial vaccine trials with three categories of radiological disease: (i) primary end-point pneumonia (end-point consolidation or pleural effusion), (ii) other infiltrate and (iii) no consolidation/infiltrate/effusion. However agreement amongst readers for detection of consolidation was modest (80%, adjusted k = 0.60), and poor for other infiltrates (66.5%, adjusted k = 0.33). Chest ultrasonography for paediatric pneumonia may be a rapid and safe diagnostic method. Data from a recent meta-analysis show that the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 93%, against various reference tests including chest radiographs in nine studies, clinical diagnosis in four studies and computed tomography in one study. However, substantial heterogeneity exists across individual studies, and a reliable reference standard is lacking. Greater methodological rigour is needed in future studies.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^0eaddd72]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever — radiologic evaluation of pneumonia notes that pneumonia is one of the primary clinical manifestations of acute Q fever and chest radiograph abnormalities are seen in the majority of patients, although early disease might have normal radiographic findings; during the Netherlands outbreak, radiographic evaluation showed infiltrates in > 96% of patients; radiographic patterns are nonspecific, with the most common abnormalities being segmental or lobar consolidation that might be unilateral or bilateral, involve upper or lower lobes, or show multiple or single opacities, whereas patchy infiltrations are an uncommon feature; acute respiratory distress syndrome is a rare manifestation but has occurred, and it is not possible to differentiate Q fever pneumonia from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia solely on the basis of radiographic findings.

### Chest radiographs for acute lower respiratory tract infections [^f556e471]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (e.g. pneumonia) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and management focuses on early treatment. Chest radiographs (X-rays) are one of the commonly used strategies. Although radiological facilities are easily accessible in high-income countries, access can be limited in low-income countries. The efficacy of chest radiographs as a tool in the management of acute LRTIs has not been determined. Although chest radiographs are used for both diagnosis and management, our review focuses only on management.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of chest radiographs in addition to clinical judgement, compared to clinical judgement alone, in the management of acute LRTIs in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 1; MEDLINE (1948 to January week 4, 2013); EMBASE (1974 to February 2013); CINAHL (1985 to February 2013) and LILACS (1985 to February 2013). We also searched NHS EED, DARE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (up to February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of chest radiographs versus no chest radiographs in acute LRTIs in children and adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author compiled the findings and any discrepancies were discussed among all review authors. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Two RCTs involving 2024 patients (1502 adults and 522 children) were included in this review. Both RCTs excluded patients with suspected severe disease. It was not possible to pool the results due to incomplete data. Both included trials concluded that the use of chest radiographs did not result in a better clinical outcome (duration of illness and of symptoms) for patients with acute LRTIs. In the study involving children in South Africa, the median time to recovery was seven days (95% confidence interval (CI) six to eight days (radiograph group) and six to nine days (control group)), P value = 0.50, log-rank test) and the hazard ratio for recovery was 1.08 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.34). In the study with adult participants in the USA, the average duration of illness was 16.9 days versus 17.0 days (P value > 0.05) in the radiograph and no radiograph groups respectively. This result was not statistically significant and there were no significant differences in patient outcomes between the groups with or without chest radiograph. The study in adults also reports that chest radiographs did not affect the frequencies with which clinicians ordered return visits or antibiotics. However, there was a benefit of chest radiographs in a subgroup of the adult participants with an infiltrate on their radiograph, with a reduction in length of illness (16.2 days in the group allocated to chest radiographs and 22.6 in the non-chest radiograph group, P < 0.05), duration of cough (14.2 versus 21.3 days, P < 0.05) and duration of sputum production (8.5 versus 17.8 days, P < 0.05). The authors mention that this difference in outcome between the intervention and control group in this particular subgroup only was probably a result of "the higher proportion of patients treated with antibiotics when the radiograph was used in patient care". Hospitalisation rates were only reported in the study involving children and it was found that a higher proportion of patients in the radiograph group (4.7%) required hospitalisation compared to the control group (2.3%) with the result not being statistically significant (P = 0.14). None of the trials report the effect on mortality, complications of infection or adverse events from chest radiographs. Overall, the included studies had a low or unclear risk for blinding, attrition bias and reporting bias, but a high risk of selection bias. Both trials had strict exclusion criteria which is important but may limit the clinical practicability of the results as participants may not reflect those presenting in clinical practice.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from two trials suggest that routine chest radiography does not affect the clinical outcomes in adults and children presenting to a hospital with signs and symptoms suggestive of a LRTI. This conclusion may be weakened by the risk of bias of the studies and the lack of complete data available.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, chest imaging, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR (posteroanterior and lateral) in all hospitalized patients with CAP to document the presence, size, and character of parenchymal infiltrates and identify complications of pneumonia requiring interventions beyond antimicrobial agents and supportive medical therapy.

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^32cdeace]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Our study does have some potential limitations. We did not have microbiological and radiological verification in all children, so we may not have detected some bacterial infections that spontaneously resolved. This would have required urine, blood, and chest radiography in all children up to 5 years of age, which was not justifiable clinically or ethically. Instead, in keeping with standards for the evaluation of diagnostic tests where applying the reference standard test in all patients is not feasible, we used a double reference standard. Children were classified as "negative" for serious bacterial infection if all reference standard tests that were done were negative (which was the case in about 25% of eligible children) and if, on follow-up, a parent reported resolution of the child's illness by days 10–14. Any cases of serious bacterial infection missed because no tests were done and that resolved spontaneously within the follow-up time frame would not greatly benefit from earlier antibiotic administration. In addition, the validity of the physician estimates of disease may be uncertain, particularly at this early stage of assessment, and the estimates had no influence on subsequent clinical care decisions.

Comparison with other studies

The evaluation of young febrile children is a major management dilemma worldwide and has attracted considerable research and policy attention. This is reflected in the recently published National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the assessment and initial management of febrile illness in children under 5 years.

These guidelines summarise the existing clinical assessment scales that combine multiple signs and symptoms in this setting. The guideline authors conducted a literature review and identified two scoring systems: the Yale observational scaleand the young infant observational scale. Problems in the development of each scale were detected, however, and neither scale was considered sensitive for the detection of serious bacterial infection. Furthermore, the review of studies of individual signs and symptoms noted that most of the data were in infants younger than 6 months of age but authors concluded it was reasonable to extrapolate to older children.

The NICE group subsequently developed a "traffic light" assessment tool that can be used to classify children into low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk of serious infection; however, the tool has not yet been evaluated. The elements in the assessment tool do have considerable overlap with fields collected in the current study, with omission only of some comparatively rare and specific events: status epilepticus, swelling of limb (non-weight bearing), bile stained vomit, and "new lump".

Pneumonia and complicated pneumonia

Pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. Pathogens include bacterial, viral, or fungal microorganisms. A presumptive diagnosis of the pathogens can be made based on the child's age and whether it was a community or nosocomial pneumonia (Table 3). Clinical symptoms include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, while neonates may present with symptoms resembling other conditions like TTN, RDS, or MAS. In community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), imaging is not required for the diagnosis, unless there is no response to outpatient treatment, which requires hospital admission due to suspected complications.

Radiography helps in detecting nosocomial pneumonia and identifying radiological patterns. Typical CR and CT findings of lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia are shown in detail in Table 4. However, these patterns lack sensitivity and specificity for determining aetiology. A unique type of pneumonia seen only in children is round pneumonia, which presents as a round opacity on CR, typically in contact with the pleura, hilum, or pulmonary fissure. This form of pneumonia is most commonly caused by bacteria, with Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for about 90% of cases. Round pneumonia predominantly affects children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as the incomplete development of collateral ventilation predisposes this age group to the condition (Fig. 8).

### Fever in well-appearing children younger than two years… [^75247989]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Lumbar puncture can be delayed in well-appearing infants 29 to 90 days of age with fever and suspected virus provided they are followed closely or hospitalized.
- Chest radiography should not be performed in well-appearing children two months to two years of age with fever of at least 100. 4°F and wheezing or a high chance of bronchiolitis.
- Urinalysis and urine cultures to diagnose urinary tract infection should be considered in well-appearing children two months to two years of age who have a fever of at least 100. 4°F, especially if they are at higher risk. From the AFP Editors. In one year, 15% of visits to the emergency department by persons younger than 15 years are children with fever, usually attributed to a benign, self-limited viral infection. Some fevers, however, can be a sign of serious infection, especially in infants younger than three months.

Although treating those who appear ill is clear cut, it can be difficult to distinguish between a benign condition and a serious bacterial infection in those who appear well. The American College of Emergency Physicians has released a clinical policy addressing issues in children younger than two years who visit the emergency department with fever, but who appear well. Recommendations INFANTS ONE TO THREE MONTHS OF AGE Laboratory studies, including a lumbar puncture to evaluate for meningitis, are commonly performed in the emergency department when an infant presents with fever. Routinely performing a lumbar puncture, which is invasive and has associated risks, is controversial. On the other hand, initiating antibiotic treatment without performing a lumbar puncture can lead to incomplete treatment or late identification of meningitis.

Being able to predict which infants presenting with fever would benefit from a lumbar puncture could help lessen parent anxiety, as well as decrease costs, the use of invasive testing, exposure to antibiotics, and admissions to the hospital. Lumbar puncture may be considered in infants 29 to 90 days of age with fever, despite that no predictors sufficiently pinpoint when cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained. Because of the lower risk of meningitis, lumbar puncture can be delayed in full-term infants diagnosed with a viral illness. Unless another source of bacteria is found, antibiotics should be withheld in infants whose lumbar puncture is delayed. These infants should be admitted to the hospital, be closely followed by a family physician, or return to the emergency department for follow-up.

CHILDREN TWO MONTHS TO TWO YEARS OF AGE The need for chest radiography in children with fever who appear well can be uncertain, especially because these patients have a greater chance of having a benign viral condition with symptoms similar to bacterial pneumonia. Clinicians should balance the benefits of performing chest radiography in children with fever with the harms. Chest radiography should be considered in children with a fever of at least 100. 4°F with no clear infection source who have a cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever, fever lasting longer than two days, or who have tachycardia or tachypnea out of proportion to the fever. Chest radiography should not be performed in those with fever of at least 100. 4°F and wheezing or a high chance of bronchiolitis.
