## Question

How is hyperparathyroidism diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the biochemical-first diagnostic approach. Then, I should confirm the core laboratory panel and the need for repeat testing. Next, I will exclude secondary causes, differentiate PHPT from phenocopies like FHH, assess supportive tests and phenotype, consider when to pursue genetics, and finally reinforce that imaging is only for localization, not diagnosis, with a concise algorithmic summary anchored in current guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the trigger for suspicion: persistent hypercalcemia on routine testing is the usual entry point, and PHPT is the most common cause of outpatient hypercalcemia, especially in postmenopausal women, so I should start by verifying albumin-corrected total calcium or ionized calcium to establish a true abnormality before proceeding further [^114rcog5] [^113LrxeF] [^115mX5fa].

> Wait, let me verify the foundational labs I must obtain simultaneously to anchor the diagnosis: adjusted total calcium or ionized calcium, intact PTH measured with a second- or third-generation assay, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine to assess renal function; this panel is endorsed by the Fifth International Workshop and AAES as the core diagnostic set [^113LrxeF] [^114fQoUh].

> Hold on, I should verify persistence before I label the disorder: for hypercalcemic PHPT, I need elevated calcium with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH on at least two occasions separated by two or more weeks to exclude transient perturbations; for normocalcemic PHPT, I must document normal adjusted and ionized calcium with elevated PTH on multiple occasions over 3–6 months, because intermittent secondary drivers can confound a single measurement [^115mxSJ5] [^114KmBRe].

> I need to ensure secondary causes are excluded methodically before confirming PHPT, especially in normocalcemic presentations: replete vitamin D if low and recheck, assess renal function and avoid diagnosing PHPT when eGFR is reduced and could drive secondary hyperparathyroidism, review medications such as thiazides and lithium, and consider malabsorption or calcium deficiency; only after these are excluded can persistent PTH elevation be ascribed to PHPT [^114KmBRe] [^114fQoUh].

> Next, I will examine the calcium–PTH relationship: in true hypercalcemia not due to PHPT, PTH should be suppressed, so an elevated or "inappropriately normal" PTH in the face of elevated calcium strongly supports PHPT, and I should remind myself that imaging does not establish diagnosis — the biochemical dyad does [^114rcog5] [^115EuFiE].

> But wait, what if the labs point to a phenocopy like familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; I should double-check a 24-hour urine calcium and calculate the calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio, suspecting FHH if the ratio is less than 0.01, particularly in young patients or with a family history, and confirm with genetic testing of CaSR, GNA11, or AP2S1 when suspicion remains; I should also consider rare ectopic PTH secretion and rule out tertiary hyperparathyroidism when advanced CKD is present [^114DBWVe] [^11359pDe] [^113F6JJa].

> I will now examine supporting tests to characterize end-organ impact and complete risk stratification: obtain a 24-hour urinary calcium to assess hypercalciuria and stone risk, document baseline renal function with eGFR or preferably creatinine clearance, perform renal imaging if stones or nephrocalcinosis are a concern, and assess bone mineral density to evaluate skeletal involvement that may guide management decisions [^111aZ7bs] [^111MsztM] [^115JXTye].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled a single hypercalciuria threshold of greater than 400 mg/day as clinically significant, but I should verify the most current guidance; AAES does reference 24-hour urine calcium greater than 400 mg/day with increased stone risk, yet the Fifth International Workshop now uses sex-specific thresholds of more than 250 mg/day in women and more than 300 mg/day in men for defining hypercalciuria and as a surgical indication, which I should apply preferentially in contemporary practice [^111Xmf47] [^116tzkNS].

> Let me consider phenotype classification cautiously: hypercalcemic PHPT remains the classic form, while normocalcemic PHPT is a validated variant that requires more rigorous exclusion of secondary causes and repeated confirmation of PTH elevation with normal adjusted and ionized calcium; I should be prepared to reconsider the diagnosis if calcium drifts upward or secondary drivers later emerge [^114KmBRe] [^114rcog5].

> Next, I should review when selective genetic testing is warranted: perform DNA analysis in suspected FHH to confirm CaSR pathway variants, and consider MEN1, CDC73/HRPT2, and RET testing in patients with early onset, multigland disease, family history, or other syndromic features, particularly under age 35 or with recurrent or persistent disease patterns [^11359pDe] [^115K4TYH].

> Hold on, I should verify that imaging is reserved strictly for localization once the biochemical diagnosis is secure and surgery is planned; high-resolution ultrasound, technetium-99m sestamibi (with SPECT/CT as needed), or 4D-CT can guide operative strategy, but they must not be used to "confirm" PHPT, a misuse that remains common and leads to errors [^115EuFiE] [^114QRTai] [^117HvUtz] [^114LkNyV].

> I should double-check the full diagnostic algorithm to ensure nothing is missed: screen with corrected or ionized calcium and suspect PHPT in persistent hypercalcemia, obtain the core panel including PTH, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine, confirm persistence on repeat testing using the appropriate interval, exclude secondary causes, assess urine calcium and the Ca/Cr clearance ratio to rule out FHH, consider genetics when indicated, stage renal and skeletal involvement, and only then localize if surgery is contemplated; this biochemical-first approach addresses the well-documented underdiagnosis and under-referral seen across health systems [^113LrxeF] [^115f5zMH] [^112FgH4C] [^112jCwYy].

Hyperparathyroidism is a **biochemical diagnosis** [^114rcog5], characterized by elevated or inappropriately normal PTH with hypercalcemia [^115mxSJ5], or by elevated PTH with normal calcium after secondary causes are excluded [^114KmBRe] [^114NPRLk]. The key steps are:

- **Confirm hypercalcemia**: Measure total calcium [^114fQoUh], correct for albumin, and confirm on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart [^115mxSJ5] [^113F6JJa]; use ionized calcium if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected [^113LrxeF].

- **Measure PTH**: Use a second- or third-generation intact PTH assay [^115mxSJ5]; elevated or inappropriately normal PTH with hypercalcemia confirms PHPT [^115mxSJ5] [^114rcog5].

- **Exclude secondary causes**: Check 25-hydroxyvitamin D, renal function (eGFR/CrCl), and 24-hour urinary calcium [^111aZ7bs] [^1173ejdr]; exclude vitamin D deficiency, CKD, thiazides, lithium, and FHH (Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01) [^114KmBRe] [^114DBWVe].

- **Normocalcemic PHPT**: Diagnose if PTH is elevated with normal calcium on at least two occasions over 3–6 months [^114KmBRe] after excluding all secondary causes [^113n6rMJ].

- **Imaging for localization**: Use cervical ultrasound [^112goaqb] and sestamibi SPECT/CT [^114QRTai] for surgical planning; consider 4D-CT or PET/CT if needed [^1155Nf8y] [^114LkNyV].

- **Assess complications**: Obtain bone mineral density (DXA) [^113LrxeF] and renal imaging for nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis [^115JXTye] [^111MsztM] [^111aZ7bs].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider MEN1, RET, or CaSR testing in young patients, those with family history, or suspected FHH [^115K4TYH] [^11359pDe].

Diagnosis is confirmed **biochemically** [^117HvUtz]; imaging is used for localization, not for diagnosis [^115EuFiE].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to parathyroid imaging, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend recognizing that identification of abnormal parathyroid tissue is enhanced with SPECT in combination with CT and is particularly valuable in repeat surgical cases. Ultrasound and (99m)Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy continue to be useful localization tools; however, they can miss small adenomas and hyperplasia.

- **Imaging for complex cases**: Additional imaging or localization tools for patients failing surgery or suspected of having an ectopic parathyroid gland include CT, MRI, C-methionine PET/CT, and parathyroid scintigraphy. Selective venous sampling should be obtained only when required for remedial exploration.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts and strategies in its management, tailored to the specific clinical phenotype presented.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: A literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, a subset of people is identified with a biochemically mild form of pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not meet the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, presenting a challenge in diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT to better characterize this patient population and to determine the benefits of parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that patients with mild pHPT displaying overt symptoms may experience improvements after parathyroidectomy. Additionally, some patients with biochemically mild pHPT progress to classic pHPT over time, though predicting which patients will do so is challenging. Early intervention in this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high-volume centers.

### Inappropriate requesting of parathyroid scintigraphy at an academic medical center [^117HvUtz]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a biochemical, not radiologic, diagnosis. Parathyroid scintigraphy should only be requested for surgical planning, not to confirm a diagnosis. This study determined the reasons for inappropriately ordered parathyroid scintigraphy.

- **Methods**: We generated a database of patients undergoing parathyroid scintigraphy over five years who did not undergo parathyroidectomy.

- **Results**: Over five years, 129 parathyroid scintigraphies (of 308 total scans) were performed in patients who did not undergo parathyroidectomy. We determined that only 58 (45%) had true primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common reason for the scan was to "confirm the diagnosis". Only 20% were ordered for adenoma localization, although surgery was not performed. Physicians requesting parathyroid scintigraphies specialized in a variety of disciplines.

- **Conclusion**: Forty-two percent of parathyroid scintigraphies were requested inappropriately to "confirm" a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. We propose changing the ordering system to clarify that parathyroid scintigraphy is a functional tool to optimize surgery when the diagnosis is secure.

### Rare causes of hypercalcemia: 2021 update [^116b7eai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the etiology of hypercalcemia, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis of rare causes of hypercalcemia, extending the observations of the original article.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive extensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology", as well as examining the references in the identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults versus pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definitive assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanism with discussion of likely etiology.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause of hypercalcemia is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology.

- **Conclusions**: The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1137a78P]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 82 patients with plausible primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to a specialist. Cases with differential diagnoses or other explanations for the imbalance in calcium homeostasis were excluded in a stepwise manner after responding to a survey and based on results of new blood tests and an assessment by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

A second sampling of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), ionized calcium, and creatinine was arranged for the remaining cohort of 45 patients. Ionized calcium was chosen for these tests to provide a more specific diagnosis of pHPT in low-range hypercalcemia compared to the formerly used albumin-corrected serum calcium values. Limits for exclusion were set at the same levels for PTH (≥ 4.3 pmol/L) and creatinine (< 175 mmol/L) as in the first inclusion criteria. The limit for ionized calcium was set at 1.26 mmol/L (reference 1.13–1.30 mmol/L), corresponding to an albumin-corrected calcium of 2.40 mmol/L. All criteria had to be met before patients continued to be included in the study. Four patients declined further participation. Patients not fulfilling the criteria after this new blood sample (n = 12) were offered one repeated testing. Ten patients did not meet the criteria this second time or declined further samplings and had to be excluded. If they fulfilled the criteria at this second new sampling, they were included in the study (n = 2).

Patients in the final study cohort (n = 32) were given outpatient appointments at the Endocrine Surgery Unit of the Department of Surgery, Östersund Hospital. At this point, two patients declined further participation in the study.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available regarding evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To provide a comprehensive summary of these developments, an international group consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT was convened. This paper presents the results of the task force assigned to review information on the management of PHPT.

For this task force, two questions were systematically reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, provide the most complete information available at the time of writing.

A panel of experts considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report, where evidence from all task forces is synthesized.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^113gWFLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data from 92 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism were identified in a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. Data were collected during 2014, and all patients had been referred to or primarily managed by a specialist.

- **Patient assessment**: Patients who had been assessed by a specialist were compared with those who had not been evaluated, using the Mann–Whitney U test.

The 82 patients not assessed by a specialist were invited to answer a survey investigating previous medication, comorbidity, and body mass index. From this survey, 12 patients with medication (thiazides, calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates) that could possibly influence serum calcium and PTH levels were identified and excluded, as well as seven patients with BMI ≥ 30. Moreover, two individuals had died, and four cases were considered too severely ill with multiple diseases to be suitable for treatment or further investigation of their hyperparathyroidism. Three patients declined further participation, four patients did not reply to the invitation, and three patients had moved to other parts of the country and were lost to follow-up. Another two patients had been diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism and were consequently cared for. All these cases were excluded from the study cohort.

### Systems-level opportunities in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism: An informatics-based assessment [^112FgH4C]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a leading cause of hypercalcemia and secondary osteoporosis, is underdiagnosed. This work aims to establish a foundation for an electronic medical record-based intervention that would prompt serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) assessment in patients with persistent hypercalcemia and identify care gaps in their management.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary academic health system of outpatients with persistent hypercalcemia, who were categorized as having classic or normohormonal PHPT. Main outcome measures included the frequencies of serum PTH measurement in patients with persistent hypercalcemia and their subsequent workup with bone mineral density (BMD) assessment, ultimately leading to medical therapy or parathyroidectomy.

Among 3,151 patients with persistent hypercalcemia, 1,526 (48%) had PTH measured, of whom 1,377 (90%) were confirmed to have classic (49%) or normohormonal (41%) PHPT. PTH was measured in 65% of hypercalcemic patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis (p < 0.001). At a median 2-year follow-up, bone density was assessed in 275 (20%) patients with either variant of PHPT (P = 0.003). Of women aged 50 years or older with classic PHPT, 95 (19%) underwent BMD assessment. Among patients with classic or normohormonal PHPT, 919 (67%) met consensus criteria for surgical intervention, though only 143 (15%) underwent parathyroidectomy.

Within a large academic health system, more than half of patients with confirmed hypercalcemia were not assessed for PHPT.

### Morbidity associated with primary hyperparathyroidism: A population-based study with a subanalysis on vitamin D [^113F6JJa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

An algorithm was developed for an initial biochemistry-based diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Any individual with a raised outpatient serum corrected calcium concentration (i.e. serum calcium concentration adjusted for serum albumin) greater than 2.55 mmol/L on two or more occasions during the follow-up period was identified as having probable PHPT. A subgroup was categorized as having definitely diagnosed PHPT if they also had one or more of the following:

- **Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)** greater than 3 pmol/L.
- **Increased 24-hour urinary calcium excretion** greater than 7 mmol/day.
- **Histologically proven parathyroid tumor**.
- **Positive Sestamibi Tc-99 scan results**.
- **Hospital admissions with PHPT diagnoses**, or surgery records with parathyroidectomy.

Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism were identified and excluded if an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤ 30 was observed before or within 180 days after the first raised serum corrected calcium. Those on thiazides and lithium before the first raised corrected calcium were excluded. Thus, our exposed cohort included all definitely and probably diagnosed PHPT patients.

For each patient with PHPT (i.e. exposed cohort), the patient register was used to identify three patients matched by gender and age (± 2.5 years) for comparison, who were free of PHPT and had normal serum calcium concentration adjusted for serum albumin during follow-up (i.e. unexposed cohort). Baseline data at the date of entry into the study were collected on all patients. Serum total 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration (i.e. serum vitamin D) was measured for each.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the third international workshop [^112xV7fq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: Interested professional societies selected a representative for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed. The conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search on PubMed, and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 5) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of kidney function.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1117mcmY]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Over-production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), or primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), is a common endocrine disease. Its prevalence increases with age, and women are affected more often than men. Studies on adult Swedish populations have demonstrated a prevalence of 0.22–0.36% and exceeding 3% in postmenopausal women.

The most common cause of the disease is a single adenoma, even though some patients have multiple adenomas or hyperplasia of all glands. Parathyroid carcinoma is uncommon and causes less than 1% of parathyroid disease cases.

Histological change decreases the parathyroid gland's sensitivity to calcium concentration, resulting in impaired inhibition of PTH secretion. High levels of PTH, in turn, increase the serum concentration of calcium. This biochemical imbalance between serum calcium levels and PTH is the basis for diagnosis. It is important to recognize that pHPT might be present even when calcium and PTH are within normal ranges.

There are a number of differential diagnoses that can cause a similar imbalance between calcium and PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is the most common and is caused by renal failure or vitamin D deficiency. Some drugs, such as lithium and thiazides, can simulate the biochemical imbalance of pHPT. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) is an uncommon and benign condition with defects in the calcium-sensing receptor, causing reduced secretion of calcium in urine, elevated serum calcium levels, and inadequately depressed PTH levels. Apart from family history and genetic testing, FHH is confirmed by measuring serum and urine calcium levels.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114fQoUh]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Serum total calcium**: This test is essential for assessing calcium levels in the blood, which are typically elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism.
- **PTH (Parathyroid Hormone)**: It is crucial to measure PTH as it helps in confirming the diagnosis and evaluating the functioning of the parathyroid glands.
- **Creatinine**: This test evaluates kidney function, which can be affected by disturbances in calcium and phosphorus metabolism.
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Measuring vitamin D levels is important for assessing how it may influence calcium metabolism and parathyroid hormone expression.

These tests are critical in the definitive diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Subclinical and asymptomatic parathyroid disease: Implications of emerging data [^1167SxAw]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by hypercalcemia caused by autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone, is prevalent, especially in postmenopausal women. Although parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic patients, most individuals with the disorder are asymptomatic and lack classic complications, such as renal stones and osteoporosis, at diagnosis. Consensus guidelines suggest which individuals might be suitable for medical follow-up rather than parathyroidectomy. However, there are no long-term randomized controlled trials to support the safety of medical surveillance, and some patients experience progression over time.

Data from observational studies suggest that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and might be predicted by parathyroid hormone concentrations, even in individuals with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Whether parathyroidectomy improves cardiovascular outcomes in these patients remains unproven, but data suggest that surgery decreases fracture risk and might improve neuropsychological symptoms. Studies also show that patients with normocalcemic (subclinical) hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism have a low risk of progression to overt disease, although their long-term risks are not well-defined. In this review, we explore the increasing range of asymptomatic parathyroid disorders, focusing on evidence about their natural history and potential complications, with a particular emphasis on primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search on PubMed, and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that: 1) Reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured, and if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### A new, vitamin D-based, multidimensional nomogram for the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism [^113ZXhJF]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To refine the diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism (1°HPT) to identify atypical patients in whom serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or both are within the "normal" range, this study measured total serum calcium, intact PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in patients with 1°HPT and healthy patient groups.

- **Methods**: Multivariate analysis of healthy patient data first identified factors that significantly affected PTH levels and defined a new PTH reference range with a mathematical model. That nomogram was then validated for the prediction of atypical 1°HPT in patients with surgically confirmed disease.

- **Results**: On multivariate analysis, calcium (P = 0.0002), 25(OH)D (P < .0001), and age (P = 0.015) independently affected PTH. Using these variables, researchers created a four-dimensional nomogram that distinguished normal patients from those with hyperparathyroid states. Mathematically, this nomogram predicts 1°HPT when the measured serum PTH value is higher than PTH calculated by the formula: PTH (pg/mL) = 120 - [6 × calcium (mg/dL)] - [0.52 × 25(OH)D (ng/mL)] + [0.26 × patient age (years)]. When applied to the surgical group of patients, this nomogram successfully identified 100% of patients (238 of 238) with classic 1°HPT, 84% (64 of 76) with normocalcemic 1°HPT, and 54% (20 of 37) with 1°HPT and normal PTH.

- **Conclusion**: This study uniquely defines a patient-specific upper limit of normal for PTH based on the readily available variables of serum calcium, 25(OH)D, and patient age. The nomogram may allow for more rapid definitive diagnosis and treatment.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, the underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6567 male (37.5%) and 10,924 female (62.5%), with a mean age of 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6096 (34.9%). Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening were five or more elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84, P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing.

### Calcitonin: current concepts and differential diagnosis [^112632Xm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Elevated serum CT levels have various causes and remain a subject of controversy.

- **Overproduction**: Endogenous CT secretion can increase due to excessive stimuli, such as hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are responsible for approximately 90% of hypercalcemia cases. However, chronic hypercalcemia rarely leads to CT elevation. Oral calcium administration can provoke diverse hormonal responses that aid in differentiating these conditions. Thyroid parafollicular cells, unlike parathyroid glands, can express a calcium-sensing receptor that, when activated, stimulates CT release. Hypergastrinemia can result from achlorhydria, such as in pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, antacid use, or Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Moreover, CT levels can rise in conditions with elevated precursors, such as pancreatitis, bacterial inflammation, sepsis, or the use of CGRP inhibitors for migraine treatment.

- **Non-stimulus related overproduction**: Overproduction may also occur primarily rather than as a response to CT secretagogues. Although not pathognomonic, elevated CT is largely linked to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and serves as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, as described previously. Importantly, MTC is not the sole thyroid condition associated with hypercalcitoninemia.

- **Note on hypercalcitoninemia causes and relevance**: A condition like C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) is associated with slight increases in both basal (10–30 mg/dL) and stimulated serum CT levels (< 560 mg/dL).

### Imaging features of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112YGB3X]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism can be primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on its aetiology. Parathyroid adenoma accounts for 80% of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism. We report a case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented with severe osteoporosis and a pathological fracture of the right acetabulum and left intertrochanteric region. The patient had diffuse osteoporosis and multiple well-defined lytic lesions. A diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, apart from multiple myeloma and metastasis, was made based on the findings of diffuse osteoporotic changes with multiple lytic lesions.

A skeletal survey was performed in view of the pathological fracture of the femur; the findings of the skeletal survey favoured the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. An ultrasound of the neck was performed to look for the cause, and a parathyroid adenoma was identified in the inferior aspect of the left lobe of the thyroid gland. A CT of the neck was also performed for preoperative localisation of the lesion. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma was made. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy, and perioperative and histopathological findings confirmed the preoperative diagnosis.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a group of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists.

The guideline panel adhered to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated the risk of bias, assessed the certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings transparently. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations.

- **GRADEd recommendations**: The panel issued eight GRADEd recommendations — seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism. Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity.

This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients? A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity from hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. While studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently from hPHPT, such as a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease, studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardized approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate, and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualized and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counseling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction, and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

- **Limitations of the literature**: Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should address these disparities to improve our understanding of nPHPT treatment outcomes.

### High ionized calcium in the general population and risk of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115mX5fa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Although it is generally held that in otherwise healthy individuals, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely cause of persistent hypercalcemia, solid research supporting this assumption is absent. We aimed to examine the relative and absolute risk of primary hyperparathyroidism associated with an incidental high ionized calcium in the general population.

- **Methods**: We used the Danish Copenhagen General Population Study, a prospective cohort study with inclusion from 2003 to 2015, to investigate the association of ionized calcium on continuous and categorical scales with primary hyperparathyroidism using Cox regression and competing-risk regression. Hazard ratios and absolute 10-year risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were calculated.

- **Results**: In 106,588 individuals, 2,497 (2.5%) had moderately high (1.33–1.40 mmol/L) or high (> 1.40 mmol/L) plasma ionized calcium at baseline, and 441 (0.4%) were diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism during follow-up. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for primary hyperparathyroidism for moderately high and high plasma ionized calcium versus low normal ionized calcium were 65 (95% CI: 46‒92) and 350 (251‒489). Stratified on sex, the corresponding hazard ratios were 63 (42‒95) and 326 (221‒482) for women and 73 (37‒145) and 490 (256‒935) for men. For women and men above 65 years, absolute risks of primary hyperparathyroidism were 7.9% and 3.3% in those with moderately high plasma ionized calcium, and 44% and 21% in those with high plasma ionized calcium.

- **Conclusions**: High ionized calcium is found in 1:40 of the general population, indicating a significant connection to primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111wk6QT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Once considered rare, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is now recognized as a common disease of mineral metabolism. The recent increase in incidence is mainly attributed to routine serum calcium determination and the measurement of calcium and parathyroid hormone levels during osteoporosis investigations. The Fourth International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism did not specifically address the global epidemiology of PHPT. Therefore, this narrative review aims to fill this knowledge gap, particularly in the context of hypercalcemic PHPT. It is based on a literature review spanning from 1980 to 2020, utilizing databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. This section also highlights recent advances in the pathophysiological aspects and genetics of PHPT.

### The diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112J6QyU]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Classical primary hyperparathyroidism — a disease of 'bones, stones, and psychic groans' — is rare in the US, though it is still observed in some parts of the world. Today, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. This change in clinical profile is not solely due to improved detection techniques. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who lack symptoms, if left untreated, rarely develop the 'classical' features that were common previously. Current data suggest that today the disorder presents different, yet characteristic, effects on the end-organs of the hyperparathyroid process.

In this review, we discuss the features of the skeletal, renal, neuropsychologic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations of 'asymptomatic' primary hyperparathyroidism. A considerable body of data has emerged since the recognition of the new clinical profile of primary hyperparathyroidism, allowing a reconsideration of care standards for this disease. These data were reviewed and incorporated into new clinical guidelines at the 2002 NIH workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. These recommendations highlight both what is known about the disease and important areas that need investigation.

Continued interest in the skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease, along with therapeutic trials of medical approaches for its management, will further refine our understanding and could lead to additional modifications in the approach to patients with this common endocrine disorder.

### Failure to diagnose hyperparathyroidism in 10,432 patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for system-level intervention to increase surgical referrals and cure [^115f5zMH]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

To determine whether a significant number of patients with hyperparathyroidism remain undiagnosed and untreated, a study was conducted. Failure to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism and refer patients to surgeons leads to impaired quality of life and increased costs. It was hypothesized that many patients with hyperparathyroidism remain untreated due to factors such as not considering the diagnosis, inadequate evaluation of hypercalcemia, and under-referral to surgeons.

A review was conducted of administrative data on 682,704 patients from a tertiary referral center between 2011 and 2015. Hypercalcemia, defined as calcium levels greater than 10.5 mg/dL, was identified in 10,432 patients. The study evaluated whether hypercalcemic patients underwent measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH), had documentation of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism, and were referred to surgeons.

Results indicated that the mean age of the cohort was 54 years, with 61% females and 56% whites. Only 3,200 (31%) hypercalcemic patients had PTH levels measured, 2,914 (28%) had a documented diagnosis of hypercalcemia, and 880 (8%) had a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism in the medical record. Only 592 (22%) out of 2,666 patients with classic hyperparathyroidism (abnormal calcium and PTH) were referred to surgeons.

In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with hyperparathyroidism do not undergo appropriate evaluation and surgical referral. System-level interventions that prompt further evaluation of hypercalcemia and raise physician awareness about hyperparathyroidism could improve outcomes and produce long-term cost savings.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues relevant to the practicing endocrinologist, we analyzed the latest information on its presentation, diagnosis, and both traditional and nontraditional aspects.

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when a traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified with normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, where no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. The traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism — the skeleton and the kidneys — continue to be a focus in patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared to the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained.

Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism have been a focus of recent interest but have not definitively aided in the decision for, or against surgery. Recommendations for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism are based on guidelines focusing on serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet these guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Primary hyperparathyroidism continues to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: a pragmatic approach [^1149Hwzn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

It is well recognised that over the past three to four decades, the incidence of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism has increased significantly. However, more recently, this pattern has further evolved into a presentation with normocalcaemia and raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels without the presence of a recognised stimulus for its rise, such as vitamin D deficiency or renal impairment. A diagnostic label of normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) has been given to this phenotype. In most cases, the initial PTH measurement is driven by the presence of metabolic bone disease.

The reported prevalence, degree of end-organ involvement, and the rate of progression vary considerably and are related to the patients studied and the biochemical cut-offs used in its definition. A majority of patients are diagnosed during the assessment of metabolic bone disease of varying degrees. Once the diagnosis is confirmed by excluding confounding factors, the patient should undergo a full assessment of end-organ involvement, which is the main determinant of further therapeutic decisions.

Surgery, with prior localisation, is considered in patients with significant end-organ involvement, in keeping with the guidance for hypercalcaemic patients. If a patient does not meet these criteria, annual clinical and biochemical surveillance is recommended to identify progression to hypercalcaemia or worsening end-organ involvement. It is less clear if patients identified during 'routine' requests for evaluation of unrelated symptoms require similar close monitoring.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease, and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### Very low or undetectable intact parathyroid hormone levels in patients with surgically verified parathyroid adenomas [^114bPYWL]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The study investigates undetectable or low-normal serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with surgically verified primary hyperparathyroidism with parathyroid adenomas. It reviews relevant literature and provides management suggestions for such clinical cases. Future research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying these 'undetectable' or inappropriately low serum intact PTH levels.

- **Methods**: Serum intact PTH levels were measured pre- and postoperatively by immunochemiluminescent assay (ICMA). The results were confirmed with at least two repeated measurements on different occasions for each patient.

- **Patients**: Two unusual patients were encountered, both with primary hyperparathyroidism. Despite having suggestive biochemical and/or clinical features of primary hyperparathyroidism, serum intact PTH levels were very low or undetectable in the context of hypercalcemia, with no other discernible cause. A (99m)Tc sestamibi scan indicated increased uptake in one of the parathyroid glands, suggesting a single adenoma confirmed at surgery for each case.

- **Results**: In the first patient from India, the mean serum calcium was 2.6 ± 0.32 mmol/l (reference range 2.12–2.74 mmol/l) with an intact PTH of 0.11 pmol/l (reference range 1.1–7.59 pmol/l). The second patient from the United States had a mean serum calcium and intact PTH of 2.9 ± 0.07 mmol/l (reference range 2.17–2.51 mmol/l) and 1.35 pmol/l (reference range 1.1–7.59 pmol/l), respectively. Following curative parathyroidectomy, serum calcium levels normalized.

### Gender differences in bone mineral density in patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism [^115T4Dwe]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the autonomous overproduction of parathormone (PTH) owing to hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands. It can be caused by a single-gland adenoma, multigland hyperplasia, or parathyroid carcinoma. PHPT is the third most common endocrine disorder and the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients. Its prevalence is about 1 to 4 per 1000 in the United States, occurring in about three times as many women as men. The incidence of PHPT rises with age, peaking in women between 50 and 60 years old.

The classic clinical presentation of PHPT is often characterized as "bones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones". Since the 1970s, the availability of routine calcium testing and PTH assays has improved the recognition of PHPT, allowing earlier diagnosis with little or no symptoms. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) remains the only definitive curative treatment for PHPT. Recent guidelines issued by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons clearly and objectively define the indications for PTX. Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less clinically effective and less cost-effective than surgical intervention, even in patients with seemingly mild disease.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114rcog5]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disorder characterized by the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. In most individuals, a single benign parathyroid adenoma is the cause, although multiglandular disease is not uncommon and is often associated with familial PHPT syndromes. The genetics of PHPT are typically monoclonal when a single gland is involved and polyclonal in cases of multiglandular disease. Genes implicated in PHPT include proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.

Hypercalcemia is the biochemical hallmark of PHPT. The concentration of PTH is usually elevated but can remain within the normal range, which is abnormal in the presence of hypercalcemia. Normocalcemic PHPT has been recognized as a variant where the serum calcium level remains consistently normal, yet PTH levels are elevated without an obvious inciting stimulus.

The clinical presentation of PHPT ranges from asymptomatic disease, commonly seen in countries with routine biochemical screening, to classic symptomatic disease with renal and/or skeletal complications. Management guidelines have been recently revised to assist clinicians in determining the merits of pursuing parathyroidectomy versus a non-surgical approach. This primer addresses these topics with a focus on the epidemiology, clinical presentations, genetics, evaluation, and management guidelines of PHPT.

Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT), a phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism, is characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone levels in the setting of persistently normal serum calcium. Diagnosis of NPHPT can be challenging and requires that secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism be excluded. The natural history of NPHPT remains inconclusive. Although biochemically less severe, the skeletal and renal complications of NPHPT vary across studies, primarily due to underlying selection bias. Due to limited data, there is currently no consensus regarding medical and surgical treatment.

Recent studies on parathyroidectomy have indicated that normocalcemic patients present more often with negative preoperative localization studies and multiglandular disease, which complicates successful surgical management. In addition, postoperative improvements in bone mineral density and nephrolithiasis vary, raising questions about the optimal treatment approach. Further studies are needed to provide better evidence-based guidance for normocalcemic patients.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: New issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated.

Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring, because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT.

There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard.

- **Unanswered questions**: Whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^113NZfcZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

In this narrative review, we present data gathered over four decades (1980–2020) on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). PHPT is typically a disease of postmenopausal women, but its prevalence and incidence vary globally and depend on a number of factors, the most important being the availability to measure serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels for screening.

In the Western world, the change in presentation to asymptomatic PHPT is likely to occur over time also in Eastern regions. The selection of the population to be screened will, of course, affect the epidemiological data (i.e.g.eneral practice as opposed to a tertiary center).

- **Parathyroid hormone role**: Parathyroid hormone has a pivotal role in regulating calcium homeostasis; small changes in extracellular Ca++ concentrations are detected by parathyroid cells, which express calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs). Clonally dysregulated overgrowth of one or more parathyroid glands together with reduced expression of CaSRs is the most important pathophysiologic basis of PHPT.

- **Skeletal disease spectrum**: The spectrum of skeletal disease reflects different degrees of dysregulated bone remodeling. Intestinal calcium hyperabsorption, together with increased bone resorption, leads to an increased filtered load of calcium that, in addition to other metabolic factors, predisposes individuals to the appearance of calcium-containing kidney stones.

- **Genetic basis**: A genetic basis of PHPT can be identified in about 10% of all cases. These may occur as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN1–MEN4) or the hyperparathyroidism jaw-tumor syndrome.

The PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend performing parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when one or more of the following conditions are present, including those who are asymptomatic, provided there are no contraindications:

- **Serum calcium levels**: Serum calcium ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal (ULN).

- **Skeletal involvement**: Presence of skeletal involvement, such as a fracture identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site.

- **Renal involvement**: Evidence of renal involvement, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 60 mL/min, or hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day in women; > 300 mg/day in men).

- **Age consideration**: Age < 50 years. No other indications are necessary; age < 50 years is a sufficient indication.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, contributing to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation if these are properly searched for. It is still unclear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, though some conservatively treated patients develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

- **Definitive treatment and cure rates**: The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite surgery's low risk of complications, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered.

- **Evaluation and guidelines in Sweden**: After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered. In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate.

Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands, but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcaemia or organ damage. However, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcaemic patients as in those with hypercalcaemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcaemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period.

Surgery had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcaemic or hypercalcaemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on the quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcaemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery. For those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and monitoring for the development of organ damage should be offered.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation. Thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^112Yiz5z]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The study aims to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

- **Methods**: The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

- **Results**: Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

- **Conclusion**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure proper evaluation and follow-up according to research.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in the older person [^114jJkyP]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common condition that may present with few symptoms. One of the principal concerns in older individuals with minimally symptomatic PHPT is the restoration of bone mineral density and the prevention of fractures. Other important considerations include cardiovascular risk and quality of life. Although surgery is traditionally the treatment of choice, it may not always address these issues effectively. We present a review of the literature and advice on medical therapies that should benefit patients, emphasizing a multifaceted approach to protecting individuals from PHPT.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in patients with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in patients with cancer.
