## Question

HIV vaccine schedule for adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the HIV vaccine schedule for adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether a preventive HIV vaccine even exists and clarify the terminology. Then, I should determine if the question instead refers to the immunization schedule for adults living with HIV against other vaccine-preventable diseases. Next, I will outline core vaccination principles in HIV, followed by specific vaccine recommendations and modified schedules where evidence supports them. Finally, I will consider safety issues, CD4 thresholds for live vaccines, and monitoring strategies such as post-vaccination serologies where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the most fundamental point: there is currently no licensed vaccine that prevents acquisition of HIV, and recent large efficacy trials have not demonstrated protection, including the mosaic Ad26-based regimen that failed to show efficacy and the earlier STEP Ad5 vector trial that even signaled early harm in a subgroup, so I should not imply that a routine "HIV vaccine" schedule exists for prevention of HIV itself [^111ptCZZ] [^111kBCRF]. Wait, let me verify the preventive strategy actually recommended in the absence of a vaccine: it is PrEP with oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for all sexes, oral emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for eligible males, and long-acting injectable cabotegravir for persons at substantial risk, all per CDC's 2021 guidelines, which confirms the prevention approach is pharmacologic rather than immunization-based [^116aSVRy] [^111GC8bR] [^115NEPCT] [^113xucfh].

> Given that, hold on, I should pivot carefully: the clinically relevant interpretation is usually the recommended immunization schedule for adults who are living with HIV, to protect them from other infections. I need to ensure I apply general principles: vaccinate early when CD4 counts are higher to improve immunogenicity; prefer inactivated or recombinant vaccines; avoid live-attenuated vaccines when CD4 is below 200 cells/μL; and consider enhanced dosing or extra doses for some vaccines, with post-series serologic checks where they change management. These principles are embedded in ACIP adult schedules and HIV-focused guidance and supported by data showing reduced vaccine response durability in persons with HIV, which argues for structured follow-up and boosters as indicated [^113PY1vc] [^111FkTuZ] [^116Levcv] [^1162rXPq].

> I will now examine influenza vaccination, because respiratory viral morbidity is substantial. Annual influenza vaccination with an inactivated or recombinant product is recommended; the live-attenuated intranasal vaccine should not be used in persons with HIV, particularly with CD4 less than 200, and immunogenicity can be blunted, especially against H3N2, which is why some clinicians consider adjuvanted or high-dose formulations when available, although standard ACIP recommendations focus on ensuring annual receipt rather than mandating a specific high-potency brand. I should double-check that immunogenicity data do support diminished responses and potential benefits from adjuvanted formulations in HIV, which they do, including weaker serologic responses and improved persistence with adjuvanted H1N1 formulations in trials of adults with HIV [^113AqjeG] [^116T3hpJ] [^1111DFJs] [^1155cCmL].

> Next, I should review COVID-19 vaccination. Adults with HIV generally follow the age-appropriate ACIP schedule for primary and updated doses, but those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, which can include some people with advanced HIV, should receive additional updated doses at least two months apart based on clinical judgment. Wait, let me verify durability: multiple cohorts show high seropositivity after two or three doses but somewhat faster waning compared with HIV-negative individuals, and fourth doses provide additional neutralization benefits, which justifies timely boosters under ACIP guidance and clinical discretion in immunocompromised states [^111FxmmS] [^117TXtUe] [^115mpLmc] [^1126Sone] [^111z7gVP].

> I need to ensure that hepatitis B vaccination is prioritized, given higher carriage and sequelae risks. For all adults with HIV who lack documented immunity, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended; in this population, enhanced regimens improve response. Let me check the specifics: using double-dose intramuscular formulations in 3- or 4-dose series and checking anti-HBs one to two months after series completion is supported; if anti-HBs is under 10 mIU/mL, revaccination with a double-dose regimen improves seroconversion. Accelerated schedules can be acceptable when rapid protection is needed, particularly at higher CD4 counts, and universal adult HBV vaccination is endorsed by ACIP, with risk-based indication for those 60 and older and universal for ages 19–59. I should confirm best-practice advice from ACP/CDC also highlights HIV as a clear indication to vaccinate against HBV, which it does [^113tL6Wx] [^1166yGQk] [^111jxt4j] [^117DzA2y] [^113LBaio] [^114wbPpF].

> For hepatitis A, I should confirm whether HIV infection itself is an indication. ACIP recommends hepatitis A vaccination for persons with HIV, typically as a two-dose series, and in travel scenarios the accelerated HepA-HepB combination schedule can be used with a 12-month booster; durability data suggest sustained seropositivity in many adults with well-controlled HIV, though titers are lower than in HIV-negative individuals, supporting vaccination early in the course and while on effective ART. Hold on, I should verify the 2020 HAV guidance and schedule note harmonization, which indeed endorse vaccination of persons with HIV and allow the accelerated Twinrix schedule for travel [^113AqjeG] [^114QTxhg] [^114ahWJu] [^1159dTBt].

> Turning to pneumococcal vaccination, adults with HIV aged 19–64 are indicated for conjugate vaccination. I need to check the updated ACIP options: either one dose of PCV20 alone or PCV15 followed by PPSV23 at the recommended interval, with analogous guidance for those 65 and older if not previously vaccinated. Given persistent excess risk of pneumococcal disease in adults with HIV, including in high-burden settings despite ART, timely conjugate vaccination is important; standard vaccines are safe and do not meaningfully perturbe HIV reservoirs under suppressive ART in clinical trials, which reassures me about administering them per schedule [^113PY1vc] [^111GRkLu] [^114e8zyz] [^1161KHK7].

> For meningococcal vaccination, let me think about the specifics because HIV is an indication for MenACWY. Adults with HIV who lack prior MenACWY should receive a 2-dose primary series separated by at least 8 weeks, with boosters every 5 years thereafter; I should confirm coadministration considerations with MenB, which ACIP notes can be done at a different site if MenB is indicated by shared clinical decision-making or during outbreaks or special risk contexts. Hold on, I should verify that ACIP explicitly highlights HIV as an indication for MenACWY and permits simultaneous administration with MenB, which it does in schedule updates and meeting summaries [^114AnAtk] [^113PY1vc].

> I will now examine human papillomavirus vaccination. Routine HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 for all persons, and the schedule for immunocompromised individuals, including adults with HIV, is the 3-dose series at 0, 1–2, and 6 months; for ages 27–45, use shared clinical decision-making, acknowledging that population benefit is smaller but individual benefit may exist for those at ongoing risk. Wait, let me double-check the evidence in adults with HIV: immunogenicity is generally acceptable, though clinical efficacy for preventing new anal HPV infections in adults over 27 with HIV was not demonstrated in one RCT, whereas broader systematic reviews support vaccine effectiveness in younger, HIV-negative cohorts and immunogenicity across schedules. WHO also emphasizes that immunocompromised persons, including those with HIV, should receive at least two and preferably three doses, which aligns with ACIP's 3-dose recommendation in immunocompromised hosts [^113AqjeG] [^114QTxhg] [^111XpXg9] [^113Z7ERx] [^116X3TYJ].

> Let me consider tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, plus measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, and zoster. Adults with HIV should receive one dose of Tdap if never received, followed by Td or Tdap booster every 10 years, consistent with ACIP; for MMR and varicella, live vaccines are contraindicated when CD4 is under 200 cells/μL, but may be given if there is no evidence of immunity and CD4 is at or above 200, keeping in mind that serologic responses can be attenuated in HIV. For herpes zoster, the recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended starting at age 19 in immunocompromised adults, including those with HIV, as a two-dose series; phase 1/2 data support robust immunogenicity of the subunit vaccine in adults with HIV, supporting use per ACIP. I should confirm the schedule notes reflecting these constraints and recommendations, which they do [^1169gUQB] [^113AqjeG] [^113chpFj] [^111o4GTK].

> But wait, what about travel and special situations? I need to ensure individualized assessment: travel vaccines such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid follow general principles; live vaccines remain contraindicated with CD4 below 200; oral cholera vaccine can be considered in outbreaks or high-risk travel with recognition of somewhat reduced immunogenicity in adults with HIV but still meaningful seroconversion rates. I should confirm that studies in HIV-infected adults show reduced yet present responses to oral cholera vaccine, which they do, supporting case-by-case use when indicated [^115QMYy7] [^112KoHho].

> To tie this together, I should double-check a practical sequence: initiate or update influenza annually and COVID-19 per current ACIP with additional updated doses as indicated for immunocompromise; ensure HepB series with enhanced dosing and post-vaccination anti-HBs testing; give HepA series if nonimmune; provide pneumococcal conjugate vaccination using PCV20 once or PCV15 then PPSV23; administer MenACWY as a 2-dose primary series with 5-year boosters and consider MenB under shared decision-making; complete HPV 3-dose series through age 26 and consider ages 27–45 individually; provide Tdap once then Td/Tdap every 10 years; evaluate MMR and varicella only if CD4 is at least 200 and there is no evidence of immunity; and give recombinant zoster vaccine in a two-dose series starting at age 19 for immunocompromised persons. I need to ensure vaccination decisions are revisited at each visit as ACIP updates evolve and as CD4 counts and clinical status change, which is a standard of care emphasized by ACIP and primary care guidance [^113AqjeG] [^113PY1vc] [^1175vyQD].

There is **no approved HIV vaccine** for adults [^111ptCZZ], so there is **no HIV vaccine schedule** [^113AqjeG]. Adults at risk should use **proven prevention strategies**, including PrEP [^115NEPCT], consistent condom use [^notfound], and regular HIV testing [^111NLbNZ]. If an HIV vaccine is approved, schedules will be set by regulatory and public health authorities [^114t4XFo].

---

## Current status of HIV vaccine development

Despite decades of research, **no HIV vaccine has shown sufficient efficacy** for approval [^111ptCZZ]. Key trials include:

- **Step study (2007)**: Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine increased HIV acquisition risk in some subgroups [^111kBCRF].

- **RV144 trial (2009)**: Modest efficacy (31%) in Thailand; not enough for approval [^111ptCZZ].

- **Imbokodo trial (2021)**: Mosaic Ad26-based regimen showed no significant efficacy [^111ptCZZ].

- **Mosaico trial (2023)**: Stopped early for futility [^111ptCZZ].

---

## Current HIV prevention strategies

Without a vaccine, **prevention relies on** the following strategies [^1175vyQD]:

- **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**: Daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) [^116aSVRy], emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF) [^111GC8bR], or long-acting injectable cabotegravir [^115NEPCT] [^113xucfh].

- **Condom use**: Consistent and correct use [^114sm9nx].

- **Regular testing**: Routine HIV screening for early detection and linkage to care [^111NLbNZ].

---

## Future considerations for HIV vaccine schedules

If a vaccine is approved, **schedules will be determined by** factors such as:

- **Regulatory approval**: FDA and WHO guidance [^113AqjeG].

- **Public health policy**: CDC and ACIP recommendations [^114QTxhg].

- **Clinical evidence**: Trial data on efficacy, safety, and durability [^111kBCRF].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no approved HIV vaccine or schedule** for adults [^111ptCZZ]. Prevention should rely on PrEP, consistent condom use, and regular testing [^115NEPCT]. If a vaccine is approved, schedules will be set by regulatory and public health authorities [^114t4XFo].

### Impact of aging and HIV infection on serologic response to seasonal influenza vaccination [^116T3hpJ]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

To determine the influence of age and HIV infection on influenza vaccine responses, a study was designed to evaluate the serologic response to a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) as the immunologic outcome in HIV-infected (HIV⁺) and age-matched HIV-negative (HIV⁻) adults.

From 2013 to 2016, 151 virologically controlled HIV⁺ individuals on antiretroviral therapy and 164 HIV⁻ volunteers were grouped by age: young (< 40 years), middle-aged (40–59 years), and old (≥ 60 years). Participants were administered TIV and investigated for serum antibody responses to vaccine antigens.

- **Results**: At prevaccination (T0), titers were in the seroprotective range in more than 90% of participants. Antibody titers increased in all participants postvaccination. However, the frequency of classified vaccine responders to individual or all three vaccine antigens at 3–4 weeks was higher in HIV⁻ than in HIV⁺ adults, with the greatest differences manifesting in the young age group. Of the three vaccine strains in TIV, antibody responses at T2 were weakest against H3N2, with those to H1N1 and B antigens dominating. Among the age groups, the titers for H1N1 and B were lowest in the old age group, with evidence of an age-associated interaction in HIV⁺ persons with antibodies to the B antigen.

- **Conclusion**: Greater frequencies of vaccine nonresponders are seen in HIV⁺ young adults compared with HIV⁻ adults, and the observed age-associated interaction for the B antigen in HIV⁺ individuals supports the concept of premature immune senescence in controlled HIV infection. It is suggested that high-potency influenza vaccination recommended for healthy aging could be considered for HIV⁺ adults.

### HIV infection in adults: Initial management [^114sm9nx]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

The HIV epidemic is an important public health priority. Transmissions continue to occur despite effective therapies that make HIV preventable and treatable. Approximately one-half of people with HIV are not receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Starting ART early, followed by continuous lifetime treatment, most effectively achieves durable virologic suppression and restoration of immune function that can improve clinical outcomes and prevent transmission to partners who are seronegative. National treatment guidelines include ART options that can be offered immediately after diagnosis, even before the results of baseline HIV drug-resistance testing are available. Initial ART selection should be guided by co-occurring conditions, including viral hepatitis, medications, and other factors such as pregnancy. Identifying and addressing psychosocial barriers to care is a key element of ensuring long-term adherence to treatment. The initial physical examination typically reveals no clinical manifestations of HIV in the absence of advanced disease. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including HIV viral load and CD4 lymphocyte monitoring, is necessary to guide decision-making for treatment, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and vaccinations. The initial management of people with HIV presents a unique opportunity for family physicians to improve patients' long-term health care and reduce HIV transmissions.

### Perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents and young adults demonstrate distinct BNT162b2 messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine immunogenicity [^116AaYd3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Immunization of vulnerable populations with distinct immunity often results in suboptimal immunogenicity, durability, and efficacy.

- **Methods**: Safety and immunogenicity profiles of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine were evaluated among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study involved 28 perinatally HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 65 healthy controls (HCs) with no previous history of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–specific humoral and CD4+ T cell responses were measured. Samples were collected at various stages: before vaccination (baseline, day [D] 0), at the second dose (D21), and at 4 weeks (D28) and 6 months (D180) after D0. Proteomic profiles at D0 and D28 were assessed using a multiplexed proximity extension assay (Olink) on plasma samples.

- **Results**: All HIV-infected patients mounted similar anti–SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses to those of HCs, albeit with lower titers of anti-trimeric S at D28 (P = 0.01). Only the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected patients demonstrated an impaired ability to expand their specific (CD40L+) CD4+ T-cell populations at D28. Similar humoral titers were maintained between the two groups at the 6-month follow-up. Baseline protein levels were correlated with either humoral or cellular responses, identifying clusters of molecules involved in immune response regulation with inverse profiles between the HIV-infected patients and the HCs.

### Vaccination in the adult patient infected with HIV: A review of vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity [^116Levcv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients infected with HIV remain at increased risk of mortality and morbidity from diseases that are preventable with vaccines, partly due to the persisting immunopathology that results in impaired responses to vaccination despite virologic suppression. Because data on clinical effectiveness in patients who are immunocompromised remain limited, undervaccination of individuals with HIV poses a major concern. Multiple societies have published recommendations on vaccination in individuals infected with HIV. Many of these recommendations are based on extrapolation of data from clinical trials that usually exclude patients with HIV, although there is a growing body of data from patients infected with HIV as well. In this review, we describe the available literature on vaccine response in the adult patient with HIV as measured by immunogenicity or vaccine efficacy.

### Guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections among HIV-infected persons — 2002. Recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117Qasbp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

In 1995, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); these guidelines were updated in 1997 and 1999. This fourth edition of the guidelines, made available on the Internet in 2001, is intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected persons.

The goal of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for preventing OIs among HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women, and HIV-exposed or infected children. Nineteen OIs, or groups of OIs, are addressed. Recommendations are included for:

- **Preventing exposure**: Guidelines for reducing exposure to opportunistic pathogens.
- **Primary prophylaxis**: Strategies for preventing first episodes of disease by chemoprophylaxis or vaccination.
- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Methods to prevent disease recurrence.

Major changes since the last edition of the guidelines include:

1. Updated recommendations for discontinuing primary and secondary OI prophylaxis among persons whose CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have increased in response to antiretroviral therapy.
2. Emphasis on screening all HIV-infected persons for infection with hepatitis C virus.
3. New information regarding the transmission of human herpesvirus 8 infection.
4. New information regarding drug interactions, chiefly related to rifamycins and antiretroviral drugs.
5. Revised recommendations for immunizing HIV-infected adults and adolescents and HIV-exposed or infected children.

### Hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care: Best practice advice from the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [^111jxt4j]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for hepatitis B virus infection, particularly with respect to immunizations, the ACP/CDC 2017 guidelines recommend offering vaccination against HBV for all unvaccinated adults (including pregnant females) at risk for infection, including:

- **History of exposure**: sexual, percutaneous, or mucosal exposure.
- **Healthcare and public safety workers**: Those at risk for blood exposure.
- **Patients with chronic conditions**: Adult patients with chronic liver disease, ESRD (including those receiving hemodialysis), or HIV infection.
- **Travelers**: Individuals traveling to HBV-endemic regions.
- **Adults seeking protection**: Those seeking protection from HBV infection.

### COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity in people with HIV [^117TXtUe]. AIDS (2023). High credibility.

Many vaccines require higher or additional doses, or adjuvants, to provide adequate protection for people with HIV (PWH). Our objective was to compare COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity in PWH to HIV-negative individuals.

In a Canadian multi-center prospective, observational cohort of PWH receiving at least two COVID-19 vaccinations, we measured vaccine-induced immunity at 3 and 6 months post the second dose and 1-month post the third dose. The primary outcome was the percentage of PWH mounting vaccine-induced immunity, defined as co-positivity for anti-IgG against SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) and receptor-binding domain proteins, 6 months post the second dose. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare COVID-19-specific immune responses between groups and within subgroups.

Data from 294 PWH and 267 controls were analyzed. Immunogenicity was achieved in over 90% at each time point in both groups. The proportions of participants achieving comparable anti-receptor-binding domain levels were similar between the groups at each time point. Anti-S IgG levels were similar by group at month 3 post the second dose and 1-month post the third dose. A lower proportion of PWH versus controls maintained vaccine-induced anti-S IgG immunity 6 months post the second dose [92% vs. 99%; odds ratio: 0.14 (95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.80; P = 0.027)]. In multivariable analyses, neither age, immune non-response, multimorbidity, sex, vaccine type, nor timing between doses was associated with reduced IgG response.

Vaccine-induced IgG was elicited in the vast majority of PWH and was overall comparable to that in HIV-negative individuals.

### A randomized controlled study of accelerated versus standard hepatitis B vaccination in HIV-positive patients [^114wbPpF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccines is impaired. The primary and secondary aims of our study were to investigate the effectiveness and compliance of two different vaccination regimens in an HIV-infected population.

- **Methods**: A noninferiority trial with a 10% response margin was designed. Included were patients aged 18 years or older, with negative HBsAg/anti-HBc serology, and not previously vaccinated against hepatitis B. Patients were stratified according to CD4(+) cell count: 500. Participants received 10 μg HBvaxPRO intramuscularly according to a 0–1–3 week schedule or the standard 0–4–24 week schedule. Anti-HBs levels were measured at week 28, considered protective ≥ 10 IU/L.

- **Results**: A modified intention-to-treat analysis in 761 patients was performed. The overall response difference was 50% (standard arm) versus 38.7% (accelerated arm) = 11.3% (95% confidence interval, [4.3, 18.3]), close to the 10% response margin. In the CD4(+) cell count group of 200–500 cells/mm³, the response difference was 20.8% (95% CI [10.9, 30.7]). However, the response difference in the CD4(+) cell count group > 500 cells/mm³ was -1.8% (95% CI [-13.4, 9.7]). Compliance was significantly superior with the accelerated schedule, 91.8% versus 82.7% (P ≤ .001).

- **Conclusion**: In HIV-infected patients, compliance with an accelerated hepatitis B vaccination schedule is significantly better. The efficacy of an accelerated schedule proved to be non-inferior in the CD4(+) cell count group > 500 cells/mm(3).

### Safety and immunogenicity of 4 intramuscular double doses and 4 intradermal low doses vs standard hepatitis B vaccine regimen in adults with HIV-1: a randomized controlled trial [^117DzA2y]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Alternative schedules more immunogenic than the standard hepatitis B vaccine regimen are needed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection.

The objective was to compare the safety and immunogenicity of 4 intramuscular double-dose and 4 intradermal low-dose regimens versus the standard hepatitis B vaccine regimen.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: An open-label, multicenter, 1:1:1 parallel-group, randomized trial was conducted between June 28, 2007, and October 23, 2008 (date of last patient visit, July 3, 2009) at 33 centers in France. Patients were enrolled in the French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis trials. They were adults with HIV-1 infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) seronegative, and had CD4 cell counts of more than 200 cells/μL.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 intramuscular injections of the standard dose (20 μg) of recombinant HBV vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 24 (IM20 × 3 group, n = 145); 4 intramuscular double doses (40 μg [2 injections of 20 μg]) of recombinant HBV vaccine at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 24 (IM40 × 4 group, n = 148); or 4 intradermal injections of low doses (4 μg [1/5 of 20 μg]) of recombinant HBV vaccine at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 24 (ID4 × 4 group, n = 144).

- **Main outcome measures**: The percentage of responders at week 28 was defined as patients with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) of at least 10 mIU/mL in patients who received at least 1 dose of vaccine. Patients with missing anti-HBs titer measurement at the final follow-up visit at week 28 were considered nonresponders in the primary analysis.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^116rLPRP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy, immunogenicity, and adverse events with HPV vaccines in people living with HIV were assessed. In children living with HIV, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine results in higher GMTs than control at seven months, though there was only very low-certainty evidence about local or systemic adverse events. In adults living with HIV, the evidence regarding clinical outcomes and harms of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine compared with control or other HPV vaccines was of very low certainty. One RCT in adults living with HIV reported that the bivalent vaccine had similar immunogenicity outcomes for HPV 16 compared to the quadrivalent vaccine, but resulted in higher GMTs and a greater rate of seroconversion to HPV 18.

- **Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**: This review collated evidence about the efficacy — in terms of clinical and immunological endpoints — and harms of different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules in females and males. The information sources searched include electronic databases, websites of the vaccine manufacturers, and a published index of HPV studies (Jørgensen 2018a), so the level of completeness is high. The applicability of the evidence to determine clinical efficacy and harms is, however, limited by the nature of HPV-related disease, as well as the design and outcomes of the studies. The evidence from RCTs about efficacy against severe HPV-related disease, including cancer, is limited for three main reasons. First, it is unethical to collect specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sexual intercourse. Second, few severe clinical outcome events related to HPV infection…

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2014 [^112jWomA]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Vaccines are recommended for adults based on their age, prior vaccinations, health conditions, lifestyle, occupation, and travel. Reasons for low levels of vaccination coverage among adults are multifactorial, including limited public awareness about adult vaccines and gaps in incorporating regular assessments of vaccine needs and vaccination into routine medical care. Updated standards for the immunization of adults were approved by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in September 2013. These standards acknowledge the low levels of vaccination coverage among adults and the role that all health-care providers, even those who do not offer all recommended adult vaccines, have in ensuring their patients are up-to-date on recommended vaccines. NVAC recommends that providers assess vaccination needs at each patient visit, recommend needed vaccines, and ideally, offer the vaccine. If the provider does not stock the needed vaccines, they should refer the patient to a vaccinating provider. Vaccinating providers should also ensure that patients and their referring health-care providers have documentation of the vaccination.

### Long-term durability of immune responses after hepatitis A vaccination among HIV-infected adults [^1159dTBt]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Vaccination provides long-term immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) among the general population, but there are no such data regarding vaccine durability among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively studied HIV-infected adults who had received two doses of the HAV vaccine. We analyzed blood specimens taken at 1 year, 3 years, and, when available, 6–10 years post-vaccination. HAV immunoglobulin G (IgG) values of ≥ 10 mIU/mL were considered seropositive.

- **Results**: We evaluated specimens from 130 HIV-infected adults with a median age of 35 years and a median CD4 cell count of 461 cells/mm³ at or before the time of vaccination. Of these, 49% had an HIV RNA load < 1000 copies/mL. Initial vaccine responses were achieved in 89% of HIV-infected adults (95% confidence interval, 83%-94%) compared with 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%) of historical HIV-uninfected adults. Among initial HIV-infected responders with available specimens, 90% (104 of 116; 95% CI, 83%-95%) remained seropositive at 3 years and 85% (63 of 74; 95% CI, 75%-92%) at 6–10 years. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) among HIV-infected adults were 154, 111, and 64 mIU/mL at 1, 3, and 6–10 years, respectively, compared with 1734, 687, and 684 mIU/mL among HIV-uninfected persons. Higher GMCs over time among HIV-infected adults were associated with lower log₁₀ HIV RNA levels (β = -.12, P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Most adults with well-controlled HIV infections had durable seropositive responses up to 6–10 years after HAV vaccination. Suppressed HIV RNA levels are associated with durable immune responses.

Persons aged ≥ 65 years with moderate or severe immunocompromise who have completed an initial vaccine series and have received at least one updated COVID-19 vaccine dose should receive an additional updated COVID-19 vaccine dose at least two months after the last updated dose. Further additional doses may be given, guided by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider, as well as the individual's personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered at least two months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. Additional clinical considerations, including detailed schedules and tables by age for all age groups and vaccination history for those who are or are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, are available.

### Risk factors for pneumococcal carriage in adults living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in the infant pneumococcal vaccine era in Malawi [^111GRkLu]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

Pneumococcus is a common colonizer of the human nasopharynx, particularly in young children and populations with HIV. Pneumococcal colonization is a prerequisite for transmission and the development of diseases such as otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteraemia. The pneumococcus is associated with a significant burden of disease in adults living with HIV (ALWHIV) compared to adults without HIV. Adult HIV prevalence remains high (> 10%) in many sub-Saharan African countries, with Malawi reporting a national prevalence of 10.6%. The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially increased survival and reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, despite more than 85% of ALWHIV in Malawi receiving ART, they remain at greater risk of IPD than adults without HIV.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are widely used in infant schedules in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), generally targeting the most commonly invasive serotypes in this age group. As of the time of writing, in contrast to high-income settings, immunization of vulnerable adults with pneumococcal vaccines has neither been adopted in most LMICs such as Malawi, nor are pneumococcal vaccines available outside the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). In November 2011, Malawi introduced the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) into the national EPI using a three-primary-dose schedule without a booster (3+0; one dose at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age). Despite nearly 10 years of more than 80% PCV13 three-dose coverage among age-eligible children, there is evidence of a suboptimal impact on adult populations.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis A virus infection, and more specifically in relation to immunization, the CDC 2020 guidelines recommend offering HAV vaccination to the following groups:

- **Unimmunized children and adolescents**: Aged 2–18 years.

- **Patients with HIV infection**: Aged ≥ 1 year.

- **Patients with chronic liver disease**: This includes, but is not limited to, individuals with HBV infection, HCV infection, cirrhosis, MASLD, alcoholic liver disease, AIH, or those with an ALT or AST level persistently 2× the ULN.

- **During hepatitis A outbreaks**: For patients aged ≥ 1 year at risk for HAV infection (such as injection or non-injection drug users, persons experiencing homelessness, or MSM) or at risk for severe disease from HAV (patients with chronic liver disease or HIV).

- **Settings providing services to adults**: Where a high proportion of individuals have risk factors for HAV infection, such as healthcare settings focusing on injection or non-injection drug users, group homes, and non-residential daycare facilities for developmentally disabled persons.

### Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^112qjtoC]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019).

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts, meets three times per year to develop recommendations for vaccine use in the United States. The group usually has 15 voting members, each appointed to a four-year term. ACIP members and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff discuss the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as vaccine research, effectiveness, safety data, and clinical trial results. Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society are present as liaisons to the ACIP.

The ACIP met on February 27 to 28, 2019, to discuss several topics, including:

- **Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination**: Vaccination of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons.
- **Pneumococcal vaccination**: Vaccination among adults aged 65 years or older.
- **Influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety**.
- **Anthrax vaccination**: Vaccination in the setting of a mass exposure.
- **Human papillomavirus vaccine**.
- **Zoster vaccines**.
- **Japanese encephalitis vaccine**.

Notes

- **Alphabetical order**: The notes are presented in alphabetical order. Edits have been made throughout the Notes section to harmonize language between the child/adolescent and adult immunization schedules to the greatest extent possible.

- **Additional information**: A section has been added to include language for COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

- **HepA**: Under "Travel in countries with high or intermediate endemic hepatitis A", text has been added for the accelerated Twinrix schedule: "HepA-HepB combination vaccine or Twinrix may be administered on an accelerated schedule of 3 doses at 0, 7, and 21–30 days, followed by a booster dose at 12 months".

- **HepB**: Under "Special situations", text has been added to indicate that hepatitis B vaccination for persons aged ≥ 60 years with diabetes is recommended, using shared clinical decision-making.

- **HPV**: Minor wording changes were made to now read "HPV vaccination recommended for all persons through age 26 years". Under routine vaccination, the text was reformatted to match the Child/Adolescent schedule and now reads "Age 15 years or older at initial vaccination: 3-dose series at 0, 1–2 months, 6 months (minimum intervals: dose 1 to dose 2: 4 weeks / dose 2 to dose 3: 12 weeks / dose 1 to dose 3: 5 months; repeat dose if administered too soon)". In addition, a bullet was added stating that no additional doses of HPV are recommended after completing a series at the recommended dosing intervals using any HPV vaccine. Under "Shared clinical decision-making", the text was modified to say "Some adults aged 27–45 years: based on shared clinical decision-making".

### Immunization programs for infants, children, adolescents, and adults: Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111FkTuZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the immunization of infants, children, adolescents, and adults have been prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). These updated guidelines replace the previous immunization guidelines published in 2002. They are intended for healthcare professionals caring for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals of all ages.

Since 2002, the ability to prevent more infectious diseases has increased markedly for several reasons. New vaccines have been licensed, including the human papillomavirus vaccine, live attenuated influenza vaccine, meningococcal conjugate vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, and zoster vaccine. New combination vaccines have also become available, such as the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine; the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine; and the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis and inactivated polio/Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccines are now universally recommended for young children. Additionally, influenza vaccines are recommended annually for all children aged 6 months through 18 years, and for adults aged ≥ 50 years. A second dose of the varicella vaccine has been added to the routine childhood and adolescent immunization schedule.

Many of these changes have resulted in the expansion of the adolescent and adult immunization schedules. Increased emphasis has also been placed on removing barriers to immunization, eliminating racial and ethnic disparities, and addressing vaccine safety.

### Safety and immunogenicity of double-dose versus standard-dose hepatitis B revaccination in non-responding adults with HIV-1 (ANRS HB04 B-BOOST): A multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113LBaio]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). High credibility.

Revaccination with a double-dose hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in HIV-infected patients who do not respond to standard vaccination, but it has not yet been assessed. We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a reinforced hepatitis B revaccination protocol with the standard revaccination schedule in HIV-infected patients not responding to primary vaccination.

- **Methods**: We conducted this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 53 centres in France. HIV-infected adults (aged ≥ 18 years), with CD4 counts of 200 cells per μL or more and no response to a previous hepatitis B vaccination or a 20 μg booster dose, were randomly assigned (1:1), according to a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks (block sizes of two to six), to receive either standard-dose (20 μg) or double-dose (40 μg) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at weeks 0, 4, and 24. Randomisation was stratified by baseline CD4 count (200–349 vs ≥ 350 cells per μL). Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the randomisation list was concealed from the investigators who assigned participants to the vaccination groups. The primary endpoint was the proportion of responders, defined as patients with hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titres of 10 mIU/mL or more, at week 28. We conducted analysis by modified intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Between May 19, 2008, and May 8, 2011, 178 participants were randomly assigned to the standard-dose group (n = 90) or the double-dose group.

### Poor immunogenicity of the H1N1 2009 vaccine in well controlled HIV-infected individuals [^1111DFJs]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the H1N1 2009 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals, a single-arm study was conducted at the clinic at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. The participants were HIV-infected adults with an indication for H1N1 vaccination.

The intervention involved a single intramuscular 15 microg dose of the monovalent, unadjuvanted, inactivated, split virus H1N1 vaccine. The main outcomes measured were immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability.

A total of 120 participants were enrolled, with 71% being men and 68% African-American. The median age was 46 years. All but one participant were on antiretroviral treatment, with a median CD4 cell count of 502 cells/microl and a nadir CD4 cell count of 132 cells/microl. In 92% of participants, the HIV RNA level was below 400 copies/ml. All participants completed the 3 weeks of follow-up.

- **Results**: Thirty of the 120 participants (25%) had antibody hemagglutination-inhibition assay titers equal to or greater than 1:40 at baseline. Among participants without evidence of previous exposure, only 61% developed protective titers by week 3 of the study. Nonresponders had lower nadir CD4 cell counts than responders. Only four of nine participants with detectable HIV viral load at baseline developed protective antibody titers. Age and race were not predictors of the response to the vaccine. The vaccine was well tolerated.

The results suggest that only 60% of well-controlled HIV-infected individuals without preexisting immunity to H1N1 develop protective antibody titers after immunization.

### Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2018 [^1169gUQB]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The footnotes in the 2018 adult immunization schedule should be used in conjunction with "Figure 1. Recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older, by age group" and "Figure 2. Recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older by medical condition and other indications". The footnotes contain additional general information, such as dosing intervals for vaccination series, and considerations for special populations, such as pregnant women and adults with HIV infection. The footnotes in the adult immunization schedule and the child and adolescent immunization schedule have been harmonized to be more consistent with one another.

Notable changes in Figures 1 and 2 include the following:

- **Replacement of vaccine terms**: In Figures 1 and 2, "ZVL" replaced the term "HZV" (herpes zoster vaccine) that was used in past adult immunization schedules to refer to the live zoster vaccine. A row for RZV was added above the row for ZVL, and a dashed line separates RZV and ZVL rows to denote that the two zoster vaccines are recommended for the same purpose. In the indication bars for RZV, the text stating that RZV is preferred over ZVL has been added when either RZV or ZVL can be used for adults aged 60 years or older.

- **Revision of tetanus and diphtheria vaccine terminology**: In Figures 1 and 2, "Td/Tdap" (tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids/tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) has been replaced by "Tdap or Td", and the text in the indication bar has been revised to "1 dose Tdap, then Td booster every 10 years". One dose of Tdap is recommended for adults who have not received it previously.

### Strategic approaches for global cervical cancer elimination: An update review and call for national action [^116X3TYJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

In light of the emerging evidence, WHO now recommends flexible HPV vaccination schedules: a one- or two-dose schedule for girls aged 9–14 years, a one- or two-dose schedule for girls and women aged 15–20 years, and a two-dose schedule, with a 6-month interval, for women aged over 21 years. The December 2022 WHO position paper highlighted that immunocompromised individuals, including those living with HIV, should receive a minimum of two doses and, where feasible, three doses. The primary target group for HPV vaccination remains girls aged 9–14 years, ideally before sexual debut, while secondary target groups, including boys and older girls, are encouraged to be vaccinated when practical and financially viable.

Several countries, including Australia, Scotland, and the UK, have adopted a single-dose vaccination strategy. In September 2023, the UK transitioned to a single-dose schedule for the National Health Service routine adolescent immunization, targeting schoolchildren aged 12–13 years. Eligible gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men under the age of 25 years will likewise receive a one-dose schedule through sexual health clinics, while those aged 25–45 years will continue with a two-dose schedule. Immunosuppressed individuals, including those living with HIV, will adhere to a three-dose schedule. In addition, eligible individuals may participate in a catch-up vaccination until their 25th birthday through their general practitioners. Currently, 37 countries have reported switching or intending to switch.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2018 [^113x1y3D]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

In October 2017, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to approve the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older, United States, 2018. The 2018 adult immunization schedule summarizes ACIP recommendations in two figures and a table of contraindications and precautions for vaccines recommended for adults and is intended to assist health care providers in implementing the ACIP recommendations for vaccinating adults.

The schedule can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules. The full ACIP recommendations for each vaccine are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html. The 2018 adult immunization schedule has also been approved by the American College of Physicians (https://www.acponline.org), the American Academy of Family Physicians (https://www.aafp.org), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (https://www.acog.org), and the American College of Nurse-Midwives (http://www.midwife.org).

The ACIP-recommended use of each vaccine is developed after an in-depth review of vaccine-related data, including data on disease epidemiology, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine safety, feasibility of program implementation, and economic aspects of immunization policy.

### Mosaic HIV-1 vaccine regimen in southern African women (Imbokodo/HVTN 705/HPX2008): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial [^111ptCZZ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIV type 1 (HIV-1) remains a global health concern, with the greatest burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite 40 years of research, no vaccine candidate has demonstrated durable and protective efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. Although pre-exposure prophylaxis in groups with high vulnerability can be very effective, there are barriers to its use, such as perceived low acquisition risk, fear of stigma, and concerns about side effects. Thus, a population-based approach, such as an HIV-1 vaccine, is needed. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a heterologous HIV-1 vaccine regimen, consisting of a tetravalent mosaic adenovirus 26-based vaccine (Ad26. Mos4.HIV) and aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted clade C glycoprotein (gp) 140, in young women at risk of acquiring HIV-1 in southern Africa.

- **Methods**: This randomised, double-blind, phase 2b study enrolled sexually active women without HIV-1 or HIV-2, aged 18–35 years, at 23 clinical research sites in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Participants were centrally randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intramuscular injections of the vaccine or saline placebo in stratified permuted blocks via an interactive web response system. Study participants, site personnel (except those with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing), and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. The vaccine regimen consisted of Ad26. Mos4.HIV administered at months 0 and 3, followed by Ad26. Mos4.HIV administered concurrently with aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted clade C gp140 at subsequent intervals.

- **Meningococcal vaccination**: At the end of the section, a note was added stating, "MenB vaccines may be administered simultaneously with MenACWY vaccines if indicated, but at a different anatomic site, when feasible".

- **MMR**: In the "Special situations" section, CD4 percentages in addition to CD4 counts in the HIV infection bullet were added to harmonize language with the child/adolescent schedule.

- **Pneumococcal vaccination**: The section has been updated to reflect ACIP's new recommendations for PCV15 and PCV20 vaccines. The "Routine vaccination" section now states that persons aged ≥ 65 years "who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV15 or 1 dose of PCV20. If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23". Similarly, the "Special situations" section has changed, stating that anyone "aged 19 through 64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who has not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV15 or 1 dose of PCV20. If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23". Guidance for dosing intervals between PCV15 and PPSV23 and for patients who have previously received PCV13 or PPSV23 in the past is also included. A note added at the end lists all the underlying medical conditions or risk factors that would render those aged 19–64 years eligible to receive pneumococcal vaccination.

### Primary care guidelines for the management of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus: 2009 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113HtsmV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were prepared by an expert panel of the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace those published in 2004. The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for HIV-infected patients or patients who may be at risk for acquiring HIV infection.

Since 2004, new antiretroviral drugs and classes have become available, and the prognosis of persons with HIV infection continues to improve. However, with fewer complications and increased survival, HIV-infected persons are increasingly developing common health problems that also affect the general population. Some of these conditions may be related to HIV infection itself and its treatment. HIV-infected persons should be managed and monitored for all relevant age- and gender-specific health problems. New information based on publications from the period 2003–2008 has been incorporated into this document.

### Risk factors for human papillomavirus infection and disease: A targeted literature summary [^113LeuDY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Adolescents are the primary cohort for routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, but unvaccinated adults may also benefit. A lack of consensus on which adults to target and the presence of reimbursement barriers likely contribute to the lag in adult vaccinations, highlighting missed prevention opportunities. Understanding factors contributing to the risk of HPV infection and disease could help in decision-making on vaccination.

This review summarizes existing literature on risk factors for HPV infection and disease and includes 153 studies reporting relative risks or odds ratios for factors associated with HPV infection or disease in adults, published between 2009 and 2020. Despite inconsistent design and reporting of risk factors across studies, this review confirmed several risk factors associated with adult infection, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity, number of sex partners, and smoking. These findings can support policymaking, guideline development, and clinical decision-making for HPV vaccination and screening of high-risk adult groups.

### Imaavy [^113vHbbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiating Imaavy. Because Imaavy causes a transient reduction in IgG levels, vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with Imaavy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage**: Dilute Imaavy prior to administration. Administer via intravenous infusion only [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The recommended initial dosage of Imaavy is 30 mg/kg, administered once via intravenous infusion over at least 30 minutes. Two weeks after the initial dosage, administer a maintenance dosage of 15 mg/kg via intravenous infusion over at least 15 minutes. Continue the maintenance dosage every two weeks thereafter. If a scheduled infusion appointment is missed, the maintenance dosage of Imaavy should be administered as soon as possible. Resume dosing every two weeks thereafter.

- **Preparation and administration instructions**: Prior to administration, dilute Imaavy single-dose vials with only 0.9% sodium chloride injection using the instructions below. For patients who weigh 40 kg or more, the total volume to be administered is 250 mL; for patients who are 12 years or older and weigh less than 40 kg, the total volume to be administered is 100 mL (see Preparation).

### Determinants of vaccine immunity in the cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected children living in Switzerland [^112j21Uw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children are at increased risk of infections caused by vaccine-preventable pathogens, and specific immunization recommendations have been issued.

- **Methods**: A prospective national multicenter study assessed how these recommendations are followed in Switzerland and how immunization history correlates with vaccine immunity.

- **Results**: Among 87 HIV-infected children (mean age: 11.1 years) followed in the 5 Swiss university hospitals and 1 regional hospital, most (76%) had CD4 T cells > 25%, were receiving highly active antiretroviral treatment (79%), and had undetectable viral load (60%). Immunization coverage was lower than in the general population, and many lacked serum antibodies to vaccine-preventable pathogens, including measles (54%), varicella (39%), and hepatitis B (65%). The presence of vaccine antibodies correlated most significantly with having an up-to-date immunization history (P < 0.05). An up-to-date immunization history was not related to age, immunologic stage, or viremia but to the referral medical center.

- **Conclusions**: All pediatricians in charge of HIV-infected children are urged to identify missing immunizations in this high-risk population.

Vaccine-specific changes involve new or revised ACIP recommendations for the influenza vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), and COVID-19 vaccine. These updates have been added to the tables and notes sections. Additionally, there is clarification of recommendations for the dengue vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine (HepA), hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y vaccine (MenACWY), meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (MenB), inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), and varicella vaccine.

- **Cover page**: COVID-19 vaccines, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15), and a newly licensed MMR (Priorix) have been included in the table of vaccine abbreviations and trade names.

- **Table 1 (Routine immunization schedule)**:
	- **COVID-19 row**: A new row has been added with the columns for ages 6 months–18 years highlighted in yellow to indicate the recommended age for COVID-19 vaccination. The text "2- or 3-dose primary series and booster (See Notes)" has been included.
	- **Pneumococcal conjugate row**: PCV15 has been added.
	- **IPV row**: The text "See Notes" has been added to the column for individuals aged 17–18 years, indicating health care providers should review the notes section for additional information for these persons.

- **Table 2 (Catch-up immunization schedule)**:
	- **Pneumococcal conjugate row**: Language for the minimum interval has been updated.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2022 [^113AqjeG]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

For the HIV infection columns, CD4 percentages are displayed along with CD4 counts to harmonize presentation of this information with that in the child/adolescent schedule. The description of the color red in the legend has been reworded to "Contraindicated or not recommended".

- **LAIV4 row**: The text overlay in the red box was changed to "Contraindicated" to increase clarity in the language and to align more closely with ACIP recommendations.
- **MMR row**: The text overlay for the red boxes was changed to "Contraindicated" to increase clarity in the language and to align more closely with ACIP recommendations.
- **VAR row**: The text overlay for the red boxes was changed to "Contraindicated" to increase clarity in the language and to align more closely with ACIP recommendations.
- **RZV row**: Under the immunocompromised and HIV infection columns, the row is yellow indicating that RZV is recommended for these subgroups. In addition, the text overlay under these columns now states, "2 doses at age ≥ 19 years".
- **HepB row**: The row is now entirely yellow, indicating that hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all risk-based groups. The text overlay states, "3 doses (see notes)" in the pregnancy column, and "2, 3, or 4 doses depending on vaccine or condition" in the remaining columns.

The notes for each vaccine are presented in alphabetical order. Edits have been made throughout the Notes section to harmonize language between the child/adolescent and the adult immunization schedule.

### Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger - United States, 2017 [^116B5Dtg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

A new figure, "Figure 3. Vaccines that might be indicated for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger based on medical indications", has been added. The purpose of this figure is to:

- **Demonstrate** most children with medical conditions can (and should) be vaccinated according to the routine child/adolescent immunization schedule.
- **Indicate** when a medical condition is a precaution or contraindication to vaccination.
- **Indicate** when additional doses of vaccines may be necessary because of a child's or adolescent's medical condition. Providers should consult the relevant footnotes for additional information.

Changes to the footnotes for the figures are as follows:

- **The Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) footnote** was revised to reflect that the birth dose of HepB should be administered within 24 hours of birth.

- **The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) footnote** was revised to more clearly present recommendations following an inadvertently early administered fourth dose of DTaP.

- **Within the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) footnote**, Comvax was removed from the routine vaccination portion of the footnote. This vaccine has been removed from the market, and all available doses have expired. Additionally, Hiberix has been added to the list of vaccines that may be used for the primary vaccination series.

- **Within the pneumococcal vaccine footnote**, references to 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) have been removed.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults aged 27 years or older: AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol A5298 [^111XpXg9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for anal and oropharyngeal cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The efficacy of HPV vaccines in this population is unknown.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned HIV-infected adults aged ≥ 27 years to the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine or placebo (1:1), stratified by sex and presence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy (bHSIL). The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against incident persistent anal infection with quadrivalent vaccine types, or single detection at the final visit that were not present at baseline. Secondary endpoints included vaccine efficacy for anal bHSIL after week 52 and persistent oral HPV infection.

- **Results**: A total of 575 participants were randomized. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study early due to futility. Vaccine efficacy was 22% (95.1% confidence interval, -31%, 53%) for prevention of persistent anal infection or single detection at the final visit; 0% (95% CI -44%, 31%) for improving bHSIL outcomes; and 88% (95.1% CI 2%, 98%) for preventing persistent oral HPV infection, but 32% (95.1% CI -80%, 74%) for 6-month persistent oral HPV infection or single detection at the final visit.

- **Conclusions**: These results do not support HPV vaccination of HIV-infected adults aged ≥ 27 years to prevent new anal HPV infections or to improve anal HSIL outcomes. However, our data suggest a role for prevention of oral HPV infections, but this finding should be c​larified further in future studies.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: Updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, 2022 [^113tL6Wx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the preventative measures for hepatitis B virus infection, specifically with respect to immunizations, the CDC 2022 guidelines recommend offering vaccination against HBV to adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with certain risk factors for hepatitis B.

- **Persons at risk for infection by sexual exposure**: Sex partners of persons testing positive for HBsAg, sexually active persons not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (such as persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months), persons seeking evaluation or treatment for an STI, and MSM.

- **Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood**: Persons with recent injection drug use, household contacts of persons testing positive for HBsAg, residents and staff members of facilities for persons with developmental disabilities, healthcare and public safety personnel with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids, patients on maintenance dialysis (including in-center or home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis), and predialysis patients. Patients with diabetes are included at the discretion of the treating clinician.

- **Other**: International travelers to countries with high or intermediate levels of endemic HBV infection (HBsAg prevalence of ≥ 2%), patients with HCV infection, and patients with chronic liver disease (including, but not limited to, patients with cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, AIH, and an ALT or AST level greater than two times the upper limit of normal).

### Immunogenicity of the bivalent oral cholera vaccine Shanchol in Haitian adults with HIV infection [^112KoHho]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We evaluated immune responses following bivalent oral cholera vaccination (Shanchol [Shantha Biotechnics]; BivWC) in a cohort of 25 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults in Haiti. Compared with adults without HIV infection, vaccination in HIV-infected individuals resulted in lower vibriocidal responses against Vibrio cholerae O1, and there was a positive relationship between the CD4(+) T-cell count and vibriocidal responses following vaccination. Nevertheless, seroconversion occurred at a rate of 65% against the Ogawa serotype and 74% against the Inaba serotype in adults with HIV infection. These results suggest that the vaccine retains substantial immunogenicity in adults with HIV infection and may benefit this population by protecting against cholera.

### Adult vaccination [^1175vyQD]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Adult vaccination rates are low in the United States, despite clear benefits for reducing morbidity and mortality. Vaccine science is evolving rapidly, and family physicians must maintain familiarity with the most recent guidelines. The recommended adult immunization schedule is updated annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All eligible patients should receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the guidelines. Adults without contraindications should also receive an annual influenza vaccine.

Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for adults with specific risk factors. All pregnant patients, adults younger than 60 years, and those 60 years and older who have risk factors should receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later.

Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity, and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine is recommended.

### Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^114AnAtk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). High credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) comprises medical and public health experts who develop recommendations for vaccine use in the United States. The ACIP meets three times per year, where members and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) staff present findings and discuss vaccine research, vaccine effectiveness (VE) and safety, clinical trial results, and labeling/package insert information. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine shortages are also discussed. Nonvoting representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society are present.

The ACIP met on June 22–23, 2016, to discuss proposed recommendations for influenza vaccination, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine dosing schedules, the cholera vaccine (CVD 103-HgR), and the use of MenACWY in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. Additionally, they provided an overview of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, safety of maternal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization, and laboratory containment of poliovirus type 2.

### Estimating pneumococcal carriage dynamics in adults living with HIV in a mature infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine programme in Malawi, a modelling study [^114e8zyz]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pneumococcal carriage acquisition probability and duration are influenced by various factors including serotype group and HIV status among potential risk groups. The analysis includes:

- **Overall pneumococcal carriage acquisition probability**: Daily acquisition probability was measured for:
	- All participants
	- Stratified by vaccine-serotype group and HIV status
	- **Specific groups including**:
		- Females or males
		- Adults aged 18–33 or 34–44 years
		- Adults living with one child or at least two children in a household
		- Adults of low or high socioeconomic status (SES)

- **Pneumococcal carriage duration**: Measured in days for:
	- Overall carriage
	- **Stratified by vaccine-serotype group and HIV status among**:
		- All participants
		- Females or males
		- Adults aged 18–33 or 34–44 years

The effect of various risk factors on pneumococcal acquisition and clearance rates was estimated using a Markov model. This model utilized data from a longitudinal nasopharyngeal swabbing study conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, between September 2021 and December 2023. Social economic status (SES) is calculated from a possession index, defined as the sum of positive responses for household ownership of 15 different functioning items, including a watch, radio, bank account, iron (charcoal), electric sewing machine, mobile phone, and CD player.

### Recommended schedules for routine immunization of children and adults [^114KEjV3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Vaccine recommendations continue to evolve due to new vaccines, safety considerations, changing disease incidence (e.g. polio), and public health priorities. The pace of discovery is accelerating, and advisory committees will need to respond accordingly. Each vaccine, whether new or old, will need to earn its place in the routine immunization schedule based on public health benefit or cost-benefit studies.

### Measles seroprevalence and vaccine responses in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adolescents and adults: A systematic review [^113chpFj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an additional dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy following immune reconstitution. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize available evidence regarding measles seroprevalence and measles vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety in HIV-infected adolescents and adults to provide the evidence base for recommendations on the need for measles vaccination.

- **Methods**: We conducted searches of 8 databases through 26 September 2017. Identified studies were screened independently by 2 reviewers.

- **Results**: The search identified 30 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Across studies, measles seroprevalence among HIV-infected adolescents and adults was high (median, 92%; 27 studies), with no significant difference compared to HIV-uninfected participants (10 studies). In 6 studies that evaluated the immunogenicity of MCVs among seronegative HIV-infected adults, measles seropositivity at the end of follow-up ranged from 0% to 56% (median, 39%). No severe adverse events were reported following measles vaccination in HIV-infected patients.

- **Conclusions**: Based on similar measles seroprevalence between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adolescents and adults, and the low response to vaccination, these studies do not support the need for an additional dose of MCV in HIV-infected adolescents and adults. These findings support WHO guidelines that measles vaccine be administered to potentially susceptible, asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals.

### Long-term immunogenicity of two doses of 2009 A/H1N1v vaccine with and without AS03(A) adjuvant in HIV-1-infected adults [^1155cCmL]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

In immunocompromised patients, vaccine regimens more immunogenic than the standard influenza vaccine are necessary to enhance and prolong efficacy. We previously reported that the AS03A-adjuvanted 2009 A/H1N1v vaccine yielded a higher short-term immune response than the nonadjuvanted one in HIV-1-infected adults. This study reports the long-term persistence of the immune response.

- **Design and methods**: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized, patient-blinded trial, two doses of AS03A-adjuvanted H1N1v vaccine containing 3.75 μg haemagglutinin (n = 155; group A) or nonadjuvanted H1N1v vaccine containing 15 μg haemagglutinin (n = 151; group B) were administered 21 days apart. Haemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibodies were assessed at 6 and 12 months after vaccination.

- **Results**: In groups A and B, the seroprotection rates were 83.7% and 59.4% at month 6, and 70.4% and 49.3% at month 12, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the persistence of seroprotection 12 months after vaccination was negatively associated with smoking (odds ratio = 0.6, P = 0.03) and positively related with the AS03A-adjuvanted H1N1v vaccine (odds ratio = 2.7, P = 0.0002).

- **Conclusion**: In HIV-1-infected adults, two doses of the adjuvanted influenza vaccine induce a long-term persistence of the immune response up to 1 year after vaccination.

### Covid-19 vaccine immunogenicity in people with HIV [^115mpLmc]. AIDS (2023). High credibility.

Vulnerability to acquisition and symptomatic/severe Covid-19 outcomes in people with HIV (PWH) is compounded by aging, multi-morbidity, and sociodemographic factors. Although sub-optimal immunogenicity to common vaccines is well documented in PWH, initial studies on Covid-19 vaccines in PWH excluded those with advanced age or lower CD4+ T-cell counts. Subsequent studies yielded divergent findings regarding Covid-19 immune response in HIV immune responders vs. non-responders. Few studies compared responses with the Covid-19 vaccine between PWH and HIV-negative participants over longer time periods, and little information is available on response to the third or booster vaccination in PWH.

To address this knowledge gap, we established a pan-Canadian prospective cohort of PWH receiving Covid-19 vaccines. The objectives were to assess humoral immunogenicity in diverse PWH; to compare immunogenicity responses in PWH vs. HIV-negative controls; and to describe the safety and tolerability of Covid-19 vaccines in PWH. An exploratory objective was to determine if subpopulations of PWH respond differently to Covid-19 vaccination. Our study is among the few at the time of writing reporting on immune responses following the third Covid-19 vaccination dose in PWH.

### Long-term immune responses to vaccination in HIV-infected patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162rXPq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Vaccine-induced antibodies may wane more quickly in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in healthy individuals. We reviewed the literature on vaccines routinely recommended in HIV-infected patients to estimate how seroprotection decreases over time in those who initially responded to immunization. For each study retrieved from the literature, the decrease of seroprotection was modeled with a log binomial generalized linear model, and data were pooled in a meta-analysis to provide estimates of seroprotection 2 and 5 years after the last vaccine administration. Our analyses confirmed that the duration of seroprotection was shorter in HIV-infected patients and that, with guidelines, a substantial proportion of patients would have lost protective antibodies before a booster was proposed. We therefore discuss the implications for the monitoring of antibody levels and timing of revaccination in these patients.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^113Z7ERx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunization schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programs that include males.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

- **Search methods**: We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were…

### Safety and efficacy of the peptide-based therapeutic vaccine for HIV-1, Vacc-4x: a phase 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1134nCer]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Present combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) alone does not cure HIV infection and requires lifelong drug treatment. The potential role of HIV therapeutic vaccines as part of an HIV cure is under consideration. Our aim was to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Vacc-4x, a peptide-based HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine targeting conserved domains on p24(Gag), in adults infected with HIV-1.

- **Methods**: Between July 2008 and June 2010, we conducted a multinational double-blind, randomised, phase 2 study comparing Vacc-4x with placebo. Participants were adults infected with HIV-1, aged 18–55 years, and virologically suppressed on cART (viral load < 50 copies per mL) with CD4 cell counts of 400 × 10⁶ cells per L or greater. The trial was conducted at 18 sites in Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the United States. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to either Vacc-4x or placebo. Group allocation was masked from participants and investigators. Four primary immunisations, weekly for 4 weeks, containing Vacc-4x (or placebo) were given intradermally after administration of adjuvant. Booster immunisations were given at weeks 16 and 18. At week 28, cART was interrupted for up to 24 weeks.

- **Endpoints and analyses**: The coprimary endpoints were cART resumption and changes in CD4 counts during treatment interruption. Analyses were by modified intention to treat and included all participants who received one intervention. Furthermore, safety, viral load, and immunogenicity (as measured by ELISPOT and proliferation assays) were assessed. The 52-week follow-up period was completed in June 2011.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody prevalence in adults with HIV [^111z7gVP]. AIDS (2025). High credibility.

The objectives of this study were to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence within a cohort of adults living with HIV and to correlate demographics with response rates to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The initial vaccine trials for SARS-CoV-2 did not examine efficacy in people with HIV. To address this gap, we undertook the SCAPE-HIV study from April 2021 to November 2022, focusing on vaccine response in this population to guide future vaccine scheduling.

Participants completed a retrospective questionnaire. Nucleocapsid and spike antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N and anti-S) were tested. Demographic and HIV factors, such as CD4 count and viral load, were correlated with quantitative serological outcomes. Anti-S titres less than 400U/mL were considered low level. Follow-up was conducted in a subset post-third vaccination.

A total of 612 participants completed the study questionnaire, with 520 included in the final analysis. Most participants received either the ChAdOx1-S recombinant vaccine or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for the first two doses. Almost all participants (99.2%) in the main group had an anti-S antibody detected above the assay cutoff (> 0.8U/mL). Most participants (77.3%) had anti-S titres greater than 400U/mL, with the median titre being 1734U/mL. Age over 60 years was significantly associated with lower (< 400U/mL) anti-S antibody titres (p < 0.0001).

We conclude that there is a high rate of anti-S seropositivity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with HIV. Age over 60 was the only parameter found to be associated with a lower anti-S antibody titre. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine scheduling may need to be adjusted for this population.

### SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralization after four COVID-19 vaccine doses in people with HIV receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^1126Sone]. AIDS (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, fourth COVID-19 vaccine doses provide immune benefits to people with HIV regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection history, supporting public health recommendations that all adults receive this additional immunization within six months of their third dose (or their most recent SARS-CoV-2 infection). As neutralization after the fourth dose will likely decline rapidly, durability studies are required to inform the timing of additional booster doses.

### Safety and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit candidate vaccine in HIV-infected adults: a phase 1/2a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^111o4GTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

This study showed that HZ/su elicits strong gE-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in HIV-infected individuals after 2 and 3 doses, and that the responses after dose 3 persist over prevaccination levels at least 1 year after the last vaccination. HZ/su also elicited VZV-specific cell-mediated immune responses, but to a lesser extent. Furthermore, although the reactogenicity of HZ/su was substantial, no safety concerns arose in this population.

The primary immunogenicity objective of the study was met. The superiority of HZ/su over saline was demonstrated at month 7 for both humoral and cellular immune responses. These immune responses were comparable to those seen in healthy adults aged 50 years or older. In addition, 1 year after vaccination, the gE-specific CD4(2+) T-cell responses were higher than those seen 1 month after natural HZ. HZ/su is being evaluated as a 2-dose schedule in immunocompetent older adults, but it was not known whether 2 or 3 doses would be required to trigger a strong immune response in HIV-infected individuals. The administration of a third dose did not show substantial additional benefit over 2 doses in terms of gE-specific humoral and CMI immune responses. These results suggest that, in terms of immunogenicity, a 2-dose schedule (at 0 and 2 months) is appropriate for HIV-infected adults, most of whom were receiving ART and have higher CD4+ T-cell counts, as it is for healthy older adults. Moreover, these results were similar to those obtained in another immunocompromised population, adult autologous HSCT recipients.

### Impact of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines on HIV persistence and immune dynamics during suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^1161KHK7]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if standard influenza and pneumococcal vaccines can be used to stimulate HIV reservoirs during antiretroviral therapy (ART).

- **Design**: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of two clinically recommended vaccines (influenza and pneumococcal).

- **Methods**: Persons with HIV on ART (N = 54) were enrolled in the clinical trial. Blood was collected at baseline and on days 2, 4, 7, 14, and 30 post-immunizations. Levels of cellular HIV RNA and HIV DNA were measured by ddPCR. Expression of immunological markers on T cell subsets was measured by flow cytometry. Changes in unspliced cellular HIV RNA from baseline to day 7 post-injection between each vaccine and placebo were the primary outcome.

- **Results**: Forty-seven participants completed at least one cycle, and there were no serious adverse events related to the intervention. We observed no significant differences in the change in cellular HIV RNA after either vaccine compared with placebo at any time point. In secondary analyses, we noted a transient increase in total HIV DNA levels after the influenza vaccine, as well as increased T cell activation and exhaustion on CD4+ T cells after the pneumococcal vaccine.

- **Conclusion**: Clinically recommended vaccines were well tolerated but did not appear to stimulate the immune system strongly enough to elicit significantly noticeable HIV RNA transcription during ART. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02707692.

### Extended follow-up confirms early vaccine-enhanced risk of HIV acquisition and demonstrates waning effect over time among participants in a randomized trial of recombinant adenovirus HIV vaccine (Step Study) [^111kBCRF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The Step Study tested whether an adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-vectored human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine could prevent HIV acquisition and/or reduce viral load set-point after infection. At the first interim analysis, nonefficacy criteria were met. Vaccinations were halted; participants were unblinded. In post hoc analyses, more HIV infections occurred in vaccinees versus placebo recipients in men who had Ad5-neutralizing antibodies and/or were uncircumcised. Follow-up was extended to assess the relative risk of HIV acquisition in vaccinees versus placebo recipients over time.

- **Methods**: We used Cox proportional hazard models for analyses of vaccine effect on HIV acquisition and vaccine effect modifiers, and nonparametric and semiparametric methods for analysis of constancy of relative risk over time.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-two of 1836 men were infected. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for vaccinees versus placebo recipients for all follow-up time was 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.92; p = 0.03). The vaccine effect differed by baseline Ad5 or circumcision status during the first 18 months, but neither was significant for all follow-up time. The HR among uncircumcised and/or Ad5-seropositive men waned with time since vaccination. No significant vaccine-associated risk was seen among circumcised, Ad5-negative men (HR, 0.97; P = 1.0) over all follow-up time.

- **Conclusions**: The vaccine-associated risk seen in interim analysis was confirmed but waned with time from vaccination.
