## Question

What are the characteristic histopathological features of Loefflers endocarditis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the characteristic histopathological features of Loeffler's endocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and pathophysiologic staging. Then, I should verify the histopathology of each stage, including the acute necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic phases. Next, I will examine organ-specific cardiac distribution patterns and valve involvement. After that, I should consider ancillary immunohistochemical markers that help distinguish eosinophilic activation states. Finally, I will integrate the histopathology with clinical and imaging correlates and summarize the key diagnostic hallmarks, making sure I double-check any areas where the literature is inconsistent or evolving [^116yZyug] [^1135rjHZ].

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and staging, because the histopathology is tightly linked to temporal evolution. Loeffler's endocarditis is the cardiac manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome, characterized by eosinophil-mediated endomyocardial injury that progresses through three phases: an acute necrotic stage with eosinophilic infiltration and myocardial necrosis, a thrombotic stage with mural thrombi forming on damaged endocardium, and a late fibrotic stage with endomyocardial scarring and restrictive physiology; I should confirm that this triphasic model is consistently described across sources, and yes, multiple reviews and case series align with this framework, including AHA statements and contemporary imaging reviews [^116yZyug] [^1135rjHZ] [^114gix2x].

> Now, I will examine the acute necrotic stage histopathology. Wait, let me verify the key elements: dense eosinophilic infiltration of the endocardium and myocardium, eosinophil degranulation with release of toxic cationic proteins such as major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein, focal myocyte necrosis, and occasionally eosinophilic microabscesses; these features reflect proteotoxic injury to endothelium and myocytes and are typically seen early in the disease course, often before overt clinical cardiac symptoms, which matches descriptions in pathology-focused reviews and case-based discussions [^116yZyug] [^114gix2x] [^116rSrPs].

> Next, I should review the thrombotic stage. Hold on, I should verify the timing and distribution. Around 10 months after sustained eosinophilia, mural thrombi form preferentially on injured endocardial surfaces, especially in the ventricular apices, and can involve one or both ventricles; thrombi are layered and can entrap chordae or extend to atrioventricular valves, with endocardial injury serving as the nidus for thrombogenesis; this pattern is repeatedly documented in case reports and reviews, including fatal and nonfatal presentations with apical thrombi and embolic complications [^116rSrPs] [^113HjFYf] [^1176kFpz].

> I will now examine the fibrotic stage. Let me think about the end-stage remodeling. Extensive endomyocardial fibrosis replaces thrombus and injured tissue, often producing apical obliteration and diffuse endocardial thickening that can extend from the left ventricular outflow tract to the apex; fibrotic tissue entraps chordae tendineae, leading to mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation, and the resulting restrictive cardiomyopathy is a hallmark of late disease; this fibrotic transformation is well characterized in imaging-pathology correlations and contemporary reviews of endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler's endocarditis [^1114rmfX] [^113bB9Kt] [^1158fbqy].

> But wait, what about organ distribution and valve involvement patterns. I should confirm that the left ventricle is most commonly and severely involved, with frequent mitral valve involvement, while isolated right ventricular disease is less common; endocardial fibrosis can also involve the aortic valve and, rarely, the pulmonary valve, and fibrotic tethering of papillary muscles and chordae contributes to regurgitation; these patterns are supported by case series and imaging-pathology reports, including descriptions of biventricular apical involvement and valve-related complications [^113bB9Kt] [^112vhaaa] [^1137Mez6].

> Next, I should review ancillary immunohistochemical markers that help characterize eosinophil activation, because this can aid in small biopsies. Let me verify the utility of CD69 and related markers. Eosinophils in endocarditis parietalis fibroplastica, which overlaps with Loeffler's pathology, show distinct activation profiles, with eosinophils typically negative for CD69 in endocarditis parietalis fibroplastica but positive in hypersensitivity myocarditis; this distinction can support the diagnosis when classic architectural features are incomplete on limited tissue [^112FBjmQ].

> Hold on, I should integrate histopathology with clinical and imaging correlates to ensure diagnostic coherence. Clinically, patients often have sustained eosinophilia and systemic manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome, with cardiac symptoms ranging from none in the acute necrotic stage to heart failure, embolic stroke, and arrhythmias in the thrombotic and fibrotic stages; echocardiography and cardiac MRI reveal endocardial thickening, apical thrombi, and a characteristic triple-layered late gadolinium enhancement pattern in advanced disease, which aligns with the histopathologic sequence of thrombus, fibrous tissue, and normal myocardium; endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard when imaging is inconclusive or to distinguish mimics [^1135rjHZ] [^1114rmfX] [^116FGV6q].

> Let me reconsider the key diagnostic hallmarks to ensure I have not missed anything critical. The characteristic histopathological features of Loeffler's endocarditis are best understood as a temporal triad: an acute necrotic phase with eosinophil-rich infiltration and myocyte necrosis, a thrombotic phase with layered mural thrombi on damaged endocardium, and a fibrotic phase with dense endomyocardial scarring, apical obliteration, and valvular involvement causing restrictive cardiomyopathy; recognizing the stage-specific pathology, along with ancillary immunophenotyping and correlation with eosinophilia and imaging, anchors the diagnosis and guides timely therapy to mitigate irreversible fibrosis and thromboembolic complications [^116yZyug] [^1135rjHZ] [^114gix2x].

---

Loeffler's endocarditis shows a **triphasic progression** on histopathology: acute necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic stages [^116yZyug]. Key features include **eosinophil-rich infiltration** of the endocardium and myocardium with myocyte necrosis, followed by mural thrombi and, ultimately, dense endomyocardial fibrosis causing restrictive cardiomyopathy [^116rSrPs]. Valves, especially the mitral, may be involved with fibrotic thickening and regurgitation [^1137Mez6]. These findings correlate with clinical stages and guide therapy and prognosis [^1135rjHZ].

---

## Histopathological stages

Loeffler's endocarditis progresses through **three distinct histopathological stages**, each with characteristic features [^116yZyug]:

| **Stage** | **Duration** | **Histopathological features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute necrotic stage | 1–2 months | - Eosinophil-rich infiltration of endocardium and myocardium <br/> - Myocyte necrosis <br/> - Eosinophil degranulation with toxic cationic proteins (ECP, MBP) <br/> - Microabscesses |
| Thrombotic stage | ~10 months | - Endothelial damage <br/> - Mural thrombi in ventricles (especially apices) <br/> - Valvular involvement (mitral > tricuspid) with fibrotic thickening and regurgitation |
| Fibrotic stage | 1–2 years | - Dense endomyocardial fibrosis <br/> - Apical obliteration <br/> - Restrictive cardiomyopathy <br/> - Entrapped chordae with valvular dysfunction |

## Detailed histopathological features

### Acute necrotic stage

- **Eosinophil infiltration**: Dense infiltration of endocardium and myocardium by activated eosinophils [^1114rmfX].
- **Myocyte necrosis**: Focal myocyte necrosis from eosinophil degranulation and toxic proteins [^114gix2x].
- **Microabscesses**: Eosinophilic microabscesses within myocardium [^116rSrPs].
- **Eosinophil degranulation**: Release of cationic proteins (ECP, MBP) causing tissue damage [^1137Mez6].

---

### Thrombotic stage

- **Endothelial damage**: Eosinophil-mediated endothelial injury promoting thrombosis [^114gix2x].
- **Mural thrombi**: Layered thrombi in ventricles, especially apices [^1137Mez6].
- **Valvular involvement**: Fibrotic thickening and regurgitation, more often mitral than tricuspid [^notfound].
- **Thromboembolism**: Risk of systemic emboli from detached thrombi [^113LXFkj].

---

### Fibrotic stage

- **Endomyocardial fibrosis**: Dense fibrosis of endocardium and inner myocardium [^113bB9Kt].
- **Apical obliteration**: Fibrotic obliteration of ventricular apices [^112bCSya].
- **Restrictive cardiomyopathy**: Impaired diastolic filling and restrictive physiology [^114gix2x].
- **Valvular dysfunction**: Entrapped chordae and fibrotic valves causing regurgitation [^116rSrPs].

## Immunohistochemical markers

Immunohistochemistry helps characterize eosinophil activation and distinguish Loeffler's endocarditis from other eosinophilic heart diseases. Eosinophil cationic protein (**ECP**) reflects degranulation and tissue damage, and major basic protein (**MBP**) indicates eosinophil activation and cytotoxicity. CD69 is typically absent in Loeffler's endocarditis but present in hypersensitivity myocarditis, aiding the differential diagnosis [^112FBjmQ].

---

## Clinical correlation and implications

Histopathological findings correlate with clinical manifestations and guide management. The **acute necrotic stage** may be subclinical or present with myocarditis, and early treatment can reverse damage [^116yZyug]. The **thrombotic stage** carries a high risk of embolic events, requiring anticoagulation [^111Vcngg]. The **fibrotic stage** causes restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure, often needing surgical intervention [^1114rmfX].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Histopathological differentiation from other eosinophilic heart diseases and restrictive cardiomyopathies is essential. Tropical endomyocardial fibrosis shares fibrosis but lacks early eosinophilic infiltration; hypersensitivity myocarditis shows **CD69-positive eosinophils** and a different pattern; and cardiac amyloidosis has **amyloid deposits** without eosinophilic infiltration [^112FBjmQ] [^113bB9Kt].

---

Loeffler's endocarditis has a **triphasic histopathology** — acute necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic — with eosinophil infiltration, myocyte necrosis, mural thrombi, and endomyocardial fibrosis as hallmarks. These features underpin clinical staging, management, and prognosis [^116yZyug].

### Loeffler endocarditis: what have we learned? [^112bCSya]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Loeffler endocarditis, eosinophilic endomyocardial disease or fibroplastic endocarditis appears to be a subcategory of the Hypereosinophilic syndrome in which the heart is predominantly involved. It is an uncommon myocardial disease, thought to be secondary to eosinophils damage, characterized by fibrous thickening of the endocardium of one or both ventricles, leading to apical obliteration and multiple cardiovascular complications. Despite all the efforts, the ultimate responsible mechanisms of this entity remain unresolved. Many theories have been raised trying to explain this phenomenon, but nowadays the enigma in relation to the different patterns of evolution continues. In this concise review we discuss the different pathophysiologic theories postulated and the management of the cardiovascular complications. Perhaps it will serve to assist in recognition of patients with the same condition around the world.

### Loeffler's endocarditis: an integrated multimodality approach [^1135rjHZ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

Loeffler's endocarditis (LE) is the cardiac manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a rare systemic disease characterized by the sustained production of eosinophils leading to organ damage. Few data, principally by case reports, are available regarding the diagnostic workup in patients with suspected LE. Thus, we have performed a systematic search of the literature dealing with imaging in LE and propose an integrated multimodality imaging approach in the cardiac diagnostics of LE patients. The aim is to provide an updated state-of-the-art review focused on noninvasive and invasive imaging modalities for this rare and underdiagnosed disease. Standard and advanced echocardiography are typically the first cardiac imaging examinations when LE is suspected and they are also used later in follow-up for prognostic stratification and assessing response to treatment. Cardiac magnetic resonance provides a more detailed anatomical and functional evaluation of cardiac chambers, tissue characterization for the presence and extension of myocardial edema and fibrosis, and ventricular thrombi identification. Computed tomography scan and [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography may be helpful in selected cases to evaluate the cardiac involvement of LE as well as the other noncardiac manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome. Endomyocardial biopsy may be considered in patients with high clinical suspicion of LE if noninvasive imaging findings are confusing or not conclusive. The appropriate use of invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities, combining the available techniques with the patients' clinical features, will hopefully lead to early diagnosis, more accurate staging of disease, and timely treatment of LE that may prevent the irreversible myocardial damage of LE and adverse cardiovascular events.

Loeffler endocarditis is an uncommon restrictive cardiomyopathy associated with eosinophilia and endomyocardial fibrosis causing diastolic restriction, predominantly involving the right ventricle. Cardiac MRI plays a crucial role in early detection of disease. Early disease usually responds well to corticosteroids. We describe a case of Loeffler endocarditis with isolated left ventricular involvement on MRI in a young male having hypereosinophilia.

### Fatal loeffler's endocarditis due to hypereosinophilic syndrome [^113HjFYf]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder that can manifest in various organ systems. We report the case of a 54-year-old woman with a remote history of seizure disorder who presented with early signs of right-sided heart failure. Laboratory studies showed significant eosinophilia (8 x 10(9) l(-1)). Computed tomography showed heterogeneity of the liver, mild ascites, moderate pleural effusion, multiple small pulmonary emboli, and a large right ventricular mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the right ventricular mass was due to thrombus and extensive endomyocardial fibrosis, consistent with Loeffler's endocarditis. Bone marrow biopsy showed marked eosinophilia but no abnormal myeloid maturation or a lymphoproliferative disorder; flow cytometry showed no clonality. Extensive infectious, immunologic, and toxicological studies were negative. Despite resolution of peripheral eosinophilia with medical management, including corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents, anticoagulation for pulmonary emboli and ventricular thrombus, and conventional treatment for heart failure, she developed worsening anasarca and died from ventricular fibrillation within 4 weeks of presentation. Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Loeffler's endocarditis, usually a late manifestation of HES, is characterized by fibrous thickening of the endocardium, leading to apical obliteration and restrictive cardiomyopathy, resulting in heart failure, thromboembolic events, or atrial fibrillation. HES is a potentially fatal disease with less than 50% reported 10-year survival. This case presentation is unusual in its rapidly progressive course leading to sudden death.

### Loeffler's endocarditis with biventricular mural thrombi [^1176kFpz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old man presented to clinic with 1-week history of cough, malaise, loss of appetite and fever. Symptoms started acutely with cough and generalised weakness followed by fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. He has been healthy before with no chronic illnesses. Further workup disclosed, leucocytosis with 87% eosinophilia, bilateral lung infiltrate, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and both right and left biventricular mural thrombi. Extensive workup was done and was consistent with hypereosinophilic syndrome, which explained all his clinical findings. The patient was started on high-dose steroids and responded very well with a complete resolution of symptoms over the course of a few weeks.

### A child with eosinophilia, loeffler endocarditis, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1122GcHm]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

We present an 8-year-old male with Loeffler endocarditis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia with hypereosinophilia (ALL/Eo) who initially presented with a 3-month history of peripheral eosinophilia thought to be due to visceral larval migrans. Despite treatment for Toxocara, his leukocytosis persisted and he developed mitral valve insufficiency and congestive heart failure. Myocardial biopsy revealed fibrosis and thrombus formation indicative of Loeffler endocarditis, and a peripheral smear showed pre-B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia. This unique case highlights a rare, yet serious sequella of prolonged eosinophilia.

### Loffler's endocarditis presenting in 2 children as fever with eosinophilia [^117Lp5kc]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are defined by the presence of peripheral and bone marrow eosinophilia and by the infiltration of multiple organs by mature eosinophilic cells. Loffler's endocarditis is a condition in which mature eosinophils infiltrate and damage the endocardium and myocardium. Male adults who live in the tropics are the population predominantly affected by this condition. Typical clinical features include weight loss, fever, cough, rash, and congestive heart failure. In this article, we report the typical presentation of an unusual illness that occurred in 2 pediatric patients in different geographic locations. In addition, we believe that these are the youngest patients with Loffler's endocarditis reported.

### Loeffler endocarditis in a pediatric patient [^115wSW54]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Loefler endocarditis is a potential fatal adverse event of hypereosinophilic syndrome. We report a case of a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with peripheral hypereosinophilia refractory to corticosteroid therapy who developed eosinophilia-related endocarditis. Echocardiography revealed infiltration of the left ventricular free wall and the posterior mitral leaflet causing moderate mitral regurgitation. Genetic tests failed to recognize FIPiLi-PDGRFA genotype; however imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was initiated. After a 4-week period of treatment there was a complete resolution of eosinophilia and a complete recovery of cardiac manifestation. This case highlights the introduction of imatinib for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome refractory to corticosteroid therapy even in the absence of FIPiLi-PDGRFA genotype in pediatric patients.

Eosinophilic endocarditis

Eosinophilic endocarditis (endomyocardial fibrosis, Löeffler endomyocarditis) is a part of the spectrum of hyperesosinophilic syndrome, which is characterized by elevated eosinophils > 1500/ μL > 6 months and organ dysfunction. The heart is the most commonly involved organ and cardiac involvement is associated with adverse prognosis. There are three stages of cardiac involvement. In the acute necrotic stage, there is eosinophilic infiltration of the endocardium and myocardium. This is followed by the thrombotic-necrotic stage, which is associated with ventricular damage. In the late fibrotic stage, there is diffuse fibrous tissue lining the endocardium often extending from the LVOT to the apex. On MRI, there is thickening of the LV apex, which can be confused with apical HCM. A high T2 signal may be seen in the apical endocardium. Diffuse subendocardial perfusion defect may be present. On LGE, a triple layered pattern of enhancement is a characteristic finding of eosinophilic endocarditis. This includes an inner dark layer due to non-enhancing thrombus, a middle bright layer due to LGE from fibrous tissue and an outer dark layer of normally nulled myocardium (Fig. 10). Patchy intramyocardial LGE may also be present. Associated wall motion abnormalities and dilated left atrium may also be seen. Treatment is surgical resection of the fibrous tissue.

### When multimodality cardiac imaging saves the day: rare cause of embolic strokes [^113LXFkj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of tissues. Myocardial infiltration occurs in 50%-60% of HES and leads to a condition called Loeffler's endocarditis. This can lead to endomyocardial injury with resultant superimposed thrombus formation and embolic stroke. We describe the case of a 57-year-old female patient presenting with neurological symptoms who was found to have multiple embolic strokes on a background of long-standing eosinophilia. Following a series of investigations, including transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiographies and cardiovascular MRI, she was confirmed to have Loeffler's endocarditis with left ventricular thrombus. She was treated successfully with steroids and anticoagulation. We describe the pathophysiology of HES and Loeffler's endocarditis and stress the crucial role of multimodality cardiac imaging in establishing its diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

Discussion

Acquired eosinophilia can be classified into secondary (cytokine-driven reactive phenomenon), clonal (presence of a bone marrow histological, cytogenetic or molecular marker of a myeloid malignancy) and idiopathic (neither secondary nor clonal) categories. In 1975 Chusid et al. described diagnostic criteria for idiopathic HES that remain in use today. These are blood eosinophilia of > 1500 cells per microliter for more than six consecutive months, absence of an underlying cause of hypereosinophilia despite extensive diagnostic evaluation, and organ damage or dysfunction as a result of local release of the toxic contents of eosinophils. HES affects mostly men between 20 and 50 years of age, with a peak in the 4 th decade of life. There are no published data regarding its incidence/prevalence, although the syndrome is considered rare in adults and very rare in children.

The exact etiology of HES is unknown; however, the process probably involves a dysregulation of IL-3, IL-5 and/or GM-CSF, which are all eosinophil growth factors.

Clinical manifestations of HES are markedly heterogeneous as the disease can either be completely asymptomatic or involve multiple organs. In essence, any organ is vulnerable to eosinophilia-associated tissue damage. Thromboembolic disease involving the cardiac chambers and/or both the venous and arterial vessels is not infrequent. Cardiac involvement occurs in more than 75% of patients with HES and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HES usually follows three stages. The first is an acute necrotic stage. This stage is usually neither recognized clinically nor diagnosed, like in our case. In this stage there is damage to the endocardium and infiltration of the myocardium with eosinophils and lymphocytes with histopathological evidence of myocardial necrosis and eosinophil degranulation and eosinophil micro abscesses. The second stage concerns thrombosis with formation of thrombi along the damaged endocardium of either one or both ventricles and occasionally in the atrium. Outflow tracts near the aortic and pulmonic valves are usually spared, although rarely thrombus may involve these valves and thrombus may form on atrioventricular valve leaflets. This stage is found in those with a mean 10-month duration of eosinophilia. In the third late fibrotic stage progressive scarring may lead to entrapment of chordae tendineae resulting in mitral and/or tricuspid valve regurgitation and endomyocardial fibrosis producing a restrictive cardiomyopathy.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with ulcerative colitis presenting with recurrent loeffler's endocarditis and left ventricular thrombus treated successfully with immune suppressive therapy and anticoagulation [^113Dh6Xq]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We reported a case of a 28-year-old Caucasian woman with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) associated with ulcerative colitis who presented on separate occasions with Loeffler's endocarditis. She was admitted in 2008 with fever, headache, confusion and visual loss. Diagnostic workup uncovered an eosinophilia of 3.1×10⁹/L and major ECG abnormalities. Subsequent echocardiography revealed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with mural thrombus. MRI brain scan showed multiple white matter lesions consistent with acute infarcts. She recovered rapidly with corticosteroids and anticoagulation. Four years later she re-presented with headache, fatigue and an eosinophilia of 13.4×10⁹/L. This occurred 3 months after cessation of immunosuppression and within 12 months of total colectomy for fulminant ulcerative colitis. Echocardiography was suggestive of hypereosinophilic endomyocardial fibrosis with left ventricular thrombus. Anticoagulation and corticosteroids were resumed with good effect. This report highlights the findings, treatment and outcome of ulcerative colitis-associated HES manifesting as recurrent Loeffler's endocarditis.

### Rapid reversion of loeffler's endocarditis by imatinib in early stage clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome [^11267ARB]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

Endomyocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) is the main cause of poor outcome in Hyper Eosinophilic Syndrome (HES) and Eosinophilic Leukemia (EL). Reversion of the cardiac damage has been seldom reported, and thrombi can superimpose on infiltrated walls, originating oembolic complications. The tyrosine kynase inhibitor imatinib has been recently employed in patients affected by HES or EL, with impressive results. We have treated with imatinib a young patient affected by Loeffler's endocarditis during EL. Loeffler's endocarditis was studied by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography with and without the contrast agent SonoVue. Cytogenetics, FISH and molecular analysis showed the presence of the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene, recently detected in a majority of HES patients. Standard echocardiography revealed a large infiltration of the apical region, with apparently pedunculate corpora floating in the LV chamber; after SonoVue injection, a thick endo-myocardial infiltration involving papillary muscles and tendinous chords appeared, which simulated mobile thrombi at standard echography. Treatment with low dose imatinib caused rapid regression of both eosinophilic proliferation and endomyocardiopathy. The fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA was found significantly decreased after a few months of treatment. Using a contrast echocardiographic approach, we demonstrated the non-thrombotic origin of the "in plus" image in our patient and its rapid resolution following imatinib treatment. Imatinib is an excellent candidate for first line treatment of Loeffler's endocarditis, especially when the FIP1L1/PDGFA fusion gene is detected.

### ANCA-negative eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA) manifesting as a large intracardiac thrombus and glomerulonephritis with angionecrosis [^1179vdt1]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old woman with a history of bronchial asthma presented with a prolonged fever and eosinophilia. There was transient proteinuria and troponin level was elevated. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody was negative and she did not fulfil criteria for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA). Echocardiography showed a large apical mass in the left ventricle, but there was no systolic dysfunction, local asynergy or ventricular remodelling. On MRI, apical mass was compatible with a thrombus and endocardial region was diffusely damaged. Loeffler endocarditis-like cardiac manifestation led to meticulous examination, which found no aetiology for eosinophilia. Finally, renal biopsy revealed eosinophil infiltration and glomerular angionecrosis, confirming as EGPA. This case highlights the isolated large cardiac thrombus as a rare presenting sign for EGPA and underscores current complicated strategy to diagnose EGPA. Of note, this clinical challenge was mostly caused by inchoate comprehension of hypereosinophilia-related disorders.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113bvRgt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of vasculitis characterised by atopic manifestations, inflammation of small-sized to medium-sized arteries and veins, hypereosinophilia and tissue infiltration with eosinophils. Cardiac complications occur most commonly in the absence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Cardiac complications include coronary arteritis (rare), pericarditis, myocarditis, endocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) and intracavitary thrombosis of the left or right ventricle. This is the first reported case of large non-infectious valvular vegetations associated with EGPA.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^1137Mez6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Endocardial involvement in patients with EGPA is similar to that of other hypereosinophilic syndromes (idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and its variants, tropical endomyocardial fibrosis). The pathological lesion most commonly associated with hypereosinophilic syndromes is referred to as Loeffler's endocarditis. Loeffler's endocarditis occurs less commonly with EGPA than with other hypereosinophilic syndromes. It evolves in three stages. The first stage is characterised by endomyocardial infiltration with eosinophils and lymphocytes. Degranulation of eosinophils results in the release of cationic protein, eosinophil major protein, eosinophil myeloperoxidase and Charcot–Leyden crystal protein. These substances are cytotoxic and are thought to produce endomyocardial necrosis. The second stage is characterised by thrombus formation in areas of endomyocardial damage (the left and right ventricular apex are most commonly affected). The third stage is characterised by endocardial fibrosis which may be local or diffuse and may result in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Endocardial fibrosis is recognised by late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI. Valvular function in Loeffler's endocarditis may be affected by fibrotic tethering of chordae tendineae or fibroinflammatory involvement of valvular endothelium. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are the most commonly reported forms of valve dysfunction in patients with EGPA, but are infrequently observed. Large valvular vegetations have been described in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and with vasculitides such as Wegener's granulomatosis. To our knowledge this case is the first description of non-infectious valvular vegetations in a patient with EGPA. In the absence of myocardial tissue from biopsy or autopsy, we are uncertain as to the cause of this patient's decline in LV systolic function after surgery. Eosinophilic infiltration of myocardium is a possibility, but cardiac MRI showed no evidence of myocarditis or endocardial fibrosis. Severing of the chordae tendineae to facilitate mitral valve replacement is also a possible explanation.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116yZyug]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Endomyocardial fibrosis and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Löffler endocarditis) — Definition and clinical spectrum are outlined: Eosinophilic myocarditis occurs when overproduction of eosinophils leads to myocardial damage through infiltration and release of inflammatory cytokines, and Löffler endocarditis is characterized by eosinophilia, myocardial fibrosis, systemic thromboembolism, and acute HF and likely represents late stages of eosinophilic myocarditis. Endomyocardial fibrosis primarily presents as restrictive cardiomyopathy and is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. Multiple organ systems are involved, including cutaneous (69%), pulmonary (44%), gastrointestinal (38%), and cardiac (20%), and eosinophilic myocarditis is the primary manifestation of the disease only 5% of the time. Eosinophilic myocarditis progresses in 3 stages (necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic), with the initial necrotic stage often subclinical but potentially presenting as fulminant myocarditis.

Conclusions

Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare cause of cardiac failure resulting in cardiogenic shock due to endomyocardial thickening and thrombus formation. Both may impede left ventricular in- and outflow tract. The risk increases when the duration of hypereosinophilia is more than ten months. Besides first line therapy (corticosteroids), early aggressive anticoagulation therapy is warranted. In more severe cases acute surgical intervention is necessary.

To diagnose HES and Löffler endocarditis, echocardiography enables sufficient detection of thickened endocardium and intraventricular thrombus. Nevertheless, acute necrotic stage can come along with absolute normal echocardiographic findings. Endomyocardial thickening is seen in 68% of patients on echocardiography and is progressive. Apical thrombus in the presence of normal apical contraction is one of the main clues in suspected Löffler's endomyocarditis. There are three primary goals for the management of HES: 1) reduction of peripheral and tissue levels of eosinophils; 2) prevention of end-organ damage; and 3) prevention of thrombo-embolic events in patients at risk. Patients without progressive organ system dysfunction typically do not require specific treatment, however, these patients should be monitored closely. Corticosteroids were initially the mainstay of HES treatment and are currently recommended as first-line therapy. Cytotoxic agents like hydroxyurea are indicated in HES subsets with corticosteroid resistance or when corticosteroid tapering is necessary. Interferon-alpha is an immunomodulator that reduces Th2-mediated IL-5 production, synthesis of GM-CSF and release of eosinophil-specific neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein and indirectly inhibits eosinophil differentiation. It is recommended for use in HES patients with organ damage and corticosteroid/cytotoxic treatment failure. Allogenic stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be a potentially curative therapy. It is the ultimate therapeutic measure in case of therapeutic refractoriness or intolerance to available therapies or in patients who present with progressive life-threatening end-organ damage. The optimal preparative regime is not well established and it is associated with major morbidity and even mortality. Several therapies are currently under investigation as potential HES therapies, like Mepolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal IgG anti-IL5 antibody. The secondary treatment should be directed at cardiac complications, e.g. heart failure and the presence of intracardial thrombus. In the view of subclinical progression of the cardiac involvement, especially in the primary stage of HES, our case suggests very early and aggressive anticoagulation, regardless of the initial (negative) cardiac evaluation. Occasionally, surgical therapies are needed for cardiovascular complications. Surgical experience of patients with valvular dysfunction secondary to HES is limited. Valve replacement is most often performed but the choice between a mechanical or biological prosthesis in this setting poses a difficult problem. Mechanical valves have a high incidence of recurrent obstructive thrombosis and therefor a bioprosthesis is recommended despite associated restrictive cardiomyopathy.

### Löffler endocarditis: a rare cause of acute cardiac failure [^112bgYET]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a heterogenous group of disorders marked by the sustained overproduction of eosinophils. It is a rare condition with an unknown prevalence. Diagnosis is based on three criteria: (1) an eosinophil count of more than 1500 cells per microliter for at least 6 months, (2) no other evident cause for eosinophilia, including allergic diseases and parasitic infection and (3) sign or symptoms of organ involvement by eosinophilic infiltration. Cardiac involvement is common in HES and eosinophilic myocarditis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with HES. Mitral valve involvement may lead to acute cardiac failure. We present a patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and severe cardiac involvement, so-called Löffler endocarditis.

Endomyocardial disorders

Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) are characterized by diffuse thickening of the LV endocardium secondary to the proteotoxic damage produced by eosinophils and the ensuing proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue. The LV is invariably involved, often together with the mitral and aortic valves. Isolated right ventricular involvement may rarely occur. Endomyocardial fibrosis is commonly seen in equatorial countries and accounts for ∼20% of HF cases and 15% of cardiac deaths in equatorial Africa. A combination of dietary, environmental, and infectious factors may elicit an inflammatory process leading to progressive endomyocardial damage and scarring. The natural history of EMF includes an active phase with inflammation and eosinophilia that progresses to restrictive heart disease. Hypereosinophilic syndrome affecting the heart, formerly known as Loeffler's endocarditis, is a very rare condition caused by the release of highly active biological substances that damage the endothelium and myocardium. Most patients are diagnosed between 20 and 50 years of age. Mechanisms of eosinophilia include helminthic and parasitic infections, malignancies, eosinophilic leukaemia, allergic drug reactions, hypersensitivity, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The fibrotic stage results in RCM due to extensive endomyocardial fibrosis and resembles EMF.

Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is characterized by diffuse thickening of the LV endocardium secondary to proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue. Two forms have been described: a dilated form (DCM phenotype), in which the LV is enlarged, and a 'contracted' form (RCM phenotype), in which the LV cavity is small. A familial pattern is seen in the majority, with presentation commonly occuring during infancy. Mitral and aortic valves are frequently involved. Isolated RV involvement may rarely occur. The 'contracted' form produces restrictive haemodynamics and a clinical picture of left-sided obstructive disease, particularly if the mitral valve is involved. Endocardial fibroelastosis is extremely rare and may respond to surgery. Medical management of the fibrotic stage may include diuretics and aspirin or anticoagulation to prevent intracardiac thrombosis. Anticoagulation can promote the reabsorption of thrombosis even in non-acute phases of the disease. The fibrotic stage may occasionally require surgical therapy, which may include resection of endocardial scar as well as subchordal repair and/or valve repair or replacement. Surgical resection of subendocardial fibrosis is rarely curative, even in centres of expertise. and cardiac transplantation is an option in advanced cases.

### Histoplasma endocarditis: clinical and mycologic features and outcomes [^1124bziX]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define the salient clinical and microbiologic characteristics and outcome of infective endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum.

Methods

Case report and review of 43 literature cases.

Results

Infection involved both native (36 cases) and prosthetic (7) heart valves, had a high rate of systemic embolization (58%), and a more delayed diagnosis than bacterial endocarditis. Cardiac involvement generally occurred on mitral and/or aortic valves, and almost always in the setting of disseminated disease. Antemortem diagnosis was best made by serology (serum antibody titers or urinary antigen) or culture of blood (positive in < 20% of cases), bone marrow, excised valves, and other non-blood specimens. Other diagnostic methods included histopathology and immunofluorescent staining of tissue samples. Untreated infection was uniformly fatal. Prolonged antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, without surgical intervention, appeared more effective than for Candida endocarditis.

Conclusions

Histoplasma endocarditis is an infrequent but important cause of left-sided, blood culture-negative endocarditis. Its true prevalence may be underestimated because of the relative difficulty in making a precise microbiologic diagnosis. Amphotericin B therapy appears more effective than for Candida endocarditis, while the role for azole treatment and secondary prophylaxis remains uncertain. Indications for surgical valve replacement are similar to those for bacterial endocarditis.

### Hyepereosiniphilic syndrome and COVID-19: 2 case reports [^117Nfcrv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is defined as a high peripheral eosinophil count (> 1.5 × 10 9 /L), along with evidence of eosinophil-related organ damage. The etiology can be neoplastic (primary), reactive to conditions like parasitic infection or lymphoma (secondary), and, more commonly, idiopathic. Cardiac involvement, known as "Loeffler's Endocarditis", consists of three phases: acute necrotic asymptomatic phase, thrombotic phase with possible embolic events, and fibrotic phase with restrictive cardiomyopathy and symptoms of heart failure. Nearly half of the patients have cardiovascular involvement, a major cause of mortality in HES.

Over the past two years, millions have been affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although upper respiratory tract symptoms are the most common manifestation, myocardial injury can occur in many patients, ranging from myocarditis to acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Cardiac involvement negatively affects the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19, especially in patients with pre-existing heart disease. COVID-19 also exacerbates the compensated pre-existing cardiac diseases or increases complications. Herein, we describe two patients with HES complicated by COVID-19 and discuss the coagulation status and treatment strategies in such patients.

Outcome and follow-up

One excised valve cusp was sent for culture, but no bacterial or fungal growth was observed. Histopathological examination of the remaining two cusps revealed features that are characteristic of NBTE, including abundant fibrin-rich thrombotic vegetations containing essentially no inflammation. The vegetations were adherent to the aortic surface of the cusps along the closing edge, with preservation of cusp architecture. No perforations or destruction of cusp tissue was identified, and tissue Gram and Gomori-methenamine silver stains were negative for bacterial and fungal organisms, respectively, further supporting a diagnosis of NBTE (figure 2).

Introduction

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by persistent eosinophilia and damage to multiple organs caused by allergies, parasites, autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer with low morbidity and high mortality, which mainly affects men aged between 20 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestation is multi-system eosinophil infiltration, especially the skin, heart, and nervous system. Diagnosis requires an eosinophil (EO) count of at least 1.5 × 10 9 /L twice (interval of more than 1 month) and/or bone marrow nucleated cell count with EO ratio ≥ 20%, and/or pathology confirmed extensive EO infiltration and/or significant deposition of eosinophilic granulocyte protein and evidence of organ damage except for other diseases that may be the primary cause of organ damage. HES can be classified into four subtypes based on etiology as follows: hereditary (familial) HE, secondary (reactive) HE, primary (clonal/neoplastic) HE, and idiopathic HE. Heart involvement is the most serious complication and the main cause of death in HES, with complication rates of 40–50%. Eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis, a serious heart complication of HES, results in damage to the endocardium or myocardium through eosinophil infiltration, leading to myocardial necrosis, thrombogenesis, and fibrosis. Eosinophilic endocarditis is also known as Löffler myocarditis (LE). Patients may lack specific symptoms but often experience dyspnea and a high risk of death. Acute cases can be severe, with systemic thrombo-embolic events, worsening cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Patients with eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (EGPA) and allergies complicated with LE face significantly higher 120-day mortality of 23.3% and 46.3%, respectively, compared to those without LE. Early recognition and treatment of LE can improve prognosis. In this article, four cases diagnosed with LE were screened based on patients who visited our hospital over the past five years, and retrospective analysis on their diagnosis and treatment will be given. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature review of the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis was conducted, aiming to establish a foundation for further research and to provide detailed insights for the clinical management of eosinophilic endocarditis.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^111GrEs5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Current recommendations for the treatment of EGPA include therapy with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone, followed by administrations of an immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. A systematic review of treatment of EGPA by Bosch et al suggested that azathioprine and possibly methotrexate may be useful in maintaining remission. In 2017, the humanised monoclonal antibody mepolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in EGPA. Our patient was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, but did not receive cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, leflunomide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange. Failure to initiate one or more of these therapies probably occurred due to the delay in confirming the diagnosis of EGPA, which occurred shortly before death, and because the patient declined further therapy once the diagnosis of EGPA was confirmed. It is possible that earlier diagnosis and more aggressive pharmacotherapy might have changed the course of this patient's illness. Mepolizumab was not available prior to the patient's demise.

In conclusion, non-infectious valvular vegetations should be added to the list of cardiovascular complications of EGPA.

Learning points

Previously described cardiac complications of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) include coronary arteritis (rare), pericarditis, myocarditis, endocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) and thrombus formation in the left or right ventricle.
Cardiac complications occur in 50%–62% of patients with EGPA, mainly in those who are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative.
Large non-infectious valvular vegetations may occur in patients with EGPA.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^114gix2x]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis progresses through three stages. The initial stage, occurring in the first 1–2 months of the disease, involves acute inflammatory necrosis of myocardial cells, where eosinophils infiltrate the heart tissue, degranulate, and release toxic cationic proteins such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and major basic protein (MBP), which mediate myocardial damage. Early histopathological features include acute myocarditis with eosinophil and lymphocyte infiltration. During this phase, eosinophils infiltrate myocardial interstitium, degranulate, and release toxic cationic proteins, inducing apoptosis and necrosis. However, patients typically exhibit no cardiac-specific symptoms or signs at this stage. The second phase is the thrombus formation period (about 10 months later), during which endothelial damage and thrombus formation occur, potentially leading to valvular dysfunction. Thrombo-embolism can lead to acute cerebral infarction and acute abdominal aortic occlusion. These conditions may initially manifest without specific cardiac symptoms or signs. The occurrence of systemic thromboembolic events secondary to intravenular thrombosis is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis. The third stage is the fibrotic scarring formation stage (after 1 to 2 years), characterized by endocardial fibrosis and restrictive filling impairments, also known as constrictive endocarditis, whose pathological features were attributed to endocardial fibrosis resulting from the fibrous inflammatory process and granulation tissue remodeling, and not to amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, or non-caseating granulomas. Thrombi are replaced by fibrosis, which can involve the endocardium, valves, and chordae tendineae. The cardiac endothelial cells and valves become fibrotic and thickened, and mitral valve regurgitation may also occur, possibly due to fibrotic scars or direct involvement of the mitral valve. The fibrotic stage can also affect the cardiac conduction system, leading to severe arrhythmias.

### Infective endocarditis [^113yT5T8]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infective endocarditis:

- Definition: IE is a disease characterized by infection and inflammation of the endocardium, the layer of endothelial cells that lines the chambers and valves of the heart.
- Pathophysiology: IE is most commonly caused by Streptococci and Staphylococci (80% cases), with S. aureus being the most common pathogen. Risk factors include the presence of cardiac prosthetic material (prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices) or abnormal valvular tissue (non-repaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases, chronic rheumatic heart disease, age-related degenerative valvular lesions), as well as intravenous drug use, and relative immunosuppression (including age ≥ 65 years, hemodialysis, diabetes, and HIV infection).
- Epidemiology: The incidence of IE is approximately 15 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US.
- Disease course: The altered cardiac valve surface produces a suitable site for bacteria in the bloodstream to attach and proliferate, creating vegetations that can detach and disseminate. Septic emboli from vegetations result in clinical manifestations of ischemic stroke, mycotic aneurysms, infarcts, and abscesses at various sites. Pulmonary, splenic, neurovascular, renal, and cardiac manifestations can ultimately lead to death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: IE is associated with 15–22% in-hospital mortality and 40% 5-year mortality in developed countries. The estimated risk of recurrence of IE is 1.3% per year.

### Loeffler's endomyocarditis: from cardiac arrest to complete recovery [^115ebmUW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are rare diseases; however, cardiac involvement is frequently seen. When diagnosed promptly, the prognosis is relatively good; however, a final diagnosis is made by ruling out many conditions leading to secondary eosinophilia. We present a case of Loeffler's endomyocarditis primarily misdiagnosed as an acute coronary syndrome, complicated by low output heart failure and cardiac arrest. After hypereosinophilic syndrome was confirmed and treatment with prednisone initiated, the patient responded well to therapy, and her further recovery was complete and uneventful.

### Update on endocarditis-associated glomerulonephritis [^1128NZAD]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Renal disease due to infective endocarditis (IE) is well established, with the earliest reports of glomerular lesions published over 100 years ago. Although initially believed to be primarily embolic, it later became clear that over 80% of cases represented focal, segmental, or diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) with prominent endocapillary proliferation and occasional infiltrating leukocytes. However, the literature describing nephritis associated with IE still relies heavily on autopsy studies conducted in the pre- and early postantibiotic era or small renal biopsy studies from the 1970s.

Several reviews have emphasized the evolution occurring in recent decades in renal complications of infectious diseases in general, with particular emphasis on the change in demographics from younger to older patients, the frequency of comorbidities such as diabetes and HIV, and the change in predominance of infectious agents from primarily streptococcal to a broader array of organisms with predominance of Staphylococci.,

IE occurs in 30 to 60% of patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and carries a mortality rate of 40–50%. Over the past decades, IE outcomes have not improved, and infection rates are steadily increasing. Recent case series and reviews of IE have compared findings from current and previous eras, confirmed similar changes in the demographics of the disease, and updated the clinical and pathologic features in both adults and children. However, few of these recent reports have focused primarily on IE-related renal lesions, and much of the data currently available still include predominately autopsy-derived information.

Based on all of the above, we investigated the clinicopathologic characteristics of a large cohort of patients with IE-associated GN diagnosed by kidney biopsy between 2001 and 2011 in two large nephropathology laboratories. Our data indicate that IE-associated GN in the new era has significantly different clinical and pathologic changes from those described historically.

Diagnosis overview — The diagnosis of IE is straightforward in the minority with a consistent history and classic oslerian manifestations, but in most patients the textbook history and physical examination findings may be few or absent; early limited manifestations occur particularly among injection drug users in whom IE is often due to acute S aureus infection of right-sided heart valves; right-sided IE usually does not create peripheral emboli and immunological vascular phenomena that can result from left-sided involvement, although right-sided IE can cause septic pulmonary emboli; and the Duke schema stratified suspected IE into 3 categories: definite, possible, and rejected.

### Löffler endocarditis: a rare cause of acute cardiac failure [^115bwgSM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Case report

A 37-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with one month of fatigue and five days of progressive dyspnoea and fever. Three months earlier he had been diagnosed with idiopathic hypereosinophilia. Extensive diagnostic evaluation at that time revealed neither a cause for secondary eosinophilia nor any cardiac abnormalities. Oral prednisone was given for two months, but was gradually tapered since there was no decline in eosinophil count.

On admission we saw an acutely ill-looking man, temperature 38.1°C, blood pressure 80/47 mmHg, heart rate 137 beats/min and a saturation of 90% with 15 liters per minute of oxygen therapy by a non-rebreathing mask. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs; diffuse inspiratory crackles were heard during ausculation of the lungs. No other abnormalities were found. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 96.8 × 10 9 /L, of which 84.2 × 10 9 /l were eosinophils (87%), hemoglobin 8.6 mmol/l, thrombocytes 238 × 10 9 /L, C-reactive protein 122 mg/L, creatinine 141 umol/L, lactate dehydrogenase 426 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 28 U/L and creatine phosphokinase 45 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.46, pCO2 4.3 kPa, pO2 8.5 kPa and bicarbonate 23 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia, a QS complex in V1 and V2, 2 mm. ST-elevations in V1-V3 and ST-depressions in II, III, AVF, V5 and V6 (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large mass in the left ventricle (LV) attached to the posterolateral wall with severe inflow- and outflow tract obstruction; echo Doppler maximal LV outflow tract velocity was 6 m/s (Figure 2 A and B). The posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) was completely embedded in the mass. The left and right ventricular function was however fully normal. Because of progressive respiratory failure, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A CT-scan of the thorax confirmed the large (thrombus) mass in the left ventricle, left and right atrial dilatation, pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed endomyocardial fibrosis and necrosis and a large thrombus in the left ventricle with obstruction of the left ventricle outflow tract. A diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis was made. Pharmacological therapy was initiated with diuretics, high dose beta-blockers, methylprednisolone (1000 mg a day for three days) and anti-coagulation along with antiplatelet agents acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. Mechanical ventilation was necessary for twelve days. After this period weaning and extubation was successfully. Because of severe diastolic dysfunction with an inflow and outflow tract obstruction of the left ventricle due to the thrombus, inotropics were not helpful and patient received only on the first day norepinephrine. Initially there was a marked decline in his eosinophil count (white blood cell count of 32 × 10 9 /L with 17 × 10 9 /L eosinophils (53%) however this was of short duration. Therefore we started therapy with interferon alpha and hydroxycarbamide resulting in a gradual decline of the eosinophil count (white blood cell count of 6.6 × 10 9 /L, of which 2.28 × 10 9 /L (34.5%) were eosinophils). Signs of bone marrow depression with anemia and thrombocytopenia complicated this therapy. Interferon alpha therefore was stopped.

### Endocarditis due to tropheryma whipplei: rapid detection, limited genetic diversity, and long-term clinical outcome in a local experience [^112XQcyy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

The characteristic features of Whipple's disease include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, wasting, and arthralgias, with the causative agent, Tropheryma whipplei, being detected mainly in intestinal biopsies. PCR technology has led to the identification of T. whipplei in specimens from various other locations, including the central nervous system and the heart. T. whipplei is now recognized as one of the causes of culture-negative endocarditis, and endocarditis can be the only manifestation of the infection with T. whipplei. Although it is considered a rare disease, the true incidence of endocarditis due to T. whipplei is not clearly established. With the increasing use of molecular methods, it is likely that T. whipplei will be more frequently identified. Questions also remain about the genetic variability of T. whipplei strains, optimal diagnostic procedures and therapeutic options. In the present study, we provide clinical data on four new patients with documented endocarditis due to T. whipplei in the context of the available published literature. There was no clinical involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic analysis of the T. whipplei strains with DNA isolated from the excised heart valves revealed little to no genetic variability. In a selected case, we describe acridine orange staining for early detection of the disease, prompting early adaptation of the antibiotic therapy. We provide long-term follow-up data on the patients. In our hands, an initial 2-week course of intravenous antibiotics followed by cotrimoxazole for at least 1 year was a suitable treatment option for T. whipplei endocarditis.

### Update on endocarditis-associated glomerulonephritis [^1136Cvaw]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Mild mesangial hypercellularity was the third major finding after crescentic and proliferative GN, and it accounted for 5/49 cases (10%) (Table 3). All of these cases showed only mild focal and segmental mesangial hypercellularity without endocapillary proliferation or crescent formation (Figure 1).

No other forms of GN were identified. Specifically, no cases of membranoproliferative GN with or without cryoglobulinemic features or cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found.

Acute tubular injury was present in the majority of cases (86%). Histological red blood cell casts were noted in more than half of the cases (64%). Almost all cases (88%) had interstitial inflammation, which was most often focal (64%), but abundant interstitial neutrophils were present in only seven cases (14%). No examples of eosinophilic allergic interstitial nephritis were seen. No micro-abscesses or cortical necrosis were present. The degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis present was most often mild (43%) or absent (37%). Moderate chronic change was present in 16% of the cases, and severe chronic change was present in 4% of the cases. Similarly, arteriosclerosis and arteriolar hyalinosis were most often absent (39%) or mild (31%). Moderate vascular disease was seen in 27%, with severe vascular disease in only two cases (4%). No histologic evidence of extraglomerular vasculitis was seen.

Conclusion

Eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis is easily misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome or other heart disease with hypertrophy of endocardium or myocardium. When there is severe myocardial necrosis or thrombus dislodgement blocking the coronary arteries, symptoms and signs similar to acute myocardial infarction will appear. The clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe symptoms, with most patients primarily experiencing shortness of breath. The mitral valve is most commonly affected, with mitral regurgitation being the most common issue. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis is crucial, as early treatment can reverse cardiac damage. Many patients with persistent eosinophilia may experience sudden unexplained death, potentially associated with underlying myocarditis, leading to malignant arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest. Echocardiography plays a key role in the preliminary screening of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis. For all patients with persistent eosinophilia, close monitoring with serial echocardiography is necessary, even if they are asymptomatic, to prevent missed diagnoses of endocarditis and delays in treatment. As echocardiographers, attention should be paid to dynamic changes in myocardial thickness and cardiac function. CMR is the secondary gold standard in addition to endocardial or myocardial biopsy and is essential for further diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis or endocarditis, with characteristic myocardial or subendocardial delayed enhancement. PET-CT plays an irreplaceable role in the localization and characterization of myocarditis or endocarditis. For unknown causes of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis, the first-line treatment option is a combination of corticosteroids and anticoagulants, aimed at rapidly reducing eosinophil counts and preventing thrombus formation and embolic events, followed by etiological treatment. For severe complications, consider surgical interventions such as valve replacement, endocardial decortication, and heart transplantation. The prognosis of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis patients is related not only to the severity of the disease but also to its cause. Published case reports indicated that patients with earlier intervention or non-fibrotic progression had better outcomes, whereas progression to fibrosis is associated with a poorer prognosis.

Abstract

Late-stage eosinophilic myocarditis (or Löffler endocarditis) is known to occur in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy. Eosinophilic myocarditis is an acute life-threatening inflammatory disease of the heart that can be associated with cancer. We report a case of a 70-year-old White woman, previously treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission, admitted for acute dyspnea with a 1-year history of hypereosinophilia. 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed endocardial uptake consistent with MRI gadolinium enhancement, suggesting left ventricular wall inflammation.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — therapeutic principles emphasize that the primary goal of antibiotic treatment is to eradicate infection, including sterilizing vegetations, and that unique vegetation characteristics (high bacterial density, biofilm-associated slow growth, low metabolic activity) complicate therapy; therefore, prolonged, parenteral, bactericidal therapy is required for attempted infection cure.

### Large apical thrombus in a patient with persistent heart failure and hypereosinophilia: Löffler endocarditis [^113wFGtP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an uncommon leukoproliferative systemic disorder characterized by the overproduction of eosinophils and poor prognosis. A major source of morbidity and mortality of this syndrome is the associated cardiac involvement represented by endocardial thickening and mural thrombi. We report a 64-year-old woman with persistent symptoms of heart failure despite standard medical therapy. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular filling due to a large apical mass; an abnormal diastolic filling pattern was also noticed. Complete blood count revealed remarkable hypereosinophilia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an apical thrombus and intense linear enhancement of the endocardium, which were compatible with Löffler endocarditis. Medical therapy, including corticosteroids and anticoagulation, was initiated promptly. The symptoms improved as the peripheral hypereosinophilia resolved in 15 days. The patient was asymptomatic at the 1-year follow-up visit with complete regression of the apical thrombus and no evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report this case to draw attention to this particularly rare condition with poor prognosis since quick and accurate diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy may improve symptoms and survival.

Generally, patients who are responsive to steroids exhibit a favorable prognosis, while those unresponsive to steroids generally face a poor prognosis. However, a good prognosis is also observed in patients with LE caused by genetic mutations after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Studies show that patients with HES have a 10-year survival rate of less than 50%, while during the fibrotic stage of LE, the 1-year survival rate is 70–80%, the 2-year survival rate is 30–50%, and the 10-year survival rate is 30%.

### Churg-Strauss syndrome with critical endomyocardial fibrosis: 10 year survival after combined surgical and medical management [^111ZyApd]. Heart (2002). Low credibility.

A case is presented of the Churg-Strauss syndrome with hypereosinophilia and severe cardiac involvement, namely biventricular endomyocardial fibrosis and gross encroachment of the right ventricular cavity. The clinical picture was similar to Loeffler's syndrome and the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Combined aggressive surgical and medical management led to full recovery and survival at 10 years. The good long term outcome is attributed to strict control of peripheral eosinophil count by oral corticosteroids. This case illustrates the damaging effects of hypereosinophilia on the heart.

### Immunohistochemical differentiation of eosinophilic heart diseases using antibodies against eosinophil activation markers [^112FBjmQ]. Histopathology (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Eosinophilic heart syndromes are rare in Western countries and include endocarditis parietalis fibroplastica (EPF) and hypersensitivity myocarditis (HM). There are striking differences in natural history and morphological findings. Since diagnosis can be difficult when analysing small myocardial biopsies lacking the characteristic histological features, we studied a set of immunohistochemical markers in order to characterize the activation status of the infiltrating eosinophils to distinguish between these two entities.

Methods and Results

This study is based on the investigation of seven explanted hearts and one left ventricular specimen collected during implantation of a left ventricular assist device from a total of seven patients with HM. Also investigated were three right and three left ventricular specimens from five patients with EPF. We used antibodies (Ab) against EG1, and EG2, CD44, and CD69 which have been described as markers to distinguish between resting and activated eosinophils. The EG1 to EG2 ratio of eosinophils and the immunoreactivity against CD44 showed no differences between the two entities. However, eosinophils in the EPF were completely negative for CD69, whereas eosinophils reacted positively within the HM group.

Conclusion

The immunohistochemical investigation of eosinophilic heart diseases using antibodies against CD69 can be a useful tool to distinguish between hypersensitivity myocarditis and endocarditis parietalis fibroplastica.

### Culture-negative subacute bacterial endocarditis masquerades as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener's granulomatosis) involving both the kidney and lung [^111QoQwh]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

We reported an elderly male patient with culture-negative SBE associated with strongly positive c-ANCA/PR3. His clinical manifestation masqueraded as GPA with pulmonary nodules and glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy showed glomerulonephritis with a membranoproliferative pattern along with several crescents. Lung biopsy showed severe alveolar capillaritis resembling polyangiitis. We believe that this is the first such reported case of both lung and renal involvement confirmed by laboratory, imaging, and biopsy results. His glomerulonephritis, pulmonary lesions, and elevated c-ANCA resolved after a course of antibiotic therapy.

Proteinase-3/c-ANCA (PR3/C-ANCA) is highly associated with GPA, with a sensitivity and specificity of > 90%. There may be exclusive cases in which PR3/C-ANCA tests are positive in patients with SBE, as reported in our case. It has been suggested that the induction of ANCA in infectious diseases, more specifically in SBE, may occur through nonspecific B-cell activation or autoimmunization after the release of PR3 or MPO from neutrophils, and PR3/C-ANCA is the most common ANCA type. The details of the underlying mechanism remain unknown. Some clinical features of GPA and infective endocarditis overlap, including vegetations detectable by echocardiography, inflammatory signs, and renal involvement with constitutional symptoms. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract is one of the characteristic pathological features of GPA. Although valvular involvement has been described in sporadic case reports of GPA, granulomatous inflammation of the lung is not common in SBE in ANCA-positive patients. A total of 23 cases of ANCA-positive SBE have been described in the literature to date. Organ involvement in SBE patients is usually limited to the skin and kidneys. This is considered to be one of the differentiating features indicative of SBE rather than GPA. A few cases of lung involvement in SBE have been reported. Lung injury is usually diagnosed as lung abscessation based on the clinical manifestations and a positive response to antibiotic therapy. However, we must be aware that the lung may also be involved in SBE patients with positive ANCA, showing pathological changes indicative of alveolar capillaritis, as seen in our case. We cannot rule out the presence of granulomatous lung lesions in this case due to possible sampling error during the biopsy. However, we confirmed that no lung abscess was present; however, ANCA-associated vasculitis-like lung injury was identified, based on the CT scan results and lung pathology report.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^112HAhNf]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Modified Duke criteria — infective endocarditis (IE) diagnostic definitions specify major criteria of blood culture positivity with typical microorganisms from 2 separate blood cultures (Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovis, HACEK group, Staphylococcus aureus), or persistently positive blood cultures defined as at least 2 positive cultures of blood samples drawn > 12 h apart or all of 3 or a majority of > 4 separate cultures of blood (with first and last sample drawn at least 1 h apart). A single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or anti–phase 1 IgG antibody titer ≥ 1:800 also qualifies as a major criterion, and evidence of endocardial involvement is established by an echocardiogram positive for IE (transesophageal echocardiography [TEE] recommended for patients with prosthetic valves, rated at least possible IE by clinical criteria, or complicated IE [paravalvular abscess]; TEE as first test in other patients) with findings of oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation; abscess; or new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve or new valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of pre-existing murmur not sufficient). Minor criteria include predisposition (predisposing heart condition or injection drug use [IDU]), fever with temperature ≥ 38°C, vascular phenomena (major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesions), immunological phenomena (glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor), and microbiological evidence that does not meet a major criterion; echocardiographic minor criteria eliminated.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^116jweQn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis is a major complication of hypereosinophilic syndrome, characterized by eosinophilic infiltration leading to endocardial or myocardial necrosis, thrombosis formation, and fibrosis. For its rare morbility and various heterogenicity, eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis is prone to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Neither large case series nor clinical trials on this specific endocarditis or myocarditis have been reported.

Case Presentation

Four middle-aged male patients had increased eosinophilia and elevated levels of troponin or lactate dehydrogenase. Cardiac ultrasound showed ventricular wall thickening with or without reduced cardiac systolic function, apical thrombosis or restrictive cardiomyopathy.one of these patients showed myocardial enhancement by CMR, and one of these patients showed endocardial enhancement by CMR. The coronary angiography results were negative. Three patients were diagnosed with eosinophilic endocarditis, and one was diagnosed with eosinophilic myocarditis. After the application of steroid treatment, eosinophil levels decreased rapidly, myocardial thickening was relieved, and cardiac function was gradually recovered.

Conclusion

This case series embodies the high heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of the eosinophilic myocarditis or endocarditis, and the important role of multi-module imaging. Early detection and early treatment is crucial for the prognosis of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis.

### Bartonella and Coxiella infections presenting as systemic vasculitis: case series and review of literature [^112CD9hU]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Coxiella and Bartonella spp. display particular tropism for endothelial or endocardial tissues and an abnormal host response to infections with induced autoimmunity. We aimed, through a case series combined with a comprehensive literature review, to outline characteristics of Coxiella and Bartonella infections presenting as systemic vasculitis.

Methods

We retrospectively included cases of definite Coxiella and Bartonella infections presenting with vasculitis features and performed a comprehensive literature review.

Results

Six cases of Bartonella infections were added to 18 cases from literature review. Causative pathogens were mainly B. henselae. Bartonella infection mimicked ANCA-associated vasculitis in 83% with PR3-ANCA and presented as cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis in 8%. GN was present in 92%, and 88% had endocarditis. Complement fractions were low in 82% and rheumatoid factor positive in 85%. Kidney biopsies showed cell proliferation, mostly crescentic, with pauci-immune GN in 29%. Outcome was favourable, with the use of antibiotics alone in one-third. Five cases of Coxiella infections were added to 16 from literature review. Sixteen had small-vessel vasculitides, mainly cryoglobulinaemia vasculitis in 75%. One patient had polyarteritis nodosa-like vasculitis and four large-vessel vasculitis. Outcome was good except for one death. A highly sensitive next generation sequencing analysis on three Coxiella- and two Bartonella-related vasculitides biopsies did not find any bacterial DNA.

Conclusion

Coxiella and Bartonella are both able to induce vasculitis but display distinct vasculitis features. Bartonella mimics PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis in the setting of endocarditis, whereas Coxiella may induce vasculitis involving all vessel sizes.

### Radiologic manifestations of sarcoidosis in various organs [^111TzfhK]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder of unknown cause with a wide variety of clinical and radiologic manifestations. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of these manifestations supported by histologic findings. Systemic manifestations (eg, Löfgren syndrome, Heerfordt syndrome) are commonly seen at clinical examination. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is the most common radiologic finding-frequently with associated pulmonary infiltrates-and typically has a characteristic perivascular distribution at high-resolution chest computed tomography. Radiologic findings in the short tubular bones of the hands and feet and magnetic resonance imaging findings of nodular involvement of muscle are often sufficient to raise suspicion for sarcoidosis. In the liver, spleen, kidneys, and scrotum, coalescing granulomas form nodules whose imaging features may occasionally be nonspecific, although familiarity with the relevant clinical settings will be helpful in recognizing the presence of sarcoidosis. Radiologic recognition of cardiac and central nervous system involvement is also important because patients may be only mildly symptomatic. The clinical course and prognosis of sarcoidosis are highly variable, often correlating with the mode of onset. Familiarity with the clinical and radiologic features of sarcoidosis in various anatomic locations plays a crucial role in diagnosis and management.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^117EdgWu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis should include cardiac diseases with myocardial thickening or ventricular thrombosis, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA). All of them can show the characteristics of RCM when developing into the terminal stages. However, they differ in etiology, pathogenesis, laboratory tests, ECG, echocardiography, and CMR. For eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis or infiltrative cardiomyopathy such as CA, characterized by reduced QRS complex voltage due to interstitial space expansion, whereas storage cardiomyopathies show normal or elevated QRS complex voltage. The difference in ventricular wall thickness and surface ECG QRS voltage may help differentiate between CA and HCM. For patients with intracavitary thrombosis, speckle tracking imaging reveals a reduction in global longitudinal strain (GLS) in the affected areas, which is typically considered normal if GLS ≤ -20%. LVEF in the early period of of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis patients is often normal, decreasing as the disease progresses. If the endocardial boundaries of left ventricle by TTE are unclear, it is recommended to use acoustic enhancing agents for a more accurate assessment of left ventricular volume and LVEF in RCM patients. HCM is primarily caused by pathogenic mutations in genes encoding sarcomere-related proteins or is idiopathic, characterized by myocardial thickening, commonly involving the left ventricular wall. Other cardiovascular or systemic, or metabolic diseases causing ventricular wall thickening should be excluded. CA, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, is characterized by the deposition of insoluble amyloid proteins in the interstitial spaces of tissue cells. TTE of CA may also show left ventricular wall myocardial thickening, with myocardium appearing as ground-glass granular echoes (a pattern resembling frosted glass). Early-stage CA patients with normal LVEF may exhibit reduced longitudinal systolic function. This is characterized by decreased two-dimensional longitudinal strain in the basal and mid segments of the left ventricle, while the apical longitudinal strain is preserved — a phenomenon referred to as apical sparing. This characteristic can serve as a basis for differentiating CA from other RCM, although it is not the definitive diagnostic gold standard. Case 1 involves a patient with a history of asthma for over ten years, who exhibits significantly elevated total IgE and troponin levels, and negative CAG results, suggesting possible asthma-induced secondary eosinophilia associated with eosinophilic myocarditis. The patient of case 2 without significant medical history was repeatedly misdiagnosed by TTE. For the thickened left ventricular wall, it was misdiagnosed as HCM, for the myocardial strain results showed that the apical segment strain was lower than the middle segment and the basal segment strain, it was misdiagnosed as CA. Subsequent increases in EO count and cardiac biomarkers post-admission led to a diagnosis of LE (stage I). The patient of case 3 with a history of tuberculosis and malaria, his troponin and other myocardial injury markers was within normal ranges, but IgG4 was significantly elevated. Despite treatment with quinine, eosinophil levels remained high, suggesting potential ANCA-associated vasculitis with LE (stage III). The patient of case 4 in poor condition at admission, showed elevated EO counts and thickened left ventricular wall by TTE, along with acute cerebral infarction, considered to be undefined HE complicated by eosinophilic endocarditis.

### Eosinophilic endocarditis and strongyloides stercoralis [^111UYet9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman from El Salvador presented with 3 months of abdominal pain and diarrhea followed by 2 weeks of atypical chest pain and exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with eosinophilic endocarditis secondary to Strongyloides stercoralis infection. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed apical masses in the left and right ventricles and a thickened posterior mitral valve leaflet and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a left ventricular apical mass with diffuse subendocardial delayed enhancement consistent with endocardial fibrosis. In conclusion, eosinophilic endocarditis is a rare cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by endomyocardial fibrosis and apical thrombosis and fibrosis with frequent involvement of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.

### Regressive aortic valve and infundibular tumors during idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome [^114MZKed]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2005). Low credibility.

Fibroblastic endocarditis is a classic complication of prolonged hypereosinophilic syndrome, whatever the cause. In France, it is most frequently encountered in cases of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. It commonly involves the apex of the ventricles, with a clinical picture of restrictive cardiomyopathy of unfavorable prognosis, and the auriculoventricular valves. We report the case of a 77-year-old man in whom atypical cardiac involvement disclosed idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. In addition to the usual features of obliteration of the apex and restrictive cardiomyopathy, echocardiographic examination showed severe left ventricular dysfunction and intracardiac tumors, one of which was unusually localized to an aortic valve. Treatment, which comprised strict control of the eosinophilic process, standard treatment for cardiac failure, and anticoagulation therapy, produced rapid and long-lasting improvement of his clinical status and left systolic and diastolic ventricular function, and on echocardiography the intracardiac tumors had totally disappeared. The patient suddenly died of septic shock 16 months after first being seen.

RESULTS

Clinical features

The clinical characteristics of 49 patients undergoing a renal biopsy with documented IE are detailed in Table 1. Features of note include a male predominance (3.5:1) with a mean age at biopsy of 48 years. Two patients (4%) were children < 18 years, and 30% of patients were elderly (≥ 60 years of age). Acute renal failure was the most common presenting condition (79%), with hematuria present in almost all cases (97%), yet typical acute nephritic syndrome in only < 10% of cases. Conditions favoring endocarditis were noted in 29 patients including intravenous drug use (29%), prosthetic valves (18%), and prior valvular disease (12%). However, over 50% of patients did not have known prior cardiac disease. Associated comorbid conditions were noted in a minority of patients, the most common being hepatitis C infection (20%) and diabetes mellitus (18%) (Table 1).

Serologic studies

Serologic studies are summarized in Table 1. While 53% of the 32 patients tested for serum complement had reduced C3 (complement component 3) levels only a minority of patients (19%) in whom it was tested had reductions in C4, suggesting that most had activation of the alternative complement pathway. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) data was obtained in 43/49 patients (88%), although testing was not carried out in 14/43 patients. Of the 29/43 patients with ANCA serologies drawn, 21 were negative (72%) and 8 were positive (28%). ANCA specificities of these 8 patients include 3 pANCA (one with positive MPO), 3 cANCA (two with positive PR3), 1 positive ANCA of unspecified type, and 1 with dual-positive MPO and PR3. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was positive in 4/26 patients tested (15%). One patient with a positive ANA had history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although renal biopsy was without significant immune complex (IC) deposition. In the other three patients, the positive ANA was an isolated finding, with none having clinical evidence of SLE.

### Histiocytic neoplasms, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112zSYRi]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Erdheim-Chester disease - NCCN, more specifically with respect to tissue biopsy, NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that histopathologic features include foamy (xanthomatous) histiocytes, including Touton cells in a background of spindled cells and fibrosis. Recognize that reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils are also often present. Recognize that typical histologic findings vary by site. For example, in bone lesions, findings may be masked by significant fibrosis, including, in some cases, storiform fibrosis. In the CNS and lung, the lesional histiocytes are non-lipidized, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and lack the typical inflammatory infiltrate. In skin, the typical xanthomatous histiocytes are common but can be diffuse or interstitial and relatively subtle. In the retroperitoneum, findings are usually xanthomatous but sometimes extensively fibrotic, and can be associated with increased IgG4-positive plasma cells meeting criteria for IgG4-related disease. Finally, in cardiac tissues, diffuse infiltrates of xanthomatous histiocytes may be observed.

### An unusual case of recurrent loffler endomyocarditis of the aortic valve [^112vhaaa]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare systemic disease with an unexplained elevated eosinophil count. Loffler endomyocarditis is hypereosinophilic syndrome with endocardial fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The atrioventricular valves are frequently involved, causing valvular regurgitation. Previously, there has been one case report of combined aortic and mitral valve involvement with Loffler endomyocarditis that was treated with bivalvular replacement. We describe a previously healthy 50-year-old man diagnosed with Loffler endomyocarditis complicated by peripheral thromboembolism and severe aortic regurgitation due to valve fibrosis and fibrotic vegetation on the aortic valve. He underwent embolectomy and aortic valve replacement in addition to treatment for his hypereosinophilia. He later presented with cardiomyopathy with severe aortic insufficiency due to the destruction of the aortic valve prosthesis by sterile fibrinous vegetation. To our knowledge, this is the second case in the literature in which Loffler endomyocarditis involves the aortic valve and the first patient in whom only the aortic valve is involved.

Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis — clinical manifestations and diagnostic tools are summarized, noting that the diagnosis of valvular IE derives from a combination of patient‑reported symptoms, clinical and radiologic signs, and complications, and that cardiac conduction abnormalities occur in approximately 15%. IE is broadly classified into native valve endocarditis (NVE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), with pathogens identified by blood cultures or serologic tests and the most common causes in high‑income countries being Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, and enterococci. For imaging, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the mainstay with sensitivity (85–90%) and specificity (> 90%) for native valves, though these excellent test characteristics are diminished when assessing for prosthetic valve infection. The modified Duke criteria codify microbiologic, imaging, and clinical features into diagnostic categories that aid research, but they should not replace careful clinical judgment, and a key decision point is whether a patient should undergo surgical treatment with indications outlined in American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, and ESC guidelines; guiding principles for medical management include prolonged therapy with bactericidal antibiotics targeted toward the infecting pathogen.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^1166dqbk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis depends on a comprehensive assessment of the condition and an accurate etiological diagnosis. For cases with identified or suspected causes, initial treatment should target these specific causes. In cases of parasitic infections, antiparasitic agents are administered. Allergen avoidance is recommended for allergy-related LE. In cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)-related LE, treatment may include steroids or the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide. Imatinib may be used for the treatment of LE associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Imatinib can achieve complete hematologic and molecular remission within weeks to months, but cannot eliminate the FLP1L1-PDGFRA clone in most patients. Corticosteroids, which inhibit eosinophil degranulation, are proposed as a first-line treatment for LE. Consequently, early initiation of treatment in LE may potentially reverse the disease progression. For patients who do not respond well to steroids, treatment options may involve cytotoxic drugs (such as hydroxyurea, azathioprine) or immunomodulator tyrosine kinase inhibitor of eosinophils (such as imatinib), or anti-tumor target (such as merizumab). In these patients, interferon and hydroxyurea are second-line therapeutic agents. For patients unresponsive to both first-line and second-line treatments, high-dose imatinib is the treatment of choice. These treatment guidelines ensure a tailored approach based on individual patient response and specific disease etiology. For patients with ventricular thrombi, it is imperative to administer prompt thrombolysis to prevent thrombo-embolic events. For patients with LE myocardial fibrosis, some of them respond well to corticosteroid therapy. If medical treatment is ineffective, surgical endocardial decortication may be considered, which generally improves symptoms in most patients postoperatively. When valvular regurgitation is severe, valve replacement surgery may be indicated. Due to the risk of thrombotic complications from mechanical valve replacements, bioprosthetic valves are recommended as the preferred option. If all the above treatments are still ineffective, heart transplantation may be considered. Initial treatment should involve a medical regimen to reduce eosinophil counts, with surgical interventions as a secondary consideration. After corticosteroid therapy, the four patients of this article showed continuous decrease in EO levels. Subsequently, myocardial wall thickness and cardiac function gradually normalized. The diagnosis and treatment procedures of the 4 patients are shown in Table 1.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for hypereosinophilic syndromes with cardiac involvement includes the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, EGPA, early giant cell myocarditis, hypersensitivity reactions (often induced by medication, parasitic infestation and malignancy). An appropriate travel history and a thorough evaluation for parasitic (particularly helminthic) infestation may help to narrow the diagnostic options. The presence of coronary arteritis which may result in myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac arrest and pericarditis favour the diagnosis of EGPA over the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromeIn this case, infective endocarditis was excluded by negative blood cultures and absence of pathogens in the vegetations. Wegener's granulomatosis is usually ANCA positive and not characterised by eosinophilia and was thought to be an unlikely cause of the vegetations.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115Nh3Vc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

This patient manifested all the American College of Rheumatology criteria for EGPA including asthma, eosinophilia > 1500 cells/µL, polyneuropathy, unfixed pulmonary infiltrates not explained by other disease states, chronic sinusitis and the presence of tissue eosinophils. Cardiac involvement occurs in 50%–62% of patients with EGPA and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Previously described cardiac complications of EGPA include vasculitis of the epicardial coronary arteries, vasculitis of the small intramyocardial vasculature (arteries, capillaries, venules), granulomatous myocardial infiltration, eosinophilic myocarditis, myocardial fibrosis, right ventricular and LV endocardial fibrosis, right ventricular and/or LV thrombus formation, restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle dysfunction, acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular and intraventricular block, and sudden cardiac death. Higher peripheral blood eosinophil counts and the absence of ANCA positivity have been associated with higher risk of cardiac involvement in EGPA.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was discharged after 26 days of hospitalisation. He was treated with 70 mg of prednisone daily with a rapid taper during the hospitalisation. His discharge medication included antibiotics and prednisone 5 mg daily. He had been treated with 5 mg of prednisone daily chronically prior to admission for reactive airway disease. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery showed an increase in LV volume and a progressive decline in LV ejection fraction to 25% despite appropriate medical therapy for LV systolic dysfunction. The patient remained clinically stable until 10 months after valve replacement surgery when he developed progressive shortness of breath, pulmonary vascular congestion on chest X-ray, marked elevation of the plasma NT-proBNP level, hypotension and non-blanching erythematous macules on the back, anterior chest, shoulders, forearms, palms and soles (figure 4). A punch biopsy of one of these lesions showed extravasation of red blood cells in the superficial dermis, thrombus formation in the deep dermis surrounded by infiltration with numerous lymphocytes and eosinophils as well as multiple histiocytes with phagocytised material (figure 5). These findings were consistent with those described with EGPA. The patient developed progressive cardiogenic shock despite vasopressor therapy. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography, fluoroscopy and cardiac MRI showed normal appearance and function of the prosthetic valves. Cardiac MRI showed moderate LV dilatation with severe global LV hypokinesis (LV ejection fraction was 15%), mild right ventricular dilation with mildly reduced right ventricular systolic function and biatrial enlargement. Delayed gadolinium enhancement was not observed on cardiac MRI. There was no evidence of myocardial infarction, myocarditis or scar. There was no evidence of thrombus in the ventricular cavities or in the atrial appendages. There was a small echo-free pericardial effusion. The patient declined further interventions and succumbed shortly thereafter. The family declined an autopsy.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Pericardial response to injury — The pericardium responds to injury with exudation of fluid, fibrin, and inflammatory cells, and healing with organization may produce focal or diffuse obliteration of the pericardial cavity by adhesions between the visceral and parietal pericardium. Fibrous proliferation may involve one or both serosal components; chronic effusions may be associated with pericardial thickening; and loculated fluid accumulation may result in cardiac compression and a constrictive clinical picture. Calcific deposits may be focal or extensive and likely represent an end-stage reaction to injury. Histologically, excised pericardium in CP is generally nonspecific, typically ranging from organizing fibrous pericarditis to organized fibrocalcific pericarditis, and pericardial late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) shows an association with granulation tissue and active inflammation with increased fibroblastic proliferation and neovascularization.

Answers:

A. Lipocyte necrosis, septal sclerosis, and membranocystic change with overlying stasis changes in the dermis – Incorrect. These are the characteristic histopathological features of lipodermatosclerosis.
B. Large collagen bundles separated from one another by clear spaces filled with mucin without an increase in fibroblasts, resulting in dermal thickening – Incorrect. These are the characteristic histopathological features of scleredema.
C. Atypical cells dissecting between collagen bundles arranged in lines within the dermis with or without signet ring cells – Correct. Atypical cells dissecting between collagen bundles arranged in lines within the dermis, "Indian files" (Fig 2, white arrow), signet ring cells (Fig 2, insert black arrow), and tumor cells trying to form glandular structures are the characteristic histopathological features usually seen in metastatic breast cancer. Our patient was found to have lobular breast cancer with distant metastasis to the stomach, colon, and skin, which was one of the presenting manifestations leading to the detection of occult invasive breast cancer.
D. Cords, alveoli, and tubular structures consisting of uniform clear cells containing both lipid and glycogen with delicate and highly vascular stroma, resulting in conspicuous areas of hemorrhage – Incorrect. These are the characteristic histopathological features of metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney.

C. Dermal infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils
D. Spongiosis, acanthosis, and an eosinophilic infiltrate
E. Nonspecific histopathologic changes, sometimes with eosinophils
A. Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis with a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and neutrophils – Incorrect. This would be the histopathology expected in a biopsy of psoriasis.
B. Foci of orthokeratosis alternating with parakeratosis in vertical and horizontal directions – Incorrect. This is the histopathology of PRP.
C. Dermal infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils – Correct. Patients with PEO classically have dermal infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes (100%), histiocytes (87%), and eosinophils (82%). Neutrophils and giant cells are present in less than 5% of cases. In patients with mycosis fungoides manifesting as PEO, the infiltrate will have a high percentage of atypical lymphocytes, as seen in our patient.
D. Spongiosis, acanthosis, and an eosinophilic infiltrate – Incorrect. This histopathology is usually seen in either atopic or contact dermatitis. The presence of eosinophils is more commonly seen in atopic dermatitis.
E. Nonspecific histopathologic changes, sometimes with eosinophils – Incorrect. Drug eruptions will have nonspecific histopathology on biopsy. Eosinophils may be present in some cases. Biopsy will not help diagnose a drug eruption; however, it may help rule out other rashes that would have characteristic histopathologic findings.

### Histopathologic features of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection [^112rsZCr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

"Characteristic" histopathologic changes are considered one of the confirmatory laboratory methods for Buruli ulcer disease; however, the features are nonspecific and change as the lesion evolves from a nodule to an ulcer. In this study, definite histopathologic diagnosis of Buruli ulcer disease was only possible in 63% of cases because the presence of AFB bacilli was not always detectable even though necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and collagen were observed. An additional challenge in the histopathologic diagnosis of this disease is having adequate tissue samples. In our study, 14% of the specimens were considered inadequate because they lacked subcutaneous tissue, and among those with adequate material, 11% required additional tissue to demonstrate AFB. New techniques that can be applied to tissue are greatly needed to diagnose Buruli ulcer disease in all stages. Until these techniques are available, defining diagnostic histopathologic features of the disease will enable better understanding of clinicopathologic and pathogenetic characteristics of M. ulcerans infection.

For this study, we collected samples from more ulcers than nodules; however, a higher proportion of nodule specimens received a histopathologic diagnosis. The histopathologic differential diagnosis for ulcers included squamous cell carcinomas only; among the other clinical diagnoses that can be encountered in this stage are tropical phagedemic ulcer, actinomycosis, noma, leishmaniasis, yaws, and scrofuloderma. In our cohort, the histopathologic differential diagnosis for nodules was more extensive and included other infectious diseases (filaria and zygomycosis) as well as other noninfectious causes of skin nodules (keratin cyst).

In summary, our study shows the histopathologic features of patients with clinically suspected Buruli ulcer disease in a population with a high prevalence of the disease. We found that necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and dermal collagen was the best predictor of disease; however, the histopathologic changes are not unique, and diagnosis requires correlation with the clinical picture and other laboratory techniques.

### Endomyocardial fibrosis: recent advances and future therapeutic targets [^1158fbqy]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Endomyocardial fibrosis, first described > 75 years ago, is a cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy with an unclear aetiopathogenesis that is most commonly found in children and adolescents from tropical regions of Africa, Asia and South America. The epidemiological trends of this cardiomyopathy are difficult to ascertain. The characteristic hallmark of endomyocardial fibrosis is ventricular fibrosis that causes diastolic dysfunction and atrioventricular regurgitation. Although advances in medical treatment for heart failure and more tailored surgical techniques to treat the condition have increased survival, the outcomes in affected patients remain poor. A major focus of research is the identification of biomarkers of preclinical disease and new therapeutic targets. Collaborative multidisciplinary research and cross-learning from other fibrotic conditions should impart knowledge and help to improve the survival rates and the quality of life of patients with endomyocardial fibrosis.

### Current features of infective endocarditis in elderly patients… [^116aSyGz]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results Elderly patients reported more frequently a hospitalization or an invasive procedure before IE onset. Diabetes mellitus and genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancer were the major predisposing conditions. Blood culture yield was higher among elderly patients with IE. The leading causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus, with a higher rate of methicillin resistance. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were also significantly more prevalent. The clinical presentation of elderly patients with IE was remarkable for lower rates of embolism, immune-mediated phenomena, or septic complications. At both echocardiography and surgery, fewer vegetations and more abscesses were found, and the gain in the diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography was significantly larger. Conclusions In this large prospective study, increasing age emerges as a major determinant of the clinical characteristics of IE.

Lower rates of surgical treatment and high mortality are the most prominent features of elderly patients with IE. Efforts should be made to prevent health care–associated acquisition and improve outcomes in this major subgroup of patients with IE. Clinical evidence of IE was found less often in elderly patients than in younger patients: in particular, vascular and immune-mediated phenomena, such as embolic events, splenomegaly, Osler nodes, Roth spots, Janeway lesions, and conjunctival hemorrhages, were all observed less commonly among elderly IE patients. Mitral regurgitation was the predominant form of valve dysfunction in elderly IE patients, whereas aortic and tricuspid disease prevailed in younger patients.

Significantly more mitral and less aortic and tricuspid vegetations were found in the elderly patients compared with the younger patients. These data further supported the hypothesis that age per se is a determinant of the different or atypical presentation of elderly IE patients. Therefore, the higher complexity of the frail condition, which predisposes patients to a reduced use of surgery, represents the typical feature of IE in elderly patients. This condition could be intrinsically more aggressive because of the reduced ability to dominate bloodstream infection, as shown by higher rates of positive blood cultures. The prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and concomitant chronic illnesses may also play a role.

### Clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of infective endocarditis in the 21st century… [^113U7dtB]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Recent health care exposure was found in one-quarter of patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. The mitral and aortic valves were infected most commonly. The following complications were common: stroke, embolization other than stroke, heart failure, and intracardiac abscess. Predisposing conditions were common in patients with definite IE. Although intravenous drug use remains important, the most common predisposing conditions were related to valvular heart disease. Degenerative valve disease was the most frequent native valve predisposing factor.

The following variables were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death: involvement of a prosthetic valve, increasing age, radiographic pulmonary edema, S aureus infection, coagulase-negative staphylococcus infection, presence of mitral valve vegetation, and paravalvular complications. Variables independently associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital death were elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, infection with a viridans group streptococcus, and surgery during the current IE episode. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, Osler nodes were recorded in 11% to 23% and splenomegaly in 20% to 44% of patients with IE. 9, 10, 25, 26 In our study, predisposing valvular conditions were common but were primarily owing to the presence of degenerative valve disease or a prosthetic valve rather than rheumatic heart disease. Another observation arising from this investigation is the shift in the microbiologic characteristics of IE.

Staphylococcus aureus is now the most common cause of IE in much of the world, confirming several recent investigations5, 16, 31 and the earlier findings of the ICE-PCS. 23 This shift is due in part to the global presence of risk factors for S aureus–associated IE. Given the growing antimicrobial resistance of S aureus, 32 including to vancomycin, 33–35 the importance of this pathogen as a potentially lethal infection is cause for concern.
