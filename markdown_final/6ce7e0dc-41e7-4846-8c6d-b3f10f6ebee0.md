## Question

Methods to assess hypothalamic function

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about methods to assess hypothalamic function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and which hypothalamic domains might be affected. Then, I should outline basal morning screening to triage obvious deficits. Next, I will review axis-specific dynamic tests with safety, thresholds, and timing, especially for the HPA axis. After that, I should consider HPT, HPG, GH, and AVP axes with when to image. Finally, I need to highlight pitfalls, assay dependence, special populations, and how findings map to management, while self-checking each step against guidelines and primary data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing: hypothalamic dysfunction is heterogeneous and not captured by a single test, so I must anchor on symptoms, risk factors, and which axes to interrogate, while distinguishing organic etiologies from functional states like FHA; red flags such as severe headache, visual change, or signs of pituitary hormone excess/deficiency should lower my threshold for MRI with pituitary cuts and contrast, and prior cranial radiation or sellar surgery strongly ups risk for multi-axial involvement, so I need to ask explicitly about tumor history, radiation dose, TBI, and exogenous glucocorticoids, and remember that hypothalamic obesity may coexist with normal pituitary labs, so adequate pituitary function does not exclude hypothalamic disease, particularly in pediatric tumor survivors and severe obesity contexts [^115MZ2hT] [^113Ykh6h] [^117NxFdf] [^116GER52] [^111F6chM].

> Wait, let me verify the initial lab screen because pulsatility and stress can confound interpretation; I should obtain an early morning panel by 8 AM including serum cortisol with or without ACTH, TSH and free T4, LH and FSH with estradiol or testosterone, prolactin, and IGF-1 as a screen for GH axis, while also collecting pregnancy testing when relevant and a basic metabolic, hematologic, and inflammatory profile since FHA and systemic illness can mimic or mask hypothalamic pathology; I need to remember that single hormone levels may overlap normal and abnormal and dynamic testing is often required when screening is borderline [^111nwjog] [^113ADgBo] [^112qNmQW] [^111wNVyU] [^111DwfDT] [^114mcvwz].

> I will now examine the HPA axis because it is the most safety-critical; a morning cortisol above about 400 nmol/L makes clinically significant ACTH deficiency extremely unlikely, whereas low or equivocal values should trigger dynamic testing, but hold on, I should verify timing after pituitary surgery since adrenal responsiveness to exogenous ACTH takes weeks to recover, and thresholds are assay dependent so local cutoffs matter [^112qNmQW] [^113ADgBo] [^111jyfek].

> Next, I should review the standard-dose 250 μg cosyntropin test performed at least 4 weeks after pituitary surgery; a 30-minute cortisol above about 650 nmol/L indicates an adequate axis, below about 350 nmol/L indicates ACTH deficiency, and intermediate responses require further evaluation, but I need to double-check that these thresholds hinge on the cortisol assay used locally to avoid misclassification [^113AgdsW] [^111jyfek].

> Let me think about immediate postoperative prediction because it may change acute management; Immediate Post-Operative Prediction (after transsphenoidal surgery): Day-of-s — wait, I started to truncate; I should correct that to day-of-surgery cortisol where values at or above 15 μg/dL strongly predict a normal HPA axis at 4–6 weeks, which can help avoid unnecessary glucocorticoid coverage while still planning formal testing later, though I should reconcile this with early morning cortisol algorithms recommending dynamic tests if values are low or borderline in the first days post-op [^111fe1wk] [^112qNmQW].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of the insulin tolerance test; the ITT remains the gold standard to interrogate central HPA function and concomitantly GH reserve, but it requires supervised hypoglycemia and has contraindications, and importantly the usual 90-minute endpoint can miss one in six cortisol peaks, so extending sampling to 120 minutes improves sensitivity; older adults can undergo ITT safely in experienced centers, but in TBI or seizure-prone patients I should avoid it and consider alternatives [^115NikAV] [^111MXmbb].

> I need to ensure alternatives are understood; the overnight metyrapone test is useful when ITT is contraindicated, but in the first postoperative week it performs no better than an AM cortisol for predicting long-term glucocorticoid need, whereas repeating it at week 6 captures recovery in a substantial subset, so sequencing and timing matter for accuracy [^11796HaJ] [^113ADgBo].

> Let me now consider the HPT axis; central hypothyroidism is best evaluated with free T4 in context of TSH that may be low or inappropriately normal, and while TRH testing exists as an adjunct, its necessity is debated and modern practice relies mainly on basal labs with TRH reserved for select combined testing contexts, and in survivors exposed to 30 Gy or more to the HP axis, annual lifelong screening for TSH deficiency is recommended [^114mcvwz] [^11784cs6] [^111UnsyS] [^113Ykh6h].

> I should review the HPG axis carefully; in females and males, morning LH and FSH with estradiol or testosterone guide the locus of hypogonadism, while AMH and inhibin B can refine gonadal reserve or testicular function, and in adolescents I must distinguish functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, a diagnosis of exclusion driven by energy deficit, stress, or exercise, from organic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, considering a progestin challenge after excluding pregnancy and pursuing MRI when FHA patients have red flags such as severe headaches, visual changes, or laboratory evidence of pituitary dysfunction [^111wNVyU] [^114mcvwz] [^1161NViZ] [^1173WSRx] [^115MZ2hT].

> But wait, what about dynamic testing across puberty; in adolescent males, a GnRH stimulation test alongside testicular volume and inhibin B can help differentiate congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from constitutional delay, yet I should confirm that these results are interpreted in full clinical context because thresholds vary and no test is perfect in isolation [^114mcvwz].

> Next, I should review the GH axis; a low IGF-1 is suggestive but insufficient on its own in many settings, and dynamic stimulation is generally required unless there are multiple other pituitary hormone deficits with very low IGF-1 in the context of structural HP disease, in which case adult guidelines allow a clinical diagnosis without provocative testing, while after TBI I should avoid ITT due to seizure risk and consider GHRH plus arginine or other safer stimuli when available [^111MXmbb] [^117JbjT4] [^113AsZ6c].

> I will now examine water balance because AVP deficiency is a key hypothalamic manifestation; when polyuria and polydipsia are present, a carefully supervised water deprivation test or hypertonic saline with copeptin-guided approaches can diagnose central diabetes insipidus, and I should note that emerging data suggest oxytocin deficiency may co-occur with AVP deficiency yet lacks validated clinical testing, so I must remain cautious and symptom-guided while evidence evolves [^114mcvwz] [^113j5BCA].

> Let me consider imaging next; when the presentation suggests an organic cause or FHA red flags are present, MRI with pituitary protocol is indicated to evaluate hypothalamic and sellar structures, whereas advanced resting-state fMRI studies mapping hypothalamic nuclei connectivity to stress are mechanistically informative but not diagnostic tools in routine clinical practice at this time, so I should not over-interpret such data for individual patients [^115MZ2hT] [^114oAHWN] [^111GVErW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, obesity adds complexity; hypothalamic inflammation can precede weight gain and confound endocrine interpretation, hypothalamic obesity can occur even when anterior pituitary testing is "normal", and in pediatric brain tumor cohorts BMI at diagnosis may reflect lifestyle or genetic factors more than pituitary deficiency, so I should not rely on BMI alone to infer hypothalamic failure and must individualize assessment across domains such as appetite, energy balance, sleep, and autonomic symptoms [^115mKZRx] [^117NxFdf] [^115Bf6kg].

> Hold on, I should verify interpretive pitfalls; dynamic tests reflect hormone reserve under stress rather than day-to-day sufficiency, cutoffs are assay and site specific, borderline responses often do not mandate daily glucocorticoid replacement but do warrant sick day coverage during intercurrent illness, and all results must be integrated with the clinical context to avoid both over- and under-treatment [^111jyfek] [^113ADgBo] [^114ys3hi].

> I need to ensure longitudinal strategy is clear; after pituitary surgery or apoplexy, reassessing the HPA axis is essential because function can recover, timing morning cortisol appropriately around hydrocortisone dosing is important, and in radiation-exposed survivors continued annual screening helps capture late-onset central hypothyroidism and other deficits [^112qNmQW] [^113Ykh6h].

> Let me now map findings to management; when FHA is confirmed, first-line therapy corrects energy imbalance with nutritional rehabilitation and exercise reduction, and cognitive behavioral therapy can support recovery, with patient education about irregular menses during recovery and fertility implications, while for organic deficits standard replacement of hydrocortisone, levothyroxine, sex steroids, and GH is guided by established endocrine protocols and safety monitoring [^114461fX] [^115KQrQs] [^116mUo51] [^114mcvwz].

Hypothalamic function testing evaluates the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axes using a combination of **dynamic hormone tests** [^111nwjog] and **MRI with a pituitary protocol** to detect structural lesions [^115MZ2hT]. The **insulin tolerance test (ITT)** is the gold standard for assessing both the HPA and GH axes [^115NikAV] [^113ADgBo], while the short Synacthen test (SST) and metyrapone test are alternatives for HPA axis evaluation [^113AgdsW] [^11796HaJ]. GnRH stimulation tests assess the HPG axis, and water deprivation tests evaluate AVP function [^114mcvwz]. Basal hormone measurements (TSH, free T4, prolactin, IGF-1, LH/FSH, estradiol/testosterone, cortisol, ACTH) are essential and must be interpreted in clinical context, considering assay variability and patient factors [^111nwjog] [^111wNVyU] [^113AsZ6c].

---

## Clinical indications for hypothalamic function testing

Hypothalamic function testing is indicated in patients who present with **features of hypothalamic dysfunction**, including [^117NxFdf] [^111F6chM]:

- **Growth disorders**: Short stature, delayed or precocious puberty [^112NmQKW].

- **Metabolic disturbances**: Obesity, diabetes insipidus, hyperphagia [^115mKZRx].

- **Reproductive dysfunction**: Amenorrhea, infertility, hypogonadism [^112tfS8z].

- **Sleep disturbances**: Narcolepsy, insomnia [^116qbiuN].

- **Thermoregulatory dysfunction**: Hyperthermia, hypothermia.

- **Behavioral and cognitive changes**: Mood disorders, cognitive impairment [^1128rGw8].

---

## Basal hormone measurements

Basal hormone measurements provide an **initial screen** for hypothalamic dysfunction [^111nwjog]:

| **Hormone** | **Axis** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| - TSH <br/> - Free T4 | HPT axis | Central hypothyroidism [^113Ykh6h] |
| Prolactin | HPL axis | - Hyperprolactinemia <br/> - Pituitary adenomas |
| IGF-1 | GH axis | Growth hormone deficiency [^117JbjT4] |
| - LH <br/> - FSH <br/> - Estradiol/testosterone | HPG axis | - Hypogonadism <br/> - Delayed puberty [^112tfS8z] |
| - Cortisol <br/> - ACTH | HPA axis | Central adrenal insufficiency [^113AsZ6c] |

## Dynamic hormone stimulation tests

Dynamic tests assess the functional integrity of the **hypothalamic-pituitary axes** [^111nwjog]:

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis

- **Insulin tolerance test (ITT)**: Gold standard for HPA axis assessment; induces hypoglycemia to stimulate ACTH and cortisol release [^113ADgBo] [^115NikAV].

- **Short Synacthen test (SST)**: Alternative to ITT; evaluates adrenal responsiveness to ACTH stimulation [^113AgdsW] [^111jyfek].

- **Metyrapone test**: Assesses hypothalamic-pituitary reserve by inhibiting cortisol synthesis, stimulating ACTH release [^11796HaJ] [^114mzRCL].

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis

The **GnRH stimulation test** evaluates the LH and FSH response to GnRH administration, helping differentiate hypothalamic from pituitary dysfunction [^114mcvwz]. The **Kisspeptin stimulation test** is an emerging tool for GnRH deficiency, particularly in adolescents with delayed puberty [^112NmQKW].

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-growth hormone (GH) axis

The **Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulation test** assesses GH secretory capacity; the **Arginine stimulation test** is an alternative to the ITT for GH axis evaluation [^117JbjT4] [^111MXmbb].

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis

The **Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test** evaluates the TSH response to differentiate primary, secondary, and tertiary hypothyroidism [^111UnsyS] [^11784cs6].

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-prolactin (HPL) axis

The **TRH stimulation test** assesses the prolactin response and is useful in the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia.

---

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-vasopressin (AVP) axis

The **Water deprivation test** evaluates AVP secretion and renal response, helping diagnose central diabetes insipidus [^114mcvwz].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are essential for identifying **structural abnormalities**. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the **gold standard** for visualizing the hypothalamic-pituitary region and detecting tumors, lesions, or structural anomalies [^115MZ2hT]. Functional MRI (fMRI) assesses **hypothalamic activity and connectivity** and is useful in research settings [^114oAHWN].

---

## Emerging and experimental techniques

Emerging techniques offer promising avenues for hypothalamic function assessment. High-resolution fMRI enables detailed mapping of **hypothalamic nuclei and functional connectivity** [^111GVErW] [^114S8Xzy]. Positron emission tomography (PET) investigates hypothalamic metabolism and neurotransmitter activity, and optogenetics and chemogenetics are experimental methods that manipulate hypothalamic neurons to elucidate functional circuits.

---

## Limitations and challenges

Several limitations and challenges exist in hypothalamic function testing. Hormonal variability from **pulsatile secretion and circadian rhythms** complicates interpretation [^111nwjog] [^116qbiuN], and assay variability across laboratories further affects results [^113AsZ6c]. Patient factors — including age, sex, stress, and medications — influence hormone levels. Safety concerns also persist, as dynamic tests like the ITT carry risks and require careful monitoring [^115NikAV] [^111MXmbb].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal test results

Abnormal hypothalamic function test results have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Hormonal deficiencies**: Require hormone replacement therapy (e.g. cortisol, thyroid hormone, sex steroids, growth hormone) [^115uR85B].

- **Metabolic disturbances**: Necessitate dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions [^116GER52].

- **Reproductive dysfunction**: May require fertility treatments or hormone therapy.

- **Behavioral and cognitive changes**: Indicate need for psychological support and cognitive rehabilitation.

---

Hypothalamic function testing involves basal hormone measurements, dynamic stimulation tests, and imaging studies to assess the **integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axes**. Dynamic tests such as the ITT, SST, and GnRH stimulation are **essential**, while MRI identifies structural abnormalities. Emerging techniques such as high-resolution fMRI and PET offer promising insights, but hormonal variability, assay differences, and patient factors remain challenges.

### Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH [^111UnsyS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The interpretation of TSH response to TRH requires an understanding of thyroid-pituitary-hypothalamic physiology and the clinical status of an individual patient. Because TSH test results may vary with the laboratory, the physician should be familiar with the TSH assay method used and the normal range for the laboratory performing the assay. TSH response 30 minutes after TRH administration in normal subjects and in patients with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are presented in Figure 2. The diagnoses were established prior to the administration of TRH based on the clinical history, physical examination, and the results of other thyroid and/or pituitary function tests.

Among normal euthyroid subjects, women and children were found to have higher levels of TSH at 30 minutes than men. In patients with hyperthyroidism or primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, no significant differences in TSH levels by age or sex were found.

- **Normal**: Baseline TSH levels of less than 10 microunits/mL (μU/mL) were observed in 97% of euthyroid normal subjects tested. Thirty minutes after TRH, the serum TSH increased by 2.0 mμU/mL or more in 95% of euthyroid subjects.

- **Hyperthyroidism**: All hyperthyroid patients tested had baseline TSH levels of less than 10 μU/mL and a rise of less than 2 μU/mL 30 minutes after TRH.

### Clinical insights into the safety and utility of the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the assessment of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis [^115NikAV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is regarded as the gold standard for assessing growth hormone (GH) and cortisol production in pituitary disease. However, there are uncertainties surrounding its safety in older individuals, the optimal duration of the test, and its efficacy in insulin-resistant states. Whether basal cortisol concentration reliably predicts an adequate adrenal response to hypoglycemia remains uncertain.

We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective examination of 197 consecutive patients with pituitary disease who underwent the ITT over 18 months. The patients had a mean age of 41.8 years (± 16.4), ranging from 13 to 76 years. The standard intravenous insulin dose administered was 0.15 units per kilogram of body weight. Patients diagnosed with acromegaly or type 2 diabetes received 0.2 units per kilogram. Those with basal cortisol concentrations ≥ 500 nmol/L underwent further evaluation. Of the 18 patients aged 65 years or older, a receiver operating characteristics curve identified a basal cortisol level of ≥ 393 nmol/L as predictive of a normal peak cortisol response to hypoglycemia.

In conclusion, in specialized units, the ITT is considered safe even for elderly patients and those with hypocortisolism. However, the standard 90-minute cut-off for the ITT can miss one in six peak cortisol responses.

Assessment of the HP axis

The diagnosis of hypopituitarism can be challenging, particularly in the neonatal period and in the peripubertal years. Patients may be started on hormone treatment inappropriately; this was certainly the issue in case 1, when the patient was started on hydrocortisone and testosterone unnecessarily.

Basal pituitary hormone screening performed early in the morning helps identify hypopituitarism. In some cases, dynamic testing is not needed; for instance, for the diagnosis of TSH/TRH deficiency, although this can be performed in the context of a combined dynamic stimulation of the HP axis in patients with suspected multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The necessity for a TRH test is debatable.

- **Stimulation tests**: Necessary for the diagnosis of GHD and usually for ACTH deficiency. Similarly, a water deprivation test might be needed to diagnose CDI.

- **Gonadotrophin deficiency**: A GnRH stimulation test, with GnRH-induced maximal LH cutoff of 4.3 IU/L, together with a testicular volume cutoff of 1.1 mL and basal inhibin B concentration < 35 pg/mL, have been proposed as the most effective discriminators of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) from delayed puberty in adolescent males. However, this test carries its own limitations and must be interpreted in the clinical context.

For females, LH, FSH, and estradiol, with additional anti-Mullerian hormone and antral follicle count if a patient has had gonadotoxic treatment, may be of more use. In boys, a combination of GnRH and 3 days and 19 days human chorionic gonadotropin administration has been suggested as a diagnostic approach.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115MZ2hT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, specifically in evaluating the etiology of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, the ES 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a brain MRI, with pituitary cuts and contrast, in adolescent and adult patients who are presumed to have functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and present with any of the following:

- **Severe or persistent headaches**: This symptom indicates the need for further investigation.

- **Persistent vomiting (not self-induced)**: Unexplained vomiting requires careful consideration.

- **Change in vision, thirst, or urination not attributable to other causes**: These symptoms suggest the need for a detailed examination.

- **Lateralizing neurologic signs**: The presence of these signs warrants the use of MRI for a clearer diagnosis.

- **Clinical signs and/or laboratory results suggesting pituitary hormone deficiency or excess**: Abnormal findings should prompt imaging to exclude structural abnormalities.

### Interpretation of reproductive hormones before, during and after the pubertal transition-identifying health and disordered puberty [^112NmQKW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

To assess GnRH production by the hypothalamus, LH measurement in response to stimulation with kisspeptin has been proposed as a useful test to identify individuals with GnRH deficiency and thus permanent hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Kisspeptin stimulates GnRH pulsatility and promotes LH, and to a lesser extent, FSH secretion. Inactivating mutations of KISS and KISS1R genes have demonstrated the importance of the KISS regulatory system in the regulation of human puberty and fertility, while activating KISS1R mutations have resulted in precocious puberty. A recent clinical study found that maximal LH rise after kisspeptin administration was more accurate for diagnosing men with GnRH deficiency than GnRH stimulation testing.

In a parallel study conducted with adolescents experiencing pubertal delay (3 females and 13 males), peak LH post kisspeptin stimulation was demonstrated to be superior to GnRH stimulation testing in predicting the capacity to progress through puberty. All eight study participants with a maximum LH response to kisspeptin of ≤ 0.4 IU/L reached age 18 years without developing physical signs of puberty, thus confirming the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. While further research is required to delineate the parameters for using kisspeptin in clinical paediatric practice, this is a promising area for the biochemical diagnosis of GnRH deficiency in adolescence.

### Low- and standard-dose corticotropin and insulin hypoglycemia testing in the assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function after pituitary surgery [^113AgdsW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

The optimal means of assessing the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after pituitary surgery remains controversial. We compared low-dose (1 μg IV) and standard-dose (250 μg IM) corticotropin tests performed 1 and 4–6 weeks after pituitary surgery with an insulin hypoglycemia test performed at 4–6 weeks.

Forty-one patients (21 male and 20 female; median age, 52 years; range, 23–73 years) who had undergone pituitary surgery were studied (Cushing's disease excluded). Twenty-two of the 41 patients had normal cortisol responses to all tests both at 1 and 4–6 weeks after surgery. Eight patients had subnormal cortisol responses to all tests. Of the 11 patients with discrepant results, seven had subnormal responses only after the low-dose corticotropin test; the remaining four patients had borderline responses to one or more tests.

At 4–6 weeks after surgery, subjects with a 30-minute serum cortisol after standard-dose corticotropin of less than 350 nmol/liter (12.7 μg/dl) consistently had a subnormal response to hypoglycemia, and those with a serum cortisol greater than 650 nmol/liter (23.6 μg/dl) had a normal response to hypoglycemia. Definitive testing of the HPA axis using the standard-dose corticotropin test can be carried out provided it is performed at least 4 weeks after pituitary surgery. A 30-minute cortisol level greater than 650 nmol/liter (23.6 μg/dl) indicates adequacy of the HPA axis, and a level of less than 350 nmol/liter (12.7 μg/dl) indicates ACTH deficiency; no further testing is then required. An intermediate level of 350–650 nmol/liter suggests further investigation may be necessary.

### The many different clinical faces of acquired hypothalamic dysfunction: A retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands [^117NxFdf]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, acquired hypothalamic dysfunction is prevalent in children both before and after (supra)sellar tumor treatment, and it has many different clinical presentations. Individualized assessment of the various domains of hypothalamic dysfunction is essential for accurate diagnostics and will enable personalized management strategies. Hypothalamic dysfunction may result in obesity, but it can also occur in the absence of obesity. In cases where a child presents with overweight or obesity, adequate pituitary function does not rule out hypothalamic dysfunction as the underlying cause. The lessons from this cohort study are not only significant for brain tumor survivors but also for children with other forms of hypothalamic dysfunction, such as genetic causes. Additionally, the insights from our cohort will benefit children presenting with weight gain or obesity where hypothalamic dysfunction as an underlying etiology must be excluded. Future studies should focus on the prospective assessment of the HS score to enhance our ability to fully understand the progression of hypothalamic dysfunction.

### The influence of sleep on human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity: A systematic review [^116qbiuN]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Inadequate sleep is highly prevalent and known to decline both physical and mental health. Literature suggests that altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis might underlie this association. This assumption is mainly based on changes in basal neuroendocrine activity, and it is of equal importance to elucidate whether sleep may also influence HPA stress responsiveness.

The present review provides a complete outline of recent human studies that have investigated how different aspects of sleep influence cortisol reactivity to laboratory stress. From the available data, it can be concluded that both objective and subjective decrements in sleep quality potentiate the stress reactivity of the HPA axis. On the contrary, normal variations in sleep duration do not seem to influence cortisol stress responsiveness, whereas excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with a blunting of the cortisol response. Given its well-established health consequences, sensitization of the HPA axis might be a crucial component linking inadequate sleep to stress-related pathology.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^111GVErW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The hypothalamus is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which activates stress responses through the release of cortisol. It is a small but heterogeneous structure comprising multiple nuclei. In vivo human neuroimaging has rarely succeeded in recording signals from individual hypothalamus nuclei. Here, we use human resting-state fMRI (n = 498) with high spatial resolution to examine relationships between the functional connectivity of specific hypothalamic nuclei and a dimensional marker of prolonged stress.

First, we demonstrate that we can parcellate the human hypothalamus into seven nuclei in vivo. Using the functional connectivity between these nuclei and other subcortical structures, including the amygdala, we significantly predict stress scores out-of-sample. Predictions use 0.0015% of all possible brain edges, are specific to stress, and improve when using nucleus-specific compared to whole-hypothalamus connectivity.

Thus, stress relates to connectivity changes in precise and functionally meaningful subcortical networks, which may be exploited in future studies using interventions in stress disorders.

### Comment on: Teeuwisse et al. Short-term caloric restriction normalizes hypothalamic neuronal responsiveness to glucose ingestion in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113xH8XZ]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The functional magnetic resonance imaging study by Teeuwisse et al. investigated the effect of caloric restriction on glucose responsiveness of the hypothalamus in patients with type 2 diabetes. In these patients, an oral glucose test does not decrease hypothalamic activity, a reaction observed in healthy persons. The authors showed that a 4-day very-low-calorie diet (450 kcal/day) was sufficient to normalize the physiological hypothalamic response.

On the basis of animal and human findings, Teeuwisse et al. discussed very comprehensively the possible underlying mechanisms of the hypothalamic response to glucose ingestion, such as glucose sensing in the hypothalamus. Although increasing plasma glucose did not significantly correlate with the hypothalamic activity in their study, we identified such a correlation in a recent study 30 min after comparable glucose ingestion in healthy humans, presumably because we studied more than twice the number of participants. We therefore propose that glucose could be one factor to modulate hypothalamic activity in humans.

- **Potential mechanisms**: Another possible factor discussed by Teeuwisse et al. is the influence of the hormone insulin. Neither in the study by Teeuwisse et al. nor in our recent study did increasing insulin concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test significantly correlate with hypothalamic activity. However, in a separate study with intranasal insulin delivery possibly resulting in higher cerebral insulin concentrations, we showed insulin to reduce hypothalamic activity in humans.

Of interest, this insulin response in the hypothalamus prompts further investigation.

### Body mass index at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor; a reflection of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction or lifestyle [^115Bf6kg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Childhood brain tumor survivors (CBTS) are at risk of becoming overweight, which has been shown to be associated with hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) dysfunction during follow-up. Body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis is related to BMI at follow-up. It is uncertain, however, whether aberrant BMI at brain tumor diagnosis reflects early hypothalamic dysfunction or rather reflects genetic and sociodemographic characteristics. We aimed to examine whether BMI at childhood brain tumor diagnosis is associated with HP dysfunction at diagnosis or its development during follow-up.

- **Methods**: The association of BMI at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor to HP dysfunction at diagnosis or during follow-up was examined in a Dutch cohort of 685 CBTS, excluding children with craniopharyngioma or a pituitary tumor. Individual patient data were retrospectively extracted from patient charts.

- **Results**: Of 685 CTBS, 4.7% were underweight, 14.2% were overweight, and 3.8% were obese at diagnosis. Being overweight or obese at diagnosis was not associated with anterior pituitary deficiency or diabetes insipidus at diagnosis or during follow-up. In children with suprasellar tumors, being obese at diagnosis was associated with central precocious puberty.

- **Conclusion**: Overweight or obesity at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor seems not to be associated with pituitary deficiencies. These results suggest that genetics and lifestyle may be more important etiologic factors for higher BMI at diagnosis in these children than hypothalamic dysfunction.

### Prospective evaluation of a week one overnight metyrapone test with subsequent dynamic assessments of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function after pituitary surgery [^11796HaJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

To determine whether an overnight metyrapone test (OMT) within the first week post-pituitary surgery can definitively assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis compared with subsequent dynamic tests and glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months, a prospective study was conducted.

The study measured morning cortisol levels on days 3 and 4 post-operatively, OMT on days 5–7 and week 6, a week 6 250 μg short Synacthen test (SST), and a week 7 insulin tolerance test (ITT). Forty participants who underwent pituitary surgery at a single center (excluding Cushing's disease) were followed for at least 6 months, with 46% having pre-operative adrenal insufficiency.

- **Primary outcome**: Week 1 OMT compared to glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months.
- **Secondary outcomes**: The performance of ITT as a "definitive" test and all tests compared to glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months.

The results showed week 1 OMT had a concordance with ITT at week 7 of 78% and glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months of 81%, which was not significantly different from post-operative morning cortisol levels. Additionally, 37% of participants with an abnormal OMT on day 6 had a normal OMT at week 6. All HPA axis tests showed similar concordance with glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months, ranging from 80% to 85%.

In conclusion, the overnight metyrapone test within the first week after pituitary surgery was no better than an early morning cortisol level at predicting glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months. However, the OMT at week 6 demonstrated recovery of the HPA axis in a substantial proportion of participants who failed earlier assessments.

### Body mass index at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor; a reflection of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction or lifestyle [^117WrCbr]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether childhood brain tumor survivors (CBTS), at risk of becoming overweight, experience this due to hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) dysfunction during follow-up. While body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis relates to BMI at follow-up, it remains unclear if aberrant BMI at brain tumor diagnosis indicates early hypothalamic dysfunction or results from genetic and sociodemographic factors. This study aimed to investigate the association of BMI at childhood brain tumor diagnosis with HP dysfunction at diagnosis or its development during follow-up.

The methods involved examining the association of BMI at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor with HP dysfunction at diagnosis or during follow-up. This examination was conducted in a Dutch cohort of 685 CBTS, excluding children with craniopharyngioma or a pituitary tumor. Individual patient data were retrospectively extracted from patient charts.

The results showed that of the 685 CTBS, 4.7% were underweight, 14.2% were overweight, and 3.8% were obese at diagnosis. Being overweight or obese at diagnosis was not associated with anterior pituitary deficiency or diabetes insipidus at diagnosis or during follow-up. However, in children with suprasellar tumors, obesity at diagnosis was associated with central precocious puberty.

In conclusion, overweight or obesity at diagnosis of a childhood brain tumor does not appear to be associated with pituitary deficiencies. These results suggest that genetics and lifestyle may be more significant etiologic factors for higher BMI at diagnosis in these children than hypothalamic dysfunction.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115cuuUD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the Pediatric Endocrine Society cosponsored this guideline, which was funded by the Endocrine Society.

- **Objective**: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA).

- **Participants**: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of eight experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

- **Consensus process**: One group meeting, several conference calls, and email communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees, members, and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

- **Conclusions**: FHA is a form of chronic anovulation not due to identifiable organic causes but often associated with stress, weight loss, excessive exercise, or a combination of these factors. Investigations should include assessment of systemic and endocrinologic etiologies, as FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is necessary, including medical, dietary, and mental health support. Medical complications include, among others, bone loss and infertility, and appropriate therapies are essential for management.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^116fqGJN]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

The network between hypothalamus nuclei and a priori subcortical ROIs included here contains less than 2% of all brain ordinates (1.38%: 1,262 of 91,282) and 0.0015% of all edges (105 edges of 91,282 × 91,282). Nevertheless, we were able to generate significant out-of-sample stress predictions. Figure 3B already suggested that specific edges of the network might be especially relevant for stress. Thus, in our next step, we tested whether an even smaller network might improve stress predictions.

To carry out this test, we iteratively added one edge at a time, from 1 to 105, based on their order of importance (absolute regression coefficient) in the training group. As before, we then applied training weights to the functional connectivity of the test group to compute out-of-sample stress predictions, only this time predictions were based on a smaller number of edges (Fig. 4A). Neighbouring predictions only differ by the inclusion of one additional edge, so rather than establishing statistical significance at each step (amounting to a total of 105 tests), we used this analysis to identify the smallest significant network and the overall best prediction, as established in prior work.

### An appetite for growth: The role of the hypothalamic - pituitary - growth hormone axis in energy balance [^1163Xf4U]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Links between the regulation of growth and energy balance are clear; to fuel growth, there must be consumption of energy. Therefore, it is perhaps intuitive that interactions between the hypothalamic - pituitary - growth hormone axis (growth axis) and pathways that drive metabolic processes exist. Overproduction of growth hormone has been associated with diabetes and metabolic disease for decades, and the opposing effects of growth hormone and insulin have been studied since early experiments almost a century ago.

The relationship between neuroendocrine axes can be complex, and the growth axis is no exception, interacting with energy balance in several organ systems, both in the periphery and centrally in hypothalamic nuclei. Much is known about peripheral interactions between growth axis hormones and processes such as glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis. More is still being learned about the molecular actions of growth axis hormones in adipose and other metabolically active tissues, and recent findings are discussed in this perspective. However, less is known about interactions with central energy balance pathways in the hypothalamus. This perspective aims to summarize what is known about these interactions, taking lessons from human studies and animal genetic and seasonal models, and discusses what this may mean in an evolving landscape of personalized medicine.

For diagnostic investigations of amenorrhea, particularly concerning the evaluation of its etiology, the ES 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive personal history from patients suspected of having functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. This history should focus on diet, eating disorders, exercise and athletic training, attitudes such as perfectionism and a high need for social approval, ambitions, expectations for self and others, weight fluctuations, sleep patterns, stressors, mood, menstrual patterns, fractures, and substance abuse.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, among which adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is the most serious and potentially life-threatening. It may occur in isolation, or more commonly, as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstration of a subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24), or in the setting of acute illness. The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized for the patient and clinical scenario.

A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate for making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus and assay-dependent; thus, normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used.

### Pituitary testing: a reappraisal [^111nwjog]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Due to the pulsatile secretion of pituitary hormones and their involvement in the acute stress response and feedback with peripheral hormones, baseline pituitary hormone levels may overlap among normal and pathological subjects. Therefore, dynamic testing has been widely used for the diagnosis and follow-up of pituitary diseases. An ideal test should be sensitive, specific, well-tolerated, easy to standardize and perform, and cost-effective.

Emerging issues include the cost and widespread availability of ultrasensitive hormone assays, increased knowledge of the pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms regulating pituitary function, and the need for better discrimination between clinically useful tests and research tools. In this special issue, experts from the US and Europe approach testing in specific pituitary diseases within the context of guidelines. Drug effects on different axes are discussed, as pharmacologic treatments may influence testing outcomes.

Regarding medical management for amenorrhea, particularly concerning functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, the 2017 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend addressing energy imbalance. To improve the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in adolescent and adult patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, it is advised to increase caloric consumption — which often necessitates weight gain — enhance nutrition, or decrease exercise activity.

### Immediate postoperative cortisol levels accurately predict postoperative hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary tumors [^111fe1wk]. Pituitary (2010). High credibility.

Accurate assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is critical for the appropriate management of patients with pituitary adenoma after transsphenoidal surgery. We examine the role of immediate postoperative cortisol levels to assess HPA axis function post-operatively. We performed preoperative cortrosyn stimulation test (CST) and measured immediate postoperative serum cortisol levels in 100 patients undergoing 104 transsphenoidal surgeries. These results were compared to those of the CST at 4–6 weeks postoperatively, which served as a measure of HPA axis function. The ability of immediate postoperative, day of surgery (DOS) cortisol levels to predict normal HPA axis function was determined using standard predictive analytic methods and confusion matrix calculations. We found that postoperative DOS cortisol levels of ≥ 15 microg/dL are a sensitive and accurate predictor of normal postoperative HPA axis function, with a sensitivity of 98%, an accuracy of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 99%. Our data suggest that an immediate postoperative DOS cortisol level of ≥ 15 microg/dL predicts distant, normal, postoperative HPA axis function following transsphenoidal surgery.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^114oAHWN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The hypothalamus is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which activates stress responses through the release of cortisol. It is a small but heterogeneous structure comprising multiple nuclei. In vivo human neuroimaging has rarely succeeded in recording signals from individual hypothalamus nuclei.

Here, we use human resting-state fMRI (n = 498) with high spatial resolution to examine relationships between the functional connectivity of specific hypothalamic nuclei and a dimensional marker of prolonged stress. First, we demonstrate that we can parcellate the human hypothalamus into seven nuclei in vivo. Using the functional connectivity between these nuclei and other subcortical structures, including the amygdala, we significantly predict stress scores out-of-sample. Predictions use 0.0015% of all possible brain edges, are specific to stress, and improve when using nucleus-specific compared to whole-hypothalamus connectivity. Thus, stress relates to connectivity changes in precise and functionally meaningful subcortical networks, which may be exploited in future studies using interventions in stress disorders.

### Disrupted hypothalamic functional connectivity in patients with PD and autonomic dysfunction [^114xqeJX]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

To test whether symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with alterations in intrinsic hypothalamic functional connectivity, given the regulatory role of the hypothalamus (HTH) in the autonomic nervous system, we conducted a study.

Resting-state fMRI scans from PD patients were analyzed. We compared patients with the highest (n = 24) and lowest (n = 28) quartile scores on a questionnaire assessing autonomic dysfunction in PD, namely the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), which were obtained from a larger pool of patients (n = 93). Higher scores on the SCOPA-AUT reflect more severe symptoms. Seed-based functional connectivity maps, grounded in a seed region in the left and right HTH, were computed for each patient. These maps were compared using a general linear model, with a false discovery rate correction applied for multiple comparisons. We also performed partial correlation tests to determine whether the associations between SCOPA-AUT scores and hypothalamic functional connectivity were independent of motor dysfunction, disease duration, cognitive function, and age.

Patients with higher SCOPA-AUT scores exhibited significantly reduced functional connectivity between the HTH and the striatum (caudate, putamen) and thalamus compared to patients with lower scores. This significant association between striato-thalamo-hypothalamic functional connectivity and SCOPA-AUT scores persisted after controlling for each patient's corresponding Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, as well as age and disease duration.

### The oxytocin system and implications for oxytocin deficiency in hypothalamic-pituitary disease [^113j5BCA]. Endocrine Reviews (2025).

- **Diagnostic challenges**: While patients with AVP-D are presumably most at risk for OXT-D, it is possible that some individuals with AVP-D, particularly if mild, may not have OXT-D due to sparing or regeneration of OXT-producing neurons. In rats, OXT neurons were more likely to survive and regenerate after stalk transection compared to AVP neurons. The clinical diagnosis of AVP-D is currently prompted by polyuria and polydipsia due to deficient circulating AVP acting at renal AVP (V2) receptors, and there may be other consequences of AVP-D that are not understood or captured by our present evaluation. Therefore, assuming that only patients with diagnosed AVP-D have OXT-D may result in missed identification of OXT-D in patients with HPDs. Development of diagnostic testing for OXT-D is needed, and there are challenges to overcome to achieve a clinically useful test.

In addition to the previously discussed difficulties in measuring OXT and the need to develop an optimal and standardized assay, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the "normal" range of OXT in any biological specimen in humans. Moreover, like other hormone axes, evidence at the time of writing indicates that a single hormone measurement is likely to miss individuals with deficient hormone secretion. While serial sampling of blood every 5 minutes for an integrated measure of basal and pulsatile OXT for an hour showed lower mean levels of OXT in those with AVP-D who are likely OXT-D, this type of sampling is resource-intensive and not practical in clinical practice. Provocative tests, for example, the A

### Hypothalamic inflammation: Marker or mechanism of obesity pathogenesis [^115mKZRx]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Our understanding of obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation — its underlying causes, the contributions made by distinct cell types, the extent to which it is reflective of tissue injury versus repair, and its implications for obesity pathogenesis and treatment — remains incomplete, but the field is evolving rapidly. Although hypothalamic inflammation shares several features with responses observed in peripheral tissues (e.g. comparable increases of some of the same inflammatory biomarkers, activation of local immune cells), its many unique features identify it as a fundamentally distinct process. For one, inflammation occurs much more rapidly in the hypothalamus than in peripheral tissues following the switch to an obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD), such that it precedes weight gain. Available data are compatible with a model in which the initial cause of hypothalamic inflammation induced by HFD feeding involves injury to neurons that comprise energy balance neurocircuits. In turn, this injury may undermine homeostatic responses that protect against weight gain, thereby contributing to obesity pathogenesis. Additional studies are warranted to critically test this model and determine if therapeutic interventions targeting this process have a role in the future of obesity treatment.

### Acthrel [^1172DsTE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The interpretation of the ACTH and cortisol responses following ACTHREL® administration requires knowledge of the clinical status of the individual patient, an understanding of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal physiology, and familiarity with the normal hormonal ranges and the standards used by the laboratory that performs the ACTH and cortisol assays.

- **Cushing's disease**: The results of challenges with corticorelin injection have been reported in approximately 300 patients with Cushing's disease. Although the ACTH and cortisol responses were variable, a hyper-response to corticorelin was seen in a majority of patients, despite high basal cortisol levels. This response pattern indicates an impairment of the negative feedback of cortisol on the pituitary. Patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease tested with corticorelin do not show the negative correlation between basal and stimulated levels of ACTH and cortisol that is found in normal subjects. A positive correlation between basal ACTH levels and maximum ACTH increments after corticorelin administration has been found in Cushing's disease patients.

- **Ectopic ACTH secretion**: Patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion (N = 32) were found to have very high basal levels of ACTH and cortisol, which were not further stimulated by corticorelin. However, there have been rare instances of patients with ectopic sources of ACTH that have responded to the corticorelin test.

Cushing's disease ACTH responses (mean of 181 patients):

- **Basal ACTH**: 63 ± 72 pg/mL (mean ± SD)
- **Peak ACTH**: 18

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115FKncZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111jyfek]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Studies looking at the outcome in patients who pass the SST and therefore were not given glucocorticoid replacement are reassuring. In a study of 148 hypothalamic-pituitary patients who passed the SST and were not treated with hydrocortisone, only 2 patients subsequently developed adrenal insufficiency, one with suspected evolving hypopituitarism and one who had a borderline response. These results confirmed those of another similar study. Therefore, when time-related clinical outcome is taken as the "gold standard", the SST rarely misses clinically significant adrenal insufficiency provided sufficient time has lapsed between the pituitary insult and testing.

For the SST, the cutoff for normality has been shown to be assay dependent and therefore should be determined in each unit based on responses in healthy controls. In our institution, we use 500 nmol/L as the cutoff for normal cortisol response, with peak levels of 500–550 nmol/L interpreted to be safe for the purpose of withholding routine glucocorticoid therapy, but these patients are prescribed stress dose glucocorticoids in times of intercurrent illness.

Dynamic tests assess ACTH/cortisol reserves rather than the adequacy of cortisol production from day to day under normal physiological conditions. Hence, patients with partial or borderline responses may not need day-to-day glucocorticoid replacement as they have been shown to have normal cortisol production under unstressed physiological conditions. As a precaution, they should receive sick day glucocorticoid therapy.

Borderline results are often difficult to interpret and require careful consideration.

### Female hypogonadism: Evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis [^112tfS8z]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Female hypogonadism refers to deficient or abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis that clinically presents with menstrual cycle disturbances. Female hypogonadism can be due to a congenital or acquired cause, and the defect can be at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or ovary. A careful history, physical exam, and selected laboratory testing can often determine the locus of the defect and whether it results from a structural or hormonal problem. Laboratory testing generally relies on basal hormone levels; however, the timing of blood sampling in relation to menses is important for the interpretation of the data.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116mUo51]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of amenorrhea, specifically the management of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, the ES 2017 guidelines recommend educating patients about various menstrual patterns occurring during the recovery phase once the diagnosis is established. It is important to inform patients that irregular menses do not require immediate evaluation and that menstrual irregularity does not preclude conception.

### Central hypoadrenalism [^114mzRCL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Central hypoadrenalism is a frequent complication of pituitary and hypothalamic pathology and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Optimal exogenous glucocorticoid use is dependent on the use of appropriate diagnostic tests and careful assessment of the clinical response to glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A PubMed search for the terms central hypoadrenalism, ACTH deficiency, glucocorticoid suppression, and glucocorticoid replacement was conducted; the papers identified and the references listed were used to build a reference list.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The published literature was assessed to present a summary of the available evidence with regard to etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypoadrenalism.

- **Conclusions**: A functional hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is essential for normal health and life expectancy; its complexity presents challenges to the clinician in the identification of patients and in the maintenance of such patients in a glucocorticoid-sufficient state. The most common cause of central hypoadrenalism remains exogenous glucocorticoid use. Further research in this field should be directed toward disease prevention by minimizing glucocorticoid exposure and toward the identification of a biomarker for glucocorticoid sufficiency that will aid clinicians in optimizing treatment.

### Thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH [^11784cs6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

TRH is indicated as an adjunctive agent in the diagnostic assessment of thyroid function. As an adjunct to other diagnostic procedures, testing with TRH (protirelin) may yield useful information in patients with pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction.

TRH is also indicated as an adjunct to evaluate the effectiveness of thyrotropin suppression with a particular dose of T4 in patients with nodular or diffuse goiter. A normal TSH baseline value and a minimal difference between the 30-minute and baseline response to a TRH injection would indicate adequate suppression of the pituitary secretion of TSH.

Additionally, TRH may be used adjunctively for the adjustment of thyroid hormone dosage given to patients with primary hypothyroidism. A normal or slightly blunted TSH response, thirty minutes following a TRH injection, would indicate adequate replacement therapy.

### Amenorrhea: an approach to diagnosis and management [^117UFmGd]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea may result from a number of different conditions, a systematic evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment of selected serum hormone levels, can usually identify the underlying cause. Primary amenorrhea, which by definition is failure to reach menarche, is often the result of chromosomal irregularities leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (e.g. Turner syndrome) or anatomic abnormalities (e.g. Müllerian agenesis). Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for three months or the cessation of irregular menses for six months. Most cases of secondary amenorrhea can be attributed to polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, or primary ovarian insufficiency. Pregnancy should be excluded in all cases.

Initial workup of primary and secondary amenorrhea includes a pregnancy test and serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovarian function and should not be presumed infertile. Patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea should be evaluated for eating disorders and are at risk for decreased bone density. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at risk for glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and other aspects of metabolic syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome (or variant) should be treated by a physician familiar with the appropriate screening and treatment measures. Treatment goals for patients with amenorrhea may vary considerably depending on the underlying cause.

### Migraine and the hypothalamus [^1166dvvX]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is a complex brain disorder involving several neuronal pathways and neurotransmitters in its pathophysiology. Searching for a specific anatomical or physiological defect in migraine may be futile. Still, the hypothalamus — with its widespread connections to other parts of the central nervous system and its significant control over the hypophysis and autonomic nervous system — is a suspected locus in quo. Several lines of evidence support the involvement of this small brain structure in migraine. However, its exact role, whether major or minor, remains unclear. The most convincing evidence for a pivotal role is the activation of the hypothalamus shown by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning during spontaneous migraine attacks.

- **Hypothalamic dysfunction theory**: A well-known theory suggests that the joint effect of several triggers may lead to temporary hypothalamic dysfunction, consequently resulting in a migraine attack. If PET scanning consistently confirmed hypothalamic activation before a migraine headache, this hypothesis would be supported. However, such evidence has not been provided, leaving the role of the hypothalamus in migraine puzzling. This review summarizes and discusses some of the clues regarding this association.

### How to approach endocrine assessment in severe obesity [^116GER52]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

The increasing numbers of severely obese patients (body mass index, BMI > 40 kg/m²) represent a significant management challenge. These patients are at risk of obesity-related complications that may be driven by changes in endocrine function. Their care may be complex at times; therefore, an appropriate assessment strategy is crucial for timely diagnosis and management. This article discusses an approach to the endocrine assessment of the severely obese patient by considering the clinical question in three categories, each representing different complexities in terms of subsequent management.

- **Obesity as a consequence of structural lesions at the hypothalamic-pituitary region**: The first category involves hypothalamic dysfunction, of which hypothalamic obesity is a consequence.

- **Obesity as a consequence of inherited and genetic syndromes**: The second category also relates to hypothalamic dysfunction.

- **Functional neuroendocrine hormone abnormalities relating to obesity**: The third category addresses functional hormone abnormalities associated with obesity.

Additionally, the implications and difficulties associated with imaging severely obese patients are discussed from an endocrinological perspective. Practical guidance is provided on which to base practice.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^117JPHH2]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Relating stress and hypothalamus nuclei connectivity

In the next step, we examined whether hypothalamus nuclei connectivity carries information about individuals' stress levels. While, so far, we considered the group average connectivity, in this step, we were interested in interindividual (i.e. between-subject) variability in hypothalamus connectivity and its potential relationship with interindividual variability in stress scores.

We generated a new split of all n = 400 3 T participants into a train and a test group with comparable means and distributions of stress scores. This split was generated only once with the aim of ensuring a comparable range of stress scores across the two groups and was based solely on behaviour (see Methods). It therefore did not bias any analyses examining relationships with functional connectivity.

### An integrative approach to HPA axis dysfunction: From recognition to recovery [^1127JFoT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a central role in the stress response and is implicated in a wide range of chronic health conditions. This review explores evidence-based perspectives on HPA axis dysregulation, its pathophysiology, diagnostic strategies, and integrative therapeutic approaches. Key contributing factors include psychological stress; genetic and epigenetic influences; dietary factors; gut health; immune system interactions; inflammation; toxins; and hormonal influences. Diagnostic methods such as serum cortisol levels, diurnal salivary cortisol profiles, and other tests are outlined.

Therapeutic approaches emphasize the importance of the patient-provider relationship, stress reduction techniques, lifestyle modifications, dietary interventions, supplements, adaptogenic herbs, and other integrative therapies. Understanding HPA axis dysfunction through an integrative lens fosters individualized care and bridges the gap between conventional endocrinology and functional models, empowering providers to support patients with often-dismissed symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, mood instability, and impaired stress tolerance.

### Early assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function in patients with congenital hypothyroidism of central origin [^116qFi8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Early recognition of gonadotropic dysfunction could enable well-timed growth and maturation and prevent damage to gonads and external genitalia. The adaptation of the Dutch neonatal screening program for congenital hypothyroidism in the mid-1990s resulted in enhanced detection of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin (CH-C), with a high likelihood of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, including gonadotropin (Gn) deficiency.

- **Objective**: We analyzed GnRH test results and baseline Gn and sex hormone measurements in 15 infants with CH-C to examine these diagnostic tools for the assessment of the integrity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in young infants.

- **Design**: In a nationwide prospective study (1994–1996), patients were referred to our department if neonatal CH screening results were indicative of CH-C. When CH-C was confirmed, GnRH tests and baseline Gn and sex hormone measurements took place at the age of 3 months when euthyroid status had been accomplished by T4 supplementation, and if necessary, cortisol supplementation was installed.

- **Setting**: The study took place at the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, a referral center.

- **Patients**: The study included 15 neonates (five girls and 10 boys) with CH-C, detected by neonatal screening, in whom investigation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis could be performed at 3 months of age.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Results of GnRH tests and baseline Gn and sex hormone measurements were assessed.

- **Results**: GnRH tests at 3 months o

Relating stress to interindividual variation in hypothalamus nuclei connectivity.

Relationships between stress scores and hypothalamus connectivity were robust and replicable. We used robust regressions to characterize relationships between the functional connectivity in each edge (7 hypothalamus nuclei x 15 ROIs) and stress and tested whether the resulting patterns of regression coefficients (shown in panel B) were more similar than expected by chance. This was true (1) across two 3 T datasets (left: n = 198 train and n = 200 test participants; one-sided p-values from a non-parametric test using permutation null distributions) and (2) within subjects when comparing patterns extracted from the 1st and 2nd half of each individual's data (right: n = 398 combined 3 T participants, run 1 + 3 versus run 2 + 4; one-sided p-values from a non-parametric test using permutation null distributions). Null distributions were generated using 10,000 iterations of shuffled stress scores. Note that the split into train and test groups was performed to achieve comparable stress distributions.

Visualisation of robust regression coefficients captured relationships with stress (1) across test and train 3 T datasets (left: top and middle row) and (2) across run 1 + 3 versus run 2 + 4 (right: top and middle row). This illustrates the similarity of the patterns statistically evaluated earlier. We extracted the contribution of each edge to this similarity by calculating the difference in correlation coefficients between the patterns obtained when excluding this specific edge.

### An appetite for growth: The role of the hypothalamic - pituitary - growth hormone axis in energy balance [^115u57gx]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Links between the regulation of growth and energy balance are clear; to fuel growth, there must be consumption of energy. Therefore, it is perhaps intuitive that interactions between the hypothalamic–pituitary–growth hormone axis (growth axis) and pathways that drive metabolic processes exist. Overproduction of growth hormone has been associated with diabetes and metabolic disease for decades, and the opposing effects of growth hormone and insulin have been studied since early experiments almost a century ago.

The relationship between neuroendocrine axes can be complex, and the growth axis is no exception. It interacts with energy balance in several organ systems, both in the periphery and centrally in hypothalamic nuclei. Much is known about peripheral interactions between growth axis hormones and processes such as glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis. More is still being learned about the molecular actions of growth axis hormones in adipose and other metabolically active tissues, and recent findings are discussed in this perspective. However, less is known about interactions with central energy balance pathways in the hypothalamus.

This perspective aims to summarize what is known about these interactions, taking lessons from human studies and animal genetic and seasonal models, and discusses what this may mean in an evolving landscape of personalized medicine.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^113ktqA5]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

We sought to replicate our results at this stage of the analysis. The factor analysis was conducted again in a second, larger cohort. Since it emphasizes behavioral rather than fMRI data, it can be derived from all HCP participants, thus eliminating the need to restrict it to data subsets with the highest quality physiological recordings necessary for pre-processing fMRI data. When the analysis was repeated on the complete set of n = 1206 3 T HCP participants, minus the previously included n = 400 participants (resulting in a total of n = 806), the stress factor was highly similar [two-tailed Pearson's correlation between factor loadings n = 400 vs. n = 806 3 T participants: r (5) = 0.998; p = 1.162 × 10⁻⁰⁷; CI = [0.99, 1]; Supplementary Fig. 4B].

- **Stress scores analysis**: Stress scores obtained for the 7 T cohort, using the same factor weights, displayed a noticeably narrower range with less extreme stress levels compared to the 3 T cohorts [two-sample F test of equal variances between 3 T and 7 T cohorts: F (397,96) = 1.876; p < 0.001; CI = [1.35, 2.54]; 3 T: min: −7.10, max: 7.44; 7 T: min: −4.87, max: 4.12]. This could be due to individuals with heightened stress levels opting not to enter a high-field MR scanner [Supplementary Fig. 4C]. This lack of variability in stress scores in the 7 T cohort may limit or even preclude an examination of how interindividual variation in hypothalamic connectivity relates to interindividual variability in stress in this cohort.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1173WSRx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, and more specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, the ES 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a progestin challenge test. This test should be conducted after excluding pregnancy to induce withdrawal bleeding, which serves as an indication of chronic estrogen exposure and ensures the integrity of the outflow tract in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

### Assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function after corticosteroid therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^1171i59z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy (CT) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is not well understood. This study aimed to assess HPA axis function in IBD patients before the end of CT during the tapering phase.

- **Methods**: HPA axis function was assessed using cortisol measurements (ng/ml) before (T0) (normal > 100) and 60 minutes after 0.25 mg tetracosactide (Synacthen immediate) injection (T60) in 55 consecutive cases of IBD attacks. An abnormal response was defined as T60 < 210. The attacks were categorized into two groups based on the Synacthen test (ST) results.

- **Results**: Out of 55 cases, 36 ST were abnormal, and the recovery time for normal HPA axis function was 7.2 ± 1.3 months. Factors such as the duration of disease since onset, past history of surgical or immunosuppressive treatment, severity and extension of the attack, need for surgical or immunosuppressive treatment, total cumulative and mean daily corticosteroid dose, total duration of CT, and steroid dose at the time of ST did not significantly differ between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that a past history of CT was predictive of abnormal ST (OR = 8.4, 95% CI = 2.2–31.5, p = 0.0009). For patients with a past history of CT, the time elapsed since the last course of CT was significantly longer in those with normal ST than in those with abnormal ST (45.5 ± 13.5 months vs. 15.4 ± 6.0 months, p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis indicated that a duration free of CT < 15 months was predictive of abnormal ST (OR = 15.00, CI = 1.23–183.00, p = 0.03).

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^112qNmQW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

All patients with sellar/parasellar tumors should be subjected to an assessment of HPA axis function, with perhaps the exception of those with pituitary microadenomas who are at a very low risk of ACTH deficiency. Patients should undergo post-operative interrogation of the HPA axis, regardless of whether they had pre-operative ACTH deficiency, as there is potential for these patients to gain functional recovery provided that viable normal pituitary tissue remains in situ.

ACTH deficiency is the most common deficit observed in pituitary apoplexy, occurring in 50–80% of cases. Due to its high frequency and potentially life-threatening effects, empiric parenteral corticosteroid is administered, when possible, preceded by blood drawing for serum cortisol levels. Pituitary function can recover following surgical decompression; therefore, post-operative re-assessment of the HPA axis is required.

An 08.00 h plasma cortisol measurement can be taken on day 1–3 post-operatively in patients not treated with glucocorticoids, and on day 3–5 in patients covered with glucocorticoids once the dose is tapered down to physiological replacement. This involves giving the second dose of hydrocortisone early in the afternoon (if hydrocortisone is used) and delaying the morning dose until after the sample is drawn. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding what constitutes a safe level of 08.00 h plasma cortisol. Patients with an 08.00 h unstressed cortisol of > 400 nmol/L have an extremely low risk of ACTH deficiency, and no further dynamic testing of the HPA axis is necessary.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113AsZ6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). High credibility.

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use. Interrogation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example, a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. In other situations, a low morning cortisol level in an at-risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed.

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones, with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected, followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in loss of ACTH and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). However, ACTH can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations, such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids. Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism are important as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

### The many different clinical faces of acquired hypothalamic dysfunction: A retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands [^111F6chM]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Acquired hypothalamic dysfunction, which can occur at diagnosis or after treatment for childhood (supra)sellar brain tumors, can have severe consequences. While morbid obesity and pituitary dysfunction are easily recognized, other consequences such as hypothermia, sleep disturbances, or behavioral issues are less well-known and may be overlooked. Additionally, hypothalamic dysfunction may present differently in each patient, hampering diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. These different faces of hypothalamic dysfunction have not been systematically described before. In this study, we systematically describe the different manifestations of acquired hypothalamic dysfunction and its association with patient, tumor, or treatment-related factors.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in children diagnosed with a (supra)sellar brain tumor across four centers in the Netherlands between January 2003 and January 2023. We included three cohorts of patients younger than 18 years (at the time of diagnosis) with at least one year of follow-up:

- **Dutch supratentorial midline low grade glioma (LGG) cohort**: Including patients with a diagnosis of supratentorial midline LGG (thalamic or suprasellar location).
- **Dutch childhood craniopharyngioma (cCP) cohort**: Including patients with a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma.
- **Dutch suprasellar germ cell tumor (GCT) cohort**: Including patients with a diagnosis of suprasellar non-germinomatous germ cell tumors or germinoma.

Patients were assessed using the diagnostic hypothalamic score, categorizing the percentage of patients with severe or mild manifestations.

### An updated view of hypothalamic-vascular-pituitary unit function and plasticity [^1128rGw8]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

The discoveries of novel functional adaptations of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland for physiological regulation have transformed our understanding of their interaction. The activity of a small proportion of hypothalamic neurons can control complex hormonal signalling, which is disconnected from a simple stimulus and the subsequent hormone secretion relationship, and is dependent on physiological status. The interrelationship of the terminals of hypothalamic neurons and pituitary cells with the vasculature has an important role in determining the pattern of neurohormone exposure. Cells in the pituitary gland form networks with distinct organizational motifs that are related to the duration and pattern of output. Modifications of these networks occur in different physiological states, can persist after cessation of demand, and result in enhanced function. Consequently, the hypothalamus and pituitary can no longer be considered as having a simple stratified relationship: with the vasculature, they form a tripartite system, which must function in concert for appropriate hypothalamic regulation of physiological processes such as reproduction. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying these regulatory features has implications for future therapies that correct defects in hypothalamic-pituitary axes. In addition, recapitulating proper network organization will be an important challenge for regenerative stem cell treatment.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^114S8Xzy]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Having tested the robustness of hypothalamus connectivity relationships with stress, we moved on to our key analysis to establish if hypothalamus nuclei connectivity was sufficient to predict stress in an independent cohort. To test this, we applied the robust regression coefficients estimated independently for all 105 edges in the training group to the functional connectivity estimates from the test group, using a weighted sum of all edge's weights and all edges' individual connectivity values, to derive individual predicted stress scores for all participants. We used Pearson's correlation to establish the similarity between predicted and true stress scores in the test group (Fig. 3C, left). For consistency and replicability, the equivalent test was repeated using robust regression weights trained on run 1 + 3 and applied to the connectivity estimates from run 2 + 4, across all participants (test+train; Fig. 3C, right).

Throughout the manuscript, analyses probing whether functional connectivity could predict stress examined whether there was a positive relationship between two patterns of robust regression coefficients (Fig. 3A, B) or between predicted and true behavioural scores (Figs. 3–5). P-values for these analyses were accordingly one-tailed.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: An ignored clinical syndrome [^111MXmbb]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Testing for a low plasma insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level is usually performed when diagnosing growth hormone deficiency (GHD). However, in acute trauma, the levels may not be reliable, and the test lacks sensitivity to screen patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). For diagnosing GHD, a low IGF-1 level warrants further dynamic testing unless it is associated with deficiency of three other pituitary hormones.

GHD requires dynamic testing because growth hormone (GH) secretion is of a pulsatile and episodic nature. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is generally considered a gold standard because it assesses both hypothalamic and pituitary function, but it runs the risk of causing neuroglycopenia and seizures after TBI. This risk makes it a less favored test to perform in these patients. GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) plus arginine and GHRH plus GH-releasing peptide 6 stimulate GH secretion and can be safely used as dynamic tests for GHD evaluation.

### Assessment of the impact of HIV infection on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and pubertal development among adolescent girls at a tertiary centre in Zimbabwe: A cross-sectional study [^113H2ZaM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Several studies have documented delayed sexual maturation, growth, and development among HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected adolescents. A study conducted in Nigeria identified lower growth parameters and pubertal delay among HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected adolescent girls. Several physiological mechanisms have been attributed to the delayed growth and development in this group of adolescents. These include chronic inflammation, increased catabolism, and immunosuppression. Delayed sexual maturation can be explained by reduced levels of the hormone leptin, secondary to poor nutrition and reduced energy reserves in chronic illness. This affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis negatively, leading to reduced pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and disruptions in pubertal development.

HIV-infected adults with reasonable immunological and virological control rarely exhibit endocrine dysfunction, but those with severe HIV infection may be significantly affected. If the same phenomenon is true for adolescents, there might be a need to screen for some endocrinopathies to ensure normal growth, development, and sexual reproduction, especially in those with poorly controlled HIV infection.

As these adolescents mature into adults, it is crucial to know whether HIV infection accelerates ovarian aging. This will facilitate counseling and planning for the reproductive health needs of these adolescents. Serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels are an accurate marker of ovarian reserve, and serum AMH levels are not influenced by the stage of the disease.

### Assessment of testicular function in boys and adolescents [^112kU7bw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is characterized by significant functional changes occurring from its establishment in fetal life until the end of puberty. The typical assessment methods used for adult males, such as serum testosterone, gonadotrophins, and semen analysis, are not applicable during most of infancy and childhood. Disorders of the gonadal axis yield different clinical consequences based on the developmental stage at which dysfunction occurs. This review explores the approaches to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in newborns, children, and adolescents.

- **Hormonal and genetic studies**: We focused on hormonal laboratory and genetic studies, along with clinical signs and imaging studies, to guide the etiological diagnosis and determine the functional status of the gonads.

- **Biomarkers and imaging**: Serum gonadotrophin and testosterone determination proves useful in the first 3–6 months after birth and during puberty. AMH and inhibin B serve as useful biomarkers for testis function from birth through the end of puberty. Clinical and imaging signs assist in evaluating testicular hormone actions during fetal and postnatal life.

The interpretation of results from the assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in pediatric patients requires a comprehensive understanding of developmental physiology. This knowledge is crucial for understanding pathophysiology and achieving an accurate diagnosis of axis disorders.

Regarding the medical management of amenorrhea, particularly in the context of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and osteoporosis management, the ES 2017 guidelines recommend considering the short-term administration of teriparatide. This therapy is suggested as an option for delayed fracture healing and very low bone mineral density in rare adult cases of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^114ys3hi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is the deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being the most serious and potentially life-threatening. This condition may occur in isolation or, more commonly, as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstrating a subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, or ACTH(1–24), particularly in the setting of acute illness.

The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized for the patient and clinical scenario. A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate for diagnosing an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. However, often a dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is dependent on both the stimulus and the assay, and normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within a clinical context and with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used.
