## Question

Is it the same as phenonsrbitol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "phenonsrbitol" is the same as sorbitol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "phenonsrbitol" is a recognized drug or chemical name. Then, I should verify what sorbitol is and how it is named. Next, I will check for common misspellings or look‑alike names that could cause confusion. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and provide the correct terminology with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the query term. Wait, let me verify the spelling: "phenonsrbitol" does not appear in the provided sources, and I do not find it as a drug or chemical name in the FDA or guideline documents here, which makes me suspect a typographical error or misremembered name rather than a standard entity [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what sorbitol actually is. Sorbitol is a hexahydric sugar alcohol (a polyol) used as an osmotic laxative, as a sweetener, and as an excipient in numerous oral medications; it is not a barbiturate or phenol derivative, and its pharmacology and safety profile are well described in FDA and clinical literature [^68ec17f4] [^d1053a4f] [^df471069].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for look‑alike names that could be confused with sorbitol. Phenol is a distinct aromatic compound used as a disinfectant and, in dilute form, for neurolysis in spasticity management; it is chemically unrelated to sorbitol and has very different safety considerations and clinical uses, so conflating "phenol" with "sorbitol" would be incorrect [^f291f340] [^2938c496] [^44a62e29]. I should also consider whether "phenobarbital" might be the intended term; phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant and sedative, which again is pharmacologically and structurally unrelated to sorbitol, reinforcing that sorbitol is not the same as either phenol or phenobarbital [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. No, "phenonsrbitol" is not the same as sorbitol; "phenonsrbitol" does not correspond to a recognized drug or chemical in the provided materials, whereas sorbitol is a well‑defined sugar alcohol with established uses and safety profile; if the user meant phenol or phenobarbital, those are entirely different agents and should not be confused with sorbitol [^68ec17f4] [^d1053a4f] [^2938c496].

> I should double‑check the correct terminology to ensure precision. The accurate name is sorbitol, and it appears in multiple FDA‑labeled contexts including urologic irrigating solutions, activated charcoal formulations, and as an excipient in oral medications, which confirms its identity and distinguishes it from phenol‑containing products and barbiturates [^d1053a4f] [^68ec17f4] [^4b8d06d5].

Introduction

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of prune juice on chronic constipation.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Japanese subjects with chronic constipation.

Results

Prune intake significantly decreased hard and lumpy stools while increasing normal stool and not increasing loose and watery stools. Prune intake also ameliorated subjective complaints of constipation and hard stools, without alteration of flatulence, diarrhea, loose stools, or urgent need for defecation. There were no adverse events or laboratory abnormalities of liver or renal function after prune intake.

Discussion

Prune juice exerted an effective and safe natural food therapy for chronic constipation.

### Sorbitol [^df471069]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

3% Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution is useful as an irrigating fluid for the urinary bladder because the sorbitol solution is nonhemolytic, electrically nonconductive, and provides a high degree of visibility for urologic procedures requiring endoscopy. During transurethral surgical procedures, the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood and tissue fragments. It is also useful as an irrigating fluid to maintain the patency of an indwelling catheter in the immediate postoperative period. If absorbed either intravascularly or extravascularly during transurethral resections, the sorbitol will be either metabolized to carbon dioxide and water via the fructose pathway, or excreted by a normally functioning kidney.

### Activated charcoal [^68ec17f4]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Sorbitol:

Sorbitol is a hexahydric sugar alcohol which primarily serves as an osmotic cathartic in Actidose® with Sorbitol.6 A secondary advantage of using sorbitol is as a palatability enhancer to decrease the innate gritty texture of activated charcoal and to provide a sweet vehicle to increase patient compliance. Sorbitol is poorly absorbed during its transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Absorbed sorbitol is metabolized by the liver and slowly converted to fructose. Insulin is not necessary for intracellular transport of sorbitol, therefore customary cathartic doses can be safely used by patients with diabetes mellitus.

As a hyperosmotic cathartic sorbitol produces a hygroscopic action resulting in increased water in the large intestine and increased intraluminal pressure which stimulates catharsis. Studies have been conducted in healthy adult human volunteers using therapeutic amounts of activated charcoal and sorbitol.8,9 Catharsis of activated charcoal occurred in an average of 1.0–1.5 hours and persisted for 8–12 hours. Fourteen poisoned patients are reported in one series representing a wide range of toxins and dosages of sorbitol resulting in the onset of catharsis in an average of 7.7 hours.10 The onset of action may be expected to be longer in patients who have ingested toxins which decrease bowel motility, such as pharmacological agents and plants with anticholinergic properties, and drugs like narcotics.20

### Malaria parasite DNA-harbouring vesicles activate cytosolic immune sensors [^9e00309b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Purification of extracellular vesicles

Briefly, infected or uninfected RBC growth media was collected and cellular debris removed by centrifugation at 1500 r.p.m. 3000 r.p.m. and 10,000 r.p.m. The supernatant was concentrated using a Vivaflow 100,000 MWCO PES (Sartorious Stedium) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet nanovesicles. OptiPrep density gradient was performed as previously described; OptiPrep velocity gradient purification — the initial vesicle pellet was resuspended in 2 mL incomplete media and further purified on a 10-ml continuous 10–30% Optiprep gradient made up in NTE buffer (137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4), 250,000 g, 14 h, 4 °C, in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top.

DNA isolation and analysis

Nanovesicle pellets from 100 mL of culture were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with DNase I (Ambion). The enzyme was then inactivated (75 °C for 15 min), followed by acid-phenol:chloroform extraction.

RNase and DNase digestion

DNA was extracted using acid-phenol:chloroform as previously described. EV-DNA or 3D7 gDNA were equally distributed and subjected to S1 nuclease, DNase or RNase A (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. For the DNA protection assay, 25 pg of plasmid DNA PuF was added prior to DNase I treatment.

Parasite EV time course

CS2 parasites were grown to the late trophozoite/early schizont stage. The iRBCs were purified using a magnetized MACS column. Bound iRBC were eluted and added to fresh uRBCs. Culture was incubated on a shaker at 37 °C for 4 h to allow invasion. Remaining trophozoites/schizonts were lysed using 5% sorbitol. The culture containing early rings (0–4 h post invasion) at 5% parasitaemia and 4% hematocrit was washed twice with RPMI-HEPES and incubated at 37 °C. Culture supernatant was collected at 12 h intervals. After each collection, parasites were washed twice with RPMI-HEPES prior to addition of fresh medium. EVs were extracted from collected culture supernatant.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^c9a7d319]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for trauma pain management — properties, dosing, formulations, and cautions: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic, although its exact mechanism of action for pain management remains unknown, and it offers several advantages, including numerous routes of administration, ease of access, and relatively few adverse effects. The addition of APAP to traditional opioid therapy consistently demonstrates decreased morphine requirements, and scheduled dosing is ideal. Intravenous APAP is commonly used in several countries as the only postoperative analgesic; however, many U.S. hospitals do not include it in their inpatient formularies because of the drug's high cost and similar analgesic effects between scheduled intravenous and oral therapy. Intravenous APAP is generally well-tolerated and effective in most patients, but hypotension has been reported in some patients. Recognize that the liquid oral formulation of APAP contains sorbitol and can cause diarrhea in some patients. Avoid APAP in patients with acute liver failure, and use reduced doses in older adults and patients with chronic liver disease.

### Activated charcoal [^2402ddd1]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Actidose® with Sorbitol should not be used in each dose of the multiple dose activated charcoal regimen unless it is necessary to produce catharsis. Actidose® with Sorbitol contains sorbitol which may produce excessive catharsis and resultant fluid and electrolyte problems if used at each dosing interval (see Precautions).9,25 Actidose®-Aqua should be used at dosage intervals when Actidose® with Sorbitol is not being used. CATHARTICS SHOULD BE USED CAUTIOUSLY AND ONLY INTERMITTENTLY DURING MULTIPLE DOSE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL THERAPY.

If catharsis of activated charcoal does not occur following the use of Actidose® with Sorbitol within 4–8 hours, an additional sorbitol dose of 1.5 gm/kg may be administered. Or, if desired, a saline cathartic such as magnesium citrate may be used if the patient's renal function is not impaired. Actidose® with Sorbitol and Actidose®-Aqua are formulated in palatable vehicles which eliminate the need to add additional taste or consistency enhancers. The use of supplementary chemicals, syrups, or dairy products should be avoided since their addition may compromise the adsorptive capacity of Actidose® with Sorbitol and Actidose®-Aqua.

### Host sorbitol and bacterial sorbitol utilization promote Clostridioides difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease [^41e5aa6c]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a widespread gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with globally increasing incidence. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) often occurs in patients with intestinal dysbiosis, such as after antibiotic therapy. Patients with IBD have increased incidence of CDI and the clinical outcome of IBD is reportedly worsened by CDI. However, the underlying reasons remain poorly understood.

Methods

We performed a retrospective single-center and a prospective multicenter analysis of CDI in patients with IBD, including genetic typing of C difficile isolates. Furthermore, we performed a CDI mouse model to analyze the role of the sorbitol metabolization locus that we found distinguished the main IBD- and non-IBD-associated sequence types (STs). Moreover, we analyzed sorbitol concentration in the feces of patients with IBD and healthy individuals.

Results

We detected a significant association of specific lineages with IBD, particularly increased abundance of ST54. We found that in contrast to the otherwise clinically predominant ST81, ST54 harbors a sorbitol metabolization locus and was able to metabolize sorbitol in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in the mouse model, ST54 pathogenesis was dependent on intestinal inflammation-induced conditions and the presence of sorbitol. Furthermore, we detected significantly increased sorbitol concentrations in the feces of patients with active IBD vs patients in remission or healthy controls.

Conclusions

Sorbitol and sorbitol utilization in the infecting C difficile strain play major roles for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of CDI in patients with IBD. CDI in patients with IBD may thus be avoided or improved by elimination of dietary sorbitol or suppression of host-derived sorbitol production.

### Whole genome sequencing, assembly and phenotypic profiling for the new budding yeast species [^99dc80aa]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Material and Methods

Yeast strains

Strains used in this study are presented in Table 1. All strains were grown and maintained on YPDA (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v Bacto-peptone, 2% v/v glucose and 2% w/v agar). Species names and strains number are stated in Table 1.

Table 1
Strains used in this study

DNA Extraction

For Illumina Hiseq, the total DNA was extracted from an overnight grown culture of yeast strains by using the standard phenol/chloroform method described previously with some modifications. Briefly, 5 mL of overnight grown yeast cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl EB buffer (4M sorbitol, 500mM EDTA and1M DTT) containing 1 mg/ml lyticase. The cells were incubated at 37° for 1 hr. Following incubation, the cells were mixed with stop solution (3M NaCl, 100mM Tris pH 7.5 and 20mM EDTA) and 60 μl of 10% SDS. The cell suspension was vortexed and mixed with 500 μl phenol-chloroform. The samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 2 min to separate the aqueous phase from the organic phase. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a clean 1.5 mL tube and phenol-chloroform step was repeated twice until a white interface was no longer present. The aqueous phase was washed with 1 mL absolute ethanol by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was air dried and resuspended in 30 μl of sterile milliQ water.

Genomic DNA for PacBio sequencing was extracted using Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G kit (cat. No. 10223) following manufacturer's recommended instructions. The yield of all DNA samples was assessed by the nanodrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000) and by Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (catalog no. Q32866). Purity and integrity of DNA was checked by electrophoresis on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and by calculating the A260/A280 ratios.

### Mechanical loading and hyperosmolarity as a daily resetting cue for skeletal circadian clocks [^c5d12a03]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Tissue explant culture, mechanical loading, and osmotic challenge

Mouse articular cartilage tissue explants were prepared as described beforeby dissecting the whole hip joint and then detaching the cartilage from subchondral bone of the femoral head using a scalpel. From the same mice whole IVDs were dissected from the lumbar region of the spine as we described before. Briefly, the whole spines were dissected and cleaned of muscle tissue using scissors. A scalpel was gently wedged between the vertebral body and the IVD until the tissues separated. Explants were cultured and recorded at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 in DMEM/F12 without phenol red and without serum. The osmolarity of the medium was increased using sorbitol and measured using freezing point osmometer. In baseline osmolarity and the conditioned media swap experiments (Fig. 2a, b and S 2b), tissue explants were adapted to the indicated media osmolarity for 3 days, after which dexamethasone (100 nM) was added for 1 h to re-synchronize the tissues to the same phase. Next, culture media were changed to recording medium (culturing medium + 100 µM luciferin) of the same osmolarity as adapted to. Tissue explants were recorded either undisturbed (Fig. 2a) or the conditioned media was swapped between dishes (Fig. 2b and S 2b). In all other osmotic treatment experiments, 2 M sorbitol dissolved in a culture medium was added to recording dishes at a volume required to achieve indicated osmolarity. An equal volume of culture medium without sorbitol was added to control dishes. Mechanical loading of tissue explants was performed in BioPress compression plates on FX-5000 system (FlexCell). Explant tissues were placed in the recording medium and their initial phase recorded in the Lumicycle. At the indicated time all explants were removed from recording dishes and placed in the BioPress plates in a fresh culture medium. Explants were subjected to loading protocol while control explants were placed in the same incubator as the compression instrument but not subjected to loading. SCN brain slices from PER2::LUC mice were prepared as described previously. Briefly, mice were culled by cervical dislocation, brains were then removed and moistened with ice-cold HBSS (Sigma) supplemented with 0.035% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Invitrogen). Coronal brain slices (250-μm thick) were cut using a vibroslicer (Camden Instruments) and transferred to sterile tissue culture dishes (Corning) in cold HBSS. Using a dissecting microscope, the SCN were identified and microdissected before excised unilateral SCN nuclei were cultured on interface-style cell culture inserts (PICM0RG50; Millipore) in standard 35-mm plastic-based cultures dishes (Corning). One milliliter of sterile culture medium [DMEM (D-2902; Sigma) supplemented with 3.5 g/L d-glucose (Sigma), 0.035% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES buffer (Sigma), 25 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mm luciferin (Promega) in autoclaved Milli-Q water] was used per culture.

Reference sequencing and genome assembly

Gwen (US Patent: USPP5298P 1983) is a grandchild of Hass and has been central to the University of California, Riverside breeding program. We sampled young leaf materials from a Gwen clone and isolated high molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) using the method of. We included a containing buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.35 M Sorbitol, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) PVP 40, 2% (v/v) of 2-mercaptoethanol) prior to cell lysis to avoid co-precipitation of polysaccharides and phenolics with DNA. DNA quality was assessed with a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA), by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer with the DNA High Sensitivity kit (Life Technologies, CA, USA), and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. From this, a 20 µg of high molecular weight genomic DNA was needle-sheared and used as input into the SMRTbell library preparation, using the SMRTbell Express Template Preparation V2 kit (Pacific Biosciences, CA, USA). Libraries were size selected to 22–80 Kb with the BluePippin (Sage Science, MA, USA) and sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences Sequel using P6-C4 chemistry (DNA Technology Core Facility, University of California, Davis).

### Effect of sorbitol on the pharmacokinetic profile of lamivudine oral solution in adults: an open-label, randomized study [^7b5ea75f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The results of this drug interaction study in adults implicate sorbitol as the perpetrator and underlying mechanism for the lower plasma lamivudine exposures in the aforementioned relative bioavailability studies in children with HIV‐1 infection who received repeated doses of lamivudine oral solution in combination with other antiretroviral drug formulations that contained sorbitol as an excipient. 4, 6, 7 In each of those pediatric studies, lamivudine oral solution was coadministered with abacavir solution, which is formulated with high concentrations of sorbitol (340 mg/mL). In some studies, children also received nevirapine suspension (162 mg of sorbitol/mL) or the prophylactic antibiotic trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole as a suspension (sorbitol amounts vary depending on the manufacturer). This interaction between lamivudine and sorbitol may also explain previous reports of lower exposures in younger/lower‐weight children compared with older/higher‐weight children 17, 18, 19, 20 because younger children are more likely to be prescribed liquid medications for ease of swallowing.

Calling Cards library preparation

Calling Cards libraries were prepared according to previous methods with the following modifications. 100 OD 600 genomic DNA was harvested using the following protocol: cells were resuspended in a solution containing 1 M Sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0, and 10 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (BME). Cells were spheroplasted with 0.7 mg/ml 100 K Zymolyase (US Biological) and shaken at 30° for 1 hr. The resultant spheroplasts were resuspended in a solution containing 1 M Sorbitol, 1% SDS, 20 mM EDTA and incubated at 55° overnight. Phenol:Choloform:Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extraction and RNase treatment (10 mg/ml) was done and the DNA was then precipitated with 3 M Sodium Acetate and 100% Ethanol. One microgram of genomic DNA was digested with Hin dIII, Hpa II, or Taq α1 (New England BioLabs). Digested DNA (200 ng) was used for intramolecular ligation reaction by T4 Ligase (New England BioLabs). Ligated DNA (20 µl) was used for inverse PCR amplification with 0.25 mM dNTPs, 0.125 µM of primer D (Table 3), 0.125 μM of primer E, F, G, or H (Table 3), Taq polymerase, and Taq buffer (35 mM MgCl 2, 750 mM KCl, 0.1% TritonX-100, pH = 8.7). Inverse PCR amplification was done with 31 cycles of 95° for 30 sec, 60° for 30 sec, and 72° for 3 min. Each PCR reaction was diluted to 10 nM and the three digestion reactions for a given Calling Cards strain were pooled and submitted for sequencing on the Illumina GAII or MiSeq with primer I (Table 3).

Analysis of Calling Cards sequencing

Sequences were analyzed by alignment to a reference genome (sacCer1) using Bowtie and SAMtools, processed to bedGraph format using BEDTools, and visualized in the UCSC genome browser. Coverage at each position was normalized by the signal at each genomic position relative to the number of aligned reads in the library (i.e. reads per million, RPM) to get quantitative information or normalized to the mean number of unique insertions to get specific positional information. Software and pipeline used to analyze Calling Cards data can be found at.

Pilonidal disease without abscess — phenol application — is endorsed with strong recommendation and moderate-quality evidence, with reports of low complication and recurrence rates and high healing. The guideline states that phenol application is effective with a Grade of Recommendation 1B. Reported outcomes include minor complications in < 15% of patients, resolution of disease in 67% to 100%, and elimination of recurrence in ≥ 80%; the procedure typically uses 1 to 3 mL of crystallized phenol and most often requires One to 4 procedures. Studies note 100% healing when laser epilation preceded phenol, and a randomized trial found healing in 100% of patients in both phenol and surgery groups with recurrence 19% and 13% (p = 0.92). In recurrent disease, phenol injection with weekly depilatory use showed low subsequent recurrence rates of 0%–11% at extended follow-up.

For MNase-seq of in vivo chromatin, nuclei were prepared from strain BY4741 grown to log phase at 30 °C as described. Briefly, cell walls were degraded by Zymolyase (ICN Biochemicals zymolyase 100T) in the presence of 1 M sorbitol and cells lysed in hypoosmotic buffer (18% Ficoll (Sigma-Aldrich, Ficoll Type 400 F4375), 20 mM KH 2 PO 4, 1 mM MgCl 2, 0.25 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM EDTA) followed by centrifugation at 22,550 × g for 30 min to collect chromatin ("nuclei"). Nuclei aliquots were digested with MNase in MNase buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM CaCl 2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) to yield mostly mononucleosomal DNA fragments. Digestion was stopped by SDS and EDTA and DNA purified by digestion with proteinase K, phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, RNaseA digestion, and isopropanol precipitation. DNA was resolved in an 1.5% agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer and mononucleosomal fragments were excised, purified, and used for sequencing library preparation as above.

### Effect of sorbitol on the pharmacokinetic profile of lamivudine oral solution in adults: an open-label, randomized study [^78d731b9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Sixteen subjects were planned to be randomized to one of four treatment sequences (four subjects per sequence) in accordance with a randomization schedule generated before the start of the study. The four treatment regimens were lamivudine oral solution 300 mg alone, lamivudine 300 mg plus sorbitol 3.2 g (low dose), lamivudine 300 mg plus sorbitol 10.2 g (medium dose), and lamivudine 300 mg plus sorbitol 13.4 g (high dose). The 300‐mg lamivudine dose represents the adult once‐daily dose for the treatment of HIV. The low, medium, and high sorbitol doses were chosen to mirror the amounts of sorbitol found in an adult dose of nevirapine (Viramune; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT) oral suspension, abacavir (Ziagen; ViiV Healthcare, Research Triangle Park, NC) oral solution, or the combined amount consumed when the nevirapine and abacavir preparations are taken together. Treatments were administered as separate oral solutions containing 10 mg/mL of lamivudine (Epivir Oral Solution; ViiV Healthcare) or 900 mg/mL of sorbitol (Geritrex Sorbitol Solution USP 70% w/w; Mount Vernon, NY). All treatments were administered with ∼240 mL of water after an 8‐h overnight fast and with a ≥ 7‐day washout between doses. Subjects continued to fast for 4 h postdose and were required to refrain from consuming products that contain sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, isomalt), including sugar‐free chewing gum, candy, or other processed food or drink, during the inpatient period of each dosing session (Day –1 through 48 h postdose). Subjects returned for a follow‐up visit 7 to 14 days after receiving the last dose of study medication.

Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before any study‐specific procedures were performed. The study protocol and informed consent were reviewed and approved by a regional Institutional Review Board in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and United States 21 Code of Federal Regulations 312.3(b). The study was registered withunder the identifier NCT02634073.

Recovery of plasmids from yeast

Assembled constructs encoding the β-carotene and β-ionone pathways were recovered from yeast using a protocol for isolating high-quality circular plasmid DNA in microgram quantities. Briefly, yeast cells harboring plasmids were grown in 10 mL selective medium overnight at 30 °C, then inoculated in 400 mL selective medium and grown again overnight at 30 °C. At an OD 600 of 1.5, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 mL distilled water, transferred to two 50-ml Falcon tubes, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed using SPE solution (1 M sorbitol, 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Na 2 EDTA, pH 7.5), Zymolyase 20T (10 mg mL −1 in 25% (w/v) glycerol), β-mercaptoethanol, lysis buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.02 M EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 12.8), and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. DNA was precipitated using sodium acetate and isopropanol and plasmid DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit (Qiagen). Recovered plasmids were transformed into E. coli cells and plated on LB plates with appropriate E. coli selection markers.

High molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from young leaves (1.5 g) using the Nanobind Plant Nuclei Big DNA Kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pacific Biosciences — PacBio, Menlo Park, CA) with the following modification. We used a nuclear isolation buffer supplemented with 350 mM sorbitol to resuspend ground tissue and during the first wash of the nuclei pellet. The extracted HMW DNA was further purified using the high-salt-phenol-chloroform method. The DNA purity was estimated using absorbance ratios (260/280 = 1.86 and 260/230 = 2.58) on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The final DNA yield (6 μg) was quantified using the Quantus Fluorometer (QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA Dye assay; Promega, Madison, WI). The size distribution of the HMW DNA was estimated using the Femto Pulse system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and we found that 50% of the fragments were 125 kb or longer.

For long genomic DNA sequencing, yeast strains were grown in 250 mL of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% pepton, and 2% glucose) with additional adenine (final concentration 40 mg/L) until OD 600 of 2.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation in a 50 mL falcon tube for 10 minutes at 4,500 rpm, washed with 50 mL of distilled water, and precipitated again. Precipitated cells were resuspended in 10 mL of lysis buffer (1 M sorbitol, 0.05 M EDTA, pH 8.0) and treated with 0.1 mL of zymolyase 20 T solution (12 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 ∘ C. Resulting spheroplasts were spun down by centrifugation (10 minutes at 4,500 rpm). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of TLB buffer (0.1 M NaCL, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, 0.025 M EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 20 μg/ml of RNAse A added right before use). The solution was incubated for 2 hours at 37 ∘ C. The solution was then treated by proteinase K (Thermo Scientific), added to a final concentration of 200 μg/mL, and incubated for 5 hours at 50 ∘ C. After this, 10 mL of UltraPure TM Buffer-Saturated Phenol (Thermo Scientific) was added.

### Weighing up the evidence on ethanol excipient use in common neonatal medications [^88c40ff0]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies (European Study for Neonatal Excipient Exposure and the Safe Excipient Exposure in Neonates and Small Children study) have highlighted that newborns are often exposed to ethanol in doses over the recommended adult dosing, as well as other potentially toxic excipients such as propylene glycol, parabens, polysorbate 80, benzoates, saccharin sodium, sorbitol, and benzalkonium chloride. These studies have provided guidance on how to limit or mitigate exposure to these excipients. It is vital to clearly state the concentrations of potentially toxic excipients including ethanol. The regulations for disclosing the concentration of excipients may differ between countries. In some medications it is difficult to find the exact concentration of ethanol. For example, in ferrous sulfate (Ferodan), the ethanol is contained in a flavoring agent (< 0.15% w/v), so we can assume that the overall ethanol content is < 0.15% w/v. The regulations for disclosing the concentration of excipients may differ between countries. Additionally, for the same active compound, there can be different formulations which contain different excipients or different concentrations of the same or different excipient. This information should be readily available to enable clinicians to make an informed decision on which formulation to best prescribe.

Mahajan et al. have highlighted that preterm infants of decreasing gestational age have greater accumulation of ethanol from medications containing ethanol as an excipient. If urinary ethanol byproducts are shown to correlate with blood ethanol levels, these biomarkers could provide a valuable non-invasive method to monitor ethanol exposure in these vulnerable preterm infants, guiding reductions in ethanol excipient exposures, and potentially helping to tease out the differential effects of ethanol exposure and prematurity on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. In the absence of clear information on the impact of relevant concentrations, on a precautionary basis we should try to minimize exposure of ethanol in preterm infants.

### Correlation between collagen solubility and skin optical clearing using sugars [^21342012]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Light scattering from collagen within skin limits light-based therapeutics while increasing the risk of epidermal thermal injury. Specific chemicals show the ability to reduce light scattering by reversibly altering the optical properties of skin. This study examines the correlation between collagen solubility and the optical clearing potential (OCP) of sugars and sugar-alcohols using in vitro rodent skin.

Materials and Methods

Collagen solubility in dextrose, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol was measured using near-UV spectroscopy. Light transmittance, reflectance, and rodent skin thickness were measured (giving skin reduced scattering coefficient) before and after exposure of the dermal surface to sugars and sugar-alcohols. OCP was calculated as the ratio of reduced scattering coefficients before and after exposures.

Results

Dextrose, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol had at least twice the collagen solubility and twice the OCP as compared to glycerol. In general, collagen solubility correlated with each agent's ability to optically clear rodent skin.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that sugar and sugar-alcohol interaction with collagen are a primary event in tissue optical clearing.

Intestinal crypts were isolated from 4 colonic biopsies per patient as described before. In short, colonic biopsies were washed thoroughly in chelating solution (5.6 mM Na 2 HPO 4, 8.0 mM KH 2 PO 4, 96.2 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 43.4 mM sucrose, 54.9 mM-sorbitol, 0.5 mM-dithiothreitol in deionized water) and incubated for 45 min in chelation solution supplemented with 2 mM EDTA at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Thereafter, biopsies were disrupted by rigorously pipetting with chelation solution to loosen and collect the crypts. The crypts were resuspended in 50% Matrigel (phenol red free, growth factor reduced, Corning, 356231) diluted by BM, and 4 droplets of 10 µL were plated in every well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. The culture plates were put at 37 °C for at least 20 min to allow Matrigel polymerization. Next, human expansion medium (HM) (BM supplemented with growth factors, Table S1) was added. The medium was replaced every other day and the organoids were split mechanically every 5–7 days, depending on their growth rate.

### Nanopore analysis of cis-diols in fruits [^06205f38]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Nanopore signatures of model cis -diols

Fruits, which contain a mixture of cis -diols such as 1,2-diphenols, alditols, α-hydroxy acids and saccharides –, were used as an example for this demonstration. These cis -diols react reversibly with phenylboronic acid (PBA) in an aqueous environment. Ten types of cis -diols containing compounds including catechin (CAT), neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA), D-sorbitol (D-SOR), xylitol (XYL), L-malic acid (L-MA), L-tartaric acid (L-TA), citric acid (CA), (2 R,3 S)-isocitric acid (ICIT), D-glucose (D-GLC) and D-fructose (D-FRU) were selected as model analytes (Fig. 2a). They represent 1,2-diphenols, alditols, α-hydroxy acids and saccharides that are widely encountered in fruits –. MspA-PBA, a hetero-octameric MspA nanopore modified with a sole phenylboronic acid (PBA) reactive adapter at site 90 (Fig. 2b), was prepared as previously reported,– (Methods). The PBA at the pore constriction reacts reversibly with cis -diols to form a boronate ester, and specifically binds molecules containing cis -diols in a heterogenous mixture (Supplementary Fig. 1). At room temperature in an aqueous measurement environment, the capture and release of a cis -diol analyte by MspA-PBA can last for more than a few milliseconds, which is ideal for data acquisition by single channel recording. The rate of the reaction can also be finely tuned by changes in the environmental pH and temperature –. The MspA nanopore, which has a conical lumen geometry that focuses the flow of ionic current to the pore constriction, also provides a high resolution of sensing in the discrimination of structurally similar compounds which has been well demonstrated in nanopore sensing of isomers of saccharides, alditolsand ribonucleotides. This high resolution thus enables direct recognition of target molecules from interfering analytes and accordingly, the need for sample separation is minimized.

### Effects of an osmotically active agent on colonic transit [^b2e57e96]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2006). Low credibility.

It is unknown if sorbitol, a widely used laxative agent, accelerates colonic transit, and if these effects are modified by concomitant meal ingestion. Colonic transit was assessed by (111)In scintigraphy in 40 healthy subjects. After a 24-h scan, subjects received sorbitol (30 mL of 70% solution) or dextrose (30 mL of 70% solution), administered with or without a meal. Colonic transit, breath hydrogen excretion, and symptom scores were recorded for 4 h thereafter. VAS scores for flatulence, but not other symptoms increased (P = 0.004) by 13.1 ± 6.3 mm (mean ± SEM) on a 100 mm scale after sorbitol alone or sorbitol with a meal (by 18.9 ± 7.2 mm), but not after dextrose. After adjusting for GC(24), sorbitol accelerated (P < 0.001) colonic transit (GC(28) = 3.0 ± 0.3) compared with dextrose (GC(28) = 2.2 ± 0.2), regardless of meal ingestion. Breath hydrogen excretion was correlated with the change in colonic transit (r = 0.52, P < 0.01) and with flatulence (r = 0.45, P = 0.003) after sugar ingestion. In healthy subjects, sorbitol accelerated colonic transit and increased flatulence but not other symptoms within 4 h, regardless of meal intake.

### Urine sorbitol and xylitol for the diagnosis of sorbitol dehydrogenase deficiency-related neuropathy [^8396c5c7]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) deficiency, due to biallelic loss-of-function variants in the SORD gene, is a recently recognized cause of autosomal recessive hereditary neuropathy. Specific diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone, and molecular genetic testing of SORD is complicated by the presence of a pseudogene. Biochemical testing of serum sorbitol is suggested as a potential biomarker. We report a novel urine biochemical profile of elevated excretion of sorbitol and a second polyol, xylitol, to aid in the identification of individuals with SORD-related neuropathy.

Methods

Patients with confirmed or suspected SORD-related neuropathy were recruited by clinicians from 7 academic medical centers and 1 nonprofit specialty care center. Urine was analyzed by a clinically validated, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to measure sorbitol and xylitol excretion. Over 700 reference samples were evaluated from residual clinical samples. Clinical and molecular findings were gathered using a standardized questionnaire.

Results

Nineteen individuals with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of SORD-related neuropathy (median age 31 years, 47% female) and 715 reference samples were used to determine the initial performance of this index urine test. The median sorbitol excretion in affected individuals was 638 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 456; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 198). The median xylitol excretion was 1,577 mmol/mol creatinine (1st percentile of disease range = 1,242; reference median = 7, reference 99th percentile = 102). In this patient cohort, the combination of sorbitol and xylitol yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity for SORD-related neuropathy. Four additional individuals who had clinical phenotypes compatible with SORD-related neuropathy had abnormal urine sorbitol/xylitol profile, 2 with genotypes involving a variant of unknown significance in SORD and 2 with a single heterozygous pathogenic SORD variant detected, whereas normal urine sorbitol/xylitol levels were observed in 11 asymptomatic, heterozygous carriers.

Discussion

These data demonstrate the clinical utility of urine sorbitol and xylitol analysis in the screening and diagnosis of SORD deficiency-related neuropathy. In addition, this is the first description of elevated xylitol in SORD deficiency as a clinically informative biomarker, which may increase the specificity of biochemical testing.

### Influence of D-arabitol and ribitol on neuronal network activity [^ef244478]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

To date, two new defects in the pentose phosphate pathway have been identified in patients with abnormalities in their polyol profiles. Some of them presented with neurological symptoms of so far unknown aetiology. The pathophysiological role of polyols, e.g. in the brain, is relatively unknown. We tested the neurotoxicity of polyols using a 'neurochip' model. After exposure of cortical rat neurons to D-arabitol and ribitol in increasing concentrations up to 10 mmol/L, the electrophysiological activity was measured. No acute effect on the spontaneous network activity of cortical neurons was observed. We speculate that polyols have only secondary effects on brain dysfunction.

Bacterial isolates, typing and antibiotic susceptibility testing

The submitted isolates were cultured on 5% horse blood agar (SSI Diagnostica, Hillerød, Denmark) at 36°C in ambient air with 5% CO 2. The cultures were inspected for purity of growth, beta-haemolysis and colony morphology, and stored at −80°C. Invasive BHS isolates were from hospitalized patients with a few exceptions, as acutely ill patients are admitted directly to the nearest public hospital in Denmark.

Lancefield groups A, B, C or G were confirmed by agglutination tests using Latex grouping reagents A, B, C and G (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) as recommended by the manufacturer. For group C isolates fermentation of trehalose or sorbitol was determined at 36°C overnight (Difco phenol red medium; SSI Diagnostica) and classified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis if trehalose was fermented, and as S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus if sorbitol was fermented.

The T-type was determined using type-specific antisera (Sevapharma, Prague, Czech Republic) and performed as recommended by the manufacturer on all GAS isolates, GCS isolates 2005–2006 and GGS isolates 2005–2007.

Serotyping was performed on all GBS isolates by the latex agglutination test and the capillary precipitation test using GBS latex and type-specific antisera (SSI Diagnostica) as recommended by the manufacturer. GBS isolates from 2008 to 2011 that were non-typable (NT) by these methods or provided an ambiguous result were also typed with multiplex-PCR using primers for detection of serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, VII and IX.

The emm sequence-type was determined as described by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

All isolates were tested by disc diffusion (Oxoid) for susceptibility to erythromycin (15 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), tetracycline (30 μg) and oxacillin/penicillin (1 μg), followed by MIC determination using Etest (bioMérieux SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France) on isolates that were non-sensitive on the screening tests as described by the manufacturers. EUCAST breakpoints were used.

Blood samples (2 mL) for PK analysis were collected via an indwelling cannula or direct venipuncture into a dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube before dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 h postdose. Blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 g to 2,000 g at 4°C, and plasma was harvested, frozen, and stored at –20°C until analysis. Plasma lamivudine concentrations were measured using a validated method by Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD; Middleton, WI). Lamivudine and the internal standard, [13 C 15 N 2]‐lamivudine, were isolated through protein precipitation. The final extract was analyzed by high‐performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry using positive ion electrospray. The lower and upper limits of quantitation were 2.5 and 2,500 ng/mL, respectively, for a 50‐μL plasma aliquot.

### Acute phenol poisoning: a life-threatening hazard of chronic pain relief [^f445ac23]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Phenol (carbolic acid, a higher alcohol) has been used for local analgesic therapy for a long time. Several complications of phenol therapy can occur by exposure through inhalational, oral, and dermal routes. Renal and pulmonary toxicity arising from the exposure to injectable phenol, however, has only been reported in a few case reports.

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old man inadvertently received 10 cc of 89% phenol injection. It resulted in the development of acute respiratory and renal failure requiring intubation and hemodialysis, respectively. He improved clinically with the recovery of renal function. However, the chest x-ray and CT scan showed persistent nodular pulmonary infiltrates which resolved by six months.

Conclusion

We report here an unusual case of acute respiratory and acute renal failure following accidental overdose of phenol. The case highlights potential development of multiple organ failure with persistence of organ dysfunction, an unusual danger associated with the overdose of injectable phenol for neurolysis.

### Urinary sorbitol measurement and the effect of an aldose reductase inhibitor on its concentration in the diabetic state [^8a03a8d1]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

The amounts of sorbitol (SOR) excreted in 24-h urine were determined on two groups, i.e., diabetic and nondiabetic patients, using an improved method in which ion exchange resin column processing was applied, and these levels were compared with SOR levels in whole blood. Urinary SOR concentration was also determined in diabetic and normal rats in the same manner and its relationship to aldose reductase (AR) activity in whole blood was investigated. Changes in SOR levels in urine and whole blood were compared in diabetic rats after administration of an AR inhibitor (ARI). Whole blood SOR levels and urinary SOR excretion were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. The same results were obtained in the animal models. In diabetic rats, the urinary SOR excretion was about five times higher than that in control rats, and the AR activity in whole blood was also significantly higher. The increase in urinary SOR excretion and whole blood SOR levels, as well as AR activity, in blood in the diabetic state was inhibited by ARI administration. The influence of the diabetic state and the efficacy of the ARI were more marked in urinary SOR excretion than in whole blood SOR levels. These data indicate that determinations of urinary SOR excretion and AR activity are easily measurable and of benefit to assessing the diabetic condition.

High molecular weight genomic DNA isolation.

High molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from 5 g of leaf tissue (Jcal-S-LA-6) using the Nanobind Plant Nuclei Big DNA Kit (Pacific Biosciences — PacBio, Menlo Park, California) and a plant-specific protocol with the following modification. We used a nuclear isolation buffer supplemented with 350 mM Sorbitol to resuspend ground tissue and during the first wash of the nuclei pellet. The extracted HMW DNA was further purified using the high-salt-phenol-chloroform method (PacBio). The DNA purity (260/280 = 1.83 and 260/230 = 2.34) was assessed by absorbance ratios on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The DNA yield (47 ng/µL; 17 µg total) was quantified using QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA Dye assay (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). The size distribution of the HMW DNA was estimated using the Femto Pulse system (Agilent, Santa Clara, California), and found that 51% of the total fragments were > 90 kb.

Phenolic disinfectants in nurseries — safety and handling emphasize that the use of phenolics in nurseries has been questioned because of hyperbilirubinemia in infants placed in bassinets where phenolic detergents were used, and bilirubin levels were reported to increase in phenolic-exposed infants compared with nonphenolic-exposed infants when prepared according to the manufacturers' recommended dilution. If phenolics are used to clean nursery floors, they must be diluted as recommended on the product label. Phenolics (and other disinfectants) should not be used to clean infant bassinets and incubators while occupied. If phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and incubators, the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before reuse of infant bassinets and incubators.

Phenolics — mechanism and antimicrobial spectrum are summarized with quantitative examples: In high concentrations, phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison, and at low concentrations phenol and higher molecular-weight derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall. Published reports showed commonly used phenolics were bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and tuberculocidal, though one study demonstrated little or no virucidal effect against coxsackie B4, echovirus 11, and poliovirus 1. Specific data include that 12% ortho-phenylphenol failed to inactivate hydrophilic viruses after a 10-minute exposure time while 5% phenol was lethal; a 0.5% dilution of a phenolic (2.8% ortho-phenylphenol and 2.7% ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol) inactivated HIV; and a 2% solution of a phenolic (15% ortho-phenylphenol and 6.3% para-tertiary-amylphenol) inactivated all but one of 11 fungi tested. Manufacturers' data using standardized AOAC methods indicate commercial phenolics are not sporicidal but are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use-dilution.

### Unveiling a pervasive DNA adenine methylation regulatory network in the early-diverging fungus rhizopus microsporus [^deb85969]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Mutant strain generation and validation

R. microsporus mutant strains were generated via CRISPR-Cas9–mediated disruption of target genes using microhomology-directed repair DNA templates. For wc-2c (ID: 1921537) and znf1 (ID: 1799646) disruption, a template DNA containing the pyrF (ID: 1869696) gene flanked by 38 nt homology regions was used to disrupt the targeted gene. Recombination was enabled through the directed double-strand break (DSB) provoked by Cas9 in an uracil-auxotrophic strain (UM1). Designed crRNAs (Alt-R TM CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA) used to target the CRISPR/Cas9 system were purchased from IDT (Supplementary Data 5). crRNAs were coupled with tracRNA (Alt-R TM CRISPR-Cas9 tracRNA, IDT) to form the gRNA, which was assembled in vitro with Cas9 (Alt-R TM S.p. Cas9 nuclease, IDT) to form the ribonucleoprotein complex. Gene disruptions and homo/heterokaryosis were validated by PCR using primers flanking the disruption site that amplifies both WT and mutant nuclei if present. All primers used for construct amplification and PCR validation are listed in Supplementary Data 5. DNA was extracted following a phenol/chloroform extraction, and all PCR amplifications were performed with the Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent), adapting the annealing temperature to each primer pair following the manufacturer's recommendations.

Fungal growth conditions

All the fungal strains used and generated in this work derive from Rhizopus microsporus ATCC 11559. Transformants of the auxotrophic strain UM1 strainusing the pyrF marker were grown in Minimal Media with Casamino acids (MMC). During transformation, electroporated protoplasts were resuspended in ice-cold Yeast Peptone Glucose (YPG) media +0.5 M Sorbitol for 90 min and then centrifugated at 80 × g and resuspended in YNB media +0.5 M Sorbitol. All strains were grown at 30 °C under light or dark conditions as specified. DAP-seq and gene expression samples were collected 24 h after inoculating 1·10 6 spores per plate. To analyze the expression of the zinc-regulated genes, the medium was supplemented with 20 mg/L of ZnSO 4.

CviPI fusion protein to express, bind the LacO array, and methylate the neighboring DNA. To extract genomic DNA, cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 mL spheroplasting solution (1 M sorbitol, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/mL zymolyase), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After a brief centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (65 mM EDTA, 52 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS; pH 8.0) and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min. Cell lysate was then sonicated with Diagenode Biorupter Pico to shear DNA (EZ mode, 30 s on, 30 s off, 10 cycles). Genomic DNA was purified by standard phenol-chloroform DNA extraction. A total of 5–10 µg genomic DNA was expected. Gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the shearing efficiency. Samples with DNA fragment size ranging from 300 bp to 600 bp were used for downstream immunoprecipitation and sequencing library preparation.

### Aqueous amine enables sustainable monosaccharide, monophenol, and pyridine base coproduction in lignocellulosic biorefineries [^0e19715b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In pursuit of reducing the dependence on depleting fossil resources and meeting the rising energy requirements, it is an attractive but challenging opportunity to process inedible biomass into various biobased products and bioenergy in lignocellulosic biorefineris –. Given the structural features of lignocellulose components, achieving fermentable sugar release for biofuel production is a well-known and sought-after illustration for structural carbohydrate utilization (cellulose and hemicelluloses, accounting for 60–85 wt%). Valorizing lignin (accounting for 15–30 wt%) composed of phenylpropanoid units into useful chemicals is another key to amplifying the economic viability of future biorefineries.

According to the developing trend of biorefineries, the central conception is increasingly shifting from the traditional carbohydrate-first strategy toward the recent lignin-first scenario. Historically, studies on lignocellulosic biorefinery focused exclusively on optimizing the utilization of carbohydrates (e.g. for cellulosic ethanol production) under harsh processing conditions. Lignin was always considered a collateral product to extract some extra value. Within this context, the processability of the isolated lignin into valuable monomers was largely restricted owing to its highly condensed structures (more interlinked C–C bonds). Recently, recognizing the enormous potential of lignin as the most abundant aromatic reservoir in nature, a new biorefinery scheme has emerged, termed lignin-first, in which active stabilization approaches are developed to avoid condensation reactions that lead to more recalcitrant lignin structures. This emerging biorefinery paradigm, which targets deriving more value from lignin than carbohydrate-first processing, is generally accomplished by the use of protection-group chemistries or reductive stabilization of reactive lignin intermediates. To name a few, α, γ-diol group of β–O–4′ motif was stabilized by adding formaldehyde to form 1,3-dioxane rings, stable acetal was formed between diols and unstable C2-aldehyde fragments, the C α alcohol of β–O–4′ was oxidized to a ketone, and early-stage catalytic conversion of lignin was achieved by Reductive Catalytic Fractionation (RCF) with 2-propanol as an H-donor. Although carbohydrates could be upgraded to dissolving pulp in lignin-first biorefining, the enzymatic hydrolyzability of pretreated lignocellulose did not perform as well as those obtained in carbohydrate-first strategy. In other words, a high cellulase dosage (~30 FPU/g glucan, or more,) is usually required to enable efficient enzymatic carbohydrate conversion. Therefore, the development of an effective strategy to upgrade the entire lignocellulose is still in demand.

### Enhanced removal of phenol with saline solution over alcohol: an in vitro study [^c2f916cf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Phenol cauterization is a chemical equivalent often chosen for treatment of ingrown toenails. Many reports describe intraoperative irrigation, or lavage, of the wound with various types of alcohol to neutralize any remaining phenol. There are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether true neutralization or merely effective removal of excess phenol is needed.

Objective

The aim of our study was to analyze the suitability and effectiveness of ethyl alcohol versus sterile saline when used in a lavage step after phenol application in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Methods

We performed an in vitro study using human skin and a diffusion cell apparatus to measure the amount of phenol recovered after lavage with ethyl alcohol or sterile saline.

Results

When the wound was irrigated with ethyl alcohol, the total phenol recovered after two irrigation washes was 55.7% of the original amount initially used in treatment, compared with 80.4% when sterile saline solution was used for irrigation.

Conclusion

Alcohol and sterile saline solution do not neutralize phenol but dilute it and aid in its removal. We found that saline solution recovered more phenol than when washing with alcohol and recommend its use instead of alcohol for irrigation purposes after chemical matrixectomy.

### An exploratory study; the therapeutic effects of premixed activated charcoal-sorbitol administration in patients poisoned with organophosphate pesticide [^ec54a45b]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of activated charcoal (AC) mixed with cathartics for gastric decontamination in the management of organophosphate (OP) poisoning remain unknown due to limited clinical evidence. This exploratory study assessed the effectiveness of premixed AC-sorbitol as a treatment for OP poisoning.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective observational case study included patients who either did not receive AC-sorbitol or received a single dose of AC-sorbitol within 24 h after OP ingestion. The patients were divided into three groups: no AC-sorbitol treatment, patients who received AC-sorbitol within 1 h of OP ingestion, and patients who received AC-sorbitol more than 1 h after OP ingestion. Mortality, the development of respiratory failure, and the duration of mechanical ventilation were used as outcome measurements for effectiveness, whereas aspiration pneumonia and electrolyte imbalance were employed as safety measurements.

Result

Among 262 patients with OP poisoning, 198 were included. Of these, 133 patients did not receive AC-sorbitol, whereas 14 and 51 patients received AC-sorbitol within 1 h or more than 1 h after ingestion, respectively. The time from ingestion to hospital arrival and time from ingestion to administration of atropine and pralidoxime differed among the groups, whereas other characteristics, including age, amount ingested, and type of ingested OP, were similar among the groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that the administration of AC-sorbitol was not associated with outcome measures for effectiveness and did not significantly increase either aspiration pneumonia or electrolyte imbalances during hospitalization.

Discussion and Conclusion

The administration of AC-sorbitol exerted neither beneficial nor harmful effects on the outcomes of OP-poisoned patients regardless of the time from OP ingestion to administration, compared with those of patients who did not receive AC-sorbitol. However, this study enrolled a small number of patients who received AC-sorbitol; further qualified trials with a sufficient number of patients are therefore needed.

For each family, 30-40g of rosette tissue was harvested from plants after 6–7 weeks of growth. To reduce starch content, plants were kept in the dark for two days prior to collecting leaf tissue, and then the harvested tissue was stored overnight in the dark at a 4°. All subsequent tissue-processing and DNA-extraction steps were carried out in a 4° cold room or refrigerated centrifuge unless stated otherwise.

Leaf tissue was disrupted in high salt isolation buffer (1.25 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol), using 10 mL of buffer per g of tissue. Disruption was performed with a standard kitchen blender and a series of five bursts of ∼10 s each with ∼10 s of settling time between each burst, followed by filtration through four layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth. Filtrates were then centrifuged at 150 rcf for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to new bottles and centrifuged at 1500 rcf for 20 min. The supernatant was then again transferred to new bottles and centrifuged at 15,000 rcf for 20 min. After discarding the resulting supernatant, the mitochondrial pellets, were gently but thoroughly resuspended in 3 mL of DNase buffer (0.35 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 15 mM MgCl 2) with a paintbrush. Then 7 mL of DNase solution (DNase I dissolved in DNase buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) was added to each resuspended pellet. The samples were incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional gentle swirling to digest contaminating plastid and nuclear DNA. Three volumes of wash buffer (0.35 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA) was added to each sample followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rcf for 20 min. The resulting pellets were washed two more times by resuspending in 20 mL wash buffer and centrifuging at 12,000 rcf for 20 min. The final washed pellet was resuspended in 1 mL wash buffer. One-twentieth volume of a 20 mg/ml proteinase K solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Mitochondria were lysed by adding one-fifth volume of lysis buffer (5% N-lauryl sarcosine Na salt; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA) followed by gentle mixing by inversion for 10 min at room temperature. One volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added followed by vortexing for 5 s and centrifugation at 12,000 rcf for 10 min. The resulting aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and incubated with 4 µl of a 10 mg/ml RNase A solution. The samples were then treated with two rounds of cleanup with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol as described above followed by precipitation with one volume of ice-cold isopropanol and incubation for at least 20 min at -20°. Precipitated DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rcf for 10 min and washed twice with 500 µl of ice-cold 70% ethanol. The final DNA pellet was air dried and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA).

### Resolving the metabolism of monolignols and other lignin-related aromatic compounds in xanthomonas citri [^5140036b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

The model plant pathogen metabolizes a diverse range of lignin-related aromatics

To investigate if X. citri 306 can grow using lignin-related aromatic compounds as the main carbon source, we performed growth assays in minimal medium supplemented with 21 aromatic monomers, representative of H, G and S units (Fig. 1). Additionally, we analyzed two complex samples of lignin-derived compounds (LDC-I and LDC-II) produced from sugarcane bagasse (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The main aromatic monomers detected in the LDC-I sample were p -coumarate, ferulate, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, along with organic acids (acetate, formate, lactate) and sugars (arabinose, glucose) (Supplementary Table 1). In LDC-II, the most abundant molecules detected were acetate and the aromatic compounds catechol, 3-methoxy-catechol, phenol, guaiacol and pyrogallol (Supplementary Table 1).

Fig. 1
Summary of growth conditions and analyses of aromatics toxicity and depletion.

Growth assays in minimal medium (XVM2m) and XVM2m plus 5 mmol L − 1 glucose (XVM2m(G)) supplemented with 5 mmol L − 1 of lignin-related aromatic compounds or 1 g L − 1 LDC-I or 0.3 g L − 1 LDC-II. LDC = lignin-derived compounds. LDC-I is a residual liquid stream resulting from the acid precipitation of lignin from an alkaline liquor of sugarcane bagasse. LDC-II is a bio-oil rich in aromatic monomers, obtained by hydrothermal depolymerization of an alkaline lignin from sugarcane bagasse (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The red gradient represents differences in growth parameters from low (blank) to high (red). HPLC analyses were performed using XVM2m(G) medium plus 2 mmol L − 1 aryl alcohols, 1 mmol L − 1 aldehydes, 5 mmol L − 1 acids, or 50 µmol L − 1 of either aryl alcohols or acids. The blue color bar represents the percentage of aromatic compound depleted by X. citri 306 after around 15 h of growth (as detailed in Supplementary Table 2). Conc. concentration, N. A. not analyzed. Growth data are shown as mean ± SD of n = 3 or n = 4 biological replicates.

### Osmotic and stimulant laxatives for the management of childhood constipation [^3208f47b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation within childhood is an extremely common problem. Despite the widespread use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives by health professionals to manage constipation in children, there has been a long standing paucity of high quality evidence to support this practice.

Objectives

We set out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic and stimulant laxatives used to treat functional childhood constipation.

Search Methods

The search (inception to May 7, 2012) was standardised and not limited by language and included electronic searching (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register), reference searching of all included studies, personal contacts and drug companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared osmotic or stimulant laxatives with either placebo or another intervention, with patients aged 0 to 18 years old were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relevant papers were identified and the authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Cochrane RevMan software was used for analyses. Patients with final missing outcomes were assumed to have relapsed. For continuous outcomes we calculated a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a fixed-effect model. The chi square and I(2) statistics were used to assess statistical heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used in situations of unexplained heterogeneity

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs (1643 patients) were included in the review. Nine studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Meta-analysis of two studies (101 patients) comparing polyethylene glycol (PEG) with placebo showed a significantly increased number of stools per week with PEG (MD 2.61 stools per week, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.08). Common adverse events in the placebo-controlled studies included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and headache. Meta-analysis of 4 studies with 338 participants comparing PEG with lactulose showed significantly greater stools per week with PEG (MD 0.95 stools per week, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.44), although follow up was short. Patients who received PEG were significantly less likely to require additional laxative therapies. Eighteen per cent of PEG patients required additional therapies compared to 30% of lactulose patients (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.89). No serious adverse events were reported with either agent. Common adverse events in these studies included diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and pruritis ani. Meta-analysis of 3 studies with 211 participants comparing PEG with milk of magnesia showed that the stools/wk was significantly greater with PEG (MD 0.69 stools per week, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89). However, the magnitude of this difference is quite small and may not be clinically significant. One child was noted to be allergic to PEG, but there were no other serious adverse events reported. Meta-analysis of 2 studies with 287 patients comparing liquid paraffin (mineral oil) with lactulose revealed a relatively large statistically significant difference in the number of stools per week favouring paraffin (MD 4.94 stools per week, 95% CI 4.28 to 5.61). No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events included abdominal pain, distention and watery stools. No statistically significant differences in the number of stools per week were found between PEG and enemas (1 study, 90 patients, MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.58 to 3.58), dietary fibre mix and lactulose (1 study, 125 patients, P = 0.481), senna and lactulose (1 study, 21 patients, P > 0.05), lactitol and lactulose (1 study, 51 patients, MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.63 to 1.03), and PEG and liquid paraffin (1 study, 158 patients, MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.38 to 1.78).

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled analyses suggest that PEG preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. Thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow up. However, PEG appears safe and well tolerated. There is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil), which was also well tolerated. There is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. Further research is needed to investigate the long term use of PEG for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin.

### Erythrocytic sorbitol contents in diabetic patients correlate with blood aldose reductase protein contents and plasma glucose levels, and are normalized by the potent aldose reductase inhibitor fidarestat (SNK-860) [^8ea6e1fa]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2004). Low credibility.

The accumulation of sorbitol by the activated polyol pathway is considered to be a major cause of diabetic neuropathy. Because the erythrocytic sorbitol contents reportedly reflects that in nerves, erythrocytic sorbitol measurement would be useful for confirming the effect of an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI). In this study, we examined erythrocytic sorbitol contents in healthy subjects and diabetic patients under fasting and postprandial conditions. Then, the contributions of blood aldose reductase (AR) contents and plasma glucose levels to the accumulated erythrocytic sorbitol contents were also analyzed. Erythrocytic sorbitol contents in the healthy subjects were 11.7 and 12.5–12.6 nmol/g Hb in fasting and postprandial status, respectively. In contrast, the erythrocytic sorbitol contents in diabetic patients were apparently higher (approximately 2.5-fold), but fidarestat treatment restored the elevated erythrocytic sorbitol contents to normal. In the diabetic patients, erythrocytic sorbitol contents were highly correlated with blood AR contents multiplied by the plasma glucose levels, whereas in the normal and fidarestat-treated diabetic patients no such correlation was observed. Taken together, these results suggest both the blood AR contents and the plasma glucose levels are factors determining erythrocytic sorbitol contents in diabetic patients. Notably, the potent ARI fidarestat was shown to normalize elevated erythrocytic sorbitol contents.

### Gastric emptying of solutions containing the natural sweetener erythritol and effects on gut hormone secretion in humans: a pilot dose-ranging study [^9e4b7dc4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Twelve normal‐weight, healthy individuals (seven men and five women; mean BMI: 21.7 ± 0.4, range: 19.4‐24.0 kg/m 2; mean age: 26.2 ± 2.0, range: 18‐40 years) participated in the study (Appendix S2, Figure S1). All the subjects tolerated the study well, and there were no adverse events during the period of the study. Five subjects did not receive placebo treatment and, therefore, complete data for seven (placebo) to 12 participants (all erythritol doses) were available for analysis. There was no order effect for the active treatments. For each measured variable, baseline values were compared between the treatments. None of these variables were statistically significant between the treatments.

### Elevated fasting serum xylitol levels are associated with a lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes in the Chinese population [^3e4b52a3]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. Firstly, it was a nested case-control study with a small sample size, which could not prove causality. Secondly, the detection method could not distinguish between endogenous and exogenous xylitol. Lastly, the roles of endogenous xylitol in the pathology of diabetes mellitus remain unclear.

In conclusion, we found that those with elevated fasting serum xylitol levels had a lower risk of progressing to diabetes. Importantly, we found that xylitol levels were negatively associated with changes in fasting glycemia. These findings suggest that fasting serum xylitol levels may serve as an important predictor and protective factor against diabetes development. However, to validate these findings, further prospective studies with larger sample sizes utilizing molecular probe techniques focused on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism intervened by xylitol are needed.

### Liver: the gut is a key target of therapy in hepatic encephalopathy [^efa069e4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Little progress has been made in the pharmacological management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy, partly because it is difficult to perform clinical trials in this group of patients. A new clinical trial now suggests that polyethylene glycol is more effective than the current standard first-line therapy in these patients.

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^134c94a0]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Combination agents — sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate for colonoscopy preparation — have recently become available in the United States and act via a stimulant laxative and an osmotic laxative. Two phase 3 U.S. trials support this regimen: one split-dose trial versus a day-before low-volume 2-L PEG-ELS with 10 mg bisacodyl found improved bowel cleansing and patient acceptance but adequate preparation was only 84.2%; the other day-before trial found noninferiority to PEG-ELS with 10 mg bisacodyl with adequate cleansing in only 83%. Adverse events are generally gastrointestinal and mild to moderate.

### Sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age [^819f0e0e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of oral sucrose or glucose with and without non-nutritive sucking is frequently used as a non-pharmacological intervention for needle-related procedural pain relief in infants.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age compared with no treatment, placebo, other sweet-tasting solutions, or pharmacological or other non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012); MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to 2012); CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 2012). The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was also searched for any ongoing trials. Clinical trial registries, conference proceedings and references for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also searched. An updated search was run to capture any new publications before finalising the review in April 2012 and no new included studies were identified. Two review authors (MK & JF) independently abstracted data and assessed quality using a standard form. Authors have been contacted for missing data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials using a sweet-tasting solution to treat pain in healthy term infants (gestational age 37 weeks and over), between one month and 12 months of age who required needle-related procedures. These procedures included but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, venepuncture, and heel lance. Studies in which the painful procedure was circumcision, lumbar puncture or supra-pubic bladder aspiration were not included as they are more severe and painful than needle-related procedures. Control conditions included no treatment or placebo (water) or any other identical intervention (same appearance and consistency) without active ingredient, another sweet-tasting solution, a pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. paracetamol, topical anaesthetic cream), non-pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. distraction method, non-nutritive sucking).

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. We report mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We planned to report risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes. The Chi(2) test and I(2) statistic were used to assess between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

Sixty-five (65) studies were identified for possible inclusion in this review. Fourteen published RCTs with a total of 1551 participants met the inclusion criteria. Duration of cry was significantly reduced in infants who were administered a sweet-tasting solution [MD -13.47 (95% CI -16.80 to -10.15)], P < 0.00001 compared with water. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 94%) that we were unable to explain. Meta-analysis was not able to be undertaken for any of the other outcome measures, except for cry duration, because of differences in study design. However, most of the individual studies that measured pain found sucrose to significantly reduce pain compared with the control group. One study compared sucrose and Lidocaine-prilocaine cream and no significant difference was found between the two treatments for the outcomes pain and cry duration. Due to the differences between the studies, we were unable to identify the optimal concentration, volume or method of administration of sweet-tasting solutions in infants aged one to 12 months. Further large RCTs are needed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confidently judge the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions in reducing needle-related pain in infants (one month to 12 months of age). The treatments do, however, appear promising. Data from a series of individual trials are promising, as are the results from a subset meta-analysis of studies measuring duration of crying. Further well controlled RCTs are warranted in this population to determine the optimal concentration, volume, method of administration, and possible adverse effects.

### Tunable and functional deep eutectic solvents for lignocellulose valorization [^597d1a81]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

By developing ternary DES compositions that involve diols beside oxalic acid/choline chloride, here we achieve the incorporation of a stabilization function, essential in biorefining, in DES systems. Notably, we were able to control the reactivity of the β-O-4 moiety to result in either in scission or protection in model compounds by simply tuning the relative ratios of the DES components (Fig. 3). For lignocellulose, the system showed excellent fractionation efficiency under mild conditions, while maintaining the value of both the cellulose as well as lignin constituents. In the lignins so obtained, the native β-O-4 moiety was largely preserved due to EG stabilization, while diol incorporation was tunable by variation of DES composition. These lignins delivered 6 times more aromatic monomers upon depolymerization via hydrogenolysis than the condensed analogs obtained using binary (ChCl/OA) DES and good yields of aromatic monomers from acidolysis. These monomers could be further converted to a number of attractive products, e.g. as previously shown toward phenolor to higher-value molecules such as pharmaceuticals or biologically active molecules –, enhancing the economic feasibility of this approach. This is further enhanced by the excellent glucose yield obtained from the cellulose residues. When comparing the quality of the cellulose residues both by SEM analysis and enzymatic hydrolysis, a clear difference was observed: The ternary DES was able to completely suppress condensed lignin formation and result in high glucose yields (95.9 ± 2.12%) compared to (58.8 ± 5.01%) for the classical (ChCl/OA) DES.

### Polihexanide solution is more efficient than alcohol to remove phenol in chemical matricectomy: an in vitro study [^0874951f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

For treatment of ingrown toenails, a phenolization approach is often chosen. Many reports describe a lavage of the wound with alcohol to neutralize any residual phenol; however, it remains uncertain if there is a more effective solution for use in the lavage step. The aim of our study was to analyze the suitability and effectiveness of 0.1% polihexanide solution compared with isopropyl alcohol in the removal of excess phenol after treatment for ingrown toenails. We performed an in vitro study using human matrix and a diffusion cell apparatus to measure the amount of phenol remaining after two lavage washes. The effect of phenol evaporation was also examined. When phenol was irrigated with alcohol alone, 27.43 ± 4.10mg (57.74%) of the initial amount of phenol was recovered. If irrigated with 0.1% polihexanide, 35.98 ± 2.93mg (75.74%) of phenol was recovered. These results indicate that a polihexanide lavage step has significantly higher efficiency for removing excess phenol relative to alcohol.

### Oral contrast agents for small bowel MRI: comparison of different additives to optimize bowel distension [^6dba0295]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare two osmotic carbohydrate sugar alcohols (mannitol 2.5% and sorbitol 2.5%, 2.0%, and 1.5% watery solutions) in combination with 0.2% locust bean gum (LBG) for small bowel distension for MR imaging. Small bowel distension was quantified on coronal 2D TrueFISP images by measuring the diameters of 16 small bowel loops in each of 12 healthy subjects (age range 31–55 years). Additionally, the grade of small bowel distension was rated qualitatively. Patient acceptance concerning nausea, vomiting, flatulence, and diarrhea was noted for each solution, and all results were compared by a Wilcoxon test or t test, respectively. The ingestion of water combined with LBG and either 2.5% mannitol or 2.0% sorbitol showed the best distension of the small bowel. The lowest side effect rate was observed following ingestion of sorbitol in a concentration of 2.0 and 1.5%. Based on these data, we recommend a combination of LBG and 2% sorbitol use for optimal bowel distension and minimal side effects resulting in enhanced patient acceptance.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^c1a2ca20]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Chemodenervation and neurolysis — scope and practical considerations: Chemodenervation and neurolysis via localized injections can help provide focal spasticity relief, with medications including botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), phenol, and alcohol. In the United States, health insurance limitations often affect the choice of therapeutic options due to costs and restrictions on repeated injections and dosage, and consequently phenol neurolysis (PN) and BoNT can be used in combination, with PN frequently reserved for proximal nerves and BoNT used for distal musculature.

### Erythrocyte sorbitol level as a predictor of the efficacy of epalrestat treatment for diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy [^40742b77]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between the effect of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) on the activation of the polyol pathway and on diabetic neuropathy has not been fully established. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of epalrestat (150 mg/day), an ARI, on erythrocyte sorbitol levels as an index of polyol activation and on nerve function test results in 43 patients with diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. After 6 months of epalrestat administration, erythrocyte sorbitol levels did not decrease in patients as a whole. However, a decrease in erythrocyte sorbitol levels during epalrestat administration was significantly correlated with baseline erythrocyte sorbitol levels (rho = -.47, P < .01): The higher the level at baseline, the greater the decrease after epalrestat treatment. Moreover, the mean sorbitol level during epalrestat treatment was associated with the beneficial effect of epalrestat on vibration sensitivity as measured with a C-128 tuning fork (rho = -.66, P < .01) and/or a pallesthesiometer TM-31A (rho = .53, P < .05). On the other hand, erythrocyte sorbitol levels did not reflect the prognosis of nerve conduction velocity. These findings at least partly suggest a causal relationship between polyol activation and the development of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitor treatment may be clinically useful in the control of polyol activation, especially in patients with excessive accumulation of sorbitol.

### Pain-relieving agents for infantile colic [^c9caae69]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile colic is a common disorder in the first months of life, affecting somewhere between 4% and 28% of infants worldwide, depending on geography and definitions used. Although it is self limiting and resolves by four months of age, colic is perceived by parents as a problem that requires action. Pain-relieving agents, such as drugs, sugars and herbal remedies, have been suggested as interventions to reduce crying episodes and severity of symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pain-relieving agents for reducing colic in infants younger than four months of age.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in March 2015 and again in May 2016: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO, along with 11 other databases. We also searched two trial registers, four thesis repositories and the reference lists of relevant studies to identify unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating the effects of pain-relieving agents given to infants with colic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs involving 1014 infants. All studies were small and at high risk of bias, often presenting major shortcomings across multiple design factors (e.g. selection, performance, attrition, lack of washout period). Three studies compared simethicone with placebo, and one with Mentha piperita; four studies compared herbal agents with placebo; two compared sucrose or glucose with placebo; five compared dicyclomine with placebo; and two compared cimetropium - one against placebo and the other at two different dosages. One multiple-arm study compared sucrose and herbal tea versus no treatment. Simethicone. Comparison with placebo revealed no difference in daily hours of crying reported for simethicone at the end of treatment in one small, low-quality study involving 27 infants. A meta-analysis of data from two cross-over studies comparing simethicone with placebo showed no difference in the number of of infants who responded positively to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.23; 110 infants, low-quality evidence). One small study (30 participants) compared simethicone with Mentha piperita and found no difference in crying duration, number of crying episodes or number of responders. Herbal agents. We found low-quality evidence suggesting that herbal agents reduce the duration of crying compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 1.33, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.96; three studies, 279 infants), with different magnitude of benefit noted across studies (I² = 96%). We found moderate-quality evidence indicating that herbal agents increase response over placebo (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.70; three studies, 277 infants). Sucrose. One very low-quality study involving 35 infants reported that sucrose reduced hours spent crying compared with placebo (MD 1.72, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.06). Dicyclomine. We could consider only one of the five studies of dicyclomine (48 infants) for the primary comparison. In this study, more of the infants given dicyclomine responded than than those given placebo (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.34). Cimetropium bromide. Data from one very low-quality study comparing cimetropium bromide with placebo showed reduced crying duration among infants treated with cimetropium bromide (MD -30.20 minutes per crisis, 95% CI -39.51 to -20.89; 86 infants). The same study reported that cimetropium increased the number of responders (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.64). No serious adverse events were reported for all of the agents considered, with the exception of dicyclomine, for which two of five studies reported relevant adverse effects (longer sleep 4%, wide-eyed state 4%, drowsiness 13%).

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence of the effectiveness of pain-relieving agents for the treatment of infantile colic is sparse and prone to bias. The few available studies included small sample sizes, and most had serious limitations. Benefits, when reported, were inconsistent. We found no evidence to support the use of simethicone as a pain-relieving agent for infantile colic. Available evidence shows that herbal agents, sugar, dicyclomine and cimetropium bromide cannot be recommended for infants with colic. Investigators must conduct RCTs using standardised measures that allow comparisons among pain-relieving agents and pooling of results across studies. Parents, who most often provide the intervention and assess the outcome, should always be blinded.

### Renal injury caused by intrarenal injection of phenol increases afferent and efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity [^19b5c524]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Intrarenal injection of phenol in rats causes a persistent elevation in blood pressure (BP) and in norepinephrine (NE) secretion from the posterior hypothalamus (PH), and downregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the PH. These studies suggest that afferent impulses from the kidney to the brain may be responsible for hypertension associated with renal injury. Downregulation of nNOS and IL-1beta, two modulators of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity may mediate this activation. In this study we measured the effects of intrarenal phenol injection on peripheral SNS activity by direct renal nerve recording, plasma NE, nNOS, and IL-1beta abundance in the brain. We also determined whether renal denervation or administration of clonidine prevented these effects of phenol. Acutely, the phenol injection increased both afferent and efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and increased plasma NE. Three weeks after the phenol injection, BP and plasma NE remained elevated. Renal denervation and pretreatment with clonidine prevented the increase in BP and plasma NE caused by phenol. Chronic renal injury caused by phenol was associated with decreased abundance of IL-1beta and nNOS in the PH. These studies have shown that a renal injury caused by phenol injection increases BP and central as well as peripheral SNS activity, which persist long after the injury. Renal denervation and antiadrenergic drugs abolish the effects of phenol on BP and plasma NE. Because NO and IL-1beta modulate SNS activity, the stimulatory action of phenol on the SNS could be mediated by downregulation of nNOS and IL-1beta in the brain.

Reaching clear effluent

In Part 1 of the study the responder rate for reaching clear effluent within 24 h was 63.3% for LVPEG-1, 58.6% for LVPEG-2, and 90.0% for LVPEG-3. In the control group 46.7% of subjects reached clear effluent. In Part 2 of the study clear effluent was achieved by 83.3% of subjects on LVPEG-3, 80% of subjects on LVPEG-4 and 76.7% of subjects on LVPEG-5. In the control group 63.3% reached clear effluent, a slightly higher proportion than in Part 1. LVPEG-3 and LVPEG-4 showed the highest responder rates, with the advantage of LVPEG-4 being that it required a total fluid consumption of only 2 L versus 3 L required for LVPEG-3.

Treatment compliance

Consumption of < 75% of either dose was defined as protocol deviation. In both study parts compliance levels were high. In Part 1 it was 100.0, 97.6, 100.0 and 97.8% for LVPEG-1, LVPEG-2, LVPEG-3 and the control, respectively. In Part 2 it was 100.0% for LVPEG-3, LVPEG-5 and the control, and 99.8% for LVPEG-4.

Tolerability: vomiting (patient-reported rates)

Vomiting affected between 3.33–6.9% and 0–3.3% of subjects in each group in Parts 1 and 2 respectively (Table 3). The overall number of subjects who vomited in each group in Part 2 was [n (P vs control)]: LVPEG-3: 1/30 (P = 1.000); LVPEG-4: 1/30 (P = 1.000); LVPEG-5: 0/30 (not applicable), and 0/30 for the control.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^757e9e4d]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial treatment approach for constipation — after discontinuing medications that can cause constipation and performing blood and other tests as guided by clinical features, a therapeutic trial (ie, fiber supplementation and/or osmotic or stimulant laxatives) is recommended before anorectal testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). NTC and STC can be safely managed with long-term use of laxatives (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
