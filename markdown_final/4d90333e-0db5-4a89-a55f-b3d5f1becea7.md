## Question

Can corticosteroids, like prednisone, be used to reduce inflammation and promote healing in canker sores?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids, including prednisone, can reduce inflammation and promote healing in canker sores. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its natural history. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for topical corticosteroids versus systemic prednisone. Next, I will review safety and guideline positions. After that, I need to consider special populations and when to escalate therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its usual course. Canker sores, or recurrent aphthous stomatitis, are painful oral ulcers that typically heal spontaneously within 7–14 days without scarring; most are minor, though major aphthae can persist longer and scar, and recurrences are common, so the clinical goals are pain control, faster healing, and recurrence mitigation when appropriate [^112QZDKw] [^115AZoga].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between topical and systemic corticosteroids because the route matters for both efficacy and safety. Topical corticosteroids are applied directly to the ulcer and act locally to suppress mucosal inflammation, whereas systemic prednisone is taken orally and has broader immunosuppressive effects; topical therapy is generally first-line for localized disease, while systemic therapy is reserved for severe or refractory cases due to systemic adverse effects [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU].

> I will now examine the evidence for topical corticosteroids. Multiple reviews and guidelines list topical steroids as first-line therapy for recurrent aphthous ulcers, with benefits in reducing pain and potentially shortening healing time, although they do not reliably prevent recurrence; formulations commonly used include dexamethasone rinses or ointments and triamcinolone dental paste, and a randomized trial of dexamethasone ointment showed improved healing and pain reduction versus placebo without detectable systemic absorption, which reassures me about local safety when used short term [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU] [^115Z76wi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic prednisone. I should confirm whether there is direct randomized evidence for oral prednisone in canker sores. The Cochrane review of systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis concluded that no single systemic treatment, including prednisone, had sufficient high-quality evidence to support routine use, and prednisone is generally reserved for severe major aphthae or frequent, debilitating recurrences unresponsive to topical therapy; this aligns with expert reviews that position systemic steroids as second- or third-line options due to adverse effect risks [^117GEAaG] [^112c8dvn] [^1129wN2A].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Topical corticosteroids have minimal systemic absorption with short courses, but prolonged use can cause local mucosal thinning and may predispose to secondary candidiasis; patients should be counseled to limit duration and consider antifungal rinses if white plaques appear. Systemic prednisone carries risks including mood changes, dysglycemia, hypertension, HPA axis suppression, and increased infection susceptibility, so if used, it should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with a planned taper and close follow-up; I need to ensure we screen for and manage comorbidities that amplify risk, such as diabetes or immunosuppression [^1121sgSp] [^112J13Am].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, aphthous ulcers may be more severe and persistent; topical steroids remain reasonable, but nonhealing ulcers require evaluation for opportunistic infections or neoplasia, and systemic steroids should be used cautiously with infection risk in mind. In Behçet disease, topical corticosteroids are recommended for oral ulcers as part of mucocutaneous management, often alongside systemic immunosuppression for more severe disease, which supports the role of topical steroids even in systemic inflammatory contexts [^1129wN2A] [^115Zooxy] [^111QQ82J].

> I should double-check guideline concordance to avoid overstatement. Contemporary reviews and pediatric infectious disease guidance consistently place topical corticosteroids as first-line for symptomatic RAS, while emphasizing that they do not change recurrence rates; this matches the randomized dexamethasone data showing improved healing and pain without altering recurrence, reinforcing a role for local therapy in routine care [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU] [^115Z76wi].

> But wait, what if the ulcer is not a simple aphthous lesion. I need to ensure we do not miss persistent or atypical ulcers; any nonhealing oral ulcer beyond about four weeks warrants evaluation for malignancy or alternative diagnoses, and recurrent or severe disease should prompt screening for systemic contributors such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, iron or B12 deficiency, or Behçet disease, because addressing the underlying driver improves outcomes and may change management [^112QZDKw] [^117W79cM].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For typical minor aphthae, start with topical corticosteroids such as dexamethasone mouth rinse or triamcinolone dental paste applied several times daily for about 5–7 days, combined with nonsteroidal analgesia and local protective measures; counsel on triggers and recurrence, and reassess if not improved. For major aphthae or frequent, debilitating outbreaks unresponsive to optimized topical therapy, a short, tapering course of systemic prednisone may be considered, ideally after excluding infection and with clear safety monitoring plans; I should confirm that the patient understands risks and that we have a steroid-sparing plan if recurrences persist [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU] [^117GEAaG].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and promote healing in canker sores, with topical corticosteroids supported as first-line therapy for most patients and systemic prednisone reserved for severe or refractory cases due to limited high-quality evidence and meaningful adverse effect risks; shared decision-making should weigh modest but clinically meaningful benefits against local and systemic risks, and persistent or atypical ulcers deserve further workup [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU] [^117GEAaG].

Prednisone and other corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and pain in canker sores, but **topical corticosteroids are preferred** because they minimize systemic side effects [^1129nbRU]. Prednisone is reserved for severe or refractory cases, and **short courses** (≤ 5–7 days) are recommended to limit adverse effects [^112c8dvn]. Topical steroids like triamcinolone or dexamethasone are first-line for most patients, with prednisone considered only when topical therapy fails or ulcers are severe [^1129nbRU].

---

## Mechanism of action

Prednisone and other corticosteroids reduce inflammation by **suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines** and mediators, thereby decreasing pain, swelling, and redness [^113WCnoo]. This anti-inflammatory effect can provide symptomatic relief and may accelerate healing in canker sores [^111QAkMq].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prednisone use

While prednisone is commonly used in clinical practice for severe or refractory canker sores, **high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically evaluating prednisone for canker sores are limited** [^117GEAaG]. However, clinical guidelines and expert consensus support the use of corticosteroids, including prednisone, for managing severe or recurrent aphthous ulcers [^112c8dvn].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

Prednisone is typically administered orally for canker sores, with **short courses** (≤ 5–7 days) to minimize systemic side effects. The following regimens are commonly used:

- **Low-dose regimen**: 10–20 mg daily for 3–5 days, followed by tapering or discontinuation.
- **Moderate-dose regimen**: 20–40 mg daily for 5–7 days, followed by tapering.

These regimens are individualized based on severity, response, and patient-specific factors [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone mouth rinses, are generally considered **first-line therapy** for canker sores due to their localized effect and lower risk of systemic side effects [^1129nbRU]. Prednisone is typically reserved for severe or refractory cases where topical therapy has failed or is impractical [^112c8dvn].

---

## Potential side effects and risks

Prednisone, like other systemic corticosteroids, carries potential side effects, particularly with prolonged use. Short-term use (≤ 7 days) is generally associated with minimal risk, but clinicians should remain vigilant:

- **Common side effects**: Insomnia, mood changes, increased appetite, fluid retention, and gastrointestinal upset.
- **Serious side effects**: Immunosuppression, increased risk of infections, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and adrenal suppression with prolonged use [^113CB6yv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize topical corticosteroids as **first-line therapy** for canker sores, reserving systemic corticosteroids like prednisone for severe or refractory cases. Prednisone should be used cautiously, with careful monitoring for side effects and consideration of patient-specific risk factors [^112c8dvn] [^1121sgSp].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Prednisone may be **particularly beneficial** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe or refractory canker sores**: Ulcers that are large, persistent, or unresponsive to topical therapy.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Individuals with HIV/AIDS or other immunosuppressive conditions may benefit from systemic corticosteroids [^1129wN2A].
- **Systemic inflammatory conditions**: Patients with underlying systemic diseases such as Behçet's syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease may benefit from systemic corticosteroids [^113DwXUL].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Prednisone and other corticosteroids can effectively reduce inflammation and promote healing in canker sores, particularly in severe or refractory cases. However, **topical corticosteroids remain the preferred first-line therapy** due to their favorable safety profile. Prednisone should be used cautiously, with short courses and careful monitoring for side effects. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors, severity of ulcers, and response to topical therapy when deciding on systemic corticosteroid use.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^112zVjz2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

On publication of this Practice paper (BMJ 2017;358:j4090, doi:), the main graphical summary of the evidence for this recommendation contained an error. For the outcome "Complete pain resolution (48 hrs)", the value of 608 people per 1000 (183 more) was stated for those people taking steroids. The correct value should have been 629 per 1000 (204 more), as stated in the systematic review supporting the recommendation. This error has been corrected in the graphical summary.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115rpVFB]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews. Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status. Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups. Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42017067808.

Introduction

Sore throat is among the most common presenting complaints in both emergency departments and outpatient care settings. It is the cause of about 5% of medical visits in children and about 2% of all outpatient visits in adults. The most common cause of sore throat is acute pharyngitis caused by self limiting viral infections. Pain management with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therefore represents the mainstay of care. These drugs provide limited pain relief but also sometimes cause serious harm.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics also provides modest benefit in reduction of symptoms and fever when the infection is bacterial, but their use could contribute to antibiotic resistance. Although most cases of sore throat have a viral aetiology, and the risk of secondary complications is low, clinicians commonly prescribe antibiotics. Though this could be because clinicians think that patients seeking care expect a course of antibiotics, in reality pain relief might be more important to them.

Corticosteroids represent an additional therapeutic option for symptom relief. Randomised control trials suggest that a short course of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids probably provides symptomatic benefit to patients with sore throat. Despite this evidence, clinicians do not commonly use steroids. Reasons might include uncertain applicability of the evidence to patients with less severe disease, as the initial studies enrolled only patients with severe sore throat presenting to emergency departments, almost all of whom received antibiotics.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In this case, the stimulus was the recent TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial, which randomised over 500 patients with sore throat presenting to their primary care clinician who were not initially prescribed antibiotics; the TOAST authors reported beneficial effects of corticosteroids. In the light of this new potentially practice changing evidence, we updated the latest Cochrane reviewdealing with the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

### Strategies to minimize surgical scarring: translation of lessons learned from bedside to bench and back [^116yRFyf]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: An understanding of the physiology of wound healing and scarring is necessary to minimize surgical scar formation. By reducing tension across the healing wound, eliminating excess inflammation and infection, and encouraging perfusion to healing areas, surgeons can support healing and minimize scarring. Recent Advances: Preoperatively, newer techniques focused on incision placement to minimize tension, skin sterilization to minimize infection and inflammation, and control of comorbid factors to promote a healing process with minimal scarring are constantly evolving. Intraoperatively, measures like layered closure, undermining, and tissue expansion can be taken to relieve tension across the healing wound. Appropriate suture technique and selection should be considered, and finally, there are new surgical technologies available to reduce tension across the closure. Postoperatively, the healing process can be supported as proliferation and remodeling take place within the wound. A balance of moisture control, tension reduction, and infection prevention can be achieved with dressings, ointments, and silicone. Vitamins and corticosteroids can also affect the scarring process by modulating the cellular factors involved in healing. Critical Issues: Healing with no or minimal scarring is the ultimate goal of wound healing research. Understanding how mechanical tension, inflammation and infection, and perfusion and hypoxia impact profibrotic pathways allows for the development of therapies that can modulate cytokine response and the wound extracellular microenvironment to reduce fibrosis and scarring. Future Directions: New tension-off loading topical treatments, laser, and dermabrasion devices are under development, and small molecule therapeutics have demonstrated scarless wound healing in animal models, providing a promising new direction for future research aimed to minimize surgical scarring.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

### Aphthous ulcers (recurrent) [^115AZoga]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 10 mm in diameter that heal after 7 to 10 days without scarring. The causes are unknown but local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 10 mm in diameter and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected topical treatments for recurrent idiopathic aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), corticosteroids (topical), tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash, and topical antiseptic agents (chlorhexidine and similar agents).

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter, that heal after 5–14 days without scarring. The causes are unknown, but risks of recurrence may decrease if the person gives up smoking. Local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 1 cm in diameter, and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), carbenoxolone mouthwash, chlorhexidine (and similar agents), corticosteroids (topical), and tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: an updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^114eb8ne]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Classical Immunosuppressive and Immunomodulating Drugs

Systemic Corticosteroids (Level of Evidence 1B) [First-Line Treatment]

The anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids (CS) is attributed to their transcription-altering effects, and to NF-κB inhibition particularly, with subsequent downregulation of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. The rapid onset of action has made systemic CS a first-line option in PG.

Treatment with systemic CS (dose 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) induces a clinical response in about 40–50% of cases, with widely variable complete response rates depending on associated systemic diseases and PG severity. Once healing has been reached, the CS dose can be tapered over a variable time period (4–6 weeks to 12–24 weeks), according to clinical course, comorbidities, and the risk of relapse. Pulse therapy with 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3–5 consecutive days, followed by oral CS, may have a faster onset of action and may also help taper oral CS. As complete remission is achieved only in 40% and relapse prevention only in 20% of those with multi-lesional PG, it is recommended to combine systemic CS with immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory adjuvants in severe cases, with the most common agent being cyclosporine.

### Interventions for treating oral lichen planus: corticosteroid therapies [^113Moooz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a relatively common chronic T cell-mediated disease, which can cause significant pain, particularly in its erosive or ulcerative forms. As pain is the indication for treatment of OLP, pain resolution is the primary outcome for this review. This review is an update of a version last published in 2011, but focuses on the evidence for corticosteroid treatment only. A second review considering non-corticosteroid treatments is in progress.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of corticosteroids, in any formulation, for treating people with symptoms of oral lichen planus.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 25 February 2019: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of any local or systemic corticosteroid treatment compared with a placebo, a calcineurin inhibitor, another corticosteroid, any other local or systemic (or both) drug, or the same corticosteroid plus an adjunctive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently scanned the titles and abstracts of all reports identified, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data from included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the estimates of effects of an intervention as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. The statistical unit of analysis was the participant. We conducted meta-analyses only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 35 studies (1474 participants) in this review. We assessed seven studies at low risk of bias overall, 11 at unclear and the remaining 17 studies at high risk of bias. We present results for our main outcomes, pain and clinical resolution measured at the end of the treatment course (between one week and six months), and adverse effects. The limited evidence available for comparisons between different corticosteroids, and corticosteroids versus alternative or adjunctive treatments is presented in the full review. Corticosteroids versus placebo Three studies evaluated the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids in an adhesive base compared to placebo. We were able to combine two studies in meta-analyses, one evaluating clobetasol propionate and the other flucinonide. We found low-certainty evidence that pain may be more likely to be resolved when using a topical corticosteroid rather than a placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.36; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%). The results for clinical effect of treatment and adverse effects were inconclusive (clinical resolution: RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 47.58; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; adverse effects RR 1.48, 95% 0.48 to 4.56; 3 studies, 88 participants, I² = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids versus calcineurin inhibitors Three studies compared topical clobetasol propionate versus topical tacrolimus. We found very low-certainty evidence regarding any difference between tacrolimus and clobetasol for the outcomes pain resolution (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88; 2 studies, 100 participants; I² = 80%), clinical resolution (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99; 2 studies, 52 participants; I² = 95%) and adverse effects (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83; 2 studies, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study (39 participants) compared topical clobetasol and ciclosporin, and provided only very low-certainty evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution with clobetasol (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 9.93), pain resolution (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.76 to 5.86) and adverse effects (RR 6.32, 95% CI 0.84 to 47.69). Two studies (60 participants) that compared triamcinolone and tacrolimus found uncertain evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35; very low-certainty evidence) and that there may be a lower rate of adverse effects in the triamcinolone group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99; low-certainty evidence). These studies did not report on pain resolution.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids have been first line for the treatment of OLP. This review found that these drugs, delivered topically as adhesive gels or similar preparations, may be more effective than placebo for reducing the pain of symptomatic OLP; however, with the small number of studies and participants, our confidence in the reliability of this finding is low. The results for clinical response were inconclusive, and we are uncertain about adverse effects. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that calcineurin inhibitors, specifically tacrolimus, may be more effective at resolving pain than corticosteroids, although there is some uncertainty about adverse effects and clinical response to tacrolimus showed conflicting results.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a comprehensive review and recommendations on therapeutic options [^112c8dvn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common chronic disease in the oral mucosa that affects about 20% of the population. It is characterized by solitary or multiple, recurrent, small ulcers with erythematous haloes and yellow/gray floors. RAS can be managed through a wide variety of preventative measures and therapies, intending to reduce ulcer pain, stimulate ulcer healing, and/or prevent ulcer recurrence. First-line treatment options include topical medications in the form of corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide), anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox), antibiotics (doxycycline), and antiseptics (lidocaine). In more severe cases of RAS where local treatment is insufficient, systemic drugs in the form of corticosteroids (prednisone), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide), and antibiotics/antimicrobials (clofazimine) can prove effective. This review will summarize current treatment options for RAS with discussion of prevention, topical measures, natural treatments, systemic therapies, and new potential therapies. Furthermore, this review will provide recommendations on therapeutic options for RAS based on disease severity and patient circumstances.

### Early treatment of cold sores with topical ME-609 decreases the frequency of ulcerative lesions: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated clinical trial [^111FDGPm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prior pilot studies support the use of antiviral medications with topical corticosteroids for herpes simplex labialis (HSL). ME-609 (Xerese, Xerclear) is a combination of 5% acyclovir and 1% hydrocortisone developed for the topical treatment of HSL.

Objectives

The primary study end point was the prevention of ulcerative HSL lesions.

Methods

In all, 2437 patients with a history of HSL were randomized to self-initiate treatment with ME-609, 5% acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle, or ME-609 vehicle (placebo) at the earliest sign of a cold sore recurrence. Cream was applied 5 times/d for 5 days. A total of 1443 patients experienced a recurrence and initiated treatment with ME-609 (n = 601), acyclovir (n = 610), or placebo (n = 232).

Results

Of patients receiving ME-609, 42% did not develop an ulcerative lesion compared with 35% of patients receiving acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle (P = 0.014) and 26% of patients receiving placebo (P < .0001). In patients with ulcerative lesions, healing times were reduced in the ME-609 and acyclovir groups compared with placebo (P < .01 for both). The cumulative lesion area for all lesions was reduced 50% in patients receiving ME-609 compared with the placebo group (P < .0001). There were no differences among groups in the number of patients with positive herpes simplex virus cultures. The side-effect profile was similar among treatments.

Limitations

The study did not contain a group treated with a topical corticosteroid alone.

Conclusions

ME-609 prevented progression of cold sores to ulcerative lesions and significantly reduced the cumulative lesion area compared with acyclovir and placebo. ME-609 treatment offers additional therapeutic benefit compared with therapy with topical acyclovir alone.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

### Navigating the path to corneal healing success and challenges: a comprehensive overview [^117Wjp2c]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

More effective approaches for enhancing corneal wound healing

Given the various factors contributing to the corneal wound healing process, addressing injured and inflamed tissue with the necessary material can enhance the healing process. Extensive inflammation and ocular surface dryness are two major contributing conditions that should be addressed carefully.

Lubricating the injured cornea can be achieved through various methods, including the use of synthetic artificial tears, blood-derived products, and ciliary nerve electrostimulation.

In the context of severe inflammation use of anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), creates a microenvironment that is more favourable for nerve regeneration. Doxycycline, which has anti collagenolytic activity can facilitate nerve repair by reducing excessive inflammation.

Recombinant nerve growth factors and cytokines have revolutionized the management of neurotrophic corneal ulcers. Oxervate® (cenegermin) is an FDA-approved recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) which promotes corneal nerve healing and epithelial repair. It significantly improves nerve regeneration in neurotrophic keratitis, herpetic and diabetic keratopathy where nerve damage prevents corneal healing.

In stem cell-deficient and chemically injured eyes, stem cell transplantation enhances corneal repair by improving CN density and function. Stem cells can directly differentiate into corneal tissues, including the corneal stromal cells, epithelial cells, and neurons. Another key supportive mechanism of stem cells in tissue regeneration is through their paracrine effects. They release various growth factors in the form of exosomes or secretomes which induce corneal wound healing and reduce fibrosis.

In extensive corneal injuries with large stromal and epithelial defects, microenviromental support is essential to enhance corneal nerve and epithelial cell regeneration. Recombinant collagen and hydrogel construct like CACICOL20® and natural amniotic membrane products like Prokera® are examples of structural support.

Stimulating chronic wounds with low-voltage electrical currents has the potential to enhance axonal migration and stimulate nerve endings by facilitating the development of a more efficient EF in the injured area.

### Medrysone promotes corneal injury repair by promoting M2-like polarization of macrophages [^114f4E3B]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The cornea is located at the forefront of the eyeball. The corneal is one of the most important parts of the surface barrier and refractive imaging system of the eyes, and corneal damage occurs frequently and severely affects the vision. Long-term corneal injury may cause corneal scarring, opacity, and even blindness. Corneal injury repair is a complex biological process that mainly involves three processes: the inflammatory response, tissue proliferation, and wound shrinkage and scarring. During corneal repair, inflammation is frequently activated to prevent infection and promote tissue repair, while excessive inflammation can lead to impaired corneal healing. Therefore, promoting rapid repair of the injury and avoiding excessive inflammatory response are important research topics in clinical ophthalmic treatment.

Acute inflammation often occurs during corneal injury repair. When the cornea is damaged or infected, macrophages migrate from the limbal vascular network to the limbus or central corneal region in response to chemokines secreted by keratocytes, and protect against external invasion. During the acute phase of inflammation, classic M1-like macrophages are activated to induce inflammation and release proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, which help pathogens kill and exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, these responses must be controlled to prevent overreactions that damage the host. At this time, M2-like macrophages are activated to avoid serious immune pathology such as anti-inflammatory cytokine mediators, cytokines and chemokines that are regulated by M1-like macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation, promoting and accelerating wound healing process and tissue repair. This fine-tuned balance between M1 and M2 helps host cells cope with stress, inflammation, regression and repair.

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of various keratitis. The main mechanism of corticosteroids executes an anti-inflammatory effect to reduce haze and scarring, including the treatment of post-refractive surgery and herpes simplex stromal keratitis. In this study, we found that the corticosteroids drug Medrysone can promote corneal injury repair by inducing the M2 polarization of macrophages. M2-like macrophages promoted the secretion of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) and the migration of vascular endothelial cells, thereby induced the cornea wound healing repair. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of Medrysone in the treatment of corneal injury.

### A well-demarcated hyperpigmented plaque of the posterior neck [^115uQtaB]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What are the most appropriate next steps in management of this patient?
A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement
B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids
C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids
D. Reassurance and regular wound care
E. Conduct patch testing to verify the implicated allergen

Answers:

A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement – Incorrect. This would be appropriate management for an FDE or exanthematous drug reaction, but no medication discontinuation is required for pressure necrosis.
B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. LSC, EM, and ACD might benefit from topical corticosteroids, but pressure necrosis is not an inflammatory condition and therefore treatment with topical corticosteroids is not recommended.
C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids – Incorrect. If the patient had findings concerning for Stevens Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis, this would be appropriate. The singularity and stability of the skin lesion, its morphology, and the patient's drug history are not concerning for Stevens Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis.
D. Reassurance and regular wound care – Correct. Pressure-induced skin necrosis is a benign condition which is not related to any underlying infectious process or drug exposure. There is no known risk of progression to toxic epidermal necrolysis or other severe adverse cutaneous reaction. Most lesions will heal spontaneously within 1 to 3 weeks, as was the case in this patient (Fig 3). To promote healing and reduce scar development though, patients should be advised to avoid pressure to the wound site and engage in daily wound care such as removal of necrotic tissue, bandaging, and maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing.
E. Conduct patch testing to verify the implicated allergen – Incorrect. This may be appropriate if the most likely diagnosis was ACD, but this diagnosis is less likely, for reasons described above.

### Multiple reactive keratoacanthomas treated with zinc oxide wraps and intralesional corticosteroids [^1141LHQB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

KAs usually arise as a solitary lesion and less commonly in multiples. Multiple KAs can either be classified as sporadic or familial. It is important to distinguish multiple eruptive KAs that arise as part of a familial genetic syndrome, such as Witten and Zak, Ferguson-Smith, and Grzybowski, from multiple reactive KAs, which typically arise in response to an external insult. Many etiologies for multiple reactive KAs have been described, such as trauma, inflammation, and iatrogenic causes secondary to surgery or topical drugs. Multiple reactive KAs can be difficult to treat, with patients often going through repeated courses of relapse and remission. There are many documented cases of recurrence of this neoplasm in the surgical margins after excision or skin grafting and even recurrences to areas of intralesional injections and radiation. Koebnerization after trauma may predispose patients to KA development secondary to increased vessel formation and epidermal proliferation.

Solitary KAs are often surgically excised because of their controversial malignant potential and association with squamous cell carcinomas. Multiple KAs are often treated with systemic retinoids, either alone or in combination with surgery or other types of intralesional chemotherapy. Intralesional corticosteroids were used to treat multiple KAs often historically; however, intralesional chemotherapies such as methotrexate and fluorouracil are now more commonly used. Many advantages to using intralesional steroids include reduced inflammation, pain, scarring, and limited systemic side effects. Many KAs in this patient were thought to have developed from repetitive scratching/koebnerization, and intralesional steroids helped to reduce inflammation and allow for self-resolution of the lesion.

To our knowledge, there is only one prior report on the successful use of zinc oxide wraps to treat multiple reactive KAs over 18 months. Topical zinc oxide has antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, astringent, and protective qualities. It also aids in removal of wound debris and promotion of epithelialization in wound healing. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of zinc oxide are theorized to be from its ability to prevent formation of nitric oxide and oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Unna boots, which our patient learned to self-apply at home, also serve as a compression device to reduce swelling and aid in healing and as a physical barrier to prevent additional trauma.

### Systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers) [^117GEAaG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most frequent form of oral ulceration, characterised by recurrent oral mucosal ulceration in an otherwise healthy individual. At its worst RAS can cause significant difficulties in eating and drinking. Treatment is primarily aimed at pain relief and the promotion of healing to reduce the duration of the disease or reduce the rate of recurrence. A variety of topical and systemic therapies have been utilised.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effect of systemic interventions in the reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or frequency.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of: Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers (to 6 June 2012); CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library (to Issue 4, 2012); MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 6 June 2012); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 6 June 2012); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 6 June 2012); and AMED via PubMed (1950 to 6 June 2012). We searched reference lists from relevant articles and contacted the authors of eligible trials to identify further trials and obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the primary outcome measures assess a reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or a reduction in episode frequency. Trials were not restricted by outcome alone. We also included RCTs of a cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We contacted trial authors for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. We carried out risk of bias assessment on six domains. We followed The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines and risk ratio (RR) values were to be calculated using fixed-effect models (if two or three trials in each meta-analysis) or random-effects models (if four or more trials in each meta-analysis).

Main Results

A total of 25 trials were included, 22 of which were placebo controlled and eight made head-to-head comparisons (five trials had more than two treatment arms). Twenty-one different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories: immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory and uncertain. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

No single treatment was found to be effective and therefore the results remain inconclusive in regard to the best systemic intervention for RAS. This is likely to reflect the poor methodological rigour of trials, and lack of studies for certain drugs, rather than the true effect of the intervention. It is also recognised that in clinical practice, individual drugs appear to work for individual patients and so the interventions are likely to be complex in nature. In addition, it is acknowledged that systemic interventions are often reserved for those patients who have been unresponsive to topical treatments, and therefore may represent a select group of patients.

### Topical hepatocyte growth factor accelerates wound healing and inhibits scarring in experimental corneal injury [^114foCCM]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Re-epithelialization and healing of the corneal stroma with minimal fibrosis after ocular trauma or injury are essential for restoring corneal transparency and vision. Disruption of the normal wound healing process can lead to fibrosis, resulting in corneal opacity. Topical medications such as corticosteroids and autologous serum, when used early, can promote re-epithelialization in settings of intense inflammation; in some cases, they can also reduce scar formation by virtue of epithelial closure. However, corticosteroids have many side effects and can also retard wound healing when used inappropriately and lead to well-known complications such as ocular hypertension, cataracts, and stromal thinning. The use of corticosteroids may be less favorable also stems from results of the SCUT trial, which showed that corticosteroids did not minimize scar size or shorten the time to re-epithelialization compared with placebo in patients with bacterial corneal ulcers. In fact, corticosteroids were associated with a larger scar size at 1 year among patients with Nocardia ulcers. As such, there are no approved pharmacological treatments currently that can resolve preexisting scars. Herein, we report that HGF, in addition to accelerating corneal wound healing and minimizing scar formation, also resolves preexisting scars in a murine model of mechanical corneal injury.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117W79cM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral ulceration is the most common ulcerative condition in humans, affecting up to 25% of young adultsand a higher proportion of children. Depending on context, ulcers in the mouth are described as mouth ulcers or canker sores, both of which are descriptive terms rather than clinical diagnoses. In this article, mouth ulcers is used as an umbrella term describing the spectrum of clinical presentation.

To date, many causes of mouth ulcers are recognised including mucosal trauma and a range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, mouth ulcers are common in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and are considered a diagnostic feature of Behçet's disease, an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels that causes ulceration of the mouth, eyes and genitals.

Many people experience recurrent mouth ulcers which cannot be attributed to systemic disease or obvious oral trauma. Here, the clinical diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is used, referring to a group of closely related conditions of uncertain aetiology, whose defining feature is the presence of clinically characteristic oral ulcers, which are painful and associated with impaired quality of life –. First line management strategies for RAS reduce the severity of ulceration without preventing recurrence. Second line management strategies involve topical or systemic use of potent and non-specific immunomodulatory drugs including thalidomide and dapsone, exposing patients to a range of side effects. Thus, there is unmet need for a wider range of therapeutic options in the management of RAS.

### Pharmacological management of common soft tissue lesions of the oral cavity [^111QAkMq]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue lesions commonly seen in the oral cavity tend to overlap in their onset, presentation, and location making it difficult to appreciate their etiology. In some instances, common oral soft tissue lesions can create confusion due to similar clinical appearance or unusual presentation; therefore, proper diagnosis of the lesion is key in pharmacologic management. In ulcerative conditions, topical steroids can decrease the symptoms and improve healing time, but do not affect the recurrence rate. Always be suspicious of soft tissue lesions that are nonresolving or recurrent lesions as they may warrant further investigation to rule out malignancy or associated systemic conditions. This article discusses key clinical presentations and the proper topical and systemic pharmacologic treatments.

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^116Z1PAD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease that classically manifests with flushing, telangiectasias, and inflamed papules and pustules on the face. A wide spectrum of stimuli can exacerbate rosacea, including ultraviolet exposure, temperature, microbes and drugs. The inflammation of rosacea is often treated with topical or oral antibiotics, and its chronic nature typically requires long‐term management and the avoidance of triggers.

Rosacea responds poorly to treatment with steroids. In general, steroids are envisioned as having potent immunosuppressive properties and have an essential role in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, clinicians have long recognized that topical steroids worsen rosacea with prolonged treatment or upon their withdrawal. A related inflammatory skin condition – perioral dermatitis – is frequently associated with the long‐term use of topical steroids on the face. In fact, these two clinical entities (rosacea and perioral dermatitis) are histologically similar and considered by some clinicians to be variants of the same condition. Together they represent cardinal examples of skin conditions that are initiated or worsened by steroids. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie their atypical proinflammatory response to steroids is not well understood.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum [^117AhtBd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum includes a combination of local wound care and systemic medications. Oral and pulse intravenous corticosteroids have traditionally been the most commonly recommended first-line systemic therapies. Cyclosporine, with or without corticosteroids, has more recently emerged as a first-line systemic treatment. A multitude of immunosuppressive and immune-modulating medications, as well as antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory properties have also been widely prescribed. Often, it is difficult to achieve control of aggressive cases of pyoderma gangrenosum, necessitating administration of a combination of systemic therapies. Furthermore, patients recalcitrant to one or many medications are frequently reported. Concomitant disease, intolerance to a class of medications, and the patient's response to prior therapies can help guide a practitioner in choosing the optimal treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^1173zAu6]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — topical corticosteroids: A conservative approach would avoid prescribing corticosteroid treatment for presumed bacterial ulcers until the organism has been identified, the epithelial defect is healing, and/or the ulcer is consolidating. If the ulcer is associated with Nocardia or fungus, the outcomes of corticosteroid therapy are likely to be poor; for most bacteria other than Nocardia, the risk is low and the addition of corticosteroids may be beneficial. In cases where the corneal infiltrate compromises the central cornea, topical corticosteroid therapy may be added to the treatment regimen following at least 2 to 3 days of progressive improvement with topical antibiotic treatment, typically after identification of the pathogen (and after fungal infection has been ruled out). The intraocular pressure (IOP) must be monitored, and the patient should be examined within 1 to 2 days after initiation of topical corticosteroid therapy, and risks of long-term topical corticosteroid therapy, including cataract and glaucoma, should be discussed with the patient. Patients being treated with ocular topical corticosteroids at the time of presentation of suspected bacterial keratitis should have their corticosteroid regimen reduced or eliminated until the infection has been controlled, and inflammation and symptoms (e.g., decreased vision, photophobia, lacrimation, injection, and hyperemia) may temporarily increase as corticosteroids are reduced because of the lack of local immune suppression. Chronic topical immunotherapy, such as use of corticosteroids, may result in infectious crystalline keratopathy, which has the striking appearance of a snowflake or ice crystals in the stroma of the cornea, and management often requires discontinuation of the topical immunotherapy and the addition of long-term therapy with topical antimicrobial agents; these infections are extremely difficult to manage and often require surgical intervention, and patients typically complain of only mild symptoms, such as blurred vision, with a relatively asymptomatic course prior to diagnosis.

### Sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation for severe bacterial keratitis [^111nfYWw]. Cornea (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of early sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of severe bacterial keratitis to reduce pain, inflammation, and haze, and to promote healing.

Method

A noncomparative case series including 3 eyes of 3 consecutive patients with severe bacterial keratitis exhibiting persistent epithelial defect/ulcer, more than 5 mm in diameter, located within 3mm from the visual axis with infiltration occupying more than 50% of the corneal thickness. They were retrospectively reviewed following early (ie, within 96 hours) sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation via ProKera together with selective topical antibiotics and preservative-free steroid. Pain relief, inflammation, haze, and corneal epithelial healing were monitored.

Results

ProKera was inserted once in 1 eye and twice in the other 2 eyes. Pain was significantly relieved and inflammation was markedly reduced in all cases. The corneal epithelial defect and stromal ulceration rapidly healed while visual acuity improved in 2 of the 3 eyes.

Conclusion

Temporary sutureless amniotic membrane transplantation via ProKera allows easy insertion and replacement of the membrane in the office, as well as early intervention to promote epithelialization, reduce pain, haze and inflammation in cases with severe bacterial keratitis. This result justifies large series controlled studies in the future.

### Management strategies for HIV-associated aphthous stomatitis [^1129wN2A]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral mucosal disorder found in men and women of all ages, races, and geographic regions. There are three forms of the lesions (minor, major, and herpetiform), with major aphthous ulcers causing significant pain and potential for scarring. In HIV-infected individuals, these ulcers occur more frequently, last longer, and produce more painful symptoms than in immunocompetent persons. In addition, they may be associated with similar ulcerations involving the esophagus, rectum, anus, and genitals. The diagnosis of HIV-induced RAS requires a careful history of the condition, and a thorough extra- and intra-oral examination. Oral mucosal biopsies are required for non-healing ulcers in order to exclude the possibility of deep fungal infections, viral infections, and neoplasms. The cause of the ulcers in HIV-positive persons has not been elucidated — local diseases, genetic, immunologic, and infectious factors all probably play a role. The goals of current treatments are to promote ulcer healing, to reduce ulcer duration and pain while maintaining nutritional intake, and to prevent or diminish the frequency of recurrence. Initial therapy for infrequent RAS recurrences includes over-the-counter topical protective and analgesic products. Initial therapy for frequent RAS outbreaks requires topical anesthetics, binding agents, and corticosteroids. Major RAS and non-healing minor or herpetiform RAS may require intralesional corticosteroids and systemic prednisone. Second-line immunomodulators for frequent and non-healing ulcers includes thalidomide and other immunomodulators.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^115fXxDw]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — medical management can be divided into two phases addressing the initiating process and the resulting problems; conventional treatment involves an antibiotic drop or ointment to protect against secondary bacterial infection, temporary tarsorrhaphy with botulinum toxin or suture can be helpful when blinking or eyelid closure is inadequate, and a bandage contact lens or amniotic membrane may be helpful in cases of delayed healing. Pressure patching used to be standard treatment, but a study found that this does not positively impact comfort or speed of healing, and progressive thinning of cornea or a small perforation usually requires structural support with application of a tissue adhesive. Topical corticosteroids are often used to reduce intraocular and corneal inflammation and IOP and cataract formation should be monitored with long-term topical corticosteroid use; a rigid gas permeable lens — or hybrid or scleral lens when greater stability is needed — will often improve vision when surface irregularity is a factor and such lenses may obviate the need for more invasive procedures.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^114cr7x1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Two RCTs concluded that sharp scalpel debridement had no benefits over sham debridement in adults with IA. In a small prospective cohort study (n = 8), treatment effect was lost by seven days. The rationale for adjunctive treatments are discussed under Recommendations 4–10 and 13. No studies have been undertaken in adults with other types of IA, or children and young people with IA. GWG members with podiatric expertise agreed that inflammatory callus margins in PsA should not be debrided. In the case of suspected ulceration, and in people with diabetes, sharp scalpel debridement of overlying callus should be performed to reveal the size and nature of the ulcer, assess for infection and promote healing. Additionally, callus is a risk factor for foot ulceration in people with diabetes, and sharp scalpel debridement should be performed. Sharp debridement, when required, should only be undertaken by competent practitioners with specialist training.

13. Emollients are safe and effective, and can be offered for the relief of dry skin affecting the foot in IA. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

Rationale

The effectiveness of emollients for foot health in IA has not been formally evaluated in clinical studies. Emollients are widely recommended for other conditions (e.g. in eczema and diabetes), and risk of harm is low. Consideration should be given to other physical problems experienced by some people with IA, such as hand problems, which could make the application of emollients difficult.

14. All adults or children and young people with IA should be offered personalized nail care advice, including footwear advice, to help prevent and/or treat common toenail pathologies. People should be advised when to access foot health care, e.g. for ingrowing toenails, wounds and infections, and how to do this. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
15. Systemic control of disease activity is the aim of treatment, including joint disease and extra-articular manifestations, e.g. skin and nail disease in psoriatic arthritis. Foot skin and nail health should be assessed and managed in the context of systemic disease. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
16. In the presence of recurrent pain or infection, surgical removal of nails can be considered. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

### Medrysone promotes corneal injury repair by promoting M2-like polarization of macrophages [^113deYB8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Corneal is the outermost transparent part of the eyes, directly exposed to the environment and thus highly susceptible to chemical burns, mechanical damage, and infection. Incomplete repair and excessive healing of the cornea can lead to serious eye complications and cause different levels of vision defects.

Inflammation was shown to play an important role in the corneal injury healing process. The complex inflammatory environment in the corneal illness affects injured corneal repair process, which is composed of various inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors. Current research suggests that a variety of growth factors, such as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor), PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor) and IGF (Insulin Growth Factor) play a key role in corneal healing, and the inflammatory factors such as TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α) and IL-6 (Interleukin-6) are also involved in the process of corneal injury repair. However, excessive activation of inflammation often has adverse effects on injury repair process and may cause perforation or fibrosis of the cornea. Therefore, taking the inflammatory response into control may affect the outcome of corneal injury.

Pharmacologically controlling unwanted effects of wound healing process may avoid corneal perforation or scar formation. Anti-TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-β) treatments such as rosiglitazone, ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) inhibitor or trichostatin A were shown to be of clinical benefit in pharmacological management of wound healing. Our study found that Medrysone promoted corneal injury repair by inducing macrophage M2 polarization and regulating inflammatory response, which may provide a new strategy for clinical ophthalmic treatment.

The application of corticosteroids in corneal injury has always been controversial. Several studies suggested that the use of corticosteroids in the early stage of injury will accelerate the process of corneal dissolution and affect the repair of the injury. However, some studies revealed that the corticosteroids don't have any adverse effect on corneal repair, and due to their anti-inflammatory effect, corticosteroids could reduce scarring significantly. In our study, we found that the corticosteroid drug Medrysone significantly promoted corneal injury repair, which was related to its promotion of M2-like macrophages and secretion of VEGF and CCL2. However, Medrysone can induce VEGF secretion, which is a strong promoter of corneal neovascularization in clinic. In our experiment, we did not observe corneal neovascularization in Medrysone short term treatment, whether long administration of Medrysone will lead to neovascularization need further study.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^1155RF7k]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether ciclosporin is superior to prednisolone for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum, a painful, ulcerating skin disease with a poor evidence base for management.

Design Multicentre, parallel group, observer blind, randomised controlled trial.

Setting 39 UK hospitals, recruiting from June 2009 to November 2012.

Participants 121 patients (73 women, mean age 54 years) with clinician diagnosed pyoderma gangrenosum. Clinical diagnosis was revised in nine participants after randomisation, leaving 112 participants in the analysis set (59 ciclosporin; 53 prednisolone).

Intervention Oral prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day compared with ciclosporin 4 mg/kg/day, to a maximum dose of 75 and 400 mg/day, respectively.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was speed of healing over six weeks, captured using digital images and assessed by blinded investigators. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, global treatment response, resolution of inflammation, self reported pain, quality of life, number of treatment failures, adverse reactions, and time to recurrence. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and six weeks and when the ulcer had healed (to a maximum of six months).

Results Of the 112 participants, 108 had complete primary outcome data at baseline and six weeks (57 ciclosporin; 51 prednisolone). Groups were balanced at baseline. The mean (SD) speed of healing at six weeks was −0.21 (1.00) cm²/day in the ciclosporin group compared with −0.14 (0.42) cm²/day in the prednisolone group. The adjusted mean difference showed no between group difference (0.003 cm²/day, 95% confidence interval −0.20 to 0.21; P = 0.97). By six months, ulcers had healed in 28/59 (47%) participants in the ciclosporin group compared with 25/53 (47%) in the prednisolone group. In those with healed ulcers, eight (30%) receiving ciclosporin and seven (28%) receiving prednisolone had a recurrence. Adverse reactions were similar for the two groups (68% ciclosporin and 66% prednisolone), but serious adverse reactions, especially infections, were more common in the prednisolone group.

Conclusion Prednisolone and ciclosporin did not differ across a range of objective and patient reported outcomes. Treatment decisions for individual patients may be guided by the different side effect profiles of the two drugs and patient preference.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host-disease [^1129H4tf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroid therapy principles in oral cGVHD — topical corticosteroids are the first line of therapy, and the type of preparation and its concentration depend on the extent and severity of the oral lesions. When the lesions are ulcerative/erosive and symptomatic, an ultra-potent steroid is preferred, and selection is tailored to the patient's tolerance of its consistency and mode of application. It is recommended to avoid long-term application of steroid on the lips, and although topical application uncommonly causes systemic adverse effects, clinicians should be aware of this potential risk; topical application of potent steroids with lower bioavailability, such as budesonide, may be a preferred alternative. For delivery, when the lesions are generalized, a rinse may be more practical whereas a gel may be more applicable for localized lesions, and for gingival involvement, application in a medication tray or as a gauze occlusion may facilitate longer contact time.

### Prasterone and ibuprofen (prastera) [^114Xyubf]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

General Precautions

Ibuprofen tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of ibuprofen tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

### Biomaterials in rhinology [^114Fdjwx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many different kinds of rhinologic biomaterials, both nonabsorbable and absorbable, have been developed over the years to improve outcomes following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. In particular, these products have been designed to prevent postoperative bleeding, optimize the wound healing process, and reduce inflammation. This review evaluates the most recent evidence on biomaterials used in rhinology, focusing on these outcomes after ESS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov.

Review Methods

A primary literature search based on the listed databases was performed with combinatorial search terms. Studies were considered for review if they met a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Conclusions

Some products have performed better than others in clinical trials, although significant heterogeneity among studies does not allow for selection of a clearly superior biomaterial. While nonabsorbable biomaterials are still effective in achieving certain outcomes, newer, absorbable substances may be just as effective and avoid the morbidity associated with nasal packing removal. Steroid-eluting biomaterials have shown promising early results in reducing inflammation and promoting wound healing.

Implications For Practice

Certain absorbable biomaterials, such as chitosan gel and fibrin glue, have performed well with respect to postoperative hemostasis and wound healing, although they do not address mucosal inflammation. Steroid delivery systems may play an increasingly important role in reducing disease recurrence after ESS, although more studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes.

### Flurandrenolide (Cordran) [^112ejhJC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions.

The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of topical corticosteroids is not completely understood. Corticosteroids with anti-inflammatory activity may stabilize cellular and lysosomal membranes. There is also the suggestion that the effect on the membranes of lysosomes prevents the release of proteolytic enzymes and, thus, plays a part in reducing inflammation.

Pharmacokinetics

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings.

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. They are metabolized primarily in the liver and then excreted in the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

### Colistin sulfate, neomycin sulfate, thonzonium bromide and hydrocortisone acetate (cortisporin TC) [^115iDRL5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Colistin sulfate is a polypeptide antibiotic which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Neomycin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis, disrupting the normal cycle of ribosomal function. Hydrocortisone acetate is a corticosteroid hormone which is thought to act by regulating the rate of protein synthesis; it controls inflammation, edema, pruritus and other dermal reactions. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they may delay healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.

The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, concentration, and release from the vehicle.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^116QVFJH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Small joint injections — clinical recommendations state that clinicians should preferably offer US guidance when performing injections into the small joints of the wrists, hands, feet, and ankles, as it may provide benefit (eg, reduced procedural pain) over landmark-based guidance (Grade C). In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in the small joints of the wrists and hands, IACSSI may be used as an adjunct therapy to decrease pain, improve function, and reduce signs and symptoms of inflammation (Grade C). For trigger finger, clinicians should perform CSI with 20 mg triamcinolone/methylprednisolone corticosteroid equivalent rather than 5 or 10 mg (Grade C), and clinicians should offer thumb splints in conjunction with CSI for De Quervain's tenosynovitis (Grade C). For plantar fascia, clinicians can perform corticosteroid injections for rheumatic inflammatory heel pain not responsive to conservative measures (Grade C) and should avoid plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids for noninflammatory plantar heel pain.

### Interventions for treating oral lichen planus [^114pw5sQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic autoimmune disease associated with cell-mediated immunological dysfunction. Symptomatic OLP is painful and complete healing is rare.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of any form of therapy for symptomatic OLP.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 26 January 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 26 January 2011) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 26 January 2011). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of therapy for symptomatic OLP which compared treatment with a placebo or between treatments or no intervention were considered in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

The titles and abstracts of all reports identified were scanned independently by two review authors. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias and data were extracted. For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effects of an intervention were expressed as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals were used to summarise the data for each group. The statistical unit was the patient. Meta-analyses were done only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures.

Main Results

28 trials were included in this review. Pain is the primary outcome of this review because it is the indication for treatment of OLP, and therefore this review indicates as effective, only those treatments which significantly reduce pain. Although topical steroids are considered first line treatment for symptomatic OLP, we identified no RCTs that compared steroids with placebo. There is no evidence from the three trials of pimecrolimus that this treatment is better than placebo in reducing pain from OLP. There is weak evidence from two trials, at unclear and high risk of bias respectively, that aloe vera may be associated with a reduction in pain compared to placebo, but it was not possible to pool the pain data from these trials. There is weak and unreliable evidence from two small trials, at high risk of bias, that cyclosporin may reduce pain and clinical signs of OLP, but meta-analysis of these trials was not possible. There were five trials that compared steroids with calcineurin inhibitors, each evaluating a different pair of interventions. There is no evidence from these trials that there is a difference between treatment with steroids compared to calcineurin inhibitors with regard to reducing pain associated with OLP. From six trials there is no evidence that any specific steroid therapy is more or less effective at reducing pain compared to another type or dose of steroid.

Authors' Conclusions

Although topical steroids are considered to be first line treatment, we identified no RCTs that compared steroids with placebo in patients with symptomatic OLP. From the trials in this review there is no evidence that one steroid is any more effective than another. There is weak evidence that aloe vera may reduce the pain of OLP and improve the clinical signs of disease compared to placebo. There is weak and unreliable evidence that cyclosporin may reduce pain and clinical signs of OLP. There is no evidence that other calcineurin inhibitors reduce pain compared to either steroids or placebo. From the 28 trials included in this systematic review, the wide range of interventions compared means there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific treatment as being superior.

### Topical corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis [^115gRY47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular infectious disease that can lead to severe visual disability. Risk factors for bacterial corneal infection include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery. Topical antibiotics constitute the mainstay of treatment in cases of bacterial keratitis, whereas the use of topical corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics remains controversial. Topical corticosteroids are usually used to control inflammation using the smallest amount of the drug. Their use requires optimal timing, concomitant antibiotics, and careful follow-up.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis. Secondary objectives included evaluation of health economic outcomes and quality of life outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 July 2014. We also searched the Science Citation Index to identify additional studies that had cited the only trial included in the original version of this review, reference lists of included trials, earlier reviews, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines. We also contacted experts to identify any unpublished and ongoing randomized trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had evaluated adjunctive therapy with topical corticosteroids in people with bacterial keratitis who were being treated with antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year. These trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, India, and South Africa. All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group. The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94). However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11). For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups. The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90). One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available). We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes. Although the four trials were generally of good methodological design, all trials had considerable losses to follow-up (10% or more) in the final analyses. Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is inadequate evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive topical corticosteroids compared with no topical corticosteroids in improving visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratitis. Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid, but may be due to insufficient power to detect a treatment effect.

### Diagnosis and management of neurotrophic keratitis [^114nypNc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Early diagnosis, severity-based treatment, and careful monitoring of NK patients are mandatory to achieve epithelial healing and prevent progression of corneal damage, especially since worsening of NK is frequently asymptomatic (Table 1).

All topical medications should be discontinued because they have detrimental effects on the ocular surface epithelium. Additionally, all ocular surface-associated diseases, such as exposure keratitis, dry eye, and limbal stem cell deficiency, which may worsen the prognosis of NK, need to be taken care of. For instance, it will be necessary to correct any eyelid dysfunction, to consider punctal occlusion, and/or perform limbal cell transplantation.

Treatment of NK should be based on disease severity. Treatment for stage 1 disease aims at improving epithelial quality and transparency and avoiding epithelial breakdown. In the presence of PED, therapy is aimed at preventing stromal involvement and corneal ulcer formation as well as promoting corneal healing. More severe cases, with corneal ulcer and stromal melting, require immediate attention to stop the stromal lysis and prevent perforation,(Table 1).

Pharmacological treatments for NK are not available. However, the use of preservative-free artificial tears may help improve the corneal surface at all stages of disease severity. Topical steroids have been proposed for NK to control ocular inflammation (if present); however, steroids may increase the risk of corneal melting and perforation by inhibiting stromal healing, and their use should be considered with great caution. Topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may also inhibit the healing process and should be avoided. In the event of stromal melting, use of topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine, and systemic administration of tetracycline or medroxyprogesterone may be considered.–Use of topical antibiotic eye drops to prevent infection in eyes with NK at stages 2 and 3 is recommended.

Nonpharmacological treatments for NK include therapeutic corneal or scleral contact lenses in the event of PED to promote corneal epithelial healing. Contact lens use may increase the risk of secondary infections.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^11513oTr]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Trigger point injections — local anesthetic (LA) use with or without corticosteroid — are supported by evidence for LA in TPIs, but there is little research supporting adding corticosteroids. LA use in TPIs has been shown to reduce injection site soreness, yet LA myotoxicity is a concern; evidence suggests reversible muscle necrosis with greater risk associated with bupivacaine, higher LA concentrations, and prolonged exposure.

### Amcinonide [^112J13Am]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amcinonide TOP:

- **Adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia**: use extreme caution with prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids or use in areas where the epidermal barrier is disrupted (i.e., skin abrasion), and the use of an occlusive dressing. Limit the use of high-potency corticosteroids to the shortest duration necessary. Avoid applying corticosteroids to areas with disrupted skin barrier or using occlusive dressings. Discontinue Amcinonide immediately. Manage Cushing's syndrome, HPA suppression, hyperglycemia, or other adverse effects under medical guidance.
- **Hyperglycemia**: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly, especially in individuals at risk for hyperglycemia. Manage hyperglycemia under medical supervision, considering appropriate interventions or adjustments to diabetes management.
- **Mask symptoms of infections**: use caution receiving topical corticosteroids to areas of infection, including tuberculosis of the skin, dermatologic fungal infection, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection. Prior to using Amcinonide, perform a thorough examination of the affected area to identify any existing infections. Discontinue Amcinonide and promptly address the underlying infection with appropriate medical treatment.
- **Skin ulceration**: use caution in patients with markedly impaired circulation or peripheral vascular disease. Regularly monitor high-risk patients, use minimal Amcinonide dose, avoid occlusive dressings, and promote proper wound care. Discontinue Amcinonide, seek medical attention for wound assessment, implement proper wound management, and consider alternative treatments.

PPES

Prevention strategies for PPES include prophylactic removal of hyperkeratotic areas, application of moisturizing cream containing urea ≥ 10%, pedicures, and cushioning of callused areas using soft or padded shoes [48]. Other preventive tactics include avoidance of activities that cause force or rubbing on the hands and feet during the first 6 weeks of treatment and limiting contact with harsh chemicals and sources of heat, such as sitting in saunas or the sun.

Management of PPES consists of keratolytic agents such as urea ≥ 10% for grade ≥ 1 PPES, with addition of high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% for grade ≥ 2 symptoms.

Stomatitis

Preventive strategies include undertaking dental work aimed at eliminating existing tooth and gum disease before the start of treatment and education regarding the importance of thorough and frequent cleaning of the oral cavity. Avoidance of salty, spicy, or citrus‐based foods, as well as hot beverages, may help prevent stomatitis.

Upon emergence of grade 1 or 2 stomatitis, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL elixir is recommended; an augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% gel applied to gauze and held against the affected surface may also assist in alleviating symptoms.

Dry Skin

Patients should be advised to moisturize skin to minimize the risk of skin adverse events and to avoid excessive exposure to detergents and soaps containing fragrances. Urea preparations have been shown to prevent transepidermal water loss, and salicylic acid preparations are helpful for their keratolytic, bacteriostatic, and fungicidal effects [50]. Exfoliation of scaly areas of xerosis is recommended. For more severe grade 3 xerosis, which results in asteatotic dermatitis, treatment can be initiated with low‐potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment or triamcinolone 0.1% cream.

Dry Mouth/Xerostomia

Patient education is an important component of dry mouth prevention. The importance of good oral hygiene, regular dentist visits, and other strategies for preventing oral disease should be stressed.

Treatment may include systemic and topical salivary stimulants, such as cevimeline and pilocarpine, and intraoral topical agents, such as chewing gums and saliva stimulants and substitutes [59]. High‐fluoride toothpaste is also recommended to prevent cavities.

Stomatitis

Stomatitis, or oral mucositis, refers specifically to inflammatory diseases of the mouth, including mucosa, dentition, periapical abscesses, and periodontium. Such ailments can impair a patient's ability to eat, swallow, and talk and can cause significant pain. Stomatitis is characterized by ulceration in the oroesophageal mucosa, resulting in pain, erythema, dysphagia, and occasionally bleeding. Onset typically occurs early (≤ 1 month after treatment initiation) and is transient. The condition is also a common toxicity associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, occurring as nonspecific ulcerations for which localized palliative treatments and systemic analgesics are generally applied. In contrast to stomatitis associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, stomatitis associated with mTOR therapy has an inflammatory component often clinically mimicking aphthous stomatitis (commonly known as canker sores) and is differentiated from lesions of viral etiology by their localization to the nonkeratinized movable oral and oropharynx mucosa, as opposed to the mucosa of the palate, gingiva, or dorsal tongue surface. These differences also suggest that the aphthous-like lesions observed with mTOR inhibitors differ from the lesions observed with cytotoxic agents, so management strategies to prevent or treat mTOR inhibitor associated stomatitis also must be distinguished.

### Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment on recurrent aphthous ulceration [^115Z76wi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent aphthous ulceration is the most common oral mucosal lesion and may be associated with many systemic diseases. Topical corticosteroids are used frequently for recurrent aphthous ulceration; however, the number of high-quality clinical experiments available is insufficient, and no reports exist on the blood level of corticosteroids after topical usage in the oral mucosa. The objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and detect serum dexamethasone concentrations in the patients.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 5 centers to compare the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone ointment with placebo. There were 810 patients with minor recurrent aphthous ulcerations screened for study eligibility, and 240 patients were enrolled at 5 centers from March 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010; 120 were assigned randomly to the treatment group and 120 to a control group. Patients were instructed to apply the given agent to the identified ulcer 3 times a day (after meals) for 5 days. The size, pain level, healing ratio, and average duration of ulcers and the safety of the agents were evaluated. The serum concentration of dexamethasone was detected using a high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay.

Results

The results showed that baseline characteristics were similar (P > .5). At day 6 ± 2 after treatment, there was significant difference in the variation of ulcer size between the treatment group (7.167 ± 6.3415 mm²) and the control group (4.346 ± 7.0666 mm²; p = 0.000); and in the variation of pain level between the treatment group (5.623 ± 1.9570) and the control group (4.940 ± 2.2449; p = 0.001). The healing ratio was 83.33% in the treatment group and 54.70% in the control group (P = 0.000). No severe adverse reactions were observed. No serum dexamethasone was detected before or after the use of the agents (< 0.502 ng/mL).

Conclusion

Dexamethasone ointment was efficient in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulceration and was safe as evaluated using clinical assessment and serum level detection.

### Patient information: what are canker sores? [^112QZDKw]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The cause of canker sores is unclear but may be related to an immune reaction, genetic factors, or deficiencies in nutrients, including vitamin B12, folic acid, and ferritin. Canker sores are more common in patients with certain medical conditions, such as celiac disease, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and HIV/AIDS. Sodium lauryl sulfate, a primary cleansing agent in toothpaste, has also been associated with canker sores. There are 3 categories of canker sores based on the size and number of ulcers. Minor canker sores comprise about 80% of all canker sores. They are small, painful, round- or oval-shaped grayish-white ulcers encircled by a red ring that can occur on the inside lining of the lips and cheeks, the underside of the tongue, and the area of the mouth below the tongue. Minor canker sores usually heal without scarring within 7 to 10 days.

Herpetiform canker sores are the least common type. They are very small painful ulcers that often merge to form larger, irregularly shaped ulcers. Herpetiform canker sores typically heal without scarring within 7 to 14 days. Most canker sores heal on their own. Natural compounds such as curcumin and honey extract as well as herbal therapies and probiotics can decrease canker sore pain and may reduce the size of the ulcers. For individuals with recurrent canker sores, topical corticosteroids may reduce the size and frequency of the ulcers. Laser therapy may also help decrease symptoms and promote healing. People with severe or frequently recurring canker sores may be prescribed oral medications to improve healing and/or reduce recurrence. Individuals with a nonhealing ulcer in the mouth that persists for more than 4 weeks should be evaluated for oral cancer; a biopsy may be necessary.

New-onset canker sores in patients older than 40 years may be associated with an underlying medical condition such as celiac disease, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, or HIV/AIDS.
