## Question

What is the criteria for diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregullation disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic features and their phasic versus tonic components. Then, I should verify the frequency and duration thresholds. Next, I will review age of onset and developmental applicability. After that, I need to check setting requirements and functional impairment. I will then examine exclusion criteria, especially bipolar spectrum disorders and ODD. Finally, I should consider comorbidity rules, differential diagnosis, and synthesize a concise diagnostic summary with a quick mnemonic check.

> Let me first confirm the core features. DMDD is defined by two interlocking components: severe, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts (phasic irritability) and persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts (tonic irritability), which must be observable by others and represent a clear departure from typical developmental expectations, not just occasional grumpiness or frustration [^117V2Wf9] [^112wikc7] [^114dTAik].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency and duration thresholds because these are easy to misstate. The temper outbursts must occur on average three or more times per week, and the constellation of symptoms must persist for at least 12 months with no period of three or more consecutive months without both the outbursts and the irritable mood; I initially thought "never without symptoms for 3 months", but I should correct that to "never without both features for 3 or more months" to be precise [^116nTbsv].

> I need to check the age-related criteria next. Onset of symptoms should be before age 10 years by history or observation, and the diagnosis can only be made for children aged 6 through 17 years; children under 6 are excluded to avoid pathologizing normative preschool dysregulation, and adults 18 and older cannot receive a new DMDD diagnosis, though longitudinal data show adult functional consequences of childhood DMDD [^114CWThU] [^114M1zub] [^111YAwq7].

> Hold on, I should verify the setting and impairment requirements. Symptoms must be present in at least two of three settings (home, school, peers) and be severe in at least one, with clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or family functioning; this cross-context requirement helps distinguish DMDD from situational reactivity and supports external validation of severity [^117V2Wf9].

> Next, I should review exclusion criteria carefully. The diagnosis cannot be made if the child meets criteria for bipolar disorder or if symptoms occur exclusively during the course of major depressive disorder; I almost said "cannot coexist with ODD", but wait, that would be incorrect — ODD can be comorbid with DMDD, so I need to ensure I do not overstate an exclusion that does not exist for ODD while keeping the bipolar and MDD exclusions intact [^116TscTM] [^1127ZXqT] [^117V2Wf9].

> Let me consider comorbidity and diagnostic hierarchy. High comorbidity is expected, with frequent overlap with ADHD, anxiety, and depressive disorders; however, each disorder that meets full criteria should be diagnosed unless DSM-5-TR hierarchical rules apply, and clinicians should be cautious not to apply DMDD as a residual category when other diagnoses better explain the presentation [^113c5NWS] [^113MdBzS] [^117V2Wf9].

> I will now examine differential diagnosis and nosologic context. DMDD was introduced to reduce overdiagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder in chronically irritable youth without episodic mania/hypomania; still, irritability is transdiagnostic and DMDD shows limited diagnostic stability and substantial overlap with ODD, so I should double-check for episodic features, decreased need for sleep, and other manic signs before excluding bipolar spectrum disorders, and I should document the chronic, nonepisodic course to support DMDD [^117V2Wf9] [^1127ZXqT] [^116TscTM].

> But wait, what about measurement and clinical utility? There are no ancillary symptom criteria beyond the core features, which contributes to reliability concerns; using standardized irritability measures such as the Affective Reactivity Index and multi-informant ratings can improve diagnostic rigor and help track treatment response, and I should confirm that my assessment captures both phasic and tonic irritability dimensions [^112wikc7] [^117CxwKj].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic criteria succinctly. A child aged 6–17 years can be diagnosed with DMDD when there are severe, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts averaging three or more times per week, a persistently irritable or angry mood observable between outbursts, symptoms present for at least 12 months without a gap of three or more consecutive months without both features, onset before age 10, symptoms severe in at least one and present in at least two settings, clinically significant impairment, and no better explanation by bipolar disorder or exclusive to major depressive disorder; ODD may coexist, and comorbid conditions should be diagnosed when criteria are met [^113MdBzS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the mnemonic I'm using to ensure it aligns with DSM-5. The SIT mnemonic captures Severe Inconsistent Temper outbursts three times per week, Irritable mood between outbursts observed by others, symptoms for 1 year, onset before age 10, and the key exclusions of Bipolar, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and exclusive occurrence during Major Depressive Disorder; I initially included ODD in the exclusion list, but I should correct that — ODD is not an exclusion for DMDD, even though overlap is common [^116nTbsv].

> Finally, I need to ensure clinical implications are addressed. Youth with DMDD often have adverse long-term outcomes, including elevated risks of depression and anxiety and functional impairment into adulthood; therefore, careful diagnostic formulation, longitudinal monitoring, and evidence-informed treatment planning are essential, and clinicians should remain alert to evolving research on irritability as a transdiagnostic risk dimension [^111YAwq7] [^117CxwKj].

---

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is diagnosed in children aged 6–17 who have **severe temper outbursts** (verbal/physical) occurring **three or more times weekly** [^116nTbsv] for at least 12 months [^116nTbsv], with a persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts [^116nTbsv]. Symptoms must be present in **two or more settings** (home, school, peers) [^116nTbsv] and cause significant impairment; onset must be before age 10, and the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6 or after age 18. DMDD **excludes** bipolar disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as the sole explanation; it can co-occur with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, but ODD must not better account for symptoms [^116nTbsv]. The diagnosis requires careful differentiation from bipolar disorder, ADHD, and ODD using clinical interviews, rating scales, and multi-informant data [^116YoQda].

---

## Core diagnostic criteria

The **core diagnostic criteria** for DMDD include the following:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Severe temper outbursts | - Verbal or behavioral outbursts <br/> - Grossly out of proportion to the situation <br/> - Occur three or more times per week [^116nTbsv] |
| Persistent irritability | - Irritable or angry mood most of the day <br/> - Nearly every day <br/> - Observable by others [^114CWThU] |
| Duration | - Symptoms present for 12 or more months <br/> - No period of three or more consecutive months without symptoms [^116nTbsv] |
| Setting | - Symptoms present in at least two settings <br/> - Home, school, or with peers <br/> - Severe in at least one setting [^116nTbsv] |
| Age of onset | - Onset before age 10 years <br/> - Diagnosis cannot be made before age 6 or after age 18 [^116nTbsv] |
| Impairment | - Clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning [^notfound] |

---

## Exclusion criteria

The diagnosis of DMDD **requires exclusion** of the following:

- **Bipolar disorder**: Manic or hypomanic episodes must not be present [^116TscTM].
- **Intermittent explosive disorder**: Must not better explain the symptoms [^116nTbsv].
- **Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)**: Must not better account for the symptoms [^116nTbsv].
- **Substance use or medical conditions**: Symptoms must not be attributable to substances or medical conditions [^116nTbsv].

---

## Differentiation from related disorders

DMDD must be **differentiated from** related disorders:

- **Bipolar disorder**: DMDD lacks distinct manic or hypomanic episodes [^112Tosf9].
- **ADHD**: DMDD includes chronic irritability and severe outbursts, not just hyperactivity/impulsivity [^117V2Wf9].
- **ODD**: DMDD requires persistent irritability and severe outbursts beyond typical defiance [^117V2Wf9].

---

## Clinical assessment tools

Clinical assessment relies on **structured interviews** — such as the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) [^1127ZXqT] and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) [^113vDq9K] — and on **rating scales**, including the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) [^117CxwKj] and the Mood Severity Index (MSI) [^112RBTEV]. Multi-informant data from parents, teachers, and the child are essential [^113cAEzv].

---

## Prevalence and clinical course

Community prevalence is approximately 0.8% to 3.3% [^111NRFEG], with higher rates in clinical samples [^1127ZXqT]. Longitudinal outcomes include increased risk of anxiety and depression and significant functional impairment into adulthood [^111YAwq7].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Controversies and limitations include **diagnostic overlap** — high comorbidity with ADHD, anxiety, and depression complicates diagnosis [^111NRFEG] — and **limited stability**, with low diagnostic stability over time [^1127ZXqT]. Evidence-based treatment guidelines remain limited, necessitating further research [^117V2Wf9].

---

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is defined by severe, frequent outbursts with chronic irritability, lasting ≥ 12 months, across settings, with onset before 10 and diagnosis only between ages 6–18. It **excludes bipolar disorder, IED, and ODD as sole explanations**, and requires multi-informant assessment to differentiate from ADHD and other mood disorders [^113MdBzS].

### Prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of DSM-5 proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^111NRFEG]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

No empirical studies on the DSM-5 proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have yet been published. This study estimated prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of this proposed disorder in the community.

Method

Prevalence rates were estimated using data from three community studies involving 7,881 observations of 3,258 participants from 2 to 17 years old. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was diagnosed using structured psychiatric interviews.

Results

Three-month prevalence rates for meeting criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%, with the highest rate in preschoolers. Rates dropped slightly with the strict application of the exclusion criterion, but they were largely unaffected by the application of onset and duration criteria. Disruptive mood dysregulation co-occurred with all common psychiatric disorders. The highest levels of co-occurrence were with depressive disorders (odds ratios between 9.9 and 23.5) and oppositional defiant disorder (odds ratios between 52.9 and 103.0). Disruptive mood dysregulation occurred with another disorder 62%-92% of the time, and it occurred with both an emotional and a behavioral disorder 32%-68% of the time. Affected children displayed elevated rates of social impairments, school suspension, service use, and poverty.

Conclusions

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is relatively uncommon after early childhood, frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, and meets common standards for psychiatric "caseness". This disorder identifies children with severe levels of both emotional and behavioral dysregulation.

### Focus on disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: a review of the literature [^117V2Wf9]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The inclusion of the Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), under the category of depressive disorders, provides a diagnosis for those children and adolescents with severe persistent irritability and temper outbursts, once misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorders. The main and constantly present features of DMDD are chronic, non-episodic and persistent irritability, and temper tantrums disproportionate with the trigger. DMDD is characterized by high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Its main clinical manifestations overlap with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. For this diagnostic overlap and the increasing use of pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents, the inclusion of DMDD diagnosis has been subjected to many criticisms. Since it is a new diagnostic entity, literature on DMDD prevalence, epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment guidelines, is still sparse and unclear. The aim of this review is to collect and analyze the literature on DMDD diagnostic criteria and main hallmarks, with particular attention to comorbidities and treatment options.

### Adult diagnostic and functional outcomes of DSM-5 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^111YAwq7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a new disorder for DSM-5 that is uncommon and frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders. Here, the authors test whether meeting diagnostic criteria for this disorder in childhood predicts adult diagnostic and functional outcomes.

Method

In a prospective, population-based study, individuals were assessed with structured interviews up to six times in childhood and adolescence (ages 10 to 16 years; 5,336 observations of 1,420 youths) for symptoms of DMDD and three times in young adulthood (ages 19, 21, and 24–26 years; 3,215 observations of 1,273 young adults) for psychiatric and functional outcomes (health, risky/illegal behavior, financial/educational functioning, and social functioning).

Results

Young adults with a history of childhood DMDD had elevated rates of anxiety and depression and were more likely to meet criteria for more than one adult disorder relative to comparison subjects with no history of childhood psychiatric disorders (noncases) or individuals meeting criteria for psychiatric disorders other than DMDD in childhood or adolescence (psychiatric comparison subjects). Participants with a history of DMDD were more likely to have adverse health outcomes, be impoverished, have reported police contact, and have low educational attainment as adults compared with either psychiatric or noncase comparison subjects.

Conclusions

The long-term prognosis of children with DMDD is one of pervasive impaired functioning that in many cases is worse than that of other childhood psychiatric disorders.

### Editorial: defining the clinical boundary of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder symptoms in youth [^112wikc7]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a novel diagnosis emerging from a continuing discourse on the best diagnostic home for children with severe, chronic irritability. DMDD emerged from a research diagnosis that was developed to test the hypothesis that severe, chronic irritability is a developmental phenotype of pediatric bipolar disorder. 1 That is, such irritability is a phenomenon that emerges prior to a hypo/manic episode that defines bipolar disorder. For many, such irritability in conjunction with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms had been treated as a prodrome of bipolar disorder. Although this line of research did not establish a deterministic association between the DMDD syndrome and later bipolar disorder, it did provide guidance for assessing the risk of irritability for later bipolar disorder. 2 Among the outcomes was the introduction of DMDD as a new diagnosis in DSM-5. It is defined by 2 core symptoms-temper outbursts and irritable/angry mood-the 2 major features of irritability. However, what qualifies as DMDD-level irritable mood and temper outbursts is unclear, and, unlike other mood disorders, no ancillary symptom criteria are available to establish a diagnosis of DMDD. Through the example of the relationship between DMDD and ODD, we will illustrate the clinical impact of this lack of clarity and describe the current efforts to establish a developmentally sensitive clinical nosology for irritability.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^111o85qX]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Other significant changes include the incorporation of criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), which will influence the field of child psychiatry. This change has occurred in reaction to discordance between putative child and adult bipolar populations with respect to clinical, treatment response, and prognostic factors, and the growing risk of overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder in childhood. However, longitudinal studies suggest that DMDD has poor diagnostic reliability, and cannot be differentiated adequately from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. Furthermore, it is not associated with current, future-onset, or parental history of mood or anxiety disorders, confirming the utility of the revision.

Removal of the bereavement exclusion for a depressive diagnosis is arguably the most contentious 'loss' to the field of mood disorders. Early studies suggested that after bereavement, depressive syndromes are common but transient, and do not require treatment. Based on research studies published since 2006, Zisook and colleagues argued persuasively that depression related to bereavement that occurs in the context of bereavement is no different phenomenologically from depression in other contexts, and has similar genetic and familial patterns, comorbidities, course, outcome, and treatment response. Hence, the bereavement exclusion was itself excluded from DSM-5. This has been critiqued, and a number of potential advantages and disadvantages that are likely to ensue have been identified. The key argument is that DSM does not meaningfully distinguish between a normal reaction to loss and the threshold for a disorder, and that abandoning the bereavement exclusion risks overdiagnosis of depression and consequent overtreatment, and in this regard, the criteria for major depression are arguably already broad and non-specific. Alternatively, some have argued for a narrowing of the construct and a return to the concepts of endogenous and melancholic depression, suggesting, for example, that greater severity predicts higher treatment response.

The changes to the mood disorders taxonomy in DSM-5 are important because of the widespread influence of this classification system. As in many other sections of DSM-5, the underpinning of diagnoses by neurobiology remains to be achieved, and thus the diagnoses are largely descriptive and limited by their dependence on phenomenology and grouping of symptoms and signs according to clinically defined cut-offs and associations. Despite these limitations, the revisions meaningfully incorporate recent advances, the system has widespread applicability, and alternate conceptual frameworks such as RDoC do not yet have overt clinical applicability.

### Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: symptomatic and syndromic thresholds and diagnostic operationalization [^115Dpb1e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate threshold for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community.

Method

Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 preadolescents/early adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The clinical threshold was assessed in 3 stages: symptomatic, syndromic, and clinical operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each DAWBA item, which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to capture preadolescents/early adolescents with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and levels of psychopathology.

Results

At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories. For outbursts, some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2 out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts delineated nonoverlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 3%.

Conclusion

Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and clinically oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.

### Examining the proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder diagnosis in children in the longitudinal assessment of manic symptoms study [^1127ZXqT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) diagnosis in a child psychiatric outpatient population. Evaluation of DMDD included 4 domains: clinical phenomenology, delimitation from other diagnoses, longitudinal stability, and association with parental psychiatric disorders.

Method

Data were obtained from 706 children aged 6–12 years who participated in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study (sample was accrued from November 2005 to November 2008). DSM-IV criteria were used, and assessments, which included diagnostic, symptomatic, and functional measures, were performed at intake and at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. For the current post hoc analyses, a retrospective diagnosis of DMDD was constructed using items from the K-SADS-PL-W, a version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, which resulted in criteria closely matching the proposed DSM-5 criteria for DMDD.

Results

At intake, 26% of participants met the operational DMDD criteria. DMDD+ vs DMDD- participants had higher rates of oppositional defiant disorder (relative risk [RR] = 3.9, P < .0001) and conduct disorder (RR = 4.5, P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, DMDD+ participants had higher rates of and more severe symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (rate and symptom severity P values < .0001) and conduct disorder (rate, P < .0001; symptom severity, P = 0.01), but did not differ in the rates of mood, anxiety, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders or in severity of inattentive, hyperactive, manic, depressive, or anxiety symptoms. Most of the participants with oppositional defiant disorder (58%) or conduct disorder (61%) met DMDD criteria, but those who were DMDD+ vs DMDD- did not differ in diagnostic comorbidity, symptom severity, or functional impairment. Over 2-year follow-up, 40% of the LAMS sample met DMDD criteria at least once, but 52% of these participants met criteria at only 1 assessment. DMDD was not associated with new onset of mood or anxiety disorders or with parental psychiatric history.

Conclusions

In this clinical sample, DMDD could not be delimited from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, had limited diagnostic stability, and was not associated with current, future-onset, or parental history of mood or anxiety disorders. These findings raise concerns about the diagnostic utility of DMDD in clinical populations.

### Are youths with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder different from youths with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder? [^111pDSdP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was included in the depressive disorders (DD) section of the DSM-5, common and distinctive features between DMDD and the pre-existing DD (i.e., major depressive disorder, MDD, and persistent depressive disorder, PDD) received little scrutiny.

Methods

Youths consecutively assessed as outpatients at two Canadian mood clinics over four years were included in the study (n = 163; mean age:13.4 ± 0.3; range:7–17). After controlling for inter-rater agreement, data were extracted from medical charts, using previously validated chart-review instruments.

Results

Twenty-two percent of youths were diagnosed with DMDD (compared to 36% for MDD and 25% for PDD), with substantial overlap between the three disorders. Youths with DMDD were more likely to have a comorbid non-depressive psychiatric disorder - particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, odds ratio (OR = 3.9), disruptive, impulse-control and conduct disorder (OR = 3.0) or trauma- and stressor-related disorder (OR = 2.5). Youths with DMDD did not differ with regard to the level of global functioning, but reported more school and peer-relationship difficulties compared to MDD and/or PDD. The vulnerability factors associated with mood disorders (i.e., history of parental depression and adverse life events) were found at a comparable frequency across the three groups.

Limitations

The retrospective design and the selection bias for mood disordered patients restricted the generalizability of the results.

Conclusions

Youths with DMDD share several clinical features with youths with MDD and PDD. Further studies are required to determine the developmental trajectories and the benefits of expanding pharmacotherapy for DD to DMDD.

### Will disruptive mood dysregulation disorder reduce false diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children? [^116YoQda]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The frequency of diagnosis of bipolar disorder has risen dramatically in children and adolescents. The DSM-V Work Group has suggested a new diagnosis termed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) (formerly temper dysregulation disorder with dysphoria) to reduce the rate of false diagnosis of bipolar disorder in young people. We sought to determine if the application of the proposed diagnostic criteria for DMDD would reduce the rate of diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children.

Patients and Methods

Eighty-two consecutively hospitalized children, ages 5 to 12 years, on a children's inpatient unit were rigorously diagnosed using admission interviews of the parents and the child, rating scales, and observation over the course of hospitalization.

Results

Overall, 30.5% of inpatient children met criteria for DMDD by parent report, and 15.9% by inpatient unit observation. Fifty-six percent of inpatient children had parent-reported manic symptoms. Of those, 45.7% met criteria for DMDD by parent-report, though only 17.4% did when observed on the inpatient unit.

Conclusion

Although DMDD does decrease the rate of diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children, how much depends on whether history or observation is used.

### Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD): an RDoC perspective [^1125oEdG]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been much debate regarding the most appropriate diagnostic classification of children exhibiting emotion dysregulation in the form of irritability and severe temper outbursts. Most recently, this has resulted in the addition of a new diagnosis, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) in the DSM 5. The impetus for including this new disorder was to reduce the number of diagnoses that these children would typically receive; however, there is concern that it has only complicated matters rather than simplifying them. For example, a recent epidemiologic study shows that DMDD cannot be differentiated from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) based on symptoms alone. Thus, these children are an ideal population in which to apply RDoC constructs in order to obtain greater clarity in terms of underlying processes and ultimately, inform nosology and appropriate interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a foundation for future research by examining extant theoretical and empirical evidence for the role of four key RDoC constructs in DMDD.

### Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: a new diagnostic approach to chronic irritability in youth [^112Tosf9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), a newcomer to psychiatric nosology, addresses the need for improved classification and treatment of children exhibiting chronic nonepisodic irritability and severe temper outbursts. In recent years, many of these children have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, despite the lack of distinct mood episodes. This diagnostic practice has raised concerns, in part because of the escalating prescription of atypical antipsychotics. This article provides an overview of the limited literature on DMDD, including its history and relevant studies of assessment and treatment. A case study is included to illustrate key points, including diagnostic issues that clinicians may encounter when considering a diagnosis of DMDD.

### DSM-5 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: correlates and predictors in young children [^114tgYDC]. Psychological Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in DSM-5, little empirical data exist on the disorder. We estimated rates, co-morbidity, correlates and early childhood predictors of DMDD in a community sample of 6-year-olds.

Method

DMDD was assessed in 6-year-old children (n = 462) using a parent-reported structured clinical interview. Age 6 years correlates and age 3 years predictors were drawn from six domains: demographics; child psychopathology, functioning, and temperament; parental psychopathology; and the psychosocial environment.

Results

The 3-month prevalence rate for DMDD was 8.2% (n = 38). DMDD occurred with an emotional or behavioral disorder in 60.5% of these children. At age 6 years, concurrent bivariate analyses revealed associations between DMDD and depression, oppositional defiant disorder, the Child Behavior Checklist - Dysregulation Profile, functional impairment, poorer peer functioning, child temperament (higher surgency and negative emotional intensity and lower effortful control), and lower parental support and marital satisfaction. The age 3 years predictors of DMDD at age 6 years included child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, the Child Behavior Checklist - Dysregulation Profile, poorer peer functioning, child temperament (higher child surgency and negative emotional intensity and lower effortful control), parental lifetime substance use disorder and higher parental hostility.

Conclusions

A number of children met DSM-5 criteria for DMDD, and the diagnosis was associated with numerous concurrent and predictive indicators of emotional and behavioral dysregulation and poor functioning.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113uPoq4]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Children and adolescents — diagnostic categories, impairment, and course: With the introduction of DSM-5, Mood Disorders are now referred to as Depressive Disorders and include Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder — Single and Recurrent Episodes, Persistent Depressive Disorder, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder, Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition, Other Specified Depressive Disorder, and Unspecified Depressive Disorder; over 60% of depressed teens reported severe impairment in functioning related to school/work, family, chores, and social roles, behavior changes must occur for at least 2 weeks to be considered impaired, episode duration is longer in children than adolescents (median of 16 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively), and clinicians are encouraged to intervene as opposed to watchful waiting.

### Editorial: a call for developmental psychopathology approaches to diagnostic nosology [^114M1zub]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The publication of DSM-5 came with a number of significant advances, including shifts in disorder classifications and a new focus on dimensional assessment. 1 It also introduced disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), which was met with some criticism and concern. Although there was research to support the establishment of this new diagnosis aimed at improving classification of children and adolescents with persistent and impairing irritability, 2 specific symptoms and definitions of frequency and impairment were not as empirically supported, and concerns arose regarding validity and reliability. 3 The introduction of new diagnoses is a complex endeavor, particularly for disorders affecting children and adolescents, which require consideration of the immense neural, cognitive, and emotional changes occurring during this developmental period. Rigorous approaches grounded in developmental psychopathology are needed to establish a meaningful and clinically useful set of symptoms and associated characteristics. This is the approach that Wiggins et al. 4 take to address the applicability of the DMDD diagnosis for children below the age of 6 years. Although this minimum age was included in DSM-5 to prevent unwarranted labeling of young children for whom temper outbursts are common, 5 it fails to consider growing evidence of impairing irritability in preschoolers and limits identification of children who would benefit from early interventions. In response to this, these authors take a comprehensive bottom-up approach to empirically identify symptoms and to define limits of clinical severity, tailored specifically to preschool-aged children. As such, this study serves as a model of how to develop and to refine the diagnostic nosology of child psychiatric disorders.

Mood Disorders

DSM-5 and depressive disorders: yet more ado about nothing?

Carmine M. Pariante

Carmine M. Pariante is Professor of Biological Psychiatry at Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London. His research focuses on the biological effects of stress, the pathogenesis of depression, and the molecular mechanisms of antidepressant drugs.

Critics have accused the new DSM-5 of multiplying the number of psychiatric diagnoses and of medicalizing normal human experience. Two changes in the clinical area of Depressive Disorders have been used as examples to support this accusation: the removal of the 'bereavement exclusion', and the introduction of the new Disruptive Mood Dysregulation disorder (DMDD) for use in children. In both cases, the accusation is wrong.

The removal of bereavement exclusion will allow individuals who have been clinically depressed for less than 2 months after the loss of a loved one to be diagnosed with Major Depression. In the previous (fourth) edition of the DSM, the diagnosis of major depression could be made only if the depression had persisted for at least 2 months after the bereavement.

Does this mean that hordes of individuals who have just lost their partner or their parent will be started on antidepressants? Obviously not: first, because individuals will still need to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for depression, including the impairment in important areas of functioning such as in their social or professional life; and second – and crucially – because no clinically competent doctor would do so. Two scenarios clarify this.

Scenario 1. A young woman loses her husband in a car crash. She has no history of psychiatric disorders. She is grief-stricken and has to take time off work. Because of the removal of the bereavement exclusion, after 2 weeks, she clinically fulfills the 'new' criteria for major depression. She consults her primary care doctor, who reassures her that she is going through a very difficult process but that this is normal, and advises her to mobilize the support of her friends and family and that she will feel better in time.

### Persistence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^113vDq9K]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is common in children with ADHD yet it is not known how persistent DMDD is in this population. As such we aimed to investigate the persistence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in a community sample of children with ADHD. The sample comprised children (n = 136) participating in a cohort study with data available at age 7 and age 10. DMDD status was ascertained using proxy items from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV. Of those with DMDD at age 7 (n = 30), eight (21.1%) had DMDD that persisted at age 10. In the first study investigating the longitudinal course of DMDD in ADHD one in five children with ADHD+DMDD at age 7 continued to meet diagnostic criteria for DMDD three years later.

Edited transcript

1. What are the changes to the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on the fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)?

(i) ADHD is now classified as one of the neurodevelopmental disorders rather than being included as a disruptive disorder.

(ii) The diagnostic criteria that apply to adults have been relaxed and this reflects growing evidence that some people are still impaired by ADHD symptoms even if the symptoms have reduced in number. The criteria for children remain at six out of nine from a list of inattentiveness symptoms and/or six out of nine from a list of symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Adults over 18, however, need only to display five out of the same lists. Furthermore, for adults being diagnosed for the first time, the criteria for onset in childhood have also been relaxed. Previously there had to have been "some impairment" before the age of seven. Now it is only necessary to show that symptoms were present (not impairment) before the age of twelve.

(iii) The traditional subtypes of predominantly inattentive, predominantly impulsive hyperactive and combined have been downgraded from subtypes to presentations. This reflects new knowledge that one subtype frequently changes into another.

(iv) Autism is no longer an exclusion and both autism and ADHD can be diagnosed together.

(v) Rapid and labile mood changes, which often accompany ADHD, now have a new diagnosis of their own. This is termed "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder" (DMDD), which describes a group of children with frequent and severe outbursts of temper whose mood between tempers is angry or miserable.

2. What will be the impact of DSM-5 on the diagnosis of ADHD?

The impact is not likely to be great. Practitioners in the UK do not usually add up the symptoms in the way that DSM envisages. Instead, they match the case to their prototype idea of the disorder, as described by the 10 th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and in professional guidelines. The fundamental conceptualisation of the disorder has not been changed. There may be a modest increase in the recognition of ADHD in adult life, but this is happening anyway without the additional spur of DSM changes.

### Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and chronic irritability in youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder [^112BKrJY]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis in the DSM-5. Youth with a family history of bipolar disorder (BD) are at increased risk for BD and non-bipolar psychopathology. No studies to date have examined rates of DMDD among offspring of parents with BD. This study examines the risk for DMDD in offspring of parents with BD compared to community controls and considers rates of chronic irritability (independent of a DMDD diagnosis) across diagnoses in youth with parents with BD.

Method

Modified DMDD criteria were applied post hoc to 375 offspring of parents with BD and 241 offspring, aged 6 to 17 years, of community control parents. We calculated odds ratios using generalized linear mixed models. In addition, we explored associations with a severe chronic irritability phenotype and various diagnoses in the high-risk cohort.

Results

Offspring of parents with BD were more likely to meet criteria for DMDD than were the offspring of community control parents (Odds ratio [OR] = 8.3, 6.7% vs. 0.8%), even when controlling for demographic variables and comorbid parental diagnoses (OR = 5.4). They also had higher rates of chronic irritability compared to community controls (12.5% vs. 2.5%, χ² = 18.8, p < .005). Within the offspring of parents with BD, the chronic irritability phenotype was frequently present in offspring with diagnoses of BD, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and disruptive behavior disorders.

Conclusions

Like other non-BD diagnoses, family history of BD increases the risk for DMDD. Severe chronic irritability and temper tantrums are the core features of DMDD, and are associated with mood and behavioral disorders in youth at risk for BD.

### A review on the general stability of mood disorder diagnoses along the lifetime [^114Fn5GL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to review the most recent literature regarding diagnostic stability of mood disorders, focusing on epidemiological, clinical-psychopathological, and neurobiological data for unipolar and bipolar affective disorders.

Recent Findings

Unipolar depression follows a chronic course in at least half of all cases and presents a considerable diagnostic stability across all age ranges. Studies using latent class analysis are allowing improved profiling of depressive subtypes and assessment of their prevalence. Advances have been made in our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of depression, with data highlighting the roles of amyloid deposits, the ApoE4 allele, and atrophy of the anterior hippocampus or frontal cortex. The diagnostic instability of bipolar disorder is manifest in the early years, seen in both the extent of diagnostic delay and the high rate of diagnostic conversion from unipolar depression. Regarding disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, we have little data to date, but those which exist indicate a high rate of comorbidity and minimal diagnostic stability for this disorder. Diagnostic stability varies substantially among mood disorders, which would be related to the validity of current diagnostic categories and our diagnostic accuracy.

### Editorial: from bipolar disorder to disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: challenges to diagnostic and treatment specificity in traumatized youths [^115gPhs9]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

This valuable contribution by Findling et al. reports on trends in diagnostic patterns since the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in the DSM-5. As the authors note, the introduction of the DMDD diagnosis was designed to address the problematic over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder and the associated rise in antipsychotic and polypharmacy use in youths. 1 Using a large, national, electronic health record database (n = 14,157), this study showed a clear increase in the treated prevalence of DMDD from 2016 to 2018 (0.08–0.35%, p < .0001) coupled with a decrease in the treated prevalence of bipolar disorder from 2015 to 2018 (0.42%-0.36%, p < .0001). 1 This suggests that the introduction of DMDD did seem to achieve the aim of reducing the rates of bipolar diagnoses. In what is discouraging but not surprising news, the study demonstrates a troubling increase in the use of antipsychotics (58.9% DMDD vs 51.0% bipolar disorder) and polypharmacy in the DMDD cohort compared to the bipolar disorder cohort (45.0% DMDD vs 37.4% bipolar disorder). 1.

### Toward a developmental nosology for disruptive Mood dysregulation disorder in early childhood [^1144wcgc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) in DSM, characterized by severe, chronic irritability, currently excludes children < 6 years of age. However, capitalizing on a burgeoning developmental science base to differentiate clinically salient irritability in young children may enable earlier identification. The objective of this study was to advance an empirically derived framework for early childhood DMDD (EC-DMDD) by modeling and validating DMDD patterns in early childhood and generating clinically informative, optimized behaviors with thresholds.

Method

Data (N = 425) were from 3 longitudinal assessments of the MAPS Study, spanning preschool (means = 4.7 and 5.5 years) to early school age (mean = 6.8 years). The Multidimensional Assessment Profile of Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB) Temper Loss scale captured irritability, the Family Life Impairment Scale (FLIS) assessed cross-domain impairment at the preschool time points and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS) was used to assess clinical status at early school age. Latent transition analyses differentiated children with EC-DMDD from children with low, transient, or nonimpairing irritability.

Results

Developmental patterning of irritability proved important for normal:abnormal differentiation. Of children, 27% had initially high irritability, but only two-thirds of these were persistently highly irritable. Thus, "false positives" based on a single screen would be substantial. Yet, "false negatives" are low, as < 1% of children with baseline low irritability demonstrated later high irritability. Based on the sequential preschool-age time points, 6.7% of children were identified with EC-DMDD, characterized by persistent irritability with pervasive impairment, similar to prevalence at older ages. Specific behaviors included low frustration tolerance; dysregulated, developmentally unexpectable tantrums; and sustained irritable mood, all of which sensitively (0.85–0.96) and specifically (0.80–0.91) identified EC-DMDD. EC-DMDD predicted irritability-related syndromes (DMDD, oppositional defiant disorder) at early school age better than downward extension of DSM DMDD criteria to preschool age.

Conclusion

These findings provide empirical thresholds for preschool-age clinical identification of DMDD patterns. The results lay the foundation for validation of DMDD in early childhood and inform revision of DSM criteria.

### Navigating in troubled waters: the developmental roots of disruptive mood Dysregulation disorder [^114TZyxG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Wiggins et al. 1 recently used data from 3 longitudinal studies spanning preschool and early school children to form an empirically derived framework for early childhood disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (EC-DMDD), ie, a theoretical entity based on all DMDD criteria except the age at onset. The authors showed that the presence of EC-DMDD strongly predicted irritability-related syndromes at early school-ages. The most striking result is that virtually all youths with DMDD had chronic irritability in preschool years (> 99%), a finding that challenges the view that DMDD cannot be diagnosed before 6 years of age. In our opinion, the developmental view on DMDD adopted by the authors is particularly welcome to address some of the nosological issues encountered with this disorder.

### A prospective study of severe irritability in youths: 2-and 4-year follow-up [^112oPc8x]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Severe, chronic irritability is receiving increased research attention, and is the cardinal symptom of a new diagnostic category, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Although data from epidemiological community samples suggest that childhood chronic irritability predicts unipolar depression and anxiety in adulthood, whether these symptoms are stable and cause ongoing clinical impairment is unknown. The present study presents 4-year prospective and longitudinal diagnostic and impairment data on a clinical sample of children selected for symptoms of severe irritability (operationalized as severe mood dysregulation [SMD]).

Methods

Youth meeting criteria for SMD (n = 200) were evaluated at baseline using standard diagnostic methods. Two-year (n = 78) and 4-year (n = 46) follow-up diagnostic and clinical impairment ratings collected at 6-month intervals were completed with those youths enrolled in the study for a sufficient time.

Results

Although the number of youth meeting strict categorical SMD criteria declined over time (49 and 40% at 2 and 4 years, respectively), many individuals not meeting full criteria continued to display clinically significant irritability symptoms (2 years: 42%; 4 years: 37%). Impairment due to these irritability symptoms remained consistently in the moderate range on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale.

Conclusions

By the 4-year follow-up, only 40% of youths meet strict SMD criteria; however, most continue to display clinically impairing symptoms and significant impairment warranting psychiatric treatment. These findings provide evidence for the course of irritability, with implications for DMDD. Future research with populations meeting DMDD criteria and followed through the ages of high risk for psychiatric diagnoses is necessary.

### Drs. wiggins and wakschlag reply [^116VQVsm]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

We thank Benarous et al. for their recognition of the necessity of a developmental view on disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and for their thoughtful comments. 1 Indeed, a growing science base challenges the "old thinking" that developmental instability precludes earlier identification of DMDD syndromes. Notably, our paper was designed to promote a move toward a dimensional approach, which ultimately would obviate the need to make "you have it or you don't" decisions. In the short term, because real-world clinical decision making still rests on the presence or absence of DSM syndromes, our goal was to generate a developmentally informed evidence base for earlier identification and prevention of early-onset clinically significant irritability.

### Editorial: antidepressants to the rescue in severe mood dysregulation and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder? [^1178hv5s]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Children with irritability and outbursts pose a serous therapeutic problem. Many of them have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with emotion dysregulation, which is sometimes captured in the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Some follow-up data find a connection between DMDD and depression and anxiety in adults. This prompted Towbin and colleagues 1 to launch a trial where children (ages 7–17) with DMDD were treated first with methylphenidate (MPH) and then randomized to citalopram (CTP) or placebo over 8 weeks. The response to CTP was complicated by lack of specific measures of both irritable mood and severity of outbursts. Future studies should include standardized and normed parent and teacher measures of both externalizing and internalizing behavior as well as irritability specific measures rating how the child feels. Studies also need better measures of the actual outbursts-not just their frequency but how agitated or aggressive the child gets during an outburst (ie, what the child does) and how long the outbursts last. Measuring DMDD on inpatient units is especially complicated because of the therapeutic nature of the setting. Further work is needed with much larger samples to identify who improves with the treatment, exactly which domains of psychopathology improve and by how much. Finally, It is also critical to conduct longer-term trials to determine the stability of the response beyond 8 weeks.

### Diagnostic trends and prescription patterns in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorder [^1173Pxeo]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was introduced in DSM-5 to distinguish a subset of chronically irritable youth who may be incorrectly diagnosed and/or treated for pediatric bipolar disorder (BPD). This study characterized the rate of new treatment episodes and treated prevalence of BPD and DMDD from a longitudinal electronic health record database and examined the impact of DMDD on prescription trends.

Method

A retrospective cohort study using 2008–2018 Optum electronic health record data was conducted. Youth aged 10 to < 18 years with ≥ 183 days of database enrollment before the study cohort entry were included. Annual new treatment episode rates per 1,000 patient-years and treated prevalence (%) were estimated. Prescriptions for medications, concomitant diagnoses, and acute mental health service use for 2016–2018 were evaluated.

Results

There were 7,677 youths with DMDD and 6,480 youths with BPD identified. Mean age (13–15 years) and ethnicity were similar for both groups. A rise in new treatment episode rates (0.87–1.75 per 1,000 patient-years, p < .0001) and treated prevalence (0.08%-0.35%, p < .0001) of DMDD diagnoses (2016–2018) following diagnosis inception was paralleled by decreasing new treatment episode rates (1.22–1.14 per 1,000 patient-years, p < .01) and treated prevalence (0.42%-0.36%, p < .0001) of BPD diagnoses (2015–2018). More youth in the DMDD group were prescribed medications compared with the BPD group (81.9% vs 69.4%), including antipsychotics (58.9% vs 51.0%). Higher proportions of youth with DMDD vs youth with BPD had disruptive behavior disorders (eg, 35.9% vs 20.5% had oppositional defiant disorder), and required inpatient hospitalization related to their mental health disorder (45.0% vs 33.0%).

Conclusion

Diagnosis of DMDD has had rapid uptake in clinical practice but is associated with increased antipsychotic and polypharmacy prescriptions and higher rates of comorbidity and inpatient hospitalization in youth with a DMDD diagnosis compared with a BPD diagnosis.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^111LSHqE]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Scenario 2. A young woman loses her husband in a car crash. She has had several previous episodes of severe depression, which have lasted for 1 year or more. During these previous periods of depression, she has not been able to hold on to a job, and has tried to commit suicide. Like the woman in Scenario 1, this woman is grief-stricken, has to take time off work, and after 2 weeks, clinically fulfills the 'new' criteria for major depression. She sees her primary care doctor, who is aware of the research evidence showing the similarities between bereavement-related depression and other forms of depression, and is therefore rightly concerned that this stressful event will precipitate yet another severe episode in this predisposed woman. Until recently, the clinical management of such patients within the American health system would have been influenced by the 'bereavement exclusion', which would have complicated the reimbursement from the medical insurances companies. However, no longer impinged by this exclusion, the doctor immediately starts the patient on treatment with an antidepressant that has proven effective for the patient in the past, and this prevents the repetition of a downward spiral.

Hence, clinical competency and personalized decisions are, as always, key to clinical management, and diagnostic textbooks will not make good doctors take bad decisions.

What about the disruptive mood dysregulation disorder? Accused of being a diagnosis for 'grumpy children', this disorder requires 'persistent irritability and frequent episodes of behavior outbursts, three or more times a week, for more than a year' to be present in order to make the diagnosis. Is this a situation that any sensible parents (let alone doctors) would call a 'grumpy child'? I am sure that many parents would ask for help if they had a child with such difficulties.

Moreover, the criticism is particularly misplaced (and ironic) because DSM-5 has introduced this new disorder to prevent the (ab)use of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children. The rates of bipolar disorder in children have grown almost six-fold between 1996 and 2004, and this diagnosis is accompanied by the premature use of antipsychotics and mood stabilizers in very young individuals, and by a much more stigmatizing label, especially in a child. Perhaps sometimes a new disorder is a good thing?

Irritability, a hallmark feature of the new DSM-5 category of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), is present in many pediatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), depressive and anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. Indeed, irritability is among the most common presenting complaints in child psychiatry 1 and predicts long-term impairments, including high suicidality and decreased education and income attainment. 2.

### Irritability in ADHD: associations with depression liability [^111v6njf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Irritability and the new DSM-5 diagnostic category of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) have been conceptualised as related to mood disorder. Irritability is common in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but little is known about its association with depression risk in this group. This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression.

Methods

The sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression.

Result

Irritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression.

Limitations

Results are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population.

Conclusions

Irritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine the association between irritability and depression in youth with ADHD as they get older.

### Pediatric attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: analyzing national treatment trends [^113xVwWk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study investigated how a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) diagnosis influences treatment selection and sequencing in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Study Design

This multicenter, population-based, retrospective cohort study analyzed data from TriNetX Research Network (June 2013 through July 2024). Youth with ADHD (without DMDD) formed the control cohort (n = 631295). Youth with ADHD + DMDD (n = 24723) formed the study cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) and relative risks were calculated to analyze associations.

Results

Compared with controls, ADHD + DMDD cohort was more likely to be composed of non-Hispanic ethnicity and exhibited higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities, inpatient and emergency service utilization, and billed psychotherapy (ORs range 1.25–6.95). Youth with ADHD + DMDD were more likely to receive ADHD medications (ORs range 1.55–4.80), as well as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics (ORs range 5.05–13.16). Hispanic youth with DMDD utilized more psychotropics but less psychotherapy, while White youth used all services more. Before the use of non-ADHD medications for aggression, only 25% of ADHD + DMDD youth had a therapy code, and around 11% showed evidence of optimization of ADHD medication. After a DMDD diagnosis, treatment rates for other psychotropics increased more than those for central nervous system stimulants.

Conclusions

In youth with ADHD, a DMDD diagnosis is associated with increases in the spectrum of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments deployed with patterns varying by race and ethnicity. Antipsychotic and mood stabilizer prescriptions increased most prominently, often before receiving psychotherapy services or efforts to optimize ADHD medication. Future research should address disparities in DMDD treatment patterns and identify the optimal treatment sequences for DMDD.

### DSM-5 intermittent explosive disorder: relationship with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^111PS7Gg]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to estimate how many adults with DSM-5 Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) would also meet diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). This was done by examining how many individuals with IED would meet the DMDD criterion of being persistently angry in between impulsive aggressive outbursts.

Methods

The first one-hundred study participants diagnosed with DSM-5 IED in our clinical research program were included in this study. Two questions were added to the IED module from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID) inquiring about the duration of anger in between impulsive aggressive outbursts in IED study participants. Data regarding aggression, impulsivity, anger expression, and related dysphoric variables were also collected.

Results

The proportion of time spent as angry in between impulsive aggressive outbursts was < 50% of the time (~35%) for the vast majority (92%) of study participants with DSM-5 IED. Despite this, persistently-angry (i.e., angry > 50% time in between outbursts) IED study participants displayed no differences from not-persistently-angry IED study participants in dysphoric and aggression/impulsivity related variables.

Conclusions

These data indicate that inter-outburst anger in those with IED is relatively brief and that such individuals do not generally display the kind of persistent anger that is a diagnostic feature of DMDD.

### Perinatal and postnatal risk factors for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder at age 11: 2004 pelotas birth cohort study [^112sQKtT]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

In the Pelotas Birth Cohort, the prevalence of DMDD at 11 years of age was 2.5%. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found that the early risk factors for the development of DMDD by 11 years of age were maternal mood symptoms during pregnancy, maternal depression during the first years after childbirth, and low maternal level of education.

Copeland et al. evaluated 3258 individuals (ages 2–17) who collectively participated in three different studies conducted in the United States (US) (the Duke Preschool Anxiety Study, the Great Smoky Mountains Study, and the Caring for Children in the Community study). The authors found that the prevalence of DMDD decreased with age, reaching 3.3% at ages 2–5% and 0.8% at ages 9–17. In a sample of 597 individuals (ages 6–18) treated at community mental health centers in the US, the overall prevalence of DMDD was 31%. Tufan et al. analyzed 403 individuals, with a mean age of 9 years (SD = 2.5), that were treated at a psychiatric clinic in Turkey, finding that 8.9% met the criteria for a diagnosis of DMDD. The criteria for operationalizing the outcome varied across those studies, being defined from the use of different questionnaires and instruments. That was due to the fact that the diagnostic criteria for DMDD were defined and disseminated after those studies had been conducted. For example, Freeman et al. used the ODD section of The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (based on DSM-IV criteria) in order to assess the duration and impact of the symptoms. None of the three studies from which the Copeland et al. sample were drawn were designed to evaluate DMDD, all three having employed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Tufan et al. conducted unstructured clinical interviews according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Therefore, these studies defined the outcome differently, creating a potential bias in the identification of DMDD, which hinders the comparison of the results. In addition to the differences in terms of the characteristics of the studies — e.g. study site, subject ages, and population (clinical or community) — the differences in terms of the definition of the outcome could explain the differences in prevalence across the studies.

### Trends in diagnosis of bipolar and disruptive mood dysregulation disorders in children and youth [^11713C2d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rates of pediatric bipolar disorders have increased and some are concerned about diagnostic accuracy. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was added to the DSM-5 in 2013. The purpose of this study was to assess diagnostic trends of bipolar disorders and DMDD and to identify predictors of receiving the DMDD diagnosis since implementation of DSM-5.

Method

Kentucky Medicaid claims from 2012–2017 for children under 18 years (N = 814,919; 2012 n = 473,389; 2013 n = 470,918; 2014 n = 499,094; 2015 n = 517,199; 2016 n = 529,048; 2017 n = 535,814) were used. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of a diagnosis of DMDD in 2015–2017 for a sub-sample (n = 5,071).

Results

The use of DMDD rose after 2013 and mood disorder NOS decreased steadily through 2017. This decrease was seen when there was a diagnosis of bipolar and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) combined with mood disorder NOS. A diagnosis of only mood disorder NOS in 2012 did not predict DMDD in 2015–2017, but the same diagnosis in 2013 was predictive (OR 2.14, p = 0.049). The reverse is true for a diagnosis of only ADHD in 2013, which did not predict DMDD in later years, but its presence in 2012 was predictive (OR 1.36, p = 0.010).

Conclusions

DMDD increased after 2013, and this was associated with a diagnosis of mood disorder NOS, ADHD, as well as with bipolar disorders comorbid with ODD. Given the complexity of comorbid diagnoses, DMDD may be more accurate in classifying some children. Administrative claims data have limitations, which are discussed; and the data represent only children living in Kentucky.

Distinguishing early‐onset mania or hypomania from other psychiatric disorders is important as there is a high level of symptomatic overlap for multiple conditions including but not limited to ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), substance abuse, personality disorders and generalized anxiety disorder 555, 570 (Table 22). The discrete episodes of mania/hypomania and the non‐overlapping symptoms can facilitate accurate diagnosis. When a comorbidity is present, such as ADHD, overlapping symptoms (eg, distractibility and hyperactivity) should only count towards a diagnosis of mania or hypomania if they intensify during intervals of elation or irritability. Notably, ADHD is an ongoing condition whereas BD is episodic, and decreased sleep, hypersexuality, hallucinations or delusions, and homicidal or suicidal thoughts and actions occur with childhood mania, but are rare or absent in uncomplicated ADHD.

Table 22
Differential diagnosis of manic symptoms in children and adolescents

It is important to note that, while chronic irritability with episodic behavioural outbursts or rages can be seen in multiple paediatric psychiatric disorders (including emerging personality disorders, substance abuse, ODD, pervasive developmental disorders, and major depressive episodes), such irritability and explosiveness are not sufficient to make a diagnosis, even when severe. The recent DSM‐5 diagnosis DMDD — which includes chronic irritability as a defining feature — lists BD as an exclusion criterion. However, the DMDD phenotype is evident in about 25% of adolescents with episodic BD, and is associated with factors such as greater family conflict and ADHD comorbidity. 571 Classical BD and chronic irritability are therefore not mutually exclusive, the nonspecific nature of the latter notwithstanding.

4.1.2 Differential diagnosis

Diagnosing PBD requires changes in mood and behavior that are uncharacteristic of the individual and more extreme than developmentally appropriate, persist long enough to satisfy duration criteria, and have a clear impact on functioning. If comorbid disorders are present, mood symptoms need to be above and beyond the regular symptoms for the other disorder. For example, if symptoms of ADHD get worse episodically, and during these episodes the youth presents symptoms more specific to mania (eg, decreased need for sleep), a PBD diagnosis should be considered. Symptom sequence may help differentiate BD from some other disorders: a teen with BD might first experience symptoms of hypomania and depression and then begin using substances, in contrast to another teen who experimented with drugs first and then began showing irritability. However, it can be difficult to separate onset of a comorbid disorder from onset of manic/hypomanic symptoms.

Although the new and controversial DSM‐5 diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) cannot formally be diagnosed if the youth has BD, 82 the phenotype commonly overlaps with those of all BD subtypes 60, 83, 84 as well as other conditions, particularly oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). 85, 86 Thus, one must evaluate the potential presence of BD even if DMDD is identified, and vice versa. The reliability of DMDD diagnoses was low in the DSM‐5 field trials, suggesting that it may be challenging to accurately identify clinically.

4.1.3 Course

Multiple longitudinal studies have prospectively followed cohorts of youths for 4 or more years. Consistent findings include (i) high rates of progression from BD‐NOS or CycD to BD‐I or BD‐II (eg, 43%), 64 particularly in youth with a family history of BD; (ii) high rates of recovery from episodes, particularly with treatment (eg, 81.5%); 87, 88 (iii) high rates of recurrence of depression, hypomania, or mania (eg, 62.5%); 64, 87, 89, 90 and (iv) patterns of comorbidity 91 and treatment response congruent with adult BD. 92 The prodrome of BD‐I or BD‐II, often identified retrospectively in adult studies, commonly involves attenuated mood symptoms; and sleep disturbance may be a marker clinically (see reference for detailed discussion of prodrome). 93

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: an integrated developmental psychopathology and research domain criteria (RDoC) approach [^116RveAL]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

5 Limitations of prior literature and future directions

As noted above, there are several limitations to existing ADHD research, which may be addressed through the adoption of an integrated DP and RDoC approach. Some of these limitations include that the bulk of prior work has: 1) compared youth with ADHD to typically developing youth on a single RDoC domain, 2) compared youth with ADHD to typically developing youth at a single level of analysis, 3) failed to consider the dimensional nature of the symptoms of the disorder, 4) failed to consider the role of comorbidity, and 5) failed to consider the role of development and the environment. We examine each of these limitations and call for future work to address these gaps in the literature below.

5.1. Consideration of single RDoC domains

The majority of prior work examining etiological mechanisms underlying ADHD has been focused on a single domain, and as such, has failed to consider the interaction of domains among youth with ADHD. Substantially less work has focused on the intersection across domains such as cognition and positive/negative valence. One example illustrating the importance of considering multiple RDoC domains in the study of ADHD is that of irritability. Irritability is increasingly recognized as an important influence in child psychopathology that cuts across existing diagnostic categories and is characterized by "proneness to anger". Although irritability has been emphasized in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in DSM 5, most children who meet criteria for DMDD also meet criteria for ADHD. Importantly, over development, irritability has also been associated with the development of mood and anxiety disorders. Thus, the presence of such a class of behavior may help to explain comorbidity of both externalizing (ODD) and internalizing (anxiety, mood) pathology in individuals with ADHD. Importantly, irritability appears to be influenced by multiple RDoC domains, including cognitive systems and positive and negative valence. Specifically, irritability is believed to be normally distributed among youth in the general population, and data suggest that irritability is associated with deficient reward learning, elevated sensitivity to reward receipt and omission (all positive valence), as well as maladaptive orienting to, interpreting, and labeling of threat (all negative valence), as well as deficits in cognitive control and regulation. Thus, the consideration of multiple RDoC domains across development will be important to the study of ADHD.

### Mood and affect disorders [^111qLkP8]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, with estimates for depressive episodes as high as 18.2% for girls and 7.7% for boys by age 17 years, and are a major cause of morbidity and even mortality. The primary care pediatrician should be able to (1) diagnose depressive disorders and use standardized instruments; (2) ask about suicide, self-harm, homicide, substance use, mania, and psychosis; (3) triage the severity of illness; (4) be aware of the differential diagnosis, including normal development, other depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and comorbid disorders, such as anxiety and substance use; (5) refer to evidenced-based psychotherapies; (6) prescribe first-line medications; and (7) provide ongoing coordination in a medical home. Pediatric bipolar disorders and the new disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) diagnoses are controversial but not uncommon, with prevalence estimates ranging from 0.8% to 4.3% in children at various ages. Although the pediatrician is not likely to be prescribing medications for children with bipolar disorder and DMDD diagnoses, all clinicians should be familiar with common neuroleptics and other mood stabilizers, including important potential adverse effects. Basic management of depressive and bipolar disorders is an important skill for primary care pediatricians.

### Distinguishing bipolar disorder from other psychiatric disorders in children [^1134A8RG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pediatric onset bipolar disorder (BD) is a challenging diagnosis with potentially debilitating outcomes. This review aims to critically evaluate recently published literature relevant to the diagnosis of BD in youth, emphasizing interesting and important new findings characterizing pediatric BD and reporting updates in the diagnostic and statistical manual relevant to this disorder in youth. Challenges regarding the diagnosis of BD will be discussed, in addition to important distinctions with other childhood disorders, including other bipolar spectrum disorders; major depressive disorder; dysthymia; disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other disruptive behavioral disorders; anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); psychotic disorders; autism spectrum disorders; substance use disorders; and borderline personality disorder. The review concludes with a comment on past research limitations and future directions in the field.

### Perinatal and postnatal risk factors for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder at age 11: 2004 pelotas birth cohort study [^116VWBG2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is characterized by irritability and persistent outbursts of anger that are inappropriate for the developmental stage. Those symptoms result in a pattern of chronic irritable behavior. Such symptoms manifest predominantly as verbal attacks and physical aggression directed at family members, colleagues, and teachers. The DSM-5 considers the diagnosis of DMDD only in individuals under 18 years of age.

In the field of psychiatric epidemiology, there is a consensus that mental disorders often begin in childhood or adolescence and persist into adult life, potentially even affecting the well-being of subsequent generations. In a systematic review, Kieling et al. noted that the prevalence of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence ranges from 1.8% to 39.4% in low- and middle-income countries, attributing that variation to differences among the studies evaluated, in terms of the instruments and methodology employed. They also observed that the risk factors and protective factors of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence include genetic and environmental characteristics.

To date, there are few studies examining early risk factors for DMDD and the current evidence suggests that the risk of developing DMDD is higher among the children of parents with psychopathology than among the other children and no other familial or social characteristics associated with DMDD have been previously investigated. In a systematic review with meta-analysis, Vidal-Ribas et al. showed that the irritability dimension of DMDD was distinct from that of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The authors found that the risk of depression and anxiety in later life is higher for individuals who, during childhood, show symptoms of DMDD-like irritability or are diagnosed with DMDD, as well as that the persistence of symptoms of irritability is associated with altered activation of the amygdala, striatum, and frontal regions of the brain. It has also been demonstrated that a parental history of bipolar disorder increases the risk of developing DMDD in childhood and adolescence. There is evidence of a difference between men and women in terms of the pattern of genetic effects on irritability, the genetic influence being greater among women only during childhood.

### Irritability in ADHD: associations with depression liability [^114CWThU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

More recently, severely impairing childhood chronic irritability has been conceptualised as a new diagnostic category in the mood disorders section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). This new diagnostic category, known as Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), is characterised by severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation. Alongside these temper outbursts the child experiences a persistently irritable or angry mood most of the day, nearly every day. In order for diagnostic criteria to be met, the temper outbursts and irritable mood must be present for at least 12 months, across settings, and have an onset before the age of 10 years.

Early research into DMDD in the general population, where existing data have been used to derive diagnoses retrospectively, suggests that the prevalence ranges from 0.8% to 3.3%. Children with DMDD have been found to be very impaired, with high rates of comorbidity including depression. DMDD in the context of ADHD has not been studied widely. Results from community samples suggest that 4.3–23.5% of those with ADHD meet DMDD diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the findings to date suggest that DMDD is more common in those with ADHD than in the general population. The only study that has examined the association between DMDD diagnosis and depression in an ADHD sample did not find any association with depression. However, this sample was pre-pubertal and so had not yet reached the age of risk for depression onset. Interestingly they did find an association with anxiety, an established pre-pubertal antecedent of depression.

If chronic childhood irritability is closely related to mood disorders, as conceptualised in DSM-5, then we would expect it to be associated with family history of depression and established pre-pubertal antecedents of depression in children with ADHD. Therefore, the aims of this study, which was based on a large clinical sample of children with ADHD, were to: 1) examine the prevalence of irritability, defined both as a continuous measure and categorically as DMDD, and 2) test associations between irritability and anxiety (symptoms or diagnosis), depression (symptoms or diagnosis), and family history of depression.

### Irritability as a transdiagnostic construct across childhood and adolescence: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CxwKj]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence regarding irritability has important implications for the diagnosis and classification of child and adolescent psychopathology. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association; APA,) and The International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) (World Health Organization,) both include irritability as a symptom in the criteria for disorders including oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), major depressive disorder in children and adolescents, and generalized anxiety disorder. ODD, for example, includes a distinct symptom dimension reflecting chronic irritability, which is thought to account in part for findings that ODD in childhood is a common precursor to many other forms of psychopathology across adolescence and later life (e.g. depression, suicidality, substance use, psychosis) (Burke et al; Hawes et al.). Recent revisions to the major diagnostic systems also reflect ongoing debate regarding the classification of chronic irritability (Evans et al; Fristad; Runions et al.). For example, DSM-5 included a new childhood mood disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), whereas ICD-11 introduced chronic irritability as a specifier within ODD (See also: Copeland et al; Lochman et al.).

Interest in irritability as a transdiagnostic construct has grown significantly in recent years, driving considerable research into associations between irritability and various symptom domains. In addition to testing these associations through methods such as factor analysis and network analysis (e.g. Burke et al; Tseng et al.), meta-analysis has been used in two studies to date. Vidal-Ribas et al. analyzed data from 12 longitudinal studies of chronic non-episodic irritability as a predictor of future mental health disorders. Irritability was reported to be significantly associated with depression and anxiety but not conduct problems such as ODD and conduct disorder (CD), and research priorities were identified, including the need for studies using high-quality measures of irritability. Research in the area has since grown rapidly, and a number of such measures have been widely adopted, including the Affective Reactivity Index, which is recommended in DSM-5 as a cross cutting symptom measure for irritability in 6–17-year-olds (APA).

### Editorial: safer use of antipsychotics in youth (SUAY): should treatment Be guided by symptoms? [^117SwQkR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists have company as they wrestle with clinical decision making regarding when it is appropriate to prescribe an antipsychotic. Pediatricians face a similar challenge in trying to determine under what circumstances to prescribe an antibiotic. Both classes of medications are powerful and can be lifesaving, but they are not without the risk of associated adverse events and cumulative exposure. Concerns regarding the widespread use of antipsychotics in children and adolescents have been supported by national trends indicating predominance of prescriptions for conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and impulsive aggression) 1,2 other than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder with mania, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, and tic disorders); the risks of weight gain, diabetes mellitus, and other adverse effects to which youths appear to be more vulnerable than adults 3; and potential disparities related to the absence of race and ethnicity in large administrative datasets. 4 Previous studies of antipsychotic prescribing patterns predate the widespread use of the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. A recent study found that 58.9% of youths given a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder were prescribed antipsychotics compared with 51% of youths with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 5 In this issue of the Journal, Penfold et al. 6 report on a novel approach to antipsychotic prescribing focused on symptoms rather than diagnoses developed as the initial phase of a pragmatic clinical trial, Targeted and Safer Use of Antipsychotics in Youth (SUAY), funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and designed to test the effectiveness of targeted interventions on the use of antipsychotics for youth 4 to 17 years old in large health care systems. We offer some perspectives on differences that distinguish this approach; the process used in its development; and its promise, potential pitfalls, and policy and clinical implications.

### Investigating the genetic underpinnings of early-life irritability [^115TP3wr]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe irritability has long been recognized as a common accompanying difficulty to neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest early in development. Irritability is commonly defined as a heightened propensity to react with anger, grouchiness, or tantrums relative to peers and is particularly common in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent estimates suggest it is present in around 25–45% of children with ADHD, when defined broadly as emotion dysregulation (which can include an inability to control other emotions, such as sadness). As well as being common, emerging evidence suggests that irritability — as well as broader constructs which include irritability (for example, emotion dysregulation, behavioral problems) — appears to index clinical severity and is associated with adverse outcomes in individuals with ADHD. It is currently unclear how irritability should be conceptualized, particularly because it is a trans-diagnostic construct. Within DSM-5, irritability is included as a feature of a number of different diagnostic categories. Severe chronic childhood irritability has recently been categorized by the new DSM-5 diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and classed as a mood disorder because of links with later depression. However, childhood irritability behaves similarly to ADHD (and other neurodevelopmental disorders) in that onset is early in development and levels tend to decline from childhood to adolescence, raising the possibility that earlier-onset irritability behaves more like a neurodevelopmental difficulty such as ADHD, rather than a mood disorder.

### Perinatal and postnatal risk factors for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder at age 11: 2004 pelotas birth cohort study [^113iYdjH]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

2.2 Outcome

To diagnose DMDD, we used the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) questionnaire. The DAWBA consists of open and closed questions identifying the occurrence of symptoms based on the DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria for mental disorders. It was developed for use in children and adolescents between 5 and 17 years of age. The open questions allow qualitative description of the symptoms, frequency, and other characteristics of the disorders assessed. In addition, a clinical evaluator (rater) can evaluate each of the questionnaires individually, integrating the responses to the questions and determining the diagnosis. A second independent rater evaluated 10% of the subjects in the cohort. The DAWBA was validated in Brazil and the agreement between the two clinical raters was 0.93 for any disorder (SE 0.03), 0.91 for internalizing disorders (SE 0.05), and 1.0 for externalizing disorders.

The DAWBA was applied to mothers or caregivers by psychologists who had been trained in its standardized administration. The training included lectures, role playing, and supervised clinical interviews with pediatric and mental health outpatients at the Federal University of Pelotas, totaling more than 40 h. The DAWBAs were applied via computer, allowing direct input of the data into an online system. Details of the questionnaire can be found online, as well as in other studies. For the purposes of this study, we used the section that evaluates the symptoms of DMDD according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

### Editorial: white matter matters: neurobiological differences between pediatric bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^112NXABo]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Think about this: Linke et al. 1 are publishing the "first" ever study using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Child and adolescent psychiatrists know that these children are not new and are not uncommonly seen in both inpatient and outpatient mental health settings. So, why does the first paper examining the microstructural differences in white matter tracts in children with DMDD emerge in 2019? If you search PubMed using the key words "autism" and "diffusion tensor imaging" (as children with autistic symptoms have likely been around for as long as children with symptoms of dysregulation), you end up with 305 papers. So, what's the story? Was aberrant white matter microstructure never considered as a putative hypothesis for DMDD? Or did DMDD fall under a different name, and, as Shakespeare once wrote, "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"? Or, in our loose psychiatric-based translation from Old English, "a pediatric bipolar child by any other name is just as dysregulated?" Indeed, DMDD has had a circuitous and somewhat shady history, with its roots in the name "pediatric bipolar disorder". 2 Because a number of long-term studies showed that few children with chronic irritable mood problems progressed to develop adult bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), 3 DMDD emerged in the DSM-5. 4.

### Neural correlates of irritability in disruptive mood dysregulation and bipolar disorders [^113KcLLp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) are clinically and pathophysiologically distinct, yet irritability can be a clinical feature of both illnesses. The authors examine whether the neural mechanisms mediating irritability differ between bipolar disorder and DMDD, using a face emotion labeling paradigm because such labeling is deficient in both patient groups. The authors hypothesized that during face emotion labeling, irritability would be associated with dysfunctional activation in the amygdala and other temporal and prefrontal regions in both disorders, but that the nature of these associations would differ between DMDD and bipolar disorder.

Method

During functional MRI acquisition, 71 youths (25 with DMDD, 24 with bipolar disorder, and 22 healthy youths) performed a labeling task with happy, fearful, and angry faces of varying emotional intensity.

Results

Participants with DMDD and bipolar disorder showed similar levels of irritability and did not differ from each other or from healthy youths in face emotion labeling accuracy. Irritability correlated with amygdala activity across all intensities for all emotions in the DMDD group; such correlation was present in the bipolar disorder group only for fearful faces. In the ventral visual stream, associations between neural activity and irritability were found more consistently in the DMDD group than in the bipolar disorder group, especially in response to ambiguous angry faces.

Conclusions

These results suggest diagnostic specificity in the neural correlates of irritability, a symptom of both DMDD and bipolar disorder. Such evidence of distinct neural correlates suggests the need to evaluate different approaches to treating irritability in the two disorders.

### Interpersonal psychotherapy for mood and behavior dysregulation: pilot randomized trial [^113zWrcB]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Youth with chronic irritability and excessive reactivity, diagnosed as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), have social impairment in multiple settings (i.e., peers, school, and home). This paper presents a pilot randomized trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for mood and behavior dysregulation (IPT-MBD), an adapted version of IPT for depressed adolescents. IPT-MBD focuses on decreasing outbursts and irritability and improving interpersonal interactions.

Methods

Nineteen adolescents (aged 12–17) with DMDD or its research precursor, severe mood dysregulation, were randomly assigned to IPT-MBD (n = 10) or treatment-as-usual (TAU, n = 9) in a 24-week psychosocial intervention study. Assessments of mood symptoms and overall functioning were conducted by an independent evaluator, blinded to treatment, every 4 weeks. Parent and self-report irritability measures were collected every 4 weeks.

Results

Eighty percent of participants randomized to the IPT-MBD arm completed the study. Also, participants enrolled in the IPT-MBD arm attended > 80% of therapy sessions. Parents and teens agreed that the frequency and duration of therapy were appropriate and were satisfied with IPT-MBD treatment. Clinical global impression scales for severity and improvement showed statistically greater improvement in the IPT-MBD group compared to TAU.

Conclusions

In this small pilot randomized trial, IPT-MBD was feasible and acceptable to parents and teens. There was significantly more improvement in the IPT-MBD group compared to TAU. IPT-MBD holds promise as a potentially effective psychosocial intervention for clinically impaired youth with DMDD and warrants further investigation in a larger randomized trial.

### A randomized clinical trial of an integrative group therapy for children with severe mood dysregulation [^112RBTEV]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonepisodic irritability is a common and impairing problem, leading to the development of the diagnoses severe mood dysregulation (SMD) and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). No psychosocial therapies have been formally evaluated for either, with medication being the most common treatment. This study examined the feasibility and efficacy of a joint parent-child intervention for SMD.

Method

A total of 68 participants aged 7 to 12 years with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and SMD were randomly assigned to the 11-week therapy or community-based psychosocial treatment. All participants were first stabilized on psychostimulant medication by study physicians. Of the participants, 56 still manifested impairing SMD symptoms and entered the therapy phase. Masked evaluators assessed participants at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint, with therapy participants reassessed 6 weeks later.

Results

All but 2 therapy participants attended the majority of sessions (n = 29), with families reporting high levels of satisfaction. The primary outcome of change in mood symptoms using the Mood Severity Index (MSI) did not reach significance except in the subset attending the majority of sessions (effect size = 0.53). Therapy was associated with significantly greater improvement in parent-rated irritability (effect size = 0.63). Treatment effects for irritability but not MSI diminished after therapy stopped. Little impact on ADHD symptoms was seen. Results may not be generalizable to youth with SMD and comorbidities different from those seen in this sample of children with ADHD, and are limited by the lack of a gold standard for measuring change in SMD symptoms.

Conclusion

While failing to significantly improve mood symptoms versus community treatment, the integrative therapy was found to be a feasible and efficacious treatment for irritability in participants with SMD and ADHD.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: a conceptual and quantitative review [^113ZPWVz]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Irritability describes proneness to anger. As many other psychiatric concepts, before it entered nosology, it was the domain of poets, philosophers, and theologians. It was featured in Burton's concept of melancholia, and it was termed "krankhafte Reizbarkeit" (literally, pathological irritability) in Bleuler's textbook of psychiatry. It also has a venerable history in psychoanalysis, self-directed hostility underlying what Freud described as "the undoubtedly pleasurable self-torture of melancholy".

Irritability was omnipresent in all recent versions of the DSM as a symptom of psychiatric disorders and is, alongside lack of concentration and restlessness, one of the few symptoms to cut across externalizing and internalizing disorders. Chronic severe irritability as the primary feature of a new diagnostic category was introduced in the DSM-5 in response to the controversy regarding the debate over the diagnosis of bipolar in children. Over the last 10 to 15 years, the number of prepubertal children diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) in the United States has increased at rates close to 500%. This increase was thought to result partly from counting severe and chronic irritability of early onset ("present forever" or "since the first year of life") as a cardinal manic symptom, analogous to the classical cardinal manic symptoms of elated mood or episodic irritability. The diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)was an attempt to curb what was seen as an overdiagnosis of BD, while recognizing the burden of problems suffered by children whose primary problem was chronic severe irritability, for whom there was no diagnostic home in the DSM.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder characteristics: II. clinical correlates of irritable mood [^113kw8t6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This study describes the relationship of irritable mood (IRR) with affective disorders in youths with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods

Five hundred ADHD subjects were assessed with the childhood version of the Schedule for Affective Disorder & Schizophrenia. Subjects were in a genetic ADHD protocol and limited to those of Caucasian/European descent.

Results

The most prevalent concurrent diagnoses were oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (43.6%), minor depression/dysthymic disorder (MDDD) (18.8%), and generalized anxiety (13.2%)/overanxious disorder (12.4%). IRR subjects (21.0%) compared to the non-IRR (NIRR) group had higher rates of all affective disorders (76.2% vs. 9.6%) and ODD (83.8% vs. 32.9%) but lower rates of hyperactive ADHD (1.9% vs. 8.9%). Among those without comorbidities, 98.3% were NIRR. Logistic regression found IRR mood significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 33.4), MDDD (OR: 11.2), ODD (OR: 11.6), and combined ADHD (OR: 1.7) but not with anxiety disorders. Among symptoms, it associated IRR mood with a pattern of dysthymic and ODD symptoms but with fewer separation anxiety symptoms. Diagnostic and symptomatic parameters were unaffected by demographic variables.

Limitations

Potential confounders influencing these results include patient recruitment from only one clinical service; a cohort specific sample effect because some presumed affective disorders and non-Caucasians were excluded; and the young mean age (10.2 years) limiting comorbid patterns.

Conclusions

The prominence of an MDDD pattern suggests this IRR group is appropriate in the DSM V's proposed chronic depressive disorder, possibly with or without temper dysregulation. A new diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may be unwarranted.

### Atypical depression: a valid subtype? [^112ds397]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The concept of atypical depression has evolved over the past several decades, yet remains inadequately defined. As currently defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), the main criterion of atypical depression is the presence of mood reactivity in combination with at least 2 of 4 secondary criteria (hypersomnia, hyperphagia and weight gain, leaden paralysis, and oversensitivity to criticism and rejection). The focus on mood reactivity as the primary distinguishing criterion remains questionable among researchers who have been unable to verify the primacy of this symptom in relation to the other diagnostic criteria for atypical depression. A model challenging the DSM-IV-TR definition of atypical depression has been developed, redefining the disorder as a dimensional nonmelancholic syndrome in which individuals with a personality subtype of "interpersonal rejection sensitivity" have a tendency toward the onset of anxiety disorders and depression, thereby exhibiting a variety of dysregulated emotional and self-consolatory responses. This reformulated definition of atypical depression (in arguing for the primacy of a personality style or rejection sensitivity as against mood reactivity) may lead to a better understanding and recognition of the disorder and its symptoms as well as other "spectrum" disorders within the scope of major depression.

Irritability is defined as an 'increased propensity to exhibit anger relative to one's peers' (Leibenluft, p.277) and a 'relative dispositional tendency to respond with anger to blocked goal attainment, and includes both mood (trait) and behavioral (reactive state) dysregulation' (Camacho, Karim, & Perlman; Fishburn et al. p.69; Stringaris et al; Wakschlag et al.). It is the hallmark symptom of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5) criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) (American Psychiatric Association). Moreover, it is a symptom prevalent in many other psychiatric diagnoses including major depressive disorder (MDD) (Stringaris, Maughan, Copeland, Costello, & Angold,), bipolar disorder (Berk et al.), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Karalunas et al.), and oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (Young et al.). Maladaptive irritability is one of the most common reasons children present to a clinic for mental health services (Avenevoli, Blader, & Leibenluft).

While increased irritability is seen in many patient groups, a specific symptom that frequently co-occurs with irritability in both clinical and community samples is anxiety (Cornacchio, Crum, Coxe, Pincus, & Comer; Kircanski et al; Stoddard et al.). Indeed, youths with significant levels of irritability are at an increased risk for the future development of anxiety disorders (Savage et al; Stringaris & Goodman). Moreover, models of the pathophysiology underpinning irritability and anxiety show considerable overlap. Heightened responsiveness to threat signals within the amygdala and connected neural structures has been related to both irritability (Blair; Kircanski et al; Leibenluft; Wiggins et al.) and anxiety (Blair et al; LeDoux & Pine; Salum, Desousa, do Rosario, Pine, & Manfro).

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^113c5NWS]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidities with youth depressive disorders — As many as 40% to 90% of youth with depressive disorders have psychiatric comorbidities; common comorbidities include anxiety, disruptive behavior, ADHD, and substance use disorders; comorbidities may heighten distress and functional impairment and may worsen treatment outcomes; each comorbid disorder may require a separate treatment plan and may influence selection of treatment; use of the Parent- and Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures or screening questions embedded in structured interview guides can standardize and enhance the efficiency of the psychiatric review of systems to assess comorbidities, and if screens are positively endorsed, the ensuing interview can ascertain whether full diagnostic criteria are met.

### Severe mood dysregulation, irritability, and the diagnostic boundaries of bipolar disorder in youths [^116bRBHP]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

In recent years, increasing numbers of children have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In some cases, children with unstable mood clearly meet current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder, and in others, the diagnosis is unclear. Severe mood dysregulation is a syndrome defined to capture the symptomatology of children whose diagnostic status with respect to bipolar disorder is uncertain, that is, those who have severe, nonepisodic irritability and the hyperarousal symptoms characteristic of mania but who lack the well-demarcated periods of elevated or irritable mood characteristic of bipolar disorder. Levels of impairment are comparable between youths with bipolar disorder and those with severe mood dysregulation. An emerging literature compares children with severe mood dysregulation and those with bipolar disorder in longitudinal course, family history, and pathophysiology. Longitudinal data in both clinical and community samples indicate that nonepisodic irritability in youths is common and is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Data also suggest that youths with severe mood dysregulation have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do those with bipolar disorder. While youths in both patient groups have deficits in face emotion labeling and experience more frustration than do normally developing children, the brain mechanisms mediating these pathophysiologic abnormalities appear to differ between the two patient groups. No specific treatment for severe mood dysregulation currently exists, but verification of its identity as a syndrome distinct from bipolar disorder by further research should include treatment trials.

### White matter microstructure in pediatric bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^117Jsynw]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) codifies severe, chronic irritability. Youths with bipolar disorder (BD) also present with irritability, but with an episodic course. To date, it is not clear whether aberrant white matter microstructure-a well-replicated finding in BD-can be observed in DMDD and relates to symptoms of irritability.

Method

We acquired diffusion tensor imaging data from 118 participants (BD = 36, DMDD = 44, healthy volunteers (HV = 38). Images of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were processed with tract-based spatial statistics controlling for age and sex. The data were also used to train Gaussian process classifiers to predict diagnostic group.

Results

In BD vs DMDD, FA in the corticospinal tract was reduced. In DMDD vs HV, reductions in FA and AD were confined to the anterior corpus callosum. In BD vs HV, widespread reductions in FA and increased RD were observed. FA in the anterior corpus callosum and corticospinal tract was negatively associated with irritability. The Gaussian process classifier could not discriminate between BD and DMDD, but achieved 68% accuracy in predicting DMDD vs HV and 75% accuracy in predicting BD vs HV.

Conclusion

Aberrant white matter microstructure was associated with both categorical diagnosis and the dimension of irritability. Alterations in DMDD were regionally discrete and related to reduced AD. In BD, we observed widespread increases in RD, supporting the hypothesis of altered myelination in BD. These findings will contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of DMDD and its differentiation from BD.

### A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of citalopram adjunctive to stimulant medication in youth with chronic severe irritability [^112gvJrJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the clinical importance of chronic and severe irritability, there is a paucity of controlled trials for its pharmacological treatment. Here, we examine the effects of adding citalopram (CTP) to methylphenidate (MPH) in the treatment of chronic severe irritability in youth using a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design.

Method

After a lead-in phase of open treatment with stimulant, 53 youth meeting criteria for severe mood dysregulation (SMD) were randomly assigned to receive CTP or placebo (PBO) for 8 weeks. A total of 49 participants, 48 of them (98%) meeting disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) criteria, were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of response based on improvements of irritability at the week 8 of the trial.

Results

At the end of the trial, a significantly higher proportion of response was seen in those participants randomly assigned to CTP+MPH compared to PBO+MPH (35% CTP+MPH versus 6% PBO+MPH; odds ratio = 11.70, 95% CI = 2.00–68.16, p = 0.006). However, there were no differences in functional impairment between groups at the end of the trial. No differences were found in any adverse effect between treatment groups, and no trial participant exhibited hypomanic or manic symptoms.

Conclusion

Adjunctive CTP might be efficacious in the treatment of chronic severe irritability in youth resistant to stimulant treatment alone.

### Neurodevelopmental risk and adaptation as a model for comorbidity among internalizing and externalizing disorders: genomics and cell-specific expression enriched morphometric study [^1141KACL]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Definition of diagnostic families

Mental disorder diagnoses were determined by using parent or guardian responses to the computerized Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria. Lifetime (past or present) diagnoses of the 18 disorders were used. Based on the definition of broad diagnostic families adopted in recent studies, two broad diagnostic families including externalizing disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), internalizing disorders (dysthymia, major depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, specific phobia, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder) were used in our analysis (Fig. 1 A). We excluded children with thought disorders (hallucinations, delusions, associated psychotic symptoms, bipolar disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder) in the manuscript for two reasons: (1) the sample size of thought disorders is too small (N = 347) compared to that of externalizing/internalizing disorders, and (2) involving thought disorders would make the single diagnostic families (externalizing or internalizing) contain children with comorbidity. We also consider the influence of thought disorders in Additional file 1.

### Phasic versus tonic irritability: differential associations with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder symptoms [^1112Bkti]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Irritability is a multifaceted construct in pediatric psychopathology. It has been conceptualized as having a phasic dimension and a tonic dimension. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is defined by the presence of both dimensions. Severe irritability, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is highly comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it is unknown whether the presence of ADHD modulates the expression of phasic and tonic irritability.

Method

A data-driven, latent variable approach was used to examine irritability and ADHD symptoms in a transdiagnostic pediatric sample (N = 489) with primary disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, ADHD, subclinical irritability symptoms, or no diagnosis. Using latent profile analyses, we identified 4 classes: high levels of both irritability and ADHD symptoms, high levels of irritability and moderate levels of ADHD symptoms, moderate levels of irritability and high levels of ADHD symptoms, and low levels of both irritability and ADHD symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis operationalized phasic irritability and tonic irritability.

Results

As expected, the 2 latent classes characterized by high overall irritability exhibited the highest levels of both phasic and tonic irritability. However, between these 2 high irritability classes, highly comorbid ADHD symptoms were associated with significantly greater phasic irritability than were moderately comorbid ADHD symptoms. In contrast, the 2 high irritability groups did not differ on levels of tonic irritability.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that phasic, but not tonic, irritability has a significant association with ADHD symptoms and that phasic and tonic might be distinct, though highly related, irritability dimensions. Future research should investigate potential mechanisms underlying this differential association.

### Is there a core neuropsychiatric phenotype in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome? [^115sCJy7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the clinical features of psychiatric illness in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), and to review current evidence that a core neuropsychiatric phenotype could underlie the full spectrum of different presentations.

Recent Findings

Individuals carrying the 22q11.2 microdeletion are at risk for diverse psychiatric diagnoses across the lifespan, including schizophrenia in a significant minority, and anxiety or mood disorder in the majority. Symptoms and cognitive disruptions can be grouped into domains: attention-executive deficits, social-cognitive deficits, anxiety-affective dysregulation, and psychotic phenomena. These domains do not respect the boundaries of traditional diagnostic categories, and can be consistently recognized in children, adolescents and adults. There is early evidence that some symptom-domain disruptions may predict adult psychiatric morbidity.

Summary

If a core neuropsychiatric phenotype does exist in 22q11DS, its detection is likely to require dimensional assessment of subtle aspects of cognitive and emotional processing, not encompassed by current diagnostic systems. A core phenotype would account for disruptions across multiple symptom domains, directly reflecting genetic and neurobiological mechanisms. Relative severity of a core phenotype would predict risk for multiple psychiatric disorders, and could, therefore, be an important target for therapeutic and preventive interventions. A core phenotype meeting these criteria has not yet been defined for 22q11DS.

### Deficits in emotion recognition are associated with depressive symptoms in youth with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^112whx2c]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although severe irritability is a predictor of future depression according to recent meta-analytic evidence, other mechanisms for this developmental transition remain unclear. In this study, we test whether deficits in emotion recognition may partially explain this specific association in youth with severe irritability, defined as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD).

Methods

Participants aged 8–20 years (M = 13.3, SD = 2.8) included youth with DMDD, split by low depressive (DMDD/LD; n = 52) and high depressive (DMDD/HD; n = 25) symptoms, and healthy controls (HC; n = 39). A standardized computer task assessed emotion recognition of faces and voices of adults and children expressing happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. A Group (3) × Emotion (4) × Actor (2) × Modality (2) repeated measures analysis of covariance examined the number of errors and misidentification of emotions. Linear regression was then used to assess whether deficits in emotion recognition were predictive of depressive symptoms at a 1 year follow-up.

Results

DMDD/HD youth were more likely to interpret happy stimuli as angry and fearful compared to DMDD/LD (happy as angry: p = 0.018; happy as fearful: p = 0.008) and HC (happy as angry: p = 0.014; happy as fearful: p = 0.024). In youth with DMDD, the misidentification of happy stimuli as fearful was associated with higher depressive symptoms at follow-up (β = 0.43, p = 0.017), independent of baseline depressive and irritability symptoms.

Conclusions

Deficits in emotion recognition are associated, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with depressive symptoms in youth with severe irritability. Future studies should examine the neural correlates that contribute to these associations.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: a conceptual and quantitative review [^114jLRkT]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Boundaries to Normality and Dysregulation

Anger can be a normal reactionand can vary along with other temperamental traits; it can also predict significant impairment throughout life. Deciding where to set the threshold above which irritability would be considered pathological can be difficult and may vary, depending on factors such as the young person's age or environment. Because clinicians must make binary decisions ("to treat or not to treat"), having a threshold is important. However, such cut-offs are often arbitrary, and, as we shall see below, this arbitrariness may have a negative impact upon reliability and validity. It is possible to derive empirical thresholds, for example, defining levels of irritability based on the amount of associated impairment.

The term "dysregulation" — frequently used to describe irritability (as, for example, in DMDD) — entails a judgment about what is pathological. Irritability is one of many manifestations of mood dysregulation.

With these discussions about normativity in mind, it is not surprising that estimates of the prevalence of irritability can vary substantially. For example, lifetime prevalence of SMD was observed to be about 3.3% in children and adolescents aged 9 to 19 years. The rates of DMDD were similar (3.3%) in a sample of preschool children. However, these rates decreased to 1% in 2 samples of older youth. Studies examining mood dysregulation and mood lability, which includes irritability as 1 of its manifestations, have reported higher prevalence estimates. In community studies, 5% to 6% of youth aged 8 to 19 had a lot of mood lability, and 3.8% of youth aged 4 to 16 years presented with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Dysregulation phenotype, which is linked to irritability. Finally, about 20% of adolescents participating in the Isle of Wight studywere rated as displaying significant irritability in terms of frequency, severity, and duration.

### What is a mental disorder? An exemplar-focused approach [^117V8AcR]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DSM definitions of mental disorder

DSM has responded to these debates in its definitions of mental disorders. Thus DSM-III emphasizes, for example, that clinicians should not misclassify or label a cultural expression of distress or political deviance as a disease (American Psychiatric Association). Subsequent editions of DSM have emphasized that the boundaries of mental disorders are fuzzy (Table 1) (American Psychiatric Association).

Table 1.
DSM-IV definition of mental disorder

During the development of DSM-5, along with others, we attempted to further clarify the DSM criteria for a mental disorder (Table 2) (Stein et al.). While our proposal differs modestly from the later DSM-5 wording (Table 3), three differences are relevant here. First, while the DSM-5 definition refers to dysfunction in 'psychological, biological, or developmental processes', we prefer 'psychobiological', to emphasize that psychology and biology are intertwined constructs that encompass development, as well as other life-course constructs.

Table 2.
DSM-V proposal for the definition of mental/psychiatric disorder

Table 3.
DSM-5 definition of mental disorder

Second, our proposal suggested that the consequences of a mental disorder are clinically significant distress or disability (B). The DSM-5 wording indicates that mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or impairment. The word 'usually' may be technically accurate, in that on rare occasions, a mental disorder is listed in DSM-5, and there is no 'clinical criterion' (First & Wakefield). However, given that psychiatric symptoms are often on a continuum with normality, the clinical criterion is one key way of providing a relatively valid and reliable marker of underlying dysfunction, so lessening the risk of false positives and over-medicalization (Cooper). Other ways in which clinical criteria can validly and reliably point to underlying dysfunction include descriptions of symptom severity, excessiveness, frequency, and duration (First & Wakefield).

Third, our proposal made reference to considerations of diagnostic validity and clinical utility. This explicitly emphasizes that decisions about proposals for new entities must address empirical data. Certainly, data on diagnostic validity and clinical utility of proposed entities were carefully assessed during the DSM-5 revision process.

### Association of genetic and environmental risks for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder with hypomanic symptoms in youths [^114v3Ciw]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Early identification of individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder (BD) is essential for prevention and interventionand can be aided by investigating hypomanic symptoms in youths. Bipolar disorder is characterized by hypomanic or manic episodes. Hypomania is common in youths, with up to 10% identified as being at high risk of BD based on the clustering, duration, and impairment of symptoms. Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms or traits have been linked to subsequent manic or hypomanic episodes and BD onset.

There is evidence that BD is preceded by childhood ADHD; a population-based studyfound higher incidence rates of BD among those with a history of ADHD (incidence rate, 23.86) compared with those without (incidence rate, 2.17). The comorbidity rates of BD-ADHD are higher than expected by chance; the weighted mean prevalence of ADHD in pediatric bipolar samples is 48%. A studythat used modified BD diagnostic criteria characterized by nonepisodic irritability and ultrarapid cycling in pediatric samples reported high ADHD-BD comorbidity rates of 74% to 98%. The focus on nonepisodic irritability, which also covers temper outbursts and emotion dysregulation, may have increased these comorbidity rates because such symptoms are associated features of ADHD. After much debate, there is some consensus that nonepisodic irritability is more characteristic of severe mood dysregulation or disruptive dysregulation disorder rather than BD. Thus, care needs to be taken to differentiate between BD and these syndromes.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^115rrgrS]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ICD-11 considers bipolar disorders as mood disorders, as the ICD-10 did (but not the DSM-5, which lists them in a separate chapter). Perhaps the most significant change is that the ICD-10 required two or more episodes of elevated mood, whereas the ICD-11 has lowered the threshold to one or more manic or mixed episodes to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. A manic episode is therefore no longer an independently diagnosable condition as it was in the ICD-10. This parallels a significant shift in clinical thinking. Orthodoxy had it that individuals should not start mood stabilizers until a couple of manic episodes had occurred. More recent evidence suggests that the response to treatment is best after the first episode and declines thereafter, and this decline is associated with a potentially neuroprogressive process with substantial clinical and functional sequelae. Additionally, the ICD-11 now requires a duration of at least 1 week for mania, while the ICD-10 did not have duration criteria and the ICD-11 waives this if treatment is present.

Allowing a mixed episode is a further significant change from the ICD-10, which specified the requirement of hypomania or mania and depression. Again, mixed episodes and their treatment implications are increasingly recognized in the clinical literature and this is a welcome change suggesting the need for a differentially tailored treatment approach. Mixed episodes are defined as being characterized by rapid alternation between or an admixture of prominent manic or depressive symptoms with a duration of at least 2 weeks, and therefore they remain in the ICD-11 as an episode type as opposed to the DSM-5, which converted those into a specifier. Rapid cycling is defined based on the frequency of episodes of mood disturbance, requiring at least four episodes in the past 12 months, as traditionally stated.

In the ICD-11, the diagnostic guideline for mania allows for euphoria, irritability, or expansiveness together with increased activity or subjectively increased energy as well as other characteristic manic symptoms, without specifying the number of symptoms. There remains controversy around the inclusion of irritability, which is a far more non-specific phenomenon with much overlap with disorders such as ADHD, conduct disorder, and personality disorders. Allowing mania based principally in the context of irritability risks blurring the boundary between these disorders. However, the requirement for increased activity or energy is an important and positive change, concordant with recent data suggesting a critical role of a biphasic change in mitochondrial energy generation as core to the biology of the disorder.

### Editorial: exemplifying a cognitive science-driven approach to intervention innovation: targeting face emotion labeling to reduce anger-proneness in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [^115Q6b9K]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a condition in which children or adolescents experience chronically irritable or angry mood. These feelings typically manifest through frequent and intense temper outbursts that can be verbal (eg, yelling) or physical (eg, hitting). These symptoms carry a personal cost, affecting family life, peer relationships, and school functioning. Yet, evidence-based treatment options can be difficult to access. A recent therapeutic solution-Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM)-lies in targeting neurocognitive mechanisms known to maintain and contribute to irritability. In this issue, Haller and colleagues use a fast-fail approach (based on a pre-registered study protocol) to evaluate the potential of a new CBM intervention for young people with DMDD. Here, we discuss what work is needed before the potential of this intervention can be translated for clinical use.

### The phenomenology of bipolar disorder: what drives the high rate of medical burden and determines long-term prognosis? [^116nq824]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) has been classically described as one of episodic mood disturbances. New evidence suggests that a chronic course and multisystem involvement is the rule, rather than the exception, and that together with disturbances of circadian rhythms, mood instability, cognitive impairment, a high rate of medical burden is often observed. The current diagnostic approach for BD neither describes the multisystem involvement that the recent literature has highlighted nor points toward potential predictors of long- term outcome. In light of the new evidence that the long-term course of BD is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and an increased mortality from medical disease, we propose a multidimensional approach that includes several symptom domains, namely affective instability, circadian rhythm dysregulation, and cognitive and executive dysfunction, presenting in various combinations that give shape to each individual presentation, and offers potential indicators of overall long-term prognosis.

Circadian dysfunction, mTOR, and MD

Introduction of MD

MD refer to conditions that severely affect the mood and its associated functions. According to DSM-5, MD broadly include major depressive disorders (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) I and II, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder, cyclothymic disorder, and premenstrual psychotic disorder. MDD refers to a heterogeneous and multifactorial psychiatric illness acting at different levels such as psychological, biological, genetic, and social. MDD is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States with a prevalence of about 7.8% of adults having at least one episode of mood disorders (2019; NIMH). The diagnosis of MDD includes consistent depressed/low mood, constant feeling of anhedonia, lack of concentration, poor sleep patterns, a state of worthlessness, changes in appetite, psychomotor impairments, and even suicidal thoughts. The prevalence of MDD is higher in females (9.6%) than in males (6%). Also, it is maximum in the age group 18–25 (15.2%) has the highest MDD episodes. BD is a serious type of MD identified by recurrent episodes of depression altering with periods of mania that are usually separated by periods of relatively normal mood and functioning.

### Toward the future of psychiatric diagnosis: the seven pillars of RDoC [^112aUjjE]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current diagnostic systems for mental disorders rely upon presenting signs and symptoms, with the result that current definitions do not adequately reflect relevant neurobiological and behavioral systems — impeding not only research on etiology and pathophysiology but also the development of new treatments.

Discussion

The National Institute of Mental Health began the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project in 2009 to develop a research classification system for mental disorders based upon dimensions of neurobiology and observable behavior. RDoC supports research to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that cut across current heterogeneous disorder categories. We summarize the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC, outline challenges in developing a research classification system (such as construct validity and a suitable process for updating the framework) and discuss seven distinct differences in conception and emphasis from current psychiatric nosologies.

Summary

Future diagnostic systems cannot reflect ongoing advances in genetics, neuroscience and cognitive science until a literature organized around these disciplines is available to inform the revision efforts. The goal of the RDoC project is to provide a framework for research to transform the approach to the nosology of mental disorders.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: a conceptual and quantitative review [^114dTAik]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The Phasic and Tonic Components of Irritability

An alternative clinical conceptualization of irritability is presented in the DSM-5 and derives from the work of Leibenluft et al. defining the syndrome of severe mood dysregulation (SMD), the precursor to DMDD. The DSM-5 criteria for DMDD identify 2 components of irritability. Phasic irritability refers to developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts, whereas tonic irritability refers to the negative affect that persists between outbursts. These 2 components were included in SMD because the temper outbursts are the hallmark clinical feature of these children, whereas requiring the tonic component allowed the investigators to recruit a sample of children who, like those with BD, have a severe and persistent mood disorder. The latter was important because SMD was operationalized to compare youth with chronic, persistent, severe irritability (i.e. the SMD phenotype) to youth who have distinct manic episodes characterized by elated mood (i.e. classic BD). However, it is unclear whether tonic and phasic irritability are distinct constructs in terms of validators such as longitudinal clinical predictions, treatment response, pathophysiology, or family history. The 2 constructs are difficult to distinguish in secondary analyses of epidemiological data, yet the distinction needs to be tested in clinical data using instruments specifically designed to capture each component. The DSM-5 account of irritability has the advantage of being purely descriptive and not having to resort to concepts such as emotion or mood that are hard to define in their own right.

### Modeling shared and specific variances of irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity yields novel insights into white matter perturbations [^113BP7ru]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity, which are common presentations of childhood psychopathology, have been associated with perturbed white matter microstructure. However, similar tracts have been implicated across these phenotypes; such non-specificity could be rooted in their high co-occurrence. To address this problem, we use a bifactor approach parsing unique and shared components of irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity, which we then relate to white matter microstructure.

Method

We developed a bifactor model based on the Conners Comprehensive Behavioral Rating Scale in a sample of youth with no psychiatric diagnosis or a primary diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (n = 521). We applied the model to an independent yet sociodemographically and clinically comparable sample (n = 152), in which we tested associations between latent variables and fractional anisotropy (FA).

Results

The bifactor model fit well (comparative fit index = 0.99; root mean square error of approximation = 0.07). The shared factor was positively associated with an independent measure of impulsivity (ρ S = 0.88, p FDR < .001) and negatively related to whole-brain FA (r = -0.20), as well as FA of the corticospinal tract (all p FWE < .05). FA increased with age and deviation from this curve, indicating that altered white matter maturation was associated with the hyperactivity-specific factor (r = -0.16, p FWE < .05). Inattention-specific and irritability-specific factors were not linked to FA.

Conclusion

Perturbed white matter microstructure may represent a shared neurobiological mechanism of irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity related to heightened impulsivity. Furthermore, hyperactivity might be uniquely associated with a delay in white matter maturation.

Plain Language Summary

In this study, researchers developed a model identifying shared aspects of key symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), more specifically irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity. In 521 participants, impulsivity emerged as a shared factor. Applied to 152 youth with brain imaging data, shared impulsivity, not specific symptoms, related to atypical brain structure. Additionally, hyperactivity was linked to delayed white matter maturation. Study findings suggest this approach might identify mechanisms of these childhood disorders that remain hidden when relying on traditional diagnostic categories.

4.2 Limitations, gaps, and future directions

Remaining controversies include whether ADHD might be a prodrome for BD. Some studies suggest that ADHD might be a prodrome, 94, 95 although some used interviews that blurred the distinction between mood episodes and more chronic presentations. 44 Longitudinal studies of ADHD cohorts tend to find no or only small increases in risk of BD. 96 Adding the DMDD diagnosis to DSM‐5 created several gaps in terms of evidence‐based assessment methods to differentiate DMDD from mood disorders, and lack of clarity regarding effective treatments. DMDD has its own definitional problems, as irritability includes both mood (often loses temper) and behavior (what happens when temper is lost). 46 The next version of ICD will not add DMDD as a diagnosis, instead making a mood disturbance specifier for ODD. 97 Research needs to evaluate the relative effectiveness of psychosocial (eg, parent training; emotion regulation strategies) and pharmacologic interventions for DMDD. 61, 98 Longitudinal data also raise interesting questions about the possibility of remission of DMDD and bipolar disorders, 55, 99 a topic that warrants further study.

### The status of irritability in psychiatry: a conceptual and quantitative review [^117DKvhz]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In this review, we have not separately analyzed DMDD and SMD, as doing so would lead to very small groups to analyze with validity. It is important to note that the vast majority of youth with SMD meet criteria for DMDD. For example, in a report by Deveney et al.of the 200 youth who met criteria for SMD, 97% met criteria for DMDD; the 6 youth who did not meet criteria for DMDD had an age of onset of 10 or 11 years old. Similarly, in a report by Stoddard et al.all but 1 youth with SMD met criteria for DMDD. It therefore seems reasonable to pool these 2 diagnoses in our analyses. Also, following the current conceptualization of psychiatric disorders as extremes of dimensional traits, we regard DMDD and SMD as lying above a certain threshold on an irritability continuum. This is an assumption supported by prior data on irritability, although not DMDD or SMD as such. Future research should test the validity of that assumption also in terms of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

Clinical Guidance

- Our review showed that irritability is impairing for young people and that it is associated with a substantially increased likelihood of future psychopathology, particularly depression and anxiety.
- In understanding how irritability arises and when it becomes pathological, a lot has been accomplished within a short period of time. However, a number of areas — most notably measurement and experimental design — still require research attention.
- Clinicians will want to measure irritability in their patients as outlined in this review and apply the — admittedly still scarce — evidence in treating it.

### Irritable mood as a symptom of depression in youth: prevalence, developmental, and clinical correlates in the great smoky mountains study [^116x1nZD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

DSM-IV grants episodic irritability an equal status to low mood as a cardinal criterion for the diagnosis of depression in youth, yet not in adults; however, evidence for irritability as a major criterion of depression in youth is lacking. This article examines the prevalence, developmental characteristics, associations with psychopathology, and longitudinal stability of irritable mood in childhood and adolescent depression.

Method

Data from the prospective population-based Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 1,420) were used. We divided observations on 9- to 16-year-olds who met criteria for a diagnosis of depression into 3 groups: those with depressed mood and no irritability, those with irritability and no depressed mood, and those with both depressed and irritable mood. We compared these groups using robust regression models on adolescent characteristics and early adult (ages 19–21 years) depression outcomes.

Results

Depressed mood was the most common cardinal mood in youth meeting criteria for depression (58.7%), followed by the co-occurrence of depressed and irritable mood (35.6%); irritable mood alone was rare (5.7%). Youth with depressed and irritable mood were similar in age and developmental stage to those with depression, but had significantly higher rates of disruptive disorders. The co-occurrence of depressed and irritable mood was associated with higher risk for comorbid conduct disorder in girls (gender-by-group interaction, F1,132 = 4.66, p = .03).

Conclusions

Our study findings do not support the use of irritability as a cardinal mood criterion for depression. However, the occurrence of irritability in youth depression is associated with increased risk of disruptive behaviors, especially in girls.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^1166pWuR]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children (hyperactive-impulsive subtype)" for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this specific subtype of ADHD. The target patient population includes children who exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

The primary components of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors include fidgeting or squirming, leaving the seat when expected to remain seated, running or climbing inappropriately, inability to engage in quiet leisure activities, excessive talking, blurting out answers prematurely, difficulty waiting turns, and interrupting or intruding on others. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score, which is used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

In addition to these behaviors, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria also consider the course of the disease. The presence of these symptoms for at least six months, to a degree that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly contributes to the overall score.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is used to determine whether a child meets the diagnostic criteria for this subtype of ADHD. A score of 106 or higher indicates that the child meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria are not met.

This tool assesses whether a child meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD. It integrates a series of ten questions about the child's behaviors and symptoms. The approach is straightforward, assigning points for the presence of specific behaviors and characteristics, and a significant number of points for the duration and impact of these symptoms.

Here's how it works:

- Each behavioral attribute, such as fidgeting, excessive talking, and trouble waiting in line, contributes 1 point if observed.
- The key condition, presence of symptoms for at least six months to a disruptive and inappropriate extent for the child's developmental level, crucially adds 100 points.

The process includes:

- **Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat**: 1 point
- **Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected**: 1 point
- Often runs or climbs inappropriately, or feels restless in adolescents/adults: 1 point
- **Often unable to play quietly**: 1 point
- **Is often "on the go" or acts as if "driven by a motor"**: 1 point
- **Often talks excessively**: 1 point
- **Often blurts out an answer before a question is completed**: 1 point
- **Often has trouble waiting their turn**: 1 point
- **Often interrupts or intrudes on others**: 1 point
- **Presence of symptoms for at least 6 months with significant disruption**: 100 points

To analyze the results, sum up the points:

- If the total score reaches 106 points or more, the criteria for ADHD (hyperactive-impulsive subtype) are met, suggesting the presence of ADHD as per DSM-5 standards.
- Scores below 106 indicate that the criteria for ADHD are not fulfilled. This outcome implies that symptoms either do not appear with enough frequency or intensity, or they have not persisted for a sufficiently long duration to meet the diagnostic threshold.

This methodology provides a straightforward evaluation that correlates the child's behaviors with the established diagnostic standards, offering a clear interpretation based on the computed score.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^113fm41X]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Multi-morbidity is common in both children and adults of both sexes. In children, around one-half will have at least one psychiatric disorder comorbid to ADHD and around one-quarter will have two or more comorbid disorders. These are typically 'current' episodes of comorbidity, the most frequent in childhood being disruptive behavioural disorders (e.g. oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), anxiety (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder) and mood (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder). Others include specific developmental disorders of language, learning and motor development, autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability, many of which present across the lifespan. Adults with ADHD also experience high rates of co-occurring conditions, especially anxiety, mood and substance use disorders (including cigarette smoking). Therefore, the clinical presentation is complex, and this is often further complicated by academic and social impairments, leading to academic and occupational failure, delinquent and antisocial behaviour.

Autism spectrum disorders

The worldwide prevalence of ASD is around 1%, but some data suggest it may be higher. Following the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, ASD is now characterised by two categories: (1) persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication and (2) restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities, including differences in sensory sensitivities and interests. Individuals with ASD exhibit a range of intellectual and language functioning. Symptoms typically present in early childhood (by 2–3 years of age) with or without language delay and may be associated with early developmental delays and/or loss of social or language skills. However, many people may not receive a diagnosis of ASD until adulthood. This may be due to a variety of factors including lack of awareness of ASD across the lifespan, poor recognition of ASD in females and/or lack of services. DSM-5 notes that symptoms must be associated with clinically significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Symptoms are usually a pervasive feature of the individual's functioning which are observable across settings. However, they may vary according to social, educational or other contexts and may be masked by 'camouflaging'. Symptoms are relatively stable across the lifespan, although there may be some developmental gains in adolescence and adulthood due to increased interest in social interaction, behavioural improvement associated with interventions and/or compensations applied and/or the environmental supports provided.

### Examination of disruptive behavior outcomes and moderation in a randomized psychotherapy trial for mood disorders [^116AHGwp]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Multifamily psychoeducational psychotherapy (MF-PEP) is an efficacious treatment for children with mood disorders. Given the comorbidity between disruptive behaviors and mood disorders, this study examined associations between disruptive behaviors and impairment, impact of MF-PEP on disruptive behaviors, and whether disruptive behaviors affected treatment response of mood symptoms.

Method

Secondary analyses examined a randomized controlled trial of MF-PEP versus waitlist control (N = 165 children 8–11 years old with mood disorders and their parents). Comorbid behavioral diagnoses occurred in 97% of children. All participants continued treatment as usual.

Results

Greater degree of disruptive behaviors was associated with worse mood symptoms and impairment. Between-group analyses examining outcome of disruptive behaviors were nonsignificant. Within-group analyses and between-group effect sizes suggested that MF-PEP was associated with decreases in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (d = 0.39), oppositional defiant disorder (d = 0.30), and overall disruptive behavior symptoms (d = 0.30), but not conduct disorder symptoms. Baseline severity of disruptive behaviors did not affect treatment response of mood symptoms to MF-PEP.

Conclusions

MF-PEP is an effective intervention for children with mood disorders and provides some benefit for disruptive behaviors. Given that disruptive behavior severity does not affect children's ability to experience improved mood symptoms, MF-PEP may be an important early intervention for children with comorbid mood and disruptive behavior disorders. Subsequent intervention targeting behavioral symptoms after improvement in mood may be beneficial. Studies examining treatment sequencing for children with comorbid mood and disruptive behavior disorders are needed.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113Aadvd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a comprehensive assessment including the following after addressing any urgent biomedical or psychiatric signs or symptoms:

- diagnostic criteria-based assessment for stimulant use disorder (such as current DSM)

- a stimulant use disorder-focused history and physical examination

- a mental status examination to identify co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as signs and symptoms of psychoses, ADHD, mood disorders, cognitive impairment, and risk of harm to self or others

- a full biopsychosocial assessment.

### Clinical application of brain imaging for the diagnosis of mood disorders: the current state of play [^114sWMan]. Molecular Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Independent of the technical challenges involved in developing diagnostic algorithms, we raise the issue of whether the current approach to developing neuroimaging-based tests for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is philosophically flawed. The claim that the machine learning approach will lead to objective biomarkers of psychiatric illness that will supplant the clinical interview is circular because the algorithms are trained to categorize patients based on clinical (that is, DSM-IV) diagnoses. Yet the raison d'etre of the biomarker is the future supersession of the subjective diagnosis as the gold standard. Our current diagnostic categories may subsume multiple distinct disorders and thus attempting to forcibly align neurobiology with DSM diagnoses is arguably regressive.

This view has recently been championed by the National Institute of Mental Health in the form of the Research Domain Criteria initiative which seeks to lay the foundations for a future psychiatric nosology based on neuroscience and genetics rather than clinical observation. The framework for this alternative psychiatric classification system is formed by psychological/behavioral 'constructs' that are explicitly linked to the underlying neurobiology. For example, in the context of mood disorders, two potentially relevant constructs are 'loss' (HPA axis dysregulation, sustained amygdala reactivity, and so on) and 'response to reward attainment' (reduced activity of the nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, and so on). Arguably, imaging-based diagnostic algorithms that differentiate individuals on the basis of Research Domain Criteria constructs such as 'loss' and 'response to reward attainment' potentially would optimize treatment strategies in currently ill patients and allow for the identification of individuals at risk of developing a mood disorder in the future.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^111estf1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (children and adolescents) — evaluation principles: Clinically significant depression must be distinguished from everyday sadness and irritability, which can be normative in specific developmental stages. In DSM-5-TR, mental disorders are defined as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in underlying psychological, biological, or developmental processes. By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met. Most diagnostic criteria sets require specific frequency and duration of symptoms and clinically significant distress and functional impairment, and alternative medical, substance, and psychiatric explanations must have been considered before the diagnosis is applied.

### Personal and familial correlates of bipolar (BP)-I disorder in children with a diagnosis of BP-I disorder with a positive child behavior checklist (CBCL)-severe dysregulation profile: a controlled study [^1137dm63]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although the DSM-IV provides explicit criteria for the diagnosis of BP-I disorder, this is a complex diagnosis that requires high levels of clinical expertise. Previous work shows children with a unique profile of the CBCL of high scores (2SD) on the attention problems (AP), aggressive behavior (AGG), and anxious-depressed (AD) (A-A-A) subscales are more likely than other children to meet criteria for BP-I disorder in both epidemiological and clinical samples. However, since not all BP-I disorder children have a positive profile questions remain as to its informativeness, particularly in the absence of an expert diagnostician.

Methods

Analyses were conducted comparing personal and familial correlates of BP-I disorder in 140 youth with a structured interview and an expert clinician based DSM-IV diagnosis of BP-I disorder with (N = 80) and without (N = 60) a positive CBCL- Severe Dysregulation profile, and 129 controls of similar age and sex without ADHD or a mood disorder. Subjects were comprehensively assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and wide range of functional measures. We defined the CBCL-severe dysregulation profile as an aggregate cut-off score of ≥ 210 on the A-A-A scales.

Results

BP-I probands with and without a positive CBCL-severe dysregulation profile significantly differed from Controls in patterns of psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial and psychoeducational dysfunction, and cognitive deficits, as well as in their risk for BP-I disorder in first degree relatives.

Limitations

Because the sample was referred and largely Caucasian, findings may not generalize to community samples and other ethnic groups.

Conclusion

A positive CBCL-severe dysregulation profile identifies a severe subgroup of BP-I disorder youth.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113cAEzv]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Special circumstances: Adolescents highlight that obtaining teacher reports might be more challenging because many adolescents have multiple teachers, parents may have less opportunity to observe behaviors, adolescents' self-reports often minimize problems, and adolescents are less likely to exhibit overt hyperactive behavior; clinicians need to try to obtain (with agreement from the adolescent) information from at least 2 teachers and other sources, establish younger manifestations, and strongly consider substance use, depression, and anxiety as alternative or co-occurring diagnoses, noting that adolescents with ADHD are at greater risk of substance abuse and that risks of mood/anxiety disorders and risky sexual behaviors increase during adolescence.

### Identification and treatment of neurodevelopmental and mental disorders in boys and adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a cohort study [^1161rDCN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Depressive mood/disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was found in 27 individuals (10.2% of the total cohort) on clinical assessment. In 7/27, the onset or the worsening of the symptoms occurred around puberty in boys who complained about growth and pubertal delay.

In 9/27, emotional dysregulation was associated with ID. In three, there were also signs of other behavioural comorbidities compatible with ADHD that had been observed since school age.

Anxiety was found in 17 individuals (6.4% of the total cohort) on clinical assessment. In 4/17, the onset or the worsening of the symptoms occurred around puberty. In 7/17, anxiety was associated with ID. In three, there were also signs of other behavioural comorbidities compatible with ADHD that had been observed since school age. Four of the 17 individuals had separation anxiety (23.5%), 2 social anxiety (11.7%), 6 generalised anxiety or specific phobias (35.3%), and 5 (29.5%) had selective mutism.

OCD was found in two individuals (0.7% of the total cohort) on clinical assessment. In both cases, the worsening of the symptoms occurred around adolescence. Neither had ID.

Psychosis risk syndrome (PRS) was found in seven individuals (2.6% of the total cohort). In three out of seven, there were reports of early signs of depressive mood with emotional dysregulation, and in one out of seven, a diagnosis of ADHD at a younger age with clear psychotic symptoms becoming more obvious around puberty or in adulthood; one had a history of autistic traits with anxiety, one of anxiety and one of OCD symptoms. In two individuals, there were also persisting signs of anxiety. In three out of seven individuals, psychotic signs were associated with ID, and in four, they were not.

Another 13 individuals (4.9% of the total cohort) had a more complex phenotype characterised by multiple neurobehavioural difficulties associated with moderate/severe intellectual disability (MS-ID) with IQ less than 50, both present since early childhood (figure 1).

### DSM-IV disorders in children with borderline to moderate intellectual disability. I: prevalence and impact [^11472oXm]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the prevalence, comorbidity, and impact of DSM-IV disorders in 7- to 20-year-olds with intellectual disability.

Method

A total of 474 children (response 86.8%) were randomly selected from a sample of students from Dutch schools for the intellectually disabled. Parents completed the anxiety, mood, and disruptive disorder modules of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.

Results

A total of 21.9% of the children met the DSM-IV symptom criteria for anxiety disorder, 4.4% for mood disorder, and 25.1% for disruptive disorder. Similar prevalence rates were found for children who screened positive or negative for pervasive developmental disorder. More than half of the children meeting the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder were severely impaired in everyday functioning, and about 37% had a comorbid disorder. Children with multiple disorders were more likely to be impaired across various areas of everyday functioning. Almost 27% of the diagnosed children received mental health care in the last year. Comorbidity and impairment in everyday functioning increased the likelihood of referral.

Conclusions

Most disorders can be observed in intellectually disabled children. Impairment and comorbidity are high. The finding that less than one third of the children with a psychiatric disorder receive mental health care deserves attention.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^113fNHCH]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) background — scope, symptom clusters, and ICD-11 versus DSM-5 distinctions are summarized as follows: Traumatic exposure spans a broad spectrum, including military combat, sexual and/or physical assault, domestic violence, interpersonal violence, intimate partner violence, torture, natural and human-made disasters, accidents, and childhood abuse, medical traumas, and chronic medical conditions, and traumatic events are not uncommon, with approximately half of all adults in the United States alone encountering at least one traumatic incident in their lifetime. The majority of individuals exposed to trauma do not develop PTSD, yet in severe cases PTSD can significantly impair a person's ability to function effectively in their professional, personal, and social life. PTSD is characterized by 20 symptoms across four symptom clusters, specifically intrusions (intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance, adverse changes in mood and cognition, and hyperarousal. The ICD-11 includes both a "simple" PTSD and Complex PTSD (C-PTSD); in the ICD-11, PTSD is comprised of only three symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance, and persistent sense of threat), the DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis has twenty symptoms, and ICD-11 C-PTSD requires meeting ICD-11 PTSD criteria plus disturbances of self: attention, emotion dysregulation, and persistent difficulties in relationships. The inclusion of C-PTSD was rejected from DSM-IV and DSM-5 and thus C-PTSD is not officially recognized as a diagnosis in the DSM-5, although DSM-5 added additional symptoms to the PTSD diagnosis such as irritability and angry outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behavior, and negative alterations in cognition and mood.

### DSM-5 and ADHD-an interview with eric Taylor [^114ved3J]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

3. What are your views on these changes?

They are mostly tweaks to the diagnostic description and most of the changes are welcome. Some opportunities have been missed and these include the possibilities of moving to recognise the distinctive problems of attention deficit in the total absence of hyperactivity, the opportunity to move to a more dimensional system of describing psychopathology, and the notion of providing a clear system to describe severity, staging and impairment. The specific changes include:

(i) While ADHD has many features in common with disruptive disorders, I believe that the shift to "neurodevelopmental" is correct and timely. Like other neurodevelopmental problems, ADHD has an early onset, steady course, high male/female ratio, strong genetic influences and multiple associations in altered brain function.

(ii) I think it is correct to have made the adult diagnosis a little easier to achieve. User groups complain strongly that the NHS fails to recognise their difficulties even when they are presented to general psychiatry.

(iii) I agree that research has not been kind to the idea that there are valid subtypes. However, some of this failure of validity has to do with poor operational definitions. The "predominantly inattentive" subtype can apply to children who have as many as five of the hyperactivity symptoms, which is quite a lot, but fall just under the cut-off point. Nevertheless, inattentive children with no hyperactivity at all can still be seriously impaired but in a different way. Their school work and occupational success suffer from a wide range of neuropsychological problems. These problems deserve scientific study, but have not received this partly because they are not included in the existing diagnostic schemes.

(iv) Autism used to be excluded, but autism and ADHD frequently coexist. It is therefore important to recognise both disorders as patients with ADHD are treated successfully even when they have autism spectrum disorders.

(v) The new diagnosis of DMDD does not really have a full scientific basis. It has been included largely to tame an epidemic in the United States in which irritable children are diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, with a consequent massive increase in the use of powerful neuroleptic drugs even in the under-fives. I am inclined to doubt whether the existence of a new diagnosis will in fact reduce the epidemic of diagnosis, but luckily it has not reached the UK anyway.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^111STbmh]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ICD-10 described hypomania and included bipolar II disorder under the heading of 'Other bipolar affective disorders'. The ICD-11 harmonizes this with the DSM system allowing a bipolar type II diagnosis with equal status to bipolar I disorder. In contrast to bipolar I disorder, where impulsive or reckless behaviour are part of the description, hypomania in bipolar II is defined as not causing marked impairment in function. The controversy around the duration of hypomania is avoided by defining the duration as lasting for at least several days.

Similarly, cyclothymia, which stood in the ICD-10 under a separate grouping, is now incorporated in the core bipolar or related disorders heading. These changes substantially harmonize the ICD-11 and DSM-5 systems, one overarching goal of the revision. Cyclothymia includes a duration definition of at least 2 years and requires that numerous hypomanic or depressive symptoms be present the majority of the time. While the hypomanic symptomatology may or may not meet threshold criteria for hypomania, but not mania, depression cannot be severe or prolonged enough to meet the diagnostic requirement for a depressive episode. Curiously, the cyclothymia rubric includes cycloid and cyclothymic personality. This is a significant change echoing the old Research Diagnostic Criteria that set the grounds for the DSM-III and earlier literature on the effect of temperament, suggesting a bridge between the core bipolar and unipolar mood disorders and the effect of mood instability so commonly seen in borderline and other personality disorders. Finally, akin to the specifiers in the DSM system, the ICD-11 allows the use of qualifiers to refine the description of current mood episodes, including prominent anxiety, melancholy (in depressive episodes), current perinatal episode, seasonal patterns, and rapid cycling, but no mention is made of predominant polarity, a specifier with therapeutic implications under consideration for future editions of the DSM.

Overall, the harmonization of the ICD-11 with the DSM-5 is desirable, hopefully presaging greater global uniformity in the use of a critical diagnostic language and hence translation to evidence-based care. The weaknesses of the two systems are both debatable and unavoidable given the lack of any objective pathophysiological compass and the limited specificity of most currently available biomarkers in mental illness. This is a welcome fillip to global clinical care.

### Higher risk of developing mood disorders among adolescents with comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorder: a nationwide prospective study [^112W6fPa]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are frequently comorbid. Previous studies suggested that the comorbidity of CD and ODD in ADHD may increase the risk of a further development of mood disorder, but most studies had a small sample size. Using a population-based prospective study design, a large sample composed of 1277 adolescents with ADHD-alone, 46 with ADHD + ODD, 87 with ADHD + CD, and 5640 age/gender-matched controls were enrolled in 2003. These cases were followed to 2010 to identify the cases developing unipolar depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. ADHD + CD groups exhibited a higher prevalence of unipolar depressive disorder (23.0% vs. 13.0% vs. 8.7% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001) and bipolar disorder (3.4% vs. 2.2% vs. 1.3% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001) than ADHD + ODD group, ADHD-alone group, and control group. Adolescents with ADHD + CD, those with ADHD + ODD, and those with ADHD-alone had a higher likelihood of developing unipolar depressive disorder (hazard ratio [HR]: 44.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.95–71.36; HR: 18.76, 95%CI: 7.87–44.71; HR: 13.01, 95%CI: 8.99–18.82) and bipolar disorder (HR: 14.39, 95%CI: 4.00–51.80; HR: 8.32, 95%CI: 1.06–65.32; HR: 5.24, 95%CI: 2.44–11.24) than the controls. Adolescents with ADHD had elevated risks of unipolar depression and bipolar disorder in their later life, and especially, those with ADHD and comorbidity of CD or ODD exhibited the highest risk. Further study would be required to evaluate whether prompt intervention for ADHD and disruptive behavior problems would decrease the risk of developing mood disorder.

### An overview of mood disorders in the DSM-5 [^112LPdwq]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

The process of revising the DSM, which is based on new findings in the literature and experience with the current classification, is initiated every 12–18 years. The process for the revision of DSM-IV to the DSM-5 began in 2006-after a series of meeting proceedings and monographs were published during the previous 3 years-with the appointment of diagnostic group chairs by Director Dr. David Kupfer and Vice Director Dr. Darrel Regier. Members were recruited for workgroups to review the existing DSM-IV, to decide what worked well and which areas needed change, to review the available literature and data, and to propose changes based on an appropriate level of evidence in the literature proportional to the significance of the change. At the halfway point in this process, the Mood Disorders Workgroup has made tentative recommendations to be tested in field trials. These recommendations and some of the basis for them are discussed in this review. Final decisions await the data from field trials, possible revisions by the workgroups, and action by the task force. This article describes some of the recommendations made by the Mood Disorders Workgroup at this point in the process.

### Mood disorders [^1169B6UR]. Continuum (2021). Medium credibility.

Among other possible causes, mood alteration can be caused by insomnia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, personality disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, puerperal psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, pain, cachexia, major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, anxiety disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, dementia, posttraumatic stress disorder, seasonal affective disorder and postpartum depression.

### The clinical features of mania and their representation in modern diagnostic criteria [^115XXZY3]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This review seeks to determine the degree to which modern operationalized diagnostic criteria for mania reflect the clinical features of mania described historically by expert textbook authors. Clinical descriptions of mania appearing in 18 textbooks published between 1899 and 1956 were reviewed and compared to the criteria for mania from six modern operationalized diagnostic systems. Twenty-two prominent symptoms and signs were reported by five or more authors. Two symptoms (elevated mood and grandiosity) and four signs (hyperactivity, pressured speech, irritability, and new activities with painful consequences) were reported by every author. A strong relationship was seen between the frequency with which the clinical features were reported and the likelihood of their inclusion in modern diagnostic systems. However, many symptoms and signs including impulsivity, hypersexuality, mood lability, altered moral standards, increased humor, hypergraphia, and a vigorous physical appearance were not included in any modern criteria. Indeed, DSM-5 contains only eight of the historically noted clinical features. We conclude that modern operationalized criteria for mania well reflect symptoms and signs frequently reported by historical experts. This suggests that the clinical construct of mania has been relatively stable in western Psychiatry since the turn of the 20th century. However, many useful clinical features of mania described in these textbooks are missing from these criteria thereby illustrating the limitations of clinical evaluations restricted to the assessment of only current diagnostic criteria. The disorders we study and treat are considerably richer clinically than is reflected in the DSM criteria which we use to diagnose them.

### An expanded conceptual framework for understanding irritability in childhood: the role of cognitive control processes [^111PXEwq]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Irritability in Clinical Populations

DMDD was introduced into the DSM-5 given that a subset of youth display severe and impairing levels of irritability by elementary school, occurring in approximately 0.8 to 2.8% of school aged youth (Baweja et al; Copeland et al.). Although some prior studies have raised concerns about DMDD as a disorder in its own right given its high comorbidity rates with both emotional and disruptive disorders (estimated at 62–92%; Copeland et al.), it is clear there are long-term impacts of DMDD into adulthood (Copeland et al.). As a key feature of childhood DMDD, irritability is also present and potentially impairing within community samples of youth who do not meet full criteria for DMDD, with prevalence estimates ranging from seven (Baweja et al; Moore et al.) to 57% (Copeland et al.). In Karlovich et al. the lifetime prevalence of irritability was estimated to be as high as 79.5% in a large epidemiological study of adolescents. Irritability has been found to have longitudinal associations with internalising psychopathology (e.g. anxiety, depression; Copeland et al.), externalising psychopathology (e.g. ODD; Dougherty et al.) and increased risk for suicidal behaviour (Benarous et al.). Moreover, irritability has been associated with more general poor functioning in youth, including peer problems (Beauchaine & Cicchetti; Elvin et al.) and high rates of school suspensions and family disruptions (Copeland et al.).

### Adult ADHD: assessment and diagnosis… [^116x2vp6]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of adults presenting with ADHD symptoms typically requires at least two visits. As well as allowing for a thorough evaluation, two visits allows the clinician to assess motivation for follow up, persistence of symptoms and dysfunction, and likelihood for alternative diagnoses. The following components of a complete evaluation should be considered during both visits: View the Adult ADHD Assessment, Diagnosis and Treatment Approach Algorithm. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association, outlines diagnostic criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children and adults. For a formal diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity and/or inattention should meet the diagnostic criteria outlined in DSM-5. The symptoms of ADHD are common in other mental health disorders and non-psychiatric conditions.

An appropriate evaluation must consider whether the symptoms belong to ADHD, another mental health condition, another physical health condition, or if they represent more than one disorder. Other explanations for presenting symptoms should also be ruled out. The following scales have been developed to screen, evaluate and monitor adults with ADHD. Since rating scales are based on self-reported perceptions, and are, therefore, subjective, it is recommended that significant persons in the adult's life also complete the forms. These can include the person's spouse, a close relative, employer and/or colleague. Note: there may be a fee associated with the use of some of these tools for you and/or the patient.

### Diagnosing ADHD | Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder… [^112yZyRB]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

How is ADHD diagnosed. Deciding if a person has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, such as sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and certain types of learning disabilities, can also have symptoms similar to ADHD. When to talk with a doctor the first step is to talk with a healthcare provider to find out if the symptoms fit an ADHD diagnosis. The diagnosis can be made by a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, or by a primary care provider, like a pediatrician. DSM-5 criteria for ADHD Healthcare providers use the guidelines in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth edition, to help diagnose ADHD. This diagnostic standard helps ensure that people are appropriately diagnosed and treated for ADHD.

Using the same standard across communities can also help determine how many children have ADHD, and how public health is impacted by this condition. The number of symptoms required for an ADHD diagnosis are as follows: ■ of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 16 years, Six or more symptoms OR ■ of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity for adolescents ages 17 years and older and adults. Five or more symptoms. People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattentionA and/or hyperactivityB–impulsivityC that interferes with functioning or development: DSM-5 criteria for ADHD diagnosis Symptoms and they are inappropriate for developmental level. present for at least 6 months.
- Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.
- Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.
- Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate.
- Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly. In addition to the above criteria, the following conditions must also be met:

- Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12 years.
- Several symptoms are present in two or more settings.
- There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition handbook, or DSM-5, is the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders, including ADHD, in the United States and other parts of the world. It defines the following dimensions, or presentations of ADHD: The diagnosis of ADHD must establish that 6 or more core symptoms are present in either or both the Inattention Dimension and/or the Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Dimension presentations, and occur inappropriately often. The core symptoms and dimensions are presented in the table below. Note that symptoms may present differently at different ages. Table 1.

Treatment Prompt diagnosis and treatment improve prognosis by reducing the risk of relapse and doubling the rate of response to medications. 38 Medications are the mainstay of therapy and are selected depending on the presenting phase of illness, severity, and patient factors such as prior responses or current medications 12, 18, 38. Among patients using pharmacotherapy, relapse occurs in up to 25% in the first year; the risk of relapse increases to 40% among patients who are untreated and to more than 70% of patients within five years, regardless of treatment approach. 12, 18, 39 It is recommended that pharmacotherapy be continued indefinitely.
12. Comanagement with a psychiatrist can aid the primary care physician in navigating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, including relapse, treatment resistance, comorbid psychiatric conditions, and the risk of self-harm. Patients should be educated about the teratogenic effects of many mood stabilizers.

12 Although patients are highly responsive to antipsychotics, these medications are associated with weight gain, diabetes, and extrapyramidal effects. 51 When mood stabilizers alone are insufficient., augmentation of treatment with anti-depressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or bupropion may be considered. 52 These therapies are less likely to induce mania compared with tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or medications that have dual properties, such as venlafaxine. 18 When treating sleep disturbance in patients who have depression, physicians should avoid prescribing trazodone because it can induce mania.
53. 12, 18; each medication has specific advantages and disadvantages. The risk of suicide is lowered when patients are more satisfied with their care, when they use lithium therapy, and with treatment of alcohol and tobacco use disorders.

36, 54 AUGMENTING THERAPIES RECOGNIZING AND ADDRESSING ADVERSE EFFECTS In the maintenance phase, patients should receive regular clinical examinations that focus on depressive, manic, and sleep symptoms; suicide risk; substance use disorders; comorbid conditions; and general medical health. 12 Extra-pyramidal effects often manifest early and can include.
