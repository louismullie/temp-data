## Question

Inhaled corticosteroids to reverse aortic stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inhaled corticosteroids can reverse aortic stenosis and whether any evidence in the provided literature supports this idea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current guidelines and authoritative reviews say about any medical therapy that reverses or even slows calcific aortic stenosis. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided references mention inhaled corticosteroids in the context of aortic valve disease. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology of calcific aortic stenosis to see if there is a plausible mechanistic rationale for inhaled corticosteroids. After that, I need to consider potential harms or unintended effects of corticosteroids in patients with cardiovascular disease. Finally, I will reaffirm the evidence-based standard of care for aortic stenosis and synthesize a clear bottom line aligned with guideline recommendations [^1151D4JR] [^1126Vz7k].

> Let me start with the big picture: there are no proven medical therapies that reverse calcific aortic stenosis, and contemporary authoritative statements repeatedly emphasize this point, so I need to be careful not to over-interpret any isolated mechanistic signals as clinical efficacy [^112CgxK1] [^1125jvRx].

> Wait, let me verify whether inhaled corticosteroids are even discussed for aortic stenosis in the provided materials. I need to check the references closely: I see inhaled corticosteroids discussed in airway contexts such as laryngotracheal stenosis deposition modeling, and in adrenal suppression case series and inhalation injury guidance, but I do not see them evaluated as a therapy for aortic valve calcification or hemodynamic stenosis, which suggests no supportive evidence for their use in reversing AS within this corpus [^114n5SqT] [^114kAcVU] [^1138Tkzy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I consider pathophysiology — calcific aortic stenosis is driven by regulated inflammatory, fibrotic, and osteogenic pathways culminating in fibro-calcific remodeling and bone-like matrix deposition in the valve, which is a very different biological problem than eosinophilic airway inflammation where inhaled corticosteroids act locally and topically to reduce airway immune activation [^113bDDJ9] [^112DjNde] [^113wrd71].

> I should confirm whether inflammation is the dominant driver in established, clinically significant stenosis or whether mineralization predominates; PET studies show that in aortic stenosis the calcification signal (18F-NaF) is robust and more closely tracks disease severity than the FDG inflammatory signal, reinforcing that late disease is calcification-heavy and unlikely to be reversed by anti-inflammatory strategies alone [^114WJ3fn] [^111UiiRm].

> Let me think about analogies: if a broadly anti-inflammatory and pleiotropic cardiovascular class like statins failed to slow hemodynamic progression of AS in multiple large trials, and guidelines specifically recommend against statins for preventing AS progression, that makes it even less plausible that inhaled corticosteroids would reverse or modify established valvular calcification, especially given their primarily local airway effects [^113DcFzu] [^113bDDJ9].

> But wait, what about potential harms — should I worry about corticosteroid side effects in this population? Systemic corticosteroids can cause sodium retention, edema, and worsen heart failure physiology, which is relevant in AS patients with limited cardiac reserve; although inhaled corticosteroids are largely topical, adrenal suppression and systemic spillover have been reported, so risk–benefit must be considered cautiously, and chronic systemic steroid harms in COPD trials further caution against routine steroid exposure for non-indicated cardiovascular purposes [^111Y7UpL] [^114kAcVU] [^113jdbvi].

> I need to ensure I state the evidence-based standard of care clearly: for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, the only therapies proven to improve survival and reverse afterload are valve interventions — surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement — applied according to symptoms, valve hemodynamics, ventricular function, and shared Heart Team decision-making per ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidelines [^1151D4JR] [^1126Vz7k].

> Bottom line: inhaled corticosteroids have no role in reversing calcific aortic stenosis based on the provided literature and current guideline-aligned understanding of disease biology; no evidence supports their efficacy for AS reversal, and management should follow established pathways centered on surveillance and definitive valve replacement when criteria are met [^112CgxK1] [^1151D4JR] [^1126Vz7k].

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) **do not reverse aortic stenosis** [^112CgxK1]. Aortic stenosis is a progressive fibro-calcific disease driven by inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification [^1128k7Gw], and **no medical therapy** — including ICS — has been shown to halt or reverse valve narrowing [^1125jvRx]. Although ICS exert anti-inflammatory effects in the airways [^113wrd71], they do not reach the aortic valve or modify its calcific remodeling. Current guidelines do not recommend ICS for aortic stenosis [^1151D4JR]; the **definitive treatment remains surgical or transcatheter valve replacement** [^1126Vz7k].

---

## Pathophysiology of aortic stenosis

Aortic stenosis is characterized by **progressive narrowing of the aortic valve orifice**, primarily due to fibro-calcific remodeling of the valve leaflets [^112VmDb7]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation plays a central role in initiating and propagating valve degeneration. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) [^116H3S1L], are elevated in stenotic valves, promoting further inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue damage [^112DjNde].
- **Fibrosis**: Activated valvular interstitial cells (VICs) differentiate into myofibroblasts [^1128k7Gw], leading to excessive extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis, contributing to valve stiffening and narrowing [^111J5zUr].
- **Calcification**: Osteogenic differentiation of VICs results in calcium deposition within the valve leaflets [^1128k7Gw], further exacerbating valve rigidity and obstruction [^111dvfkB].

These processes are **self-perpetuating and progressive**, ultimately leading to severe valve obstruction, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased mortality [^113bDDJ9].

---

## Pharmacological properties of inhaled corticosteroids

Inhaled corticosteroids are **primarily used to manage chronic respiratory conditions** such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Their pharmacological effects include:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: ICS reduce airway inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [^113wrd71], reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, and suppressing immune responses.
- **Immunosuppressive effects**: ICS suppress immune cell activation and proliferation, thereby reducing chronic inflammation in the respiratory tract [^113wrd71].
- **Limited systemic absorption**: ICS are designed for localized delivery to the respiratory tract, minimizing systemic exposure and side effects.

---

## Evidence regarding ICS in aortic stenosis

Currently, there are **no direct clinical data** or published studies specifically investigating inhaled corticosteroids to reverse or halt aortic stenosis [^1125jvRx]. Existing literature focuses on the anti-inflammatory effects of ICS in respiratory disease, with no documented impact on valvular calcification or fibrosis.

---

## Potential mechanisms of ICS in aortic stenosis

Theoretically, ICS could modulate the inflammatory component of aortic stenosis by reducing cytokine production and inflammatory cell infiltration [^113wrd71]. However, **several significant limitations exist**:

- **Limited systemic bioavailability**: ICS are designed for localized pulmonary delivery, resulting in minimal systemic absorption. Consequently, their ability to reach and exert therapeutic effects on the aortic valve is highly limited.
- **Inadequate penetration of valvular tissue**: The aortic valve is avascular, relying on diffusion from surrounding blood vessels. ICS, administered via inhalation, are unlikely to penetrate the valvular tissue sufficiently to exert meaningful anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic effects.
- **Lack of evidence on calcification reversal**: ICS have not been shown to influence osteogenic differentiation or calcium deposition, which are critical components of aortic stenosis progression [^111dvfkB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from major cardiovascular societies — including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) — **do not recommend inhaled corticosteroids** for managing or reversing aortic stenosis [^1151D4JR]. The definitive treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis remains surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (SAVR or TAVR) [^1126Vz7k].

---

## Risks and side effects of ICS in cardiovascular patients

While ICS are generally considered safe for respiratory conditions, their use in cardiovascular patients may **pose certain risks**. These include **systemic corticosteroid effects** — prolonged use can lead to adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and increased susceptibility to infections [^111Y7UpL] [^113EpGs7] — and **cardiovascular risks**; despite minimal systemic absorption, systemic effects may occur, particularly at high doses or with prolonged use [^111Y7UpL] [^114kAcVU].

---

## Alternative medical therapies for aortic stenosis

Currently, **no medical therapies have been proven effective** in reversing or halting the progression of aortic stenosis [^112CgxK1]. Statins, initially considered promising due to their anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties [^1128k7Gw], have not demonstrated efficacy in slowing valve calcification or disease progression [^113DcFzu]. Ongoing research is exploring novel therapeutic targets — including anti-inflammatory agents, anti-fibrotic drugs, and inhibitors of osteogenic signaling pathways — but no effective medical therapy has been established to date [^116KHS49] [^1125jvRx].

---

## Conclusion and future research directions

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) **do not reverse aortic stenosis**; given their limited systemic bioavailability and inadequate penetration of valvular tissue, there is no evidence supporting their use in this context [^112CgxK1]. The **definitive treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis remains surgical or transcatheter valve replacement** [^1126Vz7k]. Future research should develop targeted therapies that address the underlying inflammatory, fibrotic, and calcific processes of aortic stenosis [^115wXv6r].

### Calcific aortic stenosis: A disease of the valve and the myocardium [^1128k7Gw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health economic costs. However, no medical interventions currently exist to delay or halt its progression. Therefore, re-evaluation of the underlying pathophysiology is required to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Aortic stenosis is characterized by progressive aortic valve narrowing and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy. Both processes are important as they collectively drive the development of symptoms and adverse events marking the latter stages of the disease.

In this review, the authors examine the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis concerning both the valve and the myocardium. They focus particularly on the role of inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification in progressive valve narrowing. Additionally, they examine the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, its subsequent decompensation, and the transition to heart failure. Finally, the discussion includes potential therapeutic strategies based on the similarities aortic stenosis shares with other pathological conditions.

Despite numerous promising therapeutic targets, there are no proven medical treatments for calcific aortic stenosis (AS). Multiple stakeholders need to collaborate, and several scientific, operational, and trial design challenges must be addressed to capitalize on the recent and emerging mechanistic insights into this prevalent heart valve disease. This review briefly discusses the pathobiology and most promising pharmacologic targets; screening, diagnosis, and progression of AS; identification of subgroups that should be targeted in clinical trials; and the need to elicit the patient voice earlier rather than later in clinical trial design and implementation.

Potential trial endpoints, tools for assessment, and approaches to the implementation and design of clinical trials are reviewed. The efficiencies and advantages offered by a clinical trial network and platform trial approach are highlighted. The objective is to provide practical guidance that will facilitate a series of trials aimed at identifying effective medical therapies for AS, resulting in the expansion of therapeutic options to complement mechanical solutions for late-stage disease.

Adrenal suppression secondary to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid use has been reported in children. The authors report the use of ciclesonide to reverse adrenal suppression secondary to inhaled fluticasone use in four pediatric patients. In these four children, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function normalized after the patients were changed to ciclesonide, while good asthma control was maintained. Ciclesonide should be considered for the reversal of adrenal suppression secondary to the use of fluticasone, and perhaps other older inhaled corticosteroids as well.

### Timing of intervention in aortic stenosis: a review of current and future strategies [^113bDDJ9]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Since the original description of aortic stenosis (AS) by Mönckeberg in 1904, the decline in rheumatic fever and an ageing population have led to a demographic transition towards fibrocalcific disease. For many years, fibrocalcific AS was viewed as a degenerative disease where progressive 'wear and tear' led to structural damage and passive valvular calcification. However, contemporary thinking is that fibrocalcific AS develops as part of a series of intricate and highly regulated inflammatory, fibrotic, and osteogenic processes.

The pathophysiological processes driving aortic valve stenosis can be divided into two phases. The initiation phase is characterised by endothelial injury accompanied by infiltration of lipids, lipid oxidation, and a proinflammatory response. Despite the clear similarities with atherosclerosis, three large randomised trials have failed to show any effect of statins on disease progression or clinical outcomes. The propagation phase is characterised by the appearance of osteoblast-like cells that coordinate progressive valvular calcium and bone matrix deposition. This osteogenic phenotype involves many signalling molecules involved in bone formation and is both self-perpetuating and highly regulated. Advances in imaging now allow for non-invasive assessment of both the burden and activity of calcification in the valve; however, the severity of aortic valve obstruction is still best assessed using echocardiography.

The traditional focus of AS assessments has been on the valve. However, the…

### Unraveling the mechanisms of valvular heart disease to identify medical therapy targets: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112CgxK1]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and currently has no effective medical therapy. Severe cases are typically managed with valve replacement procedures, which entail high health care-related costs and postprocedural morbidity and mortality. Robust ongoing research programs have elucidated many important molecular pathways contributing to primary valvular heart disease. However, there remain several key challenges in translating research on valvular heart disease into viable molecular targets that can progress through the clinical trials pathway and effectively prevent or modify the course of these conditions.

In this scientific statement, we review the basic cellular structures of human heart valves and discuss how these structures change in primary valvular heart disease. We focus on the most common primary valvular heart diseases, including calcific aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valves, mitral valve prolapse, and rheumatic heart disease. We outline the fundamental molecular discoveries contributing to each. Moreover, we outline potential therapeutic molecular targets for primary valvular heart disease and discuss key knowledge gaps that might serve as future research priorities.

### Timing of intervention in aortic stenosis: a review of current and future strategies [^112tp3nw]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease requiring surgical intervention in high-income countries. It is characterized by progressive thickening, fibrosis, and calcification of the leaflets, leading to restriction and valve obstruction. The consequent increase in left ventricular afterload leads to a hypertrophic response of the left ventricle, normalizing wall tension and maintaining cardiac output. However, with progressive valvular stenosis, this hypertrophic response eventually decompensates, resulting in symptom development, heart failure, and death.

With no medications proven to attenuate or reverse stenosis progression, the only available treatment is valve replacement. This should ideally be performed when the risks of the disease process, such as sudden cardiac death, irreversible functional impairment, and heart failure, outweigh those of intervention, including procedural risk, long-term complications, and potential need for reoperation. However, we frequently lack robust evidence to make accurate assessments of such risk. Deciding on the timing of valvular intervention is therefore difficult in many patients, and contemporary clinical guidelines are often underpinned by historical observational data rather than high-quality randomized controlled trials. This article will review our understanding of the pathophysiology of AS, describe and examine the evidence behind guideline recommendations, and explore potential future strategies to optimize the timing of valve intervention.

### Inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms underlying the calcific aortic valve disease [^112DjNde]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Although calcific aortic stenosis is a very common disease associated with major adverse cardiovascular events and healthcare costs, there are currently no effective medical interventions to delay or halt its progression. Cardiometabolic risk factors, including smoking and male sex, are linked to aortic stenosis. Emerging studies have identified important regulatory roles for immunological and inflammatory responses, including oxidized lipids, various cytokines, and biomineralization.

Recent clinical and experimental studies in atherosclerosis and osteoporosis have demonstrated that oxidative stress and oxidized lipids decrease bone formation in the skeletal system while increasing bone formation in the cardiovascular system. Multidisciplinary factors contribute to vascular calcification, including inflammation and metabolic regulation of osteogenesis in the cardiovascular system via similar signaling pathways as bone formation. Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is no longer considered a simple passive process of calcium deposition occurring with advanced age. Biomineralization in CAVD is a complex, regulated process involving valvular and circulating bone marrow-derived cells, macrophage heterogeneity, and genetic factors, along with biochemical and mechanical factors.

The review discusses the recently discovered critical role of inflammation, metabolic risk factors, and molecular and cellular mechanisms promoting CAVD, as well as the link between osteogenic signals in the skeletal and cardiovascular systems. This may inform future therapeutic strategies for CAVD progression.

### Treatment of atheroembolization with corticosteroids [^114CT7zf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Aortic atheroembolization is a feared complication of invasive procedures such as arteriography, often leading to devastating consequences, including renal insufficiency. At the time of writing, even in cases with evolving renal failure, there is no recommended treatment. This case report describes the successful treatment with corticosteroids of a patient with deteriorating renal function after renal arteriography and angioplasty, resulting in rapid and sustained improvement in renal function. The implications of this observation are discussed.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, specifically concerning aortic valve replacement, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend individualizing the choice between a mechanical or bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. This decision should consider individual patient factors and involve informed shared decision-making for patients aged 50–65 years who require aortic valve replacement and do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation.

### Assessment of valvular calcification and inflammation by positron emission tomography in patients with aortic stenosis [^114WJ3fn]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis is incompletely understood, and the relative contributions of valvular calcification and inflammation to disease progression are unknown. Patients with aortic sclerosis and mild, moderate, and severe stenosis were compared prospectively with age- and sex-matched control subjects. Aortic valve severity was determined by echocardiography. Calcification and inflammation in the aortic valve were assessed by 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography.

One hundred twenty-one subjects (20 controls; 20 aortic sclerosis; 25 mild, 33 moderate, and 23 severe aortic stenosis) were administered both 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG. Quantification of tracer uptake within the valve demonstrated excellent interobserver repeatability, with no fixed or proportional biases and limits of agreement of ± 0.21 (18F-NaF) and ± 0.13 (18F-FDG) for maximum tissue-to-background ratios. Activity of both tracers was higher in patients with aortic stenosis than in control subjects (18F-NaF: 2.87 ± 0.82 versus 1.55 ± 0.17; 18F-FDG: 1.58 ± 0.21 versus 1.30 ± 0.13; both P < 0.001).
- **Findings**: Among those with aortic stenosis, 91% exhibited increased 18F-NaF uptake (> 1.97), and 35% had increased 18F-FDG uptake (> 1.63). A weak correlation between the activities of these tracers was observed (r² = 0.174, P < 0.001).

### Dexamethasone [^111Y7UpL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When a reduction in dosage is possible, it should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with corticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding the dose and duration of treatment and whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.
- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.
- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by a gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.
- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis since they may increase the risk of perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with c

### Evaluation and management of aortic stenosis for the emergency clinician: An evidence-based review of the literature [^115uX9Jj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a common condition among older adults that can be associated with dangerous outcomes due to both the disease itself and its influence on other conditions.
- **Objective**: This review provides an evidence-based summary of the Emergency Department (ED) evaluation and management of aortic stenosis.
- **Discussion**: Aortic stenosis refers to significant narrowing of the aortic valve and can be caused by calcific disease, congenital causes, or rheumatic valvular disease. Symptoms of advanced disease include angina, dyspnea, and syncope. Patients with these symptoms have a much higher mortality rate than asymptomatic patients.

	- Initial evaluation should include an electrocardiogram, complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, coagulation studies, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, type and screen, and a chest radiograph. A transthoracic echocardiogram is the test of choice, but point-of-care ultrasound has been found to have good accuracy when a formal echocardiogram is not feasible.

	- Initial management should begin with restoring preload and ensuring a normal heart rate, as both bradycardia and tachycardia can lead to clinical decompensation. For patients with high blood pressure and heart failure symptoms, nitrate agents may be reasonable, but hypotension should be avoided. Dobutamine can increase inotropy. For hypotensive patients, vasopressors should be used at the lowest effective dose. The treatment of choice is valve replacement, but extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve have been discussed as alternatives.

- **Contraindications**: Do not use in patients with advanced aortic stenosis.
- **Advanced aortic stenosis**: Cardene I.V. is contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis because part of the effect of Cardene I.V. is secondary to reduced afterload. Reduction of diastolic pressure in these patients may worsen rather than improve myocardial oxygen balance.

### A call for an evidence-based approach to the heart team for patients with severe aortic stenosis [^112v7mcx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

The application of a Heart Team approach is now a central concept in the care of patients with severe aortic stenosis. It has Class I recommendations from American and European professional societies and is required for reimbursement for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the United States. The rationale for changing traditional practice models is to improve patient selection, procedural planning, and management of patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk, thus improving outcomes.

Although the concept is intuitive, a clear definition of the Heart Team, and data supporting its effectiveness, are lacking. Other specialties, including oncology, provide a precedent for investigation of the use of a multidisciplinary team and its impact on patient care. We highlight the need for clear definitions and shared metrics to advance our understanding of an optimal Heart Team approach, focusing on patient, clinician, and health system outcomes.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for aortic stenosis, specifically concerning indications for referral, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend consulting with or referring to a primary or comprehensive heart valve center when discussing treatment options for:

- **Asymptomatic patients with severe valvular heart disease**: Consideration should be given to their treatment pathway.

- **Patients likely to benefit from valve repair versus valve replacement**: Evaluate the potential advantages of valve repair over replacement.

- **Patients with multiple comorbidities considered for valve intervention**: Special attention is needed for patients with complex medical histories.

### Reversibility of cardiac function predicts outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis [^117NAdwJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac structures possess a quality of plasticity: an ability to change their size, shape, and wall thickness based on the development or elimination of chronic changes in hemodynamic conditions, such as preload increase, as in the presence of valvular regurgitation, or afterload increase in the presence of aortic stenosis (AS). In AS, pressure overload leads to a hypertrophic response in left ventricular (LV) walls, interstitial fibrosis, and eventually LV systolic dysfunction and death. In contrast, elimination of afterload (e.g. by transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR]), leads to immediate improvement of cardiac function, followed by delayed reverse remodeling in cardiac structures.

The introduction of TAVR enabled AS patients who were older, sicker, and often with severely reduced LV function to receive potentially life-saving treatment. In this population with aging hearts, it is unclear whether elimination of AS leads only to immediate improvement of LV systolic function or whether reverse remodeling also contributes to survival.

We aimed to evaluate longitudinal changes of LV function and structural parameters evaluated by echocardiography in severe AS patients undergoing TAVR, and to assess their impact on survival. We also aimed to identify the baseline echocardiographic parameters to predict reversibility of cardiac function in this population.

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events, which included but were not limited to hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE, with an absolute risk effect of 174 more per 1,000 patients (95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low", and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy may pose potential harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. Additionally, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of available medications.

**Contraindications**: CARDENE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. As part of the effect of CARDENE is secondary to reduced afterload, the drug is also contraindicated in patients with advanced aortic stenosis. Reduction of diastolic pressure by any means in these patients may worsen, rather than improve, myocardial oxygen balance.

Regarding preventative measures for aortic stenosis, specifically with respect to the prevention of infective endocarditis, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering administering antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures — such as those involving manipulation of gingival tissue, manipulation of the periapical region of teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa — in patients with valvular heart disease who have any of the following:

- **Prosthetic cardiac valves**, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts.

- **Prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair**, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips.

- **Previous infective endocarditis**.

- **Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease**, or repaired congenital heart disease with **residual shunts or valvular regurgitation** at the site of, or adjacent to, the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device.

- **Cardiac transplant with valve regurgitation** attributable to a structurally abnormal valve.

### Hemodynamic effects of inhaled nitric oxide in women with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension [^116LzVc8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Mitral stenosis (MS) is associated with elevated left atrial pressure, increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The hemodynamic effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in adults with MS are unknown. We sought to determine the acute hemodynamic effects of inhaled NO in adults with MS and PH. Eighteen consecutive women (mean age 58 ± 15 years) with MS and PH underwent heart catheterization. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded at baseline, after NO inhalation at 80 ppm, and after percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (n = 10).

Inhaled NO reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (62 ± 14 mm Hg [baseline] vs. 54 ± 15 mm Hg [NO]; p < 0.001) and PVR (3.7 ± 2.5 Wood U [baseline] vs. 2.2 ± 1.4 Wood U [NO]; p < 0.001). However, NO had no effect on mean aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac output, or systemic vascular resistance. After valvuloplasty, the mitral valve area increased significantly (0.9 ± 0.2 cm² [baseline] vs. 1.6 ± 0.3 cm² [post-valvuloplasty]; p < 0.001), and a decrease in left atrial pressure (25 ± 4 mm Hg [baseline] vs. 17 ± 4 mm Hg [after valvuloplasty]; p < 0.001) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (58 ± 12 mm Hg [baseline] vs. 45 ± 8 mm Hg [after valvuloplasty]; p < 0.001) was observed. No change in cardiac output or PVR was noted following valvuloplasty.

Thus, inhaled NO, but not balloon valvuloplasty, acutely reduced PVR in women with MS and PH, suggesting that a reversible, endothelium-dependent regulatory abnormality of vascular tone is an important mechanism of elevated PVR in MS.

### Potential drug targets for calcific aortic valve disease [^116KHS49]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and given its association with age, the prevalence of CAVD is expected to rise as global life expectancy increases. Currently, there are no drug strategies to prevent or treat CAVD. With valve replacement being the sole clinical option, patients frequently endure a deteriorating quality of life until diminished valve function necessitates intervention.

The recognition that CAVD results from active cellular mechanisms suggests that the underlying pathways might be targeted to treat the condition. However, no therapeutic strategy has been successfully developed at the time of writing. While there was hope that existing drugs used for vascular complications might also improve CAVD outcomes, the mechanisms of CAVD progression and the desired therapeutic outcomes often differ from those of vascular diseases.

Therefore, we discuss the benchmarks that must be met by a CAVD treatment approach, and highlight advances in the understanding of CAVD mechanisms to identify potential novel therapeutic targets.

### Arterial and aortic valve calcification inversely correlates with osteoporotic bone remodelling: A role for inflammation [^115sxzim]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic factors associated with CRD, including reduced circulating levels of erythropoietin, have been shown to reduce osteoblast quantity and bone mineral density via Jak-Stat signalling in haematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, the kidneys represent the site of vitamin D activation, and therefore CRD-associated reductions in activated vitamin D may also induce parallel reductions in bone mass. Whether CRD-induced anaemia or activated vitamin D deficiency plays a role in the reduced bone mass or increased cardiovascular calcification remains uncertain.

Our results directly quantified a paradox of simultaneous osteolysis and ectopic calcification in vivo in the same animals. Although both correlate with age in humans, some clinical studies have shown the association of cardiovascular calcification and osteoporosis to be independent of age. Research has demonstrated that patients with lower bone density and osteoporosis have more severe atherosclerosis. Dyslipidaemia also may link bone loss with cardiovascular calcification. Pre-clinical studies suggest that hyperlipidaemia reduces bone mineral density and promotes arterial and valvular calcification in mice, and that statins reduce calcification. Moreover, loss of bone mass leads to increased circulating phosphate and calcium and decreased parathyroid hormone, which stimulate the Cbfa1-dependent mineralization of cardiovascular tissue. This evidence suggests that osteoporosis may contribute to cardiovascular calcification by adding to a pathological microenvironment that promotes osteogenesis of the arterial wall and aortic.

### Inflammatory and biomechanical drivers of endothelial-interstitial interactions in calcific aortic valve disease [^115wXv6r]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic valve disease is dramatically increasing in global burden, yet no therapy exists outside of prosthetic replacement. The increasing proportion of younger and more active patients mandates alternative therapies. Studies suggest a window of opportunity for biologically based diagnostics and therapeutics to alleviate or delay calcific aortic valve disease progression. Advancement, however, has been hampered by limited understanding of the complex mechanisms driving calcific aortic valve disease initiation and progression towards clinically relevant interventions.

The "2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (i.e. asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).
- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate.
- **Structure**: Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision-making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. There is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Priorities for patient-centered research in valvular heart disease: A report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group [^1164CawD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Timing of the procedure is also an important step in decision making: does the patient meet criteria for treatment of the valve? Indications for treatment with transcatheter therapies reflect practice patterns when surgery is the only option. With less invasive treatments and increasing options for repeat procedures, the optimal timing of intervention should be questioned. With the introduction of TAVR and the opportunity for valve‐in‐valve TAVR in the treatment of AS, strategy trials are important to better understand whether TAVR may be beneficial earlier in the disease, i.e. before symptoms (e.g. EARLY TAVR [Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis, NCT 03042104]), or in symptomatic moderate disease (e.g. TAVR UNLOAD [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Unload the Left Ventricle in Patients With Advanced Heart Failure: A Randomized Trial, NCT 02661451]). Similar questions about timing exist for the treatment of mitral and tricuspid valve disease. The technology, however, is at an earlier stage in defining the efficacy of approaches and devices.

### Calcification in aortic stenosis: The skeleton key [^111dvfkB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is a common, potentially fatal condition that is set to become an increasing public health burden. Once symptoms develop, there is an inexorable deterioration with a poor prognosis. Despite this, there are no medical therapies capable of modifying disease progression, and the only available treatment is aortic valve replacement, to which not all patients are suited. Conventional teaching suggests that aortic stenosis is a degenerative condition whereby "wear and tear" leads to calcium deposition within the valve. Although mechanical stress and injury are important factors, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that aortic stenosis is instead governed by a highly complex, regulated pathological process with similarities to skeletal bone formation.

This review discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with an emphasis on the emerging importance of calcification, how this can be visualized and monitored using noninvasive imaging, and how our improved knowledge may ultimately translate into novel disease-modifying treatments.

### Aortic valve stenosis: From basic mechanisms to novel therapeutic targets [^111J5zUr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Low credibility.

Aortic valve stenosis is the most prevalent heart valve disease worldwide. Although interventional treatment options have rapidly improved in recent years, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis is still associated with high morbidity and mortality. Calcific aortic valve stenosis is characterized by progressive fibro-calcific remodeling and thickening of the aortic valve cusps, which subsequently leads to valve obstruction.

The underlying pathophysiology is complex and involves endothelial dysfunction, immune cell infiltration, myofibroblastic and osteoblastic differentiation, and, subsequently, calcification. At the time of writing, no pharmacotherapy has been established to prevent aortic valve calcification. However, novel promising therapeutic targets have been recently identified. This review summarizes the knowledge of pathomechanisms involved in aortic valve calcification and points out novel treatment strategies.

### ESC/EACTS vs. ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of severe aortic stenosis [^114sUF8v]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious and complex condition for which optimal management continues to evolve rapidly. An understanding of clinical practice guidelines is critical to effective patient care and shared decision-making. This state-of-the-art review of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Guidelines and the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines compares their recommendations for AS based on the evidence at the time of writing.

The European and American guidelines are generally congruent with the exception of three key distinctions:

- **Left ventricular ejection fraction intervention threshold**: The European guidelines recommend intervening at a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, compared to 60% over serial imaging in the American guidelines for asymptomatic patients.

- **Surgical bioprosthesis age threshold**: The European guidelines recommend a threshold of ≥ 65 years for surgical bioprosthesis, whereas the American guidelines employ multiple age categories, providing latitude for patient factors and preferences.
- **Age cut-offs for valve replacement types**: There are different age cut-offs endorsed for transcatheter vs. surgical aortic valve replacement, despite limited evidence.

This review also discusses trends indicating a decreasing proportion of mechanical valve replacements. It identifies gaps in the literature, including areas like transcatheter aortic valve implantation in asymptomatic patients, the appropriateness of Ross procedures, concomitant coronary revascularization with aortic valve replacement, and bicuspid AS.

### Aortic valve calcification: Basic science to clinical practice [^112d1HDA]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic valve stenosis results from regulated cell processes. The histological hallmarks include inflammation and a remodeling of the extracellular matrix, leading to bone formation. Over the last 15 years, the perspective has shifted from seeing it as an unmodifiable degenerative disease to recognizing it as an active biological process regulated by highly conserved ubiquitous cellular pathways. Many mechanisms and risk factors are the same as those in atherosclerosis. Therefore, statins and angiotensin II antagonists were considered promising treatment options; however, clinical trials did not support their efficacy in this context. This review describes the understanding of major molecular mechanisms and discusses their role in clinical practice and potential therapy.

### Moderate aortic valve stenosis is associated with increased mortality rate and lifetime loss: Systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data of 409 680 patients [^112HFeBA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular heart disease, imposing a substantial burden on global public health. AS frequently coexists with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three decades ago, it was recognized that the pivotal aspect in managing patients with AS lies in the timely decision to refer for intervention.

Contemporary guidelines advocate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in those with severe symptomatic AS and, by extension, in those who are asymptomatic but experience reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55% by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines, class of recommendation IIa; and LVEF < 50% by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, class of recommendation I). This is owed to the adverse impact of elevated afterload on the already diseased left ventricle. Conversely, in those with moderate AS, both guidelines advocate for a "watchful waiting approach" with frequent surveillance echocardiograms (yearly by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines, and every 1–2 years by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines) to detect any disease progression. The rationale behind the contrasting recommendations concerning the timing of intervention in AS remains a matter of discussion. Recent large-scale observational studies found the prognosis of patients with moderate AS may be more unfavorable than previously thought.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, specifically with respect to aortic valve replacement (choice of valves), ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend choosing a prosthetic valve based on a shared decision-making process. This process should account for the patient's values and preferences, including discussion of the indications for and risks of anticoagulant therapy. It should also consider the potential need for, and risks associated with, valve reintervention in patients with an indication for aortic valve replacement.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of aging, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to the care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this review.

### Orally inhaled drug particle transport in computerized models of laryngotracheal stenosis [^114n5SqT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Adjuvant management for laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) may involve inhaled corticosteroids, but metered dose inhalers are designed for pulmonary drug delivery. Comprehensive analyses of drug particle deposition efficiency for orally inhaled corticosteroids in LTS subjects are lacking.
- **Study design**: Descriptive research conducted at an academic medical center.
- **Methods**: Anatomically realistic three-dimensional reconstructions of the upper airway were created from computed tomography images of four LTS subjects — two with subglottic stenosis and two with tracheal stenosis. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was used to simulate airflow and drug particle transport in each airway. Three inhalation pressures were simulated: 10 Pa, 25 Pa, and 40 Pa. Drug particle transport was simulated for 100 to 950 nanoparticles and 1 to 50 micron-particles. Particles were released into the airway to mimic varying inhaler conditions with and without a spacer chamber.
- **Results**: Based on the smallest to largest cross-sectional area ratio, the laryngotracheal stenotic segment shrunk by 57% and 47%, respectively, for subglottic stenosis models, and by 53% for both tracheal stenosis models. Airflow resistance at the stenotic segment was lower in subglottic stenosis models than in tracheal stenosis models: 0.001 to 0.011 Pa.s/mL vs 0.024 to 0.082 Pa.s/mL. Drug depositions for micron-particles and nanoparticles at stenosis were 0.06% to 2.48% and 0.10% to 2.60% for subglottic stenosis and tracheal stenosis models, respectively. Particle sizes with the highest stenotic deposition were 6 to 20 µm.

### Transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with chronic lung disease? The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind [^115F4HBD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In Bob Dylan's iconic song, "Blowin' in the Wind", the refrain "The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind" has been described as "impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind". The treatment of patients with chronic lung disease and aortic stenosis (AS) likely belongs in the latter category.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects nearly 5% of the US population and is the third leading cause of death. The most common classification of COPD severity is the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) staging system, with patients with GOLD stages III and IV frequently requiring oxygen and having a high risk of COPD exacerbations and respiratory complications. Similarly, AS is the most common valvular disorder in the Western world, with a prevalence of 2% in patients over the age of 65 years.

Both illnesses share several common features. Smoking is the most common cause of COPD and is also an established risk factor for calcific valve disease. The cardinal symptom of both illnesses is shortness of breath, and frequently, chest pain and cough. Almost diabolically, severe AS can make the diagnosis of COPD challenging. Functional limitations are frequently present in both, and increased frailty, reduced mobility, and malnutrition are common accompanying conditions. In the Euro Heart Survey, patients with COPD constituted approximately 15% of patients referred for aortic valve replacement. COPD can affect surgical outcomes in several ways.

### Aortic stenosis, atherosclerosis, and skeletal bone: Is there a common link with calcification and inflammation [^111UiiRm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis shares many similarities with atherosclerosis and skeletal bone formation. Using non-invasive imaging, we compared aortic valve calcification and inflammation activity with that measured in atherosclerosis and bone.
- **Methods and results**: Positron emission and computed tomography was performed using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF, calcification) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG, inflammation) in 101 patients with calcific aortic valve disease (81 aortic stenosis and 20 aortic sclerosis). Calcium scores and positron emission tomography tracer activity (tissue-to-background ratio; TBR) were measured in the aortic valve, coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, and bone.

	- Over 90% of the cohort had coexistent calcific atheroma; however, correlations between calcium scores were weak or absent (valve vs. aorta r(2) = 0.015, P = 0.222; valve vs. coronaries r(2) = 0.039, P = 0.049), as were associations between calcium scores and bone mineral density (BMD vs. valve r(2) = 0.000, P = 0.766; vs. aorta r(2) = 0.052, P = 0.025; vs. coronaries r(2) = 0.016, P = 0.210).

	18F-NaF activity in the valve was 28% higher than in the aorta (TBR: 2.66 ± 0.84 vs. 2.11 ± 0.31, respectively, P < 0.001) and correlated more strongly with the severity of aortic stenosis (r(2) = 0.419, P < 0.001) than 18F-NaF activity outside the valve (valve vs. aorta r(2) = 0.167, P < 0.001; valve vs. coronary arteries r(2) = 0.174, P < 0.001; valve vs. bone r(2) = 0.001, P = 0.806). In contrast, 18F-FDG activity was lower in the aortic valve than the aortic atheroma (TBR: 1.56 ± 0.21).

### Clinical outcomes according to aortic stenosis management: Insights from real-world practice [^115qybBU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, affecting approximately 5% of individuals aged over 65 years old. Untreated, symptomatic severe AS is associated with poor short-term prognosis, significant rates of healthcare resource usage including frequent hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), and impaired quality of life. At the time of writing, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only effective therapy proven to improve survival. Therefore, guidelines strongly recommend referring symptomatic patients with severe AS for AVR, whether surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR), depending on surgical risk and/or patient age.

Despite these recommendations, previous studies consistently reported an underuse of AVR in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS. Additionally, the question of more timely interventions in severe but also moderate AS emerges to reduce its burden, particularly at a time of low AVR-related death even for those previously deemed inoperable. Importantly, most studies exploring the management of patients with AS and its association with outcomes are restricted to severe AS, tertiary centers, report only limited follow-up, or may be biased by the cost or the availability of the selected therapy. Finally, the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines suggest different age thresholds (65 and 80) for choosing between SAVR or TAVR and highlight for the first time the importance of shared decision-making with the patient.

### Aortic stenosis and renal function: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis [^113B8Ktx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the bidirectional relationship between alternative markers of genetically predicted renal function and aortic stenosis. Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted (IVW) and sensitivity analyses were performed for the effect of a genetically predicted 1 unit increase in alternative markers of renal function. These markers included log-transformed eGFR based on creatinine, eGFR based on cystatin C, and SUN, examining their risk on aortic stenosis (A–C). The evaluation for reverse causality involved analyzing the effect of a 1 unit increase in the log odds of genetic liability to aortic stenosis on levels of log-transformed eGFRcrea, eGFRcys, and SUN (D–F). The horizontal axes for panels A–C present odds ratios for a binary outcome, while the horizontal axes for panels D–F present beta values for continuous outcomes. eGFR indicates estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFRcrea, estimated glomerular filtration rate based on creatinine; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C; IVW, inverse variance weighted; MR, Mendelian randomization; MR-PRESSO, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier; OR, odds ratio; and SUN, serum urea nitrogen.
- **Serum urea nitrogen and aortic stenosis**: Serum urea nitrogen (SUN) was analyzed as an alternative marker of renal function. Neutral results were found for the analyses of genetically predicted SUN as the exposure and aortic stenosis (AS) as the outcome (IVW OR, 1.34 per unit increase in genetically predicted log-transformed SUN [95% CI, 0.75–2.39], P = 0.32), as well as neutral results in the reverse direction. These results remained consistent across all Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses.

### Current therapeutic options in aortic stenosis [^112VmDb7]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease requiring valve replacement. Valve replacement therapies have undergone progressive evolution since the 1960s. Over the last 20 years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has radically transformed the care of aortic stenosis, such that it is now the treatment of choice for many, particularly elderly, patients. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, indications for intervention, and therapeutic options for aortic stenosis.

### Statin therapy of calcific aortic stenosis: hype or hope [^1138CJKc]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis, with a prevalence of 3–9%, is the most frequent heart valve disease and the main cause for valve replacement in patients over 60 years of age. Once thought to be caused by a passive calcium precipitate within the aortic valve leaflets, there is now increasing evidence that development and progression of calcific aortic valve disease may be triggered by underlying genetic and cardiovascular risk factors and is regulated by an active cellular process involving inflammatory pathways. Targeted drug therapy to prevent the progression of calcific aortic valve disease should ideally be based on the knowledge of risk factors and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Conflicting data exists on the potency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) to influence both risk factors and inflammatory pathways by lowering lipid levels and exerting anti-inflammatory properties, respectively. In this review, various aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis will be summarized and connected with recent experimental and clinical studies that address the potential benefit of the targeted drug therapy by statins in order to prevent the progression of the disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend performing valvular intervention before elective noncardiac surgery to reduce perioperative risk if possible. This recommendation depends on the urgency and risk of the noncardiac procedure and applies to patients meeting standard indications for intervention for valvular heart disease (replacement and repair), based on symptoms and disease severity.

### Upregulation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in human aortic valves correlates with severity of stenosis and leads to leukotriene-induced effects on valvular myofibroblasts [^116NYvzb]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

The development of aortic valve stenosis is not only associated with calcification and extracellular matrix remodeling but also with inflammation. This study aimed to determine the role of proinflammatory signaling through the leukotriene (LT) pathway in aortic stenosis.

- **Methods and results**: After macroscopic dissection of surgically removed human aortic valves, RNA was extracted from 311 preparations derived from 68 patients to differentiate normal, thickened, and calcified areas from each cusp. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was then used to correlate gene expression patterns with preoperative echocardiographic parameters. The messenger RNA levels of the LT-forming enzyme 5-lipoxygenase increased 1.6- and 2.2-fold in thickened and calcified tissue, respectively, compared with normal areas of the same valves. In thickened tissues, messenger RNA levels for 5-lipoxygenase (r = -0.35; P = 0.03), its activating protein (5-lipoxygenase activating protein; r = -0.39; P = 0.02), and LTA(4) hydrolase (r = -0.48; P = 0.01) correlated inversely with the velocity-time integral ratio. Additionally, leukotriene A(4) hydrolase transcripts correlated inversely with aortic valve area, indexed for body surface area (r = -0.52; P = 0.007). Immunohistochemical stainings revealed LT receptor expression on valvular myofibroblasts. In primary cultures of human myofibroblasts derived from stenotic aortic valves, Leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) increased intracellular calcium, enhanced reactive oxygen species production, and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential.

### Aortic valve and ascending aorta guidelines for management and quality measures: Executive summary [^113tPgaJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines are intended to assist physicians and other healthcare providers in clinical decision-making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. These guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the same results. Moreover, these guidelines are subject to change over time without notice. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient.

### Aortic stenosis and renal function: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis [^117EfqGe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Main analysis explores the bidirectional relationship between genetically predicted chronic kidney disease (CKD) and aortic stenosis through Mendelian randomization. The study utilized inverse variance weighted (IVW) and sensitivity analyses to examine:

- **Effect of CKD on aortic stenosis**: The impact of a 1-unit increase in the log odds of genetic liability to CKD on the risk of aortic stenosis.

- **Reverse causality**: Evaluation of the effect of a 1-unit increase in the log odds of genetic liability to aortic stenosis on the risk of CKD. The horizontal axes are logarithmic as they present odds ratios.

CKD stands for chronic kidney disease; IVW refers to inverse variance weighted; MR is Mendelian randomization; MR‐PRESSO is MR‐Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier; and OR denotes odds ratio.

The analysis considered renal function as a continuous variable using two different measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In the primary IVW analyses, no significant association was found between genetically predicted eGFRcrea and risk of aortic stenosis (AS), with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.30 per unit increase in genetically predicted log-transformed eGFRcrea (95% CI, 0.61–2.77, P = 0.50). Consistent results were obtained by weighted-median, weighted-mode, and MR‐Egger analyses. Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity, no horizontal pleiotropy was detected. Even when excluding outlier single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using MR‐PRESSO and Cook's distance methods, the null result was maintained (MR‐PRESSO: OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.55–2.42], P = 0.70; IVW with outliers excluded by Cook's distance: OR, 0.96).

### The anti-inflammatory profile of inhaled corticosteroids: Biopsy studies in asthmatic patients [^113wrd71]. Respiratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma are well established. A potent topical anti-inflammatory action is assumed to underlie the therapeutic effect, given that these agents alter the number and function of a range of inflammatory cells and markers in airway biopsies. This activity profile is shown by all inhaled corticosteroids, in a variety of patient types and study designs. Thus, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids leads to consistent reductions in the number and activation of mast cells and eosinophils in biopsy specimens. Other relevant findings include reductions in T-lymphocytes, which contribute to chronic inflammation via the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (some of which are responsible for eosinophil accumulation and activation). Inhaled corticosteroids may therefore act by down-regulating immunoreactivity, reducing activation of T-lymphocytes, and consequently eosinophils. There is considerable interest in whether corticosteroids can inhibit or reverse some structural changes in the airways, including basement membrane thickening, collagen deposition, and increased airway vascularity. It has been suggested that these changes may contribute towards airway hyperresponsiveness and irreversible airway obstruction. In summary, inhaled corticosteroids have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity in asthma patients, but the relationship between changes in clinical and immunopathological parameters, particularly in the long-term, requires further study.

### Stenotic aortic valves have dysfunctional mechanisms of anti-inflammation: Implications for aortic stenosis [^116H3S1L]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is an inflammatory disease associated with increased tissue levels of interleukin-1 beta. We hypothesized that the antagonist of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is deficient in aortic valves and that its production by aortic valve interstitial cells is less in cells from stenotic valves than from controls.
- **Methods**: Valve leaflets from stenotic aortic valves (n = 6) and from valves of hearts explanted at the time of cardiac transplantation (n = 6) were studied by immunostaining for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Aortic valve interstitial cells were isolated, and receptor antagonist levels were determined from cell lysates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Osteogenic phenotype changes in valve cells stimulated by toll-like receptors 2 and 4 were determined by immunoblotting for bone morphogenetic protein-2 after treatment with and without interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (100 μg/mL). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance.
- **Results**: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist was abundant in nonstenotic aortic valve leaflets and virtually absent in leaflets from stenotic valves. Aortic valve interstitial cells from grossly normal leaflets produced significantly more receptor antagonist at baseline and in response to toll-like receptor 2 and 4 stimulation than cells from diseased valves (P < 0.05). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist significantly attenuated toll-like receptor 2 stimulated bone morphogenetic protein-2 production in aortic valve interstitial cells, but not toll-like receptor 4 stimulated production (P < 0.05).
