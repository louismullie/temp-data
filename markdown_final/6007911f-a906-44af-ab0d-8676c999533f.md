## Question

Glp 1 and pancreatic cancer risk

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether GLP-1 receptor agonists increase the risk of pancreatic cancer and how to interpret the mixed evidence base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility from preclinical data. Then, I should review randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses for direct evidence. Next, I will examine large observational cohorts and real-world studies for external validity and longer-term signals. After that, I need to check pharmacovigilance databases for potential reporting bias. Finally, I will synthesize the weight of evidence, consider guideline positions, and outline practical clinical recommendations with attention to pancreatitis risk and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in pancreatic ductal cells and PanIN lesions, and preclinical work shows that GLP-1 agonism can increase ductal proliferation and, in some models, accelerate PanIN progression, which raises a theoretical concern for promoting existing neoplasia rather than initiating it; however, translation from rodents to humans is uncertain and often discordant, so I should not over-interpret this mechanistic signal without corroborating clinical data [^1111m7Ja] [^1178aWdJ] [^111f8YyK].

> Next, I should review randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, since these provide the highest-quality direct evidence. Multiple meta-analyses of RCTs, including cardiovascular outcomes trials, consistently show no significant increase in pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RAs; for example, pooled analyses report odds ratios around 0.67–1.06 with confidence intervals crossing 1, and CVOT syntheses likewise show no excess signal, which is reassuring despite relatively short follow-up that may miss long-latency events [^116LAMQB] [^117MBurS] [^115rtPUe] [^114zUHEM]. Wait, let me verify a potential inconsistency: one recent meta-analysis suggested a slight increase in pancreatic cancer risk only when background medications were present, but that signal disappeared when stratified by background therapy and may reflect selection or analytical artifacts; given the overall null across RCTs, I should weigh this as a weak, context-dependent signal rather than a class effect.

> I will now examine large observational cohorts to assess external validity and longer-term outcomes. Several high-quality population-based studies, including CNODES across North America and the UK with nearly one million patients, found no increased pancreatic cancer risk with incretin-based therapies compared with sulfonylureas, and in some analyses the point estimates were below 1, suggesting neutrality or possible protection with longer use; similarly, a large Israeli cohort comparing GLP-1 RAs to basal insulin found no excess risk over approximately 7–9 years, which strengthens confidence for medium-term safety [^1174NGiw] [^113XjXKB] [^113XayKB] [^114zn9b7]. Hold on, I should verify whether any real-world datasets show the opposite; indeed, some large U.S. cohorts suggest lower pancreatic cancer incidence with GLP-1 RAs versus insulin or metformin, but these are observational and susceptible to confounding, so I should interpret them cautiously while acknowledging consistency with a neutral or protective association in several analyses [^117GFprE] [^116K8Sx2].

> Next, I should review pharmacovigilance signals for potential reporting bias. Early FAERS analyses reported disproportionate reporting of pancreatic cancer with exenatide and sitagliptin, but these signals are vulnerable to notoriety and protopathic bias, especially soon after drug launch; importantly, these database signals have not been corroborated by rigorously adjudicated RCTs or well-controlled observational studies, which tempers their evidentiary weight [^113SYQV9] [^115oPP3X] [^116DUX8t]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FAERS signal might reflect a true increase, but given the lack of confirmation in higher-quality designs and the known limitations of spontaneous reporting, I should not rely on FAERS to infer causality here [^113SYQV9].

> Let me synthesize the weight of evidence. The balance across RCTs and meta-analyses is null for pancreatic cancer, supported by multiple large observational cohorts showing no increased risk versus appropriate comparators; while a few subgroup or context-specific analyses hint at slight associations, these are inconsistent and likely reflect confounding, analytical choices, or sparse events rather than a causal effect, so the prevailing conclusion is that GLP-1 RAs do not increase pancreatic cancer risk based on current data [^116LAMQB] [^1174NGiw] [^113XayKB]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline positions; professional societies emphasize the absence of a pancreatic cancer signal in large trials and meta-analyses, which reinforces clinical neutrality pending longer-term surveillance [^113AP5mk].

> But wait, what about pancreatitis as a potential intermediate? I need to ensure I address this because chronic pancreatitis is a recognized risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses of RCTs show a small, statistically significant increase in acute pancreatitis with GLP-1 RAs overall, but this signal attenuates or becomes nonsignificant in sensitivity analyses and when stratified by background medications; importantly, absolute risk remains very low, and guidelines advise caution in patients with prior pancreatitis and prompt discontinuation if pancreatitis occurs, which is a prudent, risk-mitigating approach [^117MBurS] [^115PZkt1] [^112n2rPj]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even if there is a small pancreatitis signal, the link to subsequent cancer is tenuous over typical follow-up durations, and the cancer data themselves do not show an increase, so the clinical implication is vigilance rather than avoidance in appropriately selected patients [^114WhTKm].

> I should confirm how guidelines translate this into practice. Current endocrine guidelines state that large placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated increased pancreatic cancer risk with GLP-1 RAs, and they recommend avoiding use only in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 due to unrelated thyroid C-cell concerns, while advising standard pancreatitis precautions; this supports continued use of GLP-1 RAs when clinically indicated, with routine counseling on pancreatitis symptoms and drug cessation if pancreatitis is suspected or confirmed [^113AP5mk] [^112n2rPj].

> Finally, I need to outline practical clinical recommendations and monitoring. For patients without prior pancreatitis, GLP-1 RAs can be prescribed with standard counseling and no routine pancreatic imaging; for patients with a history of pancreatitis or multiple risk factors, I should individualize decisions, consider alternatives, and ensure close follow-up, instructing patients to stop therapy and seek care for persistent severe abdominal pain; given the long latency of pancreatic cancer, ongoing pharmacovigilance and longer-term observational data are warranted, but current evidence does not support routine cancer screening solely due to GLP-1 RA exposure [^112n2rPj] [^115oPP3X]. I should double-check that this aligns with the evidence: yes, the absence of a cancer signal in high-quality trials and cohorts, coupled with low absolute pancreatitis risk and clear guidance on pancreatitis management, supports this balanced approach [^116LAMQB] [^1174NGiw] [^113AP5mk].

> In summary, after reviewing mechanistic, trial, observational, and pharmacovigilance data, I conclude that GLP-1 receptor agonists are not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer based on current evidence; a small, context-dependent pancreatitis signal warrants caution in susceptible patients but does not translate into a demonstrated cancer risk, and guideline-concordant use with appropriate monitoring remains reasonable [^116LAMQB] [^113XjXKB] [^113AP5mk].

Current evidence does not show a **significant increase** in pancreatic cancer risk with GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112UN18w]. Large randomized trials [^115rtPUe] and meta-analyses [^113jjdAs] report no excess pancreatic cancer versus placebo or other diabetes drugs, and observational cohorts are reassuring [^113XjXKB] [^114zn9b7]. A small pancreatitis signal exists [^117MBurS], but **no causal link to cancer** is established [^114WhTKm]. Guidelines advise routine use with vigilance for pancreatitis symptoms [^112n2rPj]; patients with prior pancreatitis or high risk should be monitored closely, and therapy stopped if pancreatitis occurs [^116w6R8o].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) provide the **highest-quality evidence** on GLP-1 RAs and pancreatic cancer risk [^115rtPUe].

- **Meta-analysis of CVOTs**: No significant increase in pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RAs versus placebo or active comparators (rate ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.77–1.70) [^115rtPUe].

- **ELIXA trial**: Lixisenatide showed no excess pancreatic cancer versus placebo (3 vs 9 cases; 0.1% vs 0.3%) [^114ivNxJ].

- **LEADER trial**: Liraglutide showed no significant increase versus placebo (13 vs 5 cases; 0.4% vs 0.2%; HR 2.61, 95% CI 0.93–7.35) [^116czW3f].

- **SUSTAIN-6 trial**: Semaglutide showed no significant increase versus placebo (1 vs 4 cases; 0.1% vs 0.2%) [^116czW3f].

---

## Evidence from observational studies

Observational studies offer larger, longer-term datasets but are **susceptible to bias** [^115oPP3X].

- **Large cohort studies**: No increased pancreatic cancer risk with GLP-1 RAs versus sulfonylureas or other comparators (HR ~1.02, 95% CI 0.84–1.23) [^113XjXKB] [^1174NGiw].

- **Israeli cohort**: No increased risk versus basal insulin over 7 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15–1.71) [^113XayKB].

- **Real-world data**: No increased risk versus other antidiabetics in large databases [^116j39v3].

---

## Biological plausibility and mechanisms

GLP-1 receptors are present in pancreatic ducts and acini, and preclinical data suggest proliferative effects; however, **human relevance remains uncertain** [^111f8YyK].

- **Pancreatitis risk**: GLP-1 RAs are associated with a small increase in acute pancreatitis (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.09–1.89), but this does not establish a cancer link [^117MBurS] [^114WhTKm].

- **Chronic pancreatitis**: A known risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but no evidence shows GLP-1 RAs cause chronic pancreatitis or PanIN progression in humans [^1178aWdJ].

---

## Regulatory and guideline perspectives

Regulatory agencies and professional societies have **reviewed the evidence** and provided guidance:

- **FDA and EMA**: No causal association between GLP-1 RAs and pancreatic cancer has been established [^116czW3f].

- **AACE 2022**: Large trials and meta-analyses show no increased pancreatic cancer risk; GLP-1 RAs are appropriate in T2D, including with obesity or cardiovascular disease [^113AP5mk].

- **Precautions**: Use caution in patients with prior pancreatitis; discontinue if pancreatitis occurs [^112n2rPj].

---

## Limitations and ongoing research

Despite reassuring data, **limitations remain**:

- **Follow-up**: RCTs and observational studies have median follow-up of 2–5 years, shorter than the latency of pancreatic cancer [^115MyMgC].

- **Confounding**: Observational studies may have residual confounding by obesity, diabetes duration, or other factors [^115fKiGK].

- **Ongoing studies**: Longer-term surveillance and mechanistic studies are underway to clarify any association [^111f8YyK].

---

## Clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence, **clinicians should**:

- **Routine use**: GLP-1 RAs can be used in T2D, including patients with obesity or cardiovascular disease, without excess pancreatic cancer risk [^113AP5mk].

- **Monitor for pancreatitis**: Use caution in patients with prior pancreatitis or high risk; stop therapy if pancreatitis occurs [^112n2rPj].

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss the low pancreatitis risk and absence of a cancer signal to date [^114WhTKm].

Current evidence does not show a **significant increase** in pancreatic cancer risk with GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112UN18w]. Large randomized trials [^115rtPUe] and meta-analyses [^113nCsQp] report no excess pancreatic cancer versus placebo or other diabetes drugs, and observational cohorts are reassuring [^113XjXKB] [^114zn9b7]. A small pancreatitis signal exists [^117MBurS], but **no causal link to cancer** is established [^114WhTKm]. Guidelines advise routine use with vigilance for pancreatitis symptoms [^113AP5mk] [^112n2rPj]; patients with prior pancreatitis or high risk should be monitored closely, and therapy stopped if pancreatitis occurs [^116w6R8o].

5 Conclusion

Overall analysis suggests a potential increased risk of pancreatitis with GLP‐1 RA use, which weakens when stratifying by background medication use. No conclusive evidence links GLP‐1 RA use to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but a slightly significant association was found when stratified with background medications. Clinicians should remain cautious in patients with a high baseline pancreatic risk, and GLP‐1 RA treatment should be discontinued if pancreatitis symptoms develop. Further research should address standardising GLP‐1 RA exposure, follow‐up protocols, patient characteristics, and background therapies to eliminate heterogeneity across trials.

Discussion

Our analyses of a large cohort of individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes over a 9-year follow-up period with more than 33 000 GLP-1RA users and a fairly large number of incident pancreatic cancers seem not to support an increase in pancreatic cancer risk associated with GLP-1RA use. Other publications are in line with our findings. In a nested case-control studyof median follow-up ranging from 1.3 to 2.8 years with 274 pancreatic cancer incidents, compared with sulfonylureas, GLP-1RA use was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.38–3.38).

In a systematic reviewthat included 113 trials on the safety of GLP-1RAs, the incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with GLP-1RA was not significantly different from that observed in the comparator groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.65–1.34, and 0.94; 95% CI, 0.52–1.70, respectively). Nevertheless, a significantly increased risk of cholelithiasis (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01–1.68) was detected.

A systematic review with meta-analysis published in 2018 included 4 major GLP-1RA cardiovascular safety trials with adjudication for several safety signals including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and did not support an increase in pancreatitis (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63–1.28) or pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.33–2.11) associated with GLP-1RA treatment compared with placebo.

In another systematic review with meta-analysisof randomized trials with GLP-1RA as an intervention, 12 trials were included with a total of 36 397 patients. GLP-1RA did not appear to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer when compared with other treatments (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.67–1.67; I² = 14%).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and pancreatic cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114zn9b7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, in this historical cohort of more than half a million adults with diabetes, we did not reveal any compelling evidence of increased pancreatic cancer risk following use of GLP-1RA. We were able to follow more than 30 000 GLP-1RA users and evaluate their risk for pancreatic cancer incidence up to 7 years after initiation. Our Cox model allowed us to explore the risk for pancreatic cancer associated with use of GLP-1RA compared with basal insulin, with all other characteristics being equal, including history of pancreatitis, other glucose-lowering drugs, and length of diabetes. Our new-user and prevalent new-user design analyses, comparing GLP-1RA use with basal insulin use, concurred with these findings. However, monitoring of GLP-1RA for pancreatic cancer risk beyond 7 years following initiation of therapy is still required.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and pancreatic cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115MyMgC]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Concerns were raised following several publications that identified an increased risk for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning on pancreatic safety followed, urging both patients and health care professionals to report adverse events involving incretin mimetics to the FDA MedWatch program. Two short-term in vivo studies performed at the FDA's request, and a review of case reportsfurther increased concerns about the possible adverse effects of GLP-1RA therapy on exocrine pancreas, leading to an elevation in pancreatic enzymes and acute pancreatitis. Nonetheless, more recent meta-analyses, 1 including only trials with adjudicated pancreatitis adverse events, showed neither an association of GLP-1RA with acute pancreatitis nor with pancreatic cancer. Two large cohort studies, published in 2016 also reported negative findings. Three further meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and observational studiesreported no association between GLP-1RA use and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, but an increased risk of cholelithiasis was observed in the first. Nevertheless, major shortcomings, such as fairly short mean follow-up times (of < 2 years in the RCTs and < 5 years in the observational studies), limited sample size, and various time-related biaseswere noted. Recently, increased risk for pancreatic cancer was described using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for adverse events reported from 2004 to 2020 for GLP-1RA treatment-associated neoplasms, compared with other glucose-lowering medications (GLMs).

We investigated the association of GLP-1RA treatment with pancreatic cancer incidence over a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.1 (2.9) years (median [IQR], 7.0 [3.5–8.8] years) in a population-based historical cohort of more than 500 000 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We used basal insulin as an active comparator while accounting for major confounding factors and time-related biases, as well as adjusting for treatment with other GLMs and history of pancreatitis.

### Association between GLP-1 receptor agonists as a class and colorectal cancer risk: a meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies [^113w8NUA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is escalating at an alarming rate, with an estimated 537 million adults affected worldwide in 2021 — a figure projected to rise to 783 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Population aging, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and urbanization primarily drive this surge. As a result, the demand for effective long-term glycemic control has led to the widespread use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), which have become a cornerstone in the management of T2DM. However, growing clinical attention is being directed toward the potential long-term effects of individual GLP-1 RAs, particularly their association with cancer risks such as colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Understanding these differential effects is critical, mainly as these agents are increasingly prescribed to high-risk populations. Identifying GLP-1 RAs with protective or adverse impact on cancer risk could significantly inform therapeutic decisions, cancer screening protocols, and long-term patient outcomes. Therefore, a thorough understanding of cancer and its modifiable risk factors is essential for developing effective early detection and prevention strategies.

Obesity, diabetes, and cancer risks have complex and multifaceted interactions. In recent years, the potential extra glycemic effects of GLP-1 RAs have been observed in the form of increased risk of cancer. Previous cohort-based studies have reported a reduced risk of cancers such as colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment with GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1 receptor signaling has been reported to control mucosal expansion in the intestine and colon, thus playing a role in intestinal tumorigenesis. Epidemiological research has linked obesity and T2DM to increased risk of colorectal cancer and other malignancies. Several hypothesized pathways could lead to an elevated risk of cancer, including insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, and altered gut flora. Scientists are interested in how GLP-1 receptor agonists affect colorectal carcinogenesis because they directly alter gut physiology by slowing stomach emptying, increasing gut hormone release, and altering microbiota composition.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist effects on normal and neoplastic pancreata [^1178aWdJ]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the increased pancreatic cancer diagnoses with GLP-based therapy is due to chronic subclinical pancreatitis also caused by these agents. However, it is unlikely that any risk of pancreatitis from these agents would explain the pancreatic cancer association. Pancreatic cancer arising from pancreatitis is thought to occur only after several decades of ongoing recurrent acute attacks of pancreatitis most clearly evident in patients with hereditary forms of the disease, much in the way chronic inflammation predisposes to the development of other cancers, and not as a consequence of a short duration of drug-induced pancreatitis. The cumulative risk of developing pancreatic cancer 20 years after a diagnosis of (nonhereditary) chronic pancreatitis has been estimated to be 4%. These data suggest that if GLP-1-based therapy can produce ongoing low-grade subclinical chronic pancreatitis, many years of therapy would be needed for such pancreatitis to have any influence on cancer risk. If these agents do increase pancreatic cancer risk, direct effects of GLP-1R agonists on PanIN growth are likely to be more important than the indirect effect of subclinical chronic pancreatitis.

Could GLP-1R agonists increase the growth of human pancreatic cancers? Gier et al. show that mutant KRAS increases pancreatic ductal epithelial cell responses to exendin-4. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells express GLP-1 receptors, raising the possibility that these agents could increase their proliferation in the same way they influence the growth of mPanIN cells. If true, the modest increase in pancreatic cancer diagnoses among GLP-1R agonist-treated patients could simply result from accelerated growth of subclinical pancreatic cancers. Consistent with this possibility, epidemiological studies indicate that almost 1% of adults over age 50 with new-onset diabetes will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 3 years. Although pancreatic cancer is a rapidly progressive disease once diagnosed, it likely takes several years for an initial cancerous clone to grow into a tumor mass that presents clinically. So it is likely that most patients who developed pancreatic cancer on GLP-1R agonists already had a subclinical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma when they initiated this therapy.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117MBurS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This meta-analysis evaluates the rates of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer among glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for GLP-1 RA RCTs that evaluated pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this risk; subgroup analysis was performed with and without background medications.

Results

62 studies utilising dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, or tirzepatide, with 66,232 patients, mean age of 58.3years (14.4 to 68), and mean follow-up of 43.5weeks (1 to 198) were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis (RR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.09–1.89, p = 0.009), but not when stratified by background medications (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.87–1.87) and without background medications (RR: 1.37, 95% CI 0.91–2.05). Pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 RA use showed no significant association (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.86–1.97). However, a significant increase was found with background medications (RR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.05–3.26, p = 0.03), but not without (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.43–1.55).

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs carry a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis, which is not significant when stratified by background medication use. Overall risk for pancreatic cancer was not observed, but a slight association was found when stratified with background medications. However, this difference is likely minimal, given the numerous studies excluded from the meta-analysis where both treatment arms had zero events.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and pancreatic cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113XayKB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Concerns have been raised that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Objective

To investigate the association of GLP-1RA treatment with pancreatic cancer incidence over 9 years of follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this population-based historical cohort study, adult patients (aged 21 to 89 years) with type 2 diabetes insured by Clalit Healthcare Services, the largest state-mandated health organization in Israel, were followed up from 2009, when GLP-1RA became available in Israel, until pancreatic cancer diagnosis, death, reaching age 90 years, or end of follow-up (December 2017). Data were analyzed from June 2022 to November 2023.

Exposures

Treatment with GLP-1RA was compared with basal insulin.

Main Outcome and Measures

Pancreatic cancer incidence was compared according to weighted cumulative exposures to GLP-1RA and to basal insulin in a Cox model implemented in discrete time, with time origin at 2 years after diabetes diagnosis, adjusting for confounding. In sensitivity analyses, propensity score-matched pair new-user design and prevalent new-user design were used for the comparison. Because of risk for reverse-causation bias, results in the fifth to seventh year after medication were emphasized.

Results

During a cumulative follow-up of 3 290 439 person-years of 543 595 adults with a mean (SD) age of 59.9 (12.8) years (277 502 women [51%]) with incident diabetes, 1665 patients received pancreatic cancer diagnoses. In total, 33 377 patients (6.1%) used GLP-1RA and 106 849 (19.7%) used basal insulin. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for pancreatic cancer associated with incremental use of 1 defined daily dose per day of GLP-1RA compared with basal insulin in the fifth to seventh year previously (all other characteristics, including age, sex, ethnic background, sociodemographic status, baseline body mass index, smoking history, history of pancreatitis, other glucose-lowering medications treatment history, and length of diabetes, being equal) was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.15–1.71). The new-user and prevalent new-user designs showed HRs from the fifth year onwards following initiation of GLP-1RA vs basal insulin of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.19–1.41) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.37–1.53), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this historical cohort study of adults with type 2 diabetes, no support for an increased pancreatic cancer incidence over 7 years following start of GLP-1RA treatment was found. However, monitoring for pancreatic cancer risk beyond 7 years following initiation of therapy is still required.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^113SYQV9]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Incretin based drugs, which include dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, are a relatively new group of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. These drugs have been associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and with favourable effects on body weight; however, concern has arisen that their use may be associated with the development of pancreatic cancer. This concern has been heightened by an analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration adverse events database, where the spontaneous reporting rate of pancreatic cancer was 2.9 and 2.7 times higher with exenatide and sitagliptin, respectively, compared with other oral antidiabetic drugs. In contrast, randomised controlled trials have not demonstrated this signal, although most of these trials were of short duration and none were designed or powered to assess the risk of pancreatic cancer.

To date, six observational studies have assessed the association between incretin based drugs and risk of pancreatic cancer. These studies have, however, provided conflicting results and several had methodological shortcomings. Given this controversy, regulatory agencies have called for additional studies of this potential association. To this end, the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES)designed a large, international, multicentre study to determine whether the use of incretin based drugs is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in people with type 2 diabetes.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist effects on normal and neoplastic pancreata [^111PMjza]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

In this issue of Diabetes, two articles describe preclinical studies evaluating the effects of chronic glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)–based therapy on development of pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasia. These studies were performed in light of recent case reports and a case-control study suggesting that diabetic individuals using sitagliptin or exenatide have a several-fold increased likelihood of developing pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Related to the latter association are recent case-control studies reporting that metformin therapy, which can counteract proliferative effects of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Some preclinical studies have found that GLP-1R agonists can cause pancreatitis in some mice, but others have found no such effect, and recent clinical trials found evidence for only a small increased risk of pancreatitis with liraglutide use.

In this issue, Nyborg et al. find no evidence for an increased risk of pancreatitis in liraglutide-treated compared with control-treated animals. In contrast, Gier et al. find exendin-4 had multiple effects, including increasing the extent of chronic pancreatitis-like changes in a genetically engineered mouse model (KrasG12D) of pancreatic neoplasia. How do we reconcile the different animal responses to GLP-1R agonists? It does not seem likely that these differences reflect variability in the properties of the different GLP-1R agonists in the two studies. The lack of effect of liraglutide in healthy mice, rats, and monkeys probably reflects what generally occurs in individuals with normal pancreata. Any increase in cell proliferation by GLP-1R agonists may not have pathological effects if these agents have equal effects throughout the pancreas.

### The potential risks of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with GLP-1-based therapies are far outweighed by the proven and potential (cardiovascular) benefits [^116DUX8t]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recent suggestions that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies could cause pancreatitis, and even pancreatic cancer, are based on:

Animal Studies

The worrying histological changes are not reproduced in all studies and are unexpectedly variable with different GLP-1-based therapies.

An Observational Study

Singh's findings that pancreatitis is doubled with GLP-1-based therapies could relate to their use in obese patients who are prone to pancreatitis risk factors — gallstones and hypertriglyceridaemia. The other observational studies do not find an association between GLP-1-based therapies and pancreatitis.

Us Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System

The increased reports of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer are likely to be attributable to 'notoriety bias'.

A Study Of Organ Donor Pancreases

Butler's findings for those on GLP-1-based therapies vs. those not, could have other explanations. Meanwhile: META ANALYSIS: Randomized control trials with GLP-1-based therapies do not find increased pancreatitis risk. Meta-analysis of 53 randomized controlled trials including 20 212 dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor-treated patients found a significantly reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events [odds ratio 0.689 (0.528–0.899), P = 0.006] for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors compared with control subjects.

Cardiovascular Risk

The evidence suggests that there is more than a possibility that some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists, and possibly also some dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, may be associated with reduced cardiovascular events. Eight ongoing long-term cardiovascular randomized controlled trials will report from September 2013 onwards. These trials should resolve the issue of pancreatitis risk and substantiate the extent of benefit.

Conclusion

Whilst we should remain vigilant, currently the balance of evidence is strongly in support of GLP-1-based therapy, with benefits far outweighing potential risks.

ABSTRACT

Aims

This meta‐analysis evaluates the rates of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer among glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for GLP‐1 RA RCTs that evaluated pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer. A meta‐analysis was conducted to evaluate this risk; subgroup analysis was performed with and without background medications.

Results

62 studies utilising dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, or tirzepatide, with 66,232 patients, mean age of 58.3 years (14.4 to 68), and mean follow‐up of 43.5 weeks (1 to 198) were included in this study. Meta‐analysis showed a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis (RR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.09–1.89, p = 0.009), but not when stratified by background medications (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.87–1.87) and without background medications (RR: 1.37, 95% CI 0.91–2.05). Pancreatic cancer and GLP‐1 RA use showed no significant association (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.86–1.97). However, a significant increase was found with background medications (RR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.05–3.26, p = 0.03), but not without (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.43–1.55).

Conclusion

GLP‐1 RAs carry a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis, which is not significant when stratified by background medication use. Overall risk for pancreatic cancer was not observed, but a slight association was found when stratified with background medications. However, this difference is likely minimal, given the numerous studies excluded from the meta‐analysis where both treatment arms had zero events.

Methods

Eligibility Criteria

This meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, included all studies reporting adverse events of pancreatic cancer with use of incretin-based therapy GLP-1RAs and DPP-IV inhibitors compared with placebo or other non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs in patients with T2DM. Studies fulfilling the following criteria were included: (i) RCTs; (ii) studies must include an intervention group with T2DM patients treated by incretin-based therapy (studies enrolling healthy patients, on-diabetic cases, or patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were excluded); (iii) patients with T2DM must have been studied for at least 24 weeks of treatment period (trials with shorter terms will not be able to demonstrate this association between incretin treatment and pancreatic cancer as it is thought to be a long-term adverse event); (iv) treatment for a minimum of 12 weeks with DPP-IV inhibitors in monotherapy or combination therapy or GLP-1 RA versus placebo or any anti-diabetic drug (oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin); (v) studies that yielded relevant information on reporting adverse events, regardless of whether the incidence of pancreatic cancer was the principal outcome variable or not.

Potential safety issues

Pancreatic and thyroid risk

Beyond gastrointestinal adverse events, which are widely accepted as a class effect of GLP-1 RAs, several other safety concerns have been raised over the past decade. Initial observational signals from 2011 suggested an increased risk of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients using GLP-based therapies compared to non-users (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.24, 95% CI 1.36, 3.68), leading the FDA to issue a warning on the pancreatic safety of GLP-1 RAs. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent large-scale RCTs. A meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trials found no increased risk of either acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RA treatment (Peto OR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.78, 1.40), providing reassurance evidence against this concern in high-risk populations.

Similarly, while murine studies initially raised concerns about thyroid C-cell tumors, current human data do not suggest an increased risk. A large international cohort study across six population-based databases compared nearly 100,000 GLP-1 RA users to over 2.4 million dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users and found no evidence of increased thyroid cancer risk (pooled weighted HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.59, 1.12). These findings are reassuring in the short term, though long-term risk cannot be excluded due to the relatively limited follow-up duration (median 1.8–3.0 years). As such, clinical guidelines continue to recommend against prescribing GLP-1 RAs to individuals with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

4 Discussion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis analysed 62 studies, with a total of 66,232 patients at a mean follow‐up of 43.5 weeks, to evaluate the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among patients taking GLP‐1 RAs. The main findings of this study were that GLP‐1 RAs had a small but significant association with pancreatitis, but no significance with pancreatic cancer. However, subgroup analysis with and without background medications showed no association with pancreatitis. Notably, the inclusion of tirzepatide and retatrutide, which are dual GLP‐1/glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and triple GLP‐1/GIP/glucagon agonists, respectively, may influence the safety profile due to the additional receptor activation. However, the inclusion of these agents did not substantially alter the rates of the pooled effect estimate, but the results should be interpreted with this in mind.

Our study builds on previous analyses by incorporating the largest RCT dataset to date, which evaluated acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. We also conducted subgroup analyses that stratified by background medications and study duration, allowing more focused risk evaluation of GLP‐1 RAs. Additionally, controlled trial data provide greater context for pharmacovigilance and post‐marketing safety data. All patients included in this analysis had long‐standing T2DM and were on stable anti‐hyperglycaemic medication before starting the screening process and study period. However, 45 of the 66 studies included in this study had patients who continued their medications throughout the study period, in addition to the GLP‐1 RA intervention (Table 3). Subgroup analyses showed no significant risk of pancreatitis among patients who had concomitant background medications and patients who did not, which indicates that background medications did not confound the relationship between GLP‐1 RA usage and pancreatitis. Although there was a significant risk found for pancreatic cancer among patients who had concomitant background medications, given the very small number of studies in the analyses, this finding must be interpreted with extreme caution. Furthermore, it is important to note that RCTs generally exclude patients who have a history of pancreatitis or risk factors. For example, only two of the included studies had patients with Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which is noteworthy given the possible association in modulating pancreatic disease risk. This limits the generalisability of these findings, as higher‐risk patients that would be seen in practice would be underrepresented in these study populations.

3.3 Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer

Across all studies that included patients who continued background medications, the greatest number of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer occurred in patients who received dulaglutide [28 (0.35%) and 19 (0.24%), respectively]. Across the studies that included patients who did not receive background medications, the greatest number of pancreatitis occurred in patients who received exenatide [42 (0.56%)] and the greatest number of pancreatic cancer occurred in patients who received dulaglutide [1 (0.93%)]. These results are illustrated in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Number of pancreatic events in patients without background medications.

A comprehensive meta‐analysis was conducted to assess the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer associated with GLP‐1 RAs compared to controls. In the pooled analysis of all studies evaluating pancreatitis incidence (Figure 2), GLP‐1 RA use was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09–1.89; p = 0.009; I² = 0%). When stratified by background medication use, studies that included background therapies (Figure S1) and those that did not (Figure S2) both showed nonsignificant associations (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.87–1.87, p = 0.22, I² = 0% and RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.91–2.05, p = 0.13, I² = 0%, respectively).

FIGURE 2
Meta‐analysis of GLP‐1 RA versus control for comparison of pancreatitis incidence.

For pancreatic cancer, the overall pooled analysis (Figure S3) demonstrated no significant association with GLP‐1 RA use (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.86–1.97, p = 0.22, I² = 0%). There was also no significant association found in the subgroup analysis without background medications (Figure S4; RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.43–1.55, p = 0.53, I² = 0%); however, the results were significant with background medications (Figure S5; RR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.05–3.26, p = 0.03, I² = 0%).

TABLE 3
Number of pancreatic events in patients with background medications.

The studies reviewed in this systematic analysis focused on patients classified as overweight or obese, with inclusion criteria encompassing individuals with a BMI ranging from 25 to 45. Amylase and lipase levels were also measured in some of the studies, with many patients showing elevated levels of these enzymes at the latest follow‐up. However, in some cases, despite the elevated levels, the increases were insufficient to meet the researchers' diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis.

This variation within the included studies limits the generalizability and validity of the pooled estimates. The low I² heterogeneity is also likely due to the fixed‐effects model and the sparse number of events, rather than true homogeneity across the studies. Concomitant background medication usage may influence the observed risk of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, either through confounding or diluting the risk attributable to GLP‐1 RAs. For pancreatic cancer, subgroup analysis with background medications showed an association with pancreatic cancer. However, it is important to note that only studies with events were included in the pooled risk ratio estimate, as the other RCTs had zero events in both arms. This may overestimate the risk as the double‐zero studies would likely have diluted the RR, indicating that the true risk is lower than expected. Nevertheless, these zero‐event studies highlight the overall rare incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in both arms. All studies were retained in the forest plots for transparency but were not included in the meta‐analysis.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis provides reassuring evidence against the hypothesis that incretin-based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Further, subgroup analyses suggest possible beneficial effects which require direct testing in trials designed a priori to do so. Given the potential carcinogenic potency, more large-scale RCTs with longstanding surveillance of pancreatic safety are urgently warranted, whereas epidemiological studies will also continue to be needed for long-term surveillance if such RCTs are absent.

1 Introduction

The glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) hormone is released in response to nutrient ingestion, enhancing insulin secretion, reducing glucagon release, and delaying gastric emptying. Agonists of this hormone were identified as providing potential therapeutic benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including improved glycaemic control and weight reduction. In addition to glucose control, GLP‐1 receptor agonist (RA) therapy has evolved to address cardiovascular benefits, weight management, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

Despite these advantages, concerns were raised in preclinical models and case reports highlighting pancreatic changes and acute pancreatitis, respectively. Although the total number of cases was low, these initial findings led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warnings in 2007 on the potential increased risk of pancreatitis. GLP‐1 RAs, such as exenatide, have been shown to induce pancreatic duct gland expansion and exacerbate chronic pancreatitis, potentially accelerating the formation of dysplastic lesions, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), by increasing ductal cell proliferation and promoting acinar‐to‐ductal metaplasia.

Findings of pancreatitis in these trials have been inconsistent, and subsequent studies have disputed the link between GLP‐1 RAs and pancreatitis. Clinical trials have monitored serum amylase and lipase, common markers of pancreatic health, and utilised independent adjudication committees to diagnose instances of pancreatitis to address these concerns. This study aims to evaluate available clinical trials of different GLP‐1 RAs to identify the rates of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer associated with their use. We hypothesise that GLP‐1 RAs will not significantly increase the risk of pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer.

When subgrouped by studies that had a minimum 24‐week follow‐up, pancreatitis risk (RR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.09–1.89, p = 0.01, I² = 0%) and pancreatic cancer (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.84–1.96, p = 0.25, I² = 25%) remained statistically significant and non‐significant, respectively (Figures S6 and S7).

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115fKiGK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies utilised postmarketing reports and observational studies, which carry inherent limitations that decrease the strengths of those studies. Notably, among the database studies, it was found that there was remarkable notoriety bias for the AEs reported. It is important to note that obesity increases the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk factors (e.g. gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia, biliary disease). Furthermore, since T2DM is a risk factor for pancreatic disease, it can be difficult to differentiate whether pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer is attributable to the underlying condition or the GLP‐1 RA. Thus, patient and treatment selection provide another source of imbalance and confounding across these studies. Other systematic reviews and meta‐analyses found no significant findings for pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Cao et al. collected data from seven cardiovascular outcome trials with 56,004 patients with T2DM and a median follow‐up ranging from 1.3 to 5.4 years, with no significant difference compared to placebo for acute pancreatitis (OR: 1.05, 0.78–1.40, p = 0.76) or pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.12, 0.77–1.63, p = 0.56). Similarly, a 2023 meta‐analysis with 43 trials found that pancreatitis (OR: 1.24, 0.94–1.64, p = 0.13) and pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.28, 0.87–1.89, p = 0.20) displayed no clear association for GLP‐1 RA usage. Most recently, a 2024 population‐based cohort study following 543,595 patients at over 7 years of follow‐up supported no increased risk for pancreatic cancer (OR: 0.50, 0.15–1.71). However, an evaluation of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2020 found a significantly increased (proportional reporting ratio: 9.86) pancreatic cancer cases associated with GLP‐1 RAs compared to the other glucose‐lowering agents analysed in the study. Notably, the authors stated that the combination of GLP‐1 RAs with DPP‐4 inhibitors may have led to an increased reporting of several tumours, including pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, a 2024 study presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting evaluating 638,501 patients with a history of acute pancreatitis suggested that GLP‐1 RAs reduce the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. However, these findings have not been published, and further research is required to detail these preliminary results. Regardless, this possibility will offer more options for patients that will help improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

2.3 Study Quality and Risk of Bias

The risk of bias (RoB) and study quality was assessed utilising the Cochrane RoB tool, given that all included studies were RCTs. Two independent authors assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality, and any disagreements were resolved via rigorous re‐review until consensus was achieved. The Cochrane tool contains seven domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Each domain is evaluated as high, low, or unclear RoB. Two independent authors analysed each article, and any discrepancies were resolved via rigorous re‐review or by consulting a third reviewer until agreement was reached.

2.4 Data Extraction and Analysis

The study variables extracted and analysed included title, author, study year, number of patients, GLP‐1 RA agent and dosages, mean age, mean follow‐up time, pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer rates, related lab values (amylase/lipase), and those taking background anti‐diabetic drugs. Notably, the diagnostic criteria were not consistently reported across the studies and were reported as investigator or an independent committee–determined AE. The data was compiled using Google Sheets (Google Drive; Google, Mountain View, CA). The mean, median, percentages, ranges, and standard deviations were reported if available and applicable.

Meta‐analysis was conducted using the fixed effects model to evaluate the risk ratio (RR) of developing acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis was not specified for pooling, and pancreatic cancer was an exploratory outcome, given that trial durations were not expected to be long enough to assess the risks for these two conditions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with RCTs that had at least 24 weeks of follow‐up to test for differences in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer findings. Heterogeneity was calculated with the I² statistic, with p ‐values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Forest plots were generated using Cochrane's Review Manager application (RevMan, version 5.4; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Studies with double‐zero events (treatment arms that had zero events) were included in the forest plot for transparency.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113pg5Ad]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

In the last 5 years, various epidemiological observational and randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted worldwide to establish this association. Nevertheless, the inconsistent findings among different studies have posed a dilemma of uncertainty about the association between incretin-based drugs and risk of pancreatic cancer. In 2014, Amy et al. reviewed the pancreatic safety of incretin-based therapies by evaluating FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) database. Although their conclusions seem to provide a definitive statement that the available scientific evidence does not support a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatic cancer, there is no current pooled data providing direct evidence from the standpoint of evidence-based medicine to support such a conclusion. Actually, much of the controversy was generated by Peter Butler and colleagues initially, when they speculated this association from the results of animal study involving genetically modified rats in year 2009; followed by an adverse experience database study in 2011 and finally by an analysis of post-mortem samples in 2013. Therefore, in order to provide more compelling evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis by investigating all RCTs regarding any information about pancreatic cancer events during incretin-based treatments.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and pancreatic cancer risk: target trial emulation using real-world data [^1173jtwc]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on pancreatic cancer incidence are limited and inconsistent. Here we evaluate the association of GLP-1RAs, alone and in combinations, with incident pancreatic cancer risk in a real-world population, stratified by obesity and smoking status.

Methods

This retrospective cohort included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were prescribed GLP-1RAs or other nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications between January 2013 and March 2019 and had no prior diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The incident (first-time) diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during a 5-year follow-up was compared between propensity-score matched cohorts of patients prescribed GLP-1RAs vs other nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients stratified by the status of obesity and tobacco use disorder. We also compared GLP-1RA combination therapies with monotherapies. Time-to-first-event analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval calculated.

Results

The study population comprised 1636056 eligible patients including 167091 prescribed GLP-1RAs and 1468965 prescribed other antidiabetes medications. GLP-1RAs were associated with a statistically significant decreased risk for pancreatic cancer incidence compared with each of 6 nonglucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes medications with hazard ratios ranging from 0.42 to 0.82. The reduction was greater in patients with obesity and tobacco use disorder than in those without. GLP-1RA combination therapies were associated with lower pancreatic cancer risk compared with monotherapies.

Conclusions

GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced pancreatic cancer incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further studies and trials are needed to explore mechanisms and confirm causal effects.

4.2 Limitations

However, these findings must be understood within the context of their limitations. First, as mentioned earlier, there was heterogeneity in the included studies in terms of GLP‐1 RA dosage/type, study design, age (range of 14.4 to 68 years), follow‐up time (range of 1 to 198 weeks), and background medication usage. Most importantly, this heterogeneity was seen in the definition of pancreatitis, which was not consistently reported and was determined through investigator or independent committees. Second, we included only RCTs, which provide high‐quality evidence but generally have a shorter duration, which may not be long enough to fully capture the risk of pancreatic cancer. In contrast, databases and pharmacovigilance, such as FAERS, suggest increased pancreatic cancer risk, but these data are subject to reporting bias, preventing the determination of causality. Thus, the discrepancy between FAERS and the findings of this study highlights the need for long‐term observational studies to further clarify this risk. Third, a key limitation of the meta‐analysis is the exclusion of studies with zero events in both arms from the pooled risk ratio calculations. This was done due to the risk ratio becoming undefined if no events occur in either arm; these studies would not provide data to the pooled estimate and were excluded. However, this limits the comprehensiveness of the pooled values and can overestimate the overall relative risk as the excluded trials likely could dilute the observed risk ratio. RevMan software prevented smaller decimal precision of very small effect sizes, as we originally intended to use risk difference calculation, which could better capture the low incidence across all included studies. Fourth, despite the high quality of RCTs, patients typically enrolled in RCTs are highly selected and may not be representative of the general T2DM or obese population, possibly limiting the external validation of these findings. Fifth, although we included trials with at least a 1‐week follow‐up to maximise the capture of acute events of pancreatitis, this would limit the detection of longer‐term outcomes such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Long‐term observational studies, real‐world evidence, or pharmacovigilance are needed to reliably test these outcomes. To test this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with trials that had at least 12 weeks of follow‐up to assess for differences in pancreatitis. Sixth, patients with a history of pancreatitis or risk factors for pancreatitis are usually excluded during the screening phase. It is important to note that acute pancreatitis secondary to drugs is a diagnosis of exclusion. Thus, cases that are deemed idiopathic may very well be due to drug exposure as well. Additionally, a lack of classic symptoms or a lack of evolution of symptoms may lead to further underdiagnosis.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1-based therapies and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with diabetes and obesity [^117GFprE]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There have been conflicting reports concerning an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) in new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1As). We aimed to explore whether the use of GLP-1A is associated with an increased risk of PC.

Methods

A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX. Adult patients with diabetes and/or overweight and obesity who were newly treated with GLP-1A or metformin for the first time between 2006 and 2021 were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching. The risk of PC was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 492,760 patients were identified in the GLP-1A and 918,711 patients in the metformin group. After propensity score matching, both cohorts (370,490 each) were well matched. During follow-up, 351 patients in the GLP-1A and 956 on metformin developed PC after an exposure lag of 1 year. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists was associated with a significantly lower risk of PC (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.52).

Conclusions

The use of GLP-1A in patients with obesity/diabetes is associated with a lower risk of PC compared with a similar cohort of patients using metformin. Our study findings reassure clinicians and patients with apprehensions about any possible association between GLP-1A and PC.

4.1 Potential Mechanisms and Reported Rates in the Literature

Incretins have been suspected to relate to pancreatitis, especially as T2DM is associated with the development of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Although the mechanism of action is not yet elucidated, warnings and precautions of pancreatitis are included in the prescribing information for GLP‐1 RAs. Preliminary studies have found that GLP‐1 elicits a beta‐cell preserving effect, and these sustained proliferative actions may cause unintentional exocrine and endocrine effects (e.g. pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer). Acute pancreatitis, specifically fatal haemorrhagic and necrotising types, has been noted, but the causal relationship between GLP‐1 RAs and pancreatitis/pancreatic carcinoma is not yet confirmed. GLP‐1 RAs, thus, are not recommended to be prescribed for patients with a history of pancreatitis and should be discontinued if pancreatitis symptoms develop. However, recent literature has suggested that GLP‐1 RAs can be used in patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, albeit on an individualised basis where the glycaemic, cardiovascular, and weight loss benefits outweigh the risks. A retrospective review of 161 patients with a history of acute pancreatitis at a mean follow‐up of 28.2 months found a total of 16 (9.9%) secondary episodes, of which 6 (37.5%) were attributed to the GLP‐1 RA. The 9.9% rate is lower than a pooled recurrent pancreatitis rate by Li et al. of 21% (95% CI: 18%–24%) and a pooled incidence rate calculated by Gagyi et al. of 5.26 per 100 person‐years (CI: 3.99–6.94).

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^1174NGiw]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

In this large, population based study, we found that the use of incretin based drugs is not associated with an overall increased risk of pancreatic cancer, compared with the use of sulfonylureas in patients followed for up to eight years (median 1.3–2.8 years). These findings remained consistent by class and by duration of use. Although the upper limit of the confidence interval was sufficient to exclude a 24% increased risk of pancreatic cancer, there is a need for the continued surveillance of this adverse drug effect, particularly given the latency of the cancer. None the less, this study should provide some reassurance to patients and clinicians with concerns of an association between these drugs and pancreatic cancer.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: are the GLP-1 therapies safe? [^1117czxf]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is no question that incretin-based glucose-lowering medications have proven to be effective glucose-lowering agents. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment and appear to do so with significant effects to promote weight loss with minimal hypoglycemia. In addition, there are significant data with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showing efficacy comparable to sulfonylureas but with weight neutral effects and reduced risk for hypoglycemia. However, over the recent past there have been concerns reported regarding the long-term consequences of using such therapies, and the issues raised are in regard to the potential of both classes to promote acute pancreatitis, to initiate histological changes suggesting chronic pancreatitis including associated preneoplastic lesions, and potentially, in the long run, pancreatic cancer. Other issues relate to a potential risk for the increase in thyroid cancer. There are clearly conflicting data that have been presented in preclinical studies and in epidemiologic studies. To provide an understanding of both sides of the argument, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part point-counterpoint narrative. In the point narrative below, Dr. Butler and colleagues provide their opinion and review of the data to date and that we need to reconsider the use of incretin-based therapies because of the growing concern of potential risk and based on a clearer understanding of the mechanism of action. In the counterpoint narrative following the contribution by Dr. Butler and colleagues, Dr. Nauck provides a defense of incretin-based therapies and that the benefits clearly outweigh any concern of risk.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114oYh8v]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis shows that: (1) overall, there is no evidence to indicate increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with incretin-based treatment in patients with T2DM; (2) there was lower incidence of pancreatic neoplasm in incretin-based groups than those in placebo or non-incretin-based anti-diabetic drugs in studies with study period longer than 104 weeks; (3) also, decreased risk of pancreatic cancer was identified among intervention studies controlled by incretin-matched placebos than those paralleled with non-incretin-based anti-diabetic drugs; (4) incretin-based drugs used as either monotherapy or combination regimen did not increase risk of pancreatic cancer as compared to non-incretin-based anti-diabetic drugs or placebo.

At present, several meta-analyses have been carried out with regards to the safety of incretin-based therapy. It is reported that incretin-based drugs are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, acute pancreatitis and several types of neoplasm. However, some meta-analyses had only focused on evaluation of a single drug classified within the incretin drug category. As for pancreatic safety, most of the meta-analyses have just provided combined data of the risk of acute pancreatitis with incretin therapies. Few meta-analysis specially investigated the association regarding the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Although one meta-analysis investigated such association, it only included two single drugs (exenatide and liraglutide). Here, we tried to comprehensively analyze all the incretin-related drugs together for the first time, including both GLP-1RAs and DPP-IV inhibitors.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: are the GLP-1 therapies safe? [^1111m7Ja]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of pancreatic cancer, as of pancreatitis, is increased in type 2 diabetes. Work over the past decade has established that premalignant changes known as pancreatic intraepithelial (PanIN) lesions precede and predict the onset of pancreatic cancer. PanINs are present in up to 50% of the middle-aged population, although relatively few actually progress to cancer. Both PanINs and pancreatic cancer express the GLP-1 receptor in humans. Since progression of PanINs to pancreatic cancer is via the accumulation of additional somatic mutations, any driver of increased cellular replication in PanINs is likely to increase that probability. This theoretical risk was illustrated by the progression of PanINs in the exenatide-treated Kras G12D mouse model. It is worth noting here that such a potential link between GLP-1 therapy and risk for pancreatic cancer is analogous to estrogen therapy and breast cancer. Estrogen does not initiate breast cancer, but in individuals with premalignant dysplastic ductal changes that bear estrogen receptors, estrogen accelerates growth and malignant conversion in some individuals. Likewise, the very high concentration of insulin delivered to the bronchial tree with inhaled insulin was associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer. Are estrogen, insulin, or GLP-1 carcinogens? No, but all three can serve as growth factors, and when pharmacological stimulation of growth is imposed on dysplastic lesions, accelerated declaration of cancer is not unexpected.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116T5ALW]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

The overall results indicated in our study were consistent with the latest FDA and EMA database assessment of pancreatic safety. Irrespective of different types of incretin-based drugs, there was no evidence of increased risk of pancreatic neoplasm associated with incretin-based treatment. This result is consistent with human and animal studies performed by the pharmaceutical companies.

Although several observational studies have shown an increased risk of pancreatic cancer with incretin-based drugs, these data need to be reevaluated due to the potential mechanistic questions. Some adjusting methods had been applied in order to reduce the confounding factors, but it is still difficult to measure such large data by a reliable methodology on the estimated population. Additionally, the association between diabetes mellitus itself and pancreatic cancer is also very complicated as the long-duration of T2DM is considered a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the results of observational studies need to be interpreted with caution.

### Do GLP-1-based therapies increase cancer risk? [^113w6Lfq]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cases of pancreatitis have been described in connection with the use of exenatide, liraglutide and other glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists. From these findings, the following hypothesis has been generated: stimulating the GLP-1 receptor with respective agonists has a potential to cause pancreatitis, perhaps chronic pancreatitis, and in the long term, potentially even pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, in rodents like mice and rats, stimulating the GLP-1 receptor raises cAMP in thyroid C cells, initiates the release of calcitonin, and upon longer-term exposure, is accompanied by C-cell proliferation and the formation of C-cell adenomas and (medullary thyroid) carcinomas. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that GLP-1–derived medications have a potential to cause medullary thyroid carcinoma in humans as well. It is the purpose of the current review to discuss the evidence in favor and against the hypothesis that GLP-1–based therapies increase cancer risk, specifically the risk for pancreatic and thyroid carcinomas in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide and sitagliptin.

### Will GLP-1 agonists weaken the links between obesity and cancer? [^114gJ8C5]. Cancer Discovery (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists hold great promise to reverse some cancer risk in people living with obesity, and emerging clinical trials support this so far. However, some preclinical work and caveats from human studies highlight that more work is needed to understand the mechanisms and full potential of antiobesity medicines in cancer.

### GLP-1-based therapy for diabetes: what you do not know can hurt you [^116MMap3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

While low-grade asymptomatic pancreatitis in and of itself as a result of GLP-1–based therapy would not be a cause for major concern, the problem is that it represents a risk for pancreatic cancer. The risk for developing pancreatic cancer increases with the duration of chronic pancreatitis. Because medications for type 2 diabetes may be taken for many years, if GLP-1–based therapy did induce low-grade asymptomatic pancreatitis, there is a real concern that such a therapy might increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. Even if this is a relatively small risk (which we do not know), how many of us practicing physicians would choose a therapeutic strategy for ourselves with insight into the potential for this risk? Since metformin has been shown to decrease the risk of pancreatic cancer, at the least we would suggest that GLP-1–based medications should be reserved for patients taking metformin.

In conclusion, we believe it is premature to conclude that the GLP-1 class of drugs has been established as having a good safety profile and is appropriate for a relatively early choice of therapy for type 2 diabetes. There are grounds for concern that the GLP-1 class of drugs may induce asymptomatic pancreatitis and, over time in some individuals, induce pancreatic cancer. At present, these concerns are based on limited data. However, the implications of the data are sufficiently serious that continuing to promote this class of drugs without establishing clear experimental evidence to permit the concern to be rejected is irresponsible. Moreover, arguably patients prescribed these drugs should be made aware of the potential risks of pancreatic cancer. Otherwise, we collectively subscribe to the proverb "What you do not know cannot hurt you" and, in the case of new drug therapy, this proverb has already been shown to be flawed.

### The safety and tolerability of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a review [^114e6eoT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Although several classes of pharmacotherapy are available for type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control is often hampered by medication-related adverse effects and contraindications such as renal impairment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists provide a new pharmacotherapeutic option based on the multiple glucose-lowering effects of the human hormone GLP-1. This mechanism of action not only provides therapeutic efficacy but also suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists have distinct safety and tolerability concerns compared with other diabetes therapies. Stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion by GLP-1 receptor agonists is glucose dependent, conferring a lesser risk of hypoglycaemia than that seen with sulfonylureas. Individual GLP-1 receptor agonists differ in their metabolism and excretion profiles, affecting the choice of agent for patients with renal impairment. As with other protein-based therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists may induce the formation of antibodies that may attenuate therapeutic efficacy and affect safety. Conclusions on cardiovascular safety must await outcomes studies, but at present no signal of harm has been reported, and preclinical data and effects on risk markers suggest a potential for benefit. Current data on thyroid medullary cancer in humans and pancreatic malignancy in rodents do not suggest that there is any reason to restrict the clinical use of GLP-1 analogues in most people with diabetes. It is currently difficult to ascertain the possible contributory role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in increasing the risk of pancreatitis, and vigilance for signs and symptoms is prudent. Primary tolerability issues include transient gastrointestinal symptoms, common with GLP-1 receptor agonists, which can be reduced through dose titration.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^116fMwrt]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large population based study we investigated the association between the use of incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer. The findings of this study, comprising a combined cohort of almost one million people with type 2 diabetes, suggest that use of incretin based drugs is not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared with use of sulfonylureas. These results remained consistent in several secondary and sensitivity analyses, which considered type of incretin based drugs and duration of use.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and pancreatic cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112UnuQ8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

As we included follow-up information from 2009 onwards (the year GLP-1RA first became available in Israel), patients who received diabetes diagnoses before 2007 entered follow-up later than at the time origin (2 years after diabetes diagnosis). To accommodate this delayed entry, we followed the method of Lamarca et al. For details, see eAppendix 3 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1.

Since physicians selectively prescribe GLP-1RA or basal insulin to patients with specific characteristics, introducing selection bias in the GLP-1RA and basal insulin treated groups, we adjusted the models for several potentially important confounders. We adjusted for history of pancreatitis (as a time-dependent covariate) diagnosed before taking the specified medications but not pancreatitis occurring after initiation of GLP-1RA or basal insulin, since the latter is not a confounder. Other confounder variables adjusted for included age in 5 groups (21–50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, and 81–90 years), sex, ethnicity, sociodemographic status (low, medium, high, or missing), smoking history (never or missing, past, and current), BMI at baseline (< 25, 25–29.9, ≥ 30, or missing; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and history of other GLMs using the same 3 time windows as used with GLP-1RA and basal insulin. Defining time since diabetes diagnosis as the time scale (Figure, B) automatically adjusted for any confounding due to length of diabetes.

In our analyses, we also adjusted for potential bias due to another type of reverse-causation, whereby yet undiagnosed pancreatic cancer may cause disturbance of glucose metabolism, leading to higher glucose and HbA 1c levels, thus inducing prescription of GLP-1RA or basal insulin as an intensification second-line treatment. If present, this phenomenon is expected to operate during the year preceding diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and possibly in the second to fourth years back. To mitigate this effect, we conducted analyses that excluded from the Cox models the variables for GLM treatments in the previous year (see eFigure 2 in Supplement 1) or both the previous year and the second to fourth years back.

Sensitivity analyses using a propensity score–matched new-user design and prevalent new-user designwere also conducted to compare pancreatic cancer risk among GLP-1RA users vs basal insulin users. The methods are described in eAppendix 4 in Supplement 1.

### Incretin mimetics and acute pancreatitis: enemy or innocent bystander? [^114WhTKm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incretin enhancers and mimetics, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and GLP-1/GIP co-agonists, have become mainstays in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, the approval of certain GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIP co-agonists for the treatment of obesity has broadened their popularity and use. In this review, we summarize the evidence for an association of these drugs with acute pancreatitis and other adverse events of special interest to gastroenterologists.

Recent Findings

In addition to pancreatic islets, GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the exocrine cells of the pancreas. There is inconsistent evidence for an association of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RA and co-agonists with risk for acute pancreatitis in individual trials. Meta-analyses of long-term randomized controlled trials indicate a small risk of acute pancreatitis associated with DPP-4 inhibitors but not GLP-1RA or co-agonists. Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis may be more common among those treated with GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIP co-agonists. There is no evidence that any of these drugs are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

Summary

While drugs that leverage the incretin system are increasingly being used for patients with T2D and obesity, caution in warranted in those with a history of pancreatitis and gallbladder disease.

Other Antidiabetic Therapies: Injectable

It has been suggested that some GLP-1 based therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, could increase the risk of pancreatitis, with a number of cases being reported in the literature. In response to these case reports, analyses have been published in the literature examining the currently available data on incretin drugs. These analyses have reported conflicting results and there is no clear evidence that either DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with an increased risk for any pancreatic disorder; prospective long-term studies are needed to properly quantify these risks. A number of these analyses are discussed below.

A study investigating GLP-1 based drugs that analysed the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) adverse event data reported a sixfold increased risk of pancreatic cancer, as well as an increased risk of thyroid cancer, in people treated with exenatide or sitagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor). The FDA, however, has stated that its adverse event data cannot be used to reliably and accurately determine the incidence of an adverse event and conflicting results have been observed in other studies, including preclinical data in animal models.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^116BZwT9]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether the use of incretin based drugs compared with sulfonylureas is associated with an increased risk of incident pancreatic cancer in people with type 2 diabetes.

Design Population based cohort.

Setting Large, international, multicentre study combining the health records from six participating sites in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Participants A cohort of 972 384 patients initiating antidiabetic drugs between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2013, with follow-up until 30 June 2014.

Main outcome measures Within each cohort we conducted nested case-control analyses, where incident cases of pancreatic cancer were matched with up to 20 controls on sex, age, cohort entry date, duration of treated diabetes, and duration of follow-up. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident pancreatic cancer were estimated, comparing use of incretin based drugs with use of sulfonylureas, with drug use lagged by one year for latency purposes. Secondary analyses assessed whether the risk varied by class (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) or by duration of use (cumulative duration of use and time since treatment initiation). Site specific hazard ratios were pooled using random effects models.

Results During 2 024 441 person years of follow-up (median follow-up ranging from 1.3 to 2.8 years; maximum 8 years), 1221 patients were newly diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer (incidence rate 0.60 per 1000 person years). Compared with sulfonylureas, incretin based drugs were not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.23). Similarly, the risk did not vary by class and evidence of a duration-response relation was lacking.

Conclusions In this large, population based study the use of incretin based drugs was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared with sulfonylureas. Although this potential adverse drug reaction will need to be monitored long term owing to the latency of the cancer, these findings provide some reassurance on the safety of incretin based drugs.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113nCsQp]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The present study aims to evaluate the risk of pancreatic cancer with incretin-based therapy among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov for eligible studies published up to March 06 2016. This meta-analysis includes all studies reporting adverse events of pancreatic cancer with use of incretin-based therapies compared with placebo or non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs in patients with T2DM. We used fixed-effect model to compare pooled relative risk (RR) with related 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

A total of 159 randomized trials were identified. Out of these, 135 studies were excluded as pancreatic cancer occurrence had not been included as an end point. The remaining 24 trials enrolling 47,904 participants were further assessed. Overall, no increased risk of pancreatic cancer were detected in association with incretin-based treatment (RR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.37–1.05). The incidence of pancreatic neoplasm was even lower among incretin-based groups than controls (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.87) in trials with duration more than 104 weeks. There was even decreased risk of pancreatic cancer within groups paralleled by incretin-matched placebos (RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32–0.93) than by non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs. Neither monotherapy (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.38–1.01) nor combination regimen (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.45–1.90) of incretin mimetics increased the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis shows that incretin-based therapies are not associated with increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, subgroup analyses suggested lower risk of pancreatic cancer in incretin groups than placebo in long-term studies (> 104 weeks). Considering the inconsistent results among randomized trials and previous epidemiological investigations, more such studies should be conducted to clarify the existence or non-existence of this association.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists with cancer risk in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^115roCeQ]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The real-world evidence on the association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and cancer risk remains limited and mixed.

Methods

In 2013–2020 national Medicare claims data, we included cancer-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We identified those who initiated GLP-1 RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) and conducted 1:1 propensity score matching for confounding adjustment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of nine obesity-associated cancers (thyroid, pancreatic, bladder, colorectal, lung, kidney, breast, endometrial, and prostate cancer).

Results

In the matched GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i cohort (n = 21,362 pairs), GLP-1RA users had similar overall cancer risk with SGLT2i users (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.95–1.12]), but GLP-1RAs were associated with an increased kidney cancer risk (HR, 1.43 [1.06–1.92]). In the matched GLP-1RA versus DPP4i cohort (n = 20,962 pairs), the GLP-1RA versus DPP4i comparison showed no significant difference in overall cancer risk (HR, 0.96 [0.89–1.04]) but revealed a significantly elevated endometrial cancer risk (HR, 1.55 [1.01–2.37]).

Conclusion

GLP-1RAs might be associated with an increased risk of certain cancer types. Future studies are needed to validate the potential tumorigenic risk associated with GLP1-RAs.

### Safety issues with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and cholelithiasis): data from randomized controlled trials [^113jjdAs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Prior meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials failed to show any significant increase of risk; however, those meta-analyses did not include the recently published cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT) with GLP1-RA, which provide a substantial additional body of data. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to assess the effect of GLP1-RA on pancreatitis, pancreatic cancers and cholelithiasis.

Materials and Methods

A Medline search for GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, albiglutide, dulaglutide or semaglutide) was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials with a duration > 11weeks, enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes and comparing a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo or any other non-GLP-1 receptor agonist drug.

Results

Of the 113 trials fulfilling inclusion criteria, 13 did not report information on pancreatitis, whereas 72 reported no events in all treatment groups. The incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with GLP1-RA was not significantly different from that observed in comparator arms (MH-OR [95% CI] 0.93 [0.65–1.34], P = 0.71, and 0.94 [0.52–1.70], P = 0.84, respectively), whereas, a significantly increased risk of cholelithiasis (MH-OR [95% CI] 1.30 [1.01–1.68], P = 0.041) was detected.

Conclusions

Presently available data confirm the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists for pancreatitis. Conversely, therapy with those drugs is associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis, which deserves further investigation.

### A prospective, claims-based assessment of the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide compared to other antidiabetic drugs [^111cvqEz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Liraglutide is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Before FDA approval, we initiated a prospective surveillance programme to evaluate potential adverse effects of liraglutide in the United States. Thyroid cancer is the primary endpoint; however, acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer are evaluated in the programme. Recent publications have questioned the pancreatic safety of other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs)–, thus we performed this interim analysis on acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide.

2.2 Article Selection Process

The Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time (PICOT) methodology was utilised to guide article selection. The patient population and intervention encompassed patients of any age taking a GLP‐1 RA. As all studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparisons with active comparators or placebo were included. The main outcomes assessed were rates of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among different agents within the GLP‐1 RA class. Studies with a minimum follow‐up of 1 week were included. The following inclusion criteria were utilised: (1) RCTs with patients taking GLP‐1 RAs; (2) active GLP‐1 RAs or discontinued GLP‐1 RAs (e.g. albiglutide) that were compared against another active GLP‐1 RA; (3) reported on adverse events (AEs) with a focus on pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Although we excluded studies that compared albiglutide or lixisenatide against placebo, we included studies that compared those agonists against other GLP‐1 RAs. These head‐to‐head trials were retained to provide comparative safety data for the active GLP‐1 RAs that are still in use, which remain clinically relevant for clinicians and patients. Exclusion criteria consisted of studies that did not meet the three inclusion criteria, discontinued GLP‐1 RAs (e.g. albiglutide) when compared against placebo, or if they were study designs such as non‐RCTs, case reports, review articles, expert opinions, abstracts, commentaries, animal studies, and studies not in English. This systematic review protocol is registered with PROSPERO as CRD42024550993.

Two independent authors participated in the title/abstract and full‐text screening of each article to determine study eligibility for inclusion. If there was a discrepancy between authors, the lead author (J.W.) reviewed the article for final study eligibility. Upon completion of full‐text screening, a rigorous reference search was performed for the included studies to assess for further studies to add to this review.

Results

Description of Studies

The initial search identified a total of 5823 studies: 5549 from MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL database and 274 from Clinicaltrial.gov. Of these, 4987 records were excluded due to irrelevant topics. 462 full-text articles and 274 clinical trials were assessed for eligibility. After excluding non-randomized and observational studies, studies with non-T2DM patients and studies with no interest of outcome, we identified 159 RCT (Fig. 1). Of these, 135 did not disclose their results or did not report any adverse events of pancreatic cancer (supplement table). The remaining 24 trials enrolling 47,904 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The study characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A total of 24,462 patients had received incretin-based regimens while 23,434 had received placebo or other non-incretin-based treatments such as metformin or glimepiride.

Risk of Bias Assessment

The assessed quality of publication was of medium- to high-quality evidence and two studies (NCT01064687 and Jadzinsky 2009) had high risk of bias as these two studies had reported incomplete data (Fig. 2 a, b). Begg's funnel plot (P = 0.309) suggests no evidence of heterogeneity (Fig. 3). However, Egger's test (P = 0.019) and Harbord's modified test (P = 0.038) indicates potential heterogeneity across the studies.

2.5 Data analysis and quality assessment

Two of the investigators (G. A.S. and C.M.) assessed the risk of bias in RCTs using the revised Cochrane recommended tool, which includes five specific domains: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) bias due to deviations from intended interventions; (3) bias due to missing outcome data; (4) bias in the measurement of the outcome; (5) bias in the selection of the reported result.

The results of these domains were graded as 'low' risk of bias, 'high' risk of bias or 'uncertain' risk of bias. The aim was to assess the effect of assignment to intervention (the 'intention‐to‐treat' effect). For domains 3, 4, 5, the present meta‐analysis's primary endpoint, that is, the incidence of malignancies, was considered as the outcome of interest. For each domain all the 'signalling questions' comprised in the tool were addressed, a judgement about risk of bias for the domain was made, as well as an overall risk of bias judgement for the study. Conflicts between the judgements of the two investigators were resolved by a third investigator (MM).

### GLP-1 single, dual, and triple receptor agonists for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity: a narrative review [^1125WNm6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer

Amongst those with T2DM, findings from meta-analyses of the CVOTs suggest no increased risk of either disorder with use of individual GLP-1 RAs or the medications as a class. However, in a population using GLP-1 RAs for obesity management without history of diabetes, increased risk of pancreatitis associated with the GLP-1 RAs was found compared to bupropion-naltrexone (HR 9.1, 95%CI 1.25–66.0) suggesting the risk benefit ratio of these medications is influenced by underlying disease state. Studies evaluating the potential risk from dual and triple agonists are needed.

Thyroid disorders and thyroid cancer

The relationship between risk of thyroid cancer and use of GLP-1 RAs is not well understood and the mechanisms promoting potential unfavorable effects of the drug on the thyroid is not well defined. When specific GLP-1 RAs were evaluated compared to placebo and other antidiabetic drugs, liraglutide was found to increase risk of thyroid disorders by 37% and dulaglutide in similar comparisons increased risk by 96%. No effects on risk were noted for semaglutide, lixisenatide, exenatide, nor albiglutide in which relative risks were not significant. During its meeting in October 2023, The European Medical Association (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluded that the available evidence does not support a causal association between the GLP-1RA)–exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide–and cancer of the thyroid.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: the benefits by far outweigh the potential risks [^111DCHkw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is no question that incretin-based glucose-lowering medications have proven to be effective glucose-lowering agents. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment and appear to do so with significant effects to promote weight loss with minimal hypoglycemia. In addition, there are significant data with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showing efficacy comparable to sulfonylureas but with weight neutral effects and reduced risk for hypoglycemia. However, over the recent past there have been concerns regarding the long-term consequences of using such therapies, and the issues raised are in regard to the potential of both classes to promote acute pancreatitis, to initiate histological changes suggesting chronic pancreatitis including associated preneoplastic lesions, and potentially, in the long run, pancreatic cancer. Other issues relate to an increase in thyroid cancer. There are clearly conflicting data that have been presented in preclinical studies and in epidemiologic studies. To provide an understanding of both sides of the argument, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part point-counterpoint narrative. In the point narrative preceding the counterpoint narrative below, Dr. Butler and colleagues provide their opinion and review of the data to date and that we need to reconsider use of incretin-based therapies because of the growing concern of potential risk and based on a clearer understanding of the mechanism of action. In the counterpoint narrative provided below, Dr. Nauck provides a defense of incretin-based therapies and that benefits clearly outweigh any concern of risk.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114k1vHV]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

In our study, the total incidence of pancreatic cancers was very low (1.59‰), resulting in the widening of 95% CIs. This may indicate the possibility of underestimated events. Actually, in all 24 included studies, most of them were phase III trials, thus these might have been designed for evaluating the pharmacological efficacy of drugs rather than safety concerns. Consequently, some adverse events possibly remain unreported. Additionally, we found decreased risk of pancreatic cancer within intervention groups controlled by incretin-matched placebos compared to those using non-incretin-based anti-diabetic drugs such as insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Within the seven trials with incretin-matched placebos, four were recent large RCTs including SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial (NCT00790205) and EXAMINE trial (NCT00968708). Given the long-term follow-up surveillance and large-scale of population, the pooled results may be more convincing. However, these four studies had mainly focused on investigating cardiovascular events associated with incretin-based drugs. Hence, we could not exclude the possibility of selection bias and pancreatic cancer events going unreported.

Strengths and Limitations

Our meta-analysis has several strengthens. This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to assess all types of incretin-based therapies. Specific types of GLP-1 receptors (albiglutide, exenatide, liraglutide) and DPP-IV inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, linagliptin) approved by both FDA and EMA were included. We also used the ClinicalTrials.gov search engine as one important resource of RCTs. In addition, we conducted several subgroup analyses in order to reduce potential heterogeneity among different RCTs. Furthermore, we identified eight observational studies investigating the relationship of pancreatic cancer and incretin-based therapy, however, we finally included RCTs only as some of these observational studies have inherent bias and confounding by indication and should not be added to trials that are internally randomized. In addition, there are no specific diagnostic criteria of pancreatic cancer among all eligible RCTs, which should also be a limitation in our study. It is reported that the risk of pancreatic cancer includes both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, but we were unable to analyze the incidence of both types due to limited information of tumor classification provided by RCTs.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with bariatric metabolic surgery and the risk of obesity-related cancer: an observational, retrospective cohort study [^112wGGTH]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A substantial body of evidence demonstrated the association between obesity and different types of cancer. In view of the magnitude of this association, in the United States obesity was considered to be the major preventable cause of cancer.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer, classified specific cancer sites and types as having sufficient strength of evidence for the preventive effects of weight control on cancer risk, further termed obesity-related cancer (ORC).

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is also an established risk factor for certain cancers. Epidemiological studies indicated an association between T2DM and the risk for overall cancer incidence, several site-specific cancers, and cancer-associated mortality. Moreover, causal detrimental effects of T2DM on several cancers were demonstrated by a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.

Both bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS) and treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are offered to patients with obesity and diabetes.

BMS is well established for the treatment of severe obesity. Furthermore, BMS was demonstrated to be associated with lower incidence of ORC in a number of long-term studies and meta-analyses, with an effectiveness estimated at 32%–45%. However, less is known regarding the cancer-preventive effects of obesity pharmacotherapy. Due to the efficacy of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class of pharmaceuticals in controlling T2DM, obesity, and related comorbidities, GLP1-RA might also reduce the risk for ORC. This was demonstrated in a recent comparison of patients treated with GLP1-RAs to patients who received insulin, with regard to esophageal, colorectal, endometrial, gallbladder, kidney, liver, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer, meningioma and multiple myeloma.

Despite the above evidence, the comparative effectiveness of BMS and GLP1-RAs in reducing the incidence of ORC is unknown. Therefore, our objective was to compare the incidence of ORC in adults living with obesity and diabetes who were treated with BMS or first-generation GLP-1RA.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^112ThVp3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4.4 Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer

A meta‐analysis of 11 cardiovascular outcome trials involving patients with T2D starting GLP‐1RA drugs found no materially elevated risk of acute pancreatitis (rate ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.78–1.41) or pancreatic cancer (rate ratio 1.14 [0.77–1.70]). Another meta‐analysis of 43 RCTs of different GLP‐1RAs for T2D found an OR of 1.24 (0.94–1.64) for pancreatitis and OR 1.28 (0.87–1.89) for pancreatic cancer. The absence of any strong association with pancreatitis for GLP‐1RAs has been corroborated by numerous large real‐world observational studies of patients with T2D already a decade ago. Newer registry‐based T2D cohort studies have suggested a decreased risk of most obesity‐associated cancers in patients with T2D using GLP‐1RA, including decreased risks of pancreatic cancer among a US study (HR 0.41, 0.33–0.50)and Israel (HR 0.50, 0.15–1.71).

### The safety of incretin-based therapies – review of the scientific evidence [^111ofQHL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Antidiabetic therapies based on potentiation of incretin action are now widely used; however, understanding of their long-term safety remains incomplete.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched articles in PubMed for data assessing the safety of incretin-based therapies.

Evidence Synthesis

Three major areas of interest are reviewed: incretin action in the cardiovascular system, pancreatitis, and cancer. Incretin therapies reduce weight gain, minimize hypoglycemia, decrease inflammation, and are cardioprotective in preclinical studies. However, data permitting conclusions about whether incretin therapies modify the development of cardiovascular events in humans are not available. Case reports link incretin therapies to pancreatitis, but retrospective case control studies do not associate pancreatitis with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Preclinical studies of pancreatitis have yielded conflicting results, and mechanisms linking incretin receptor activation to pancreatic inflammation have not yet been forthcoming. GLP-1R activation promotes C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer in rodents; however, long-term clinical studies of sufficient size and duration to permit conclusions regarding cancer and incretin therapeutics have not yet been completed.

Conclusions

The available data on incretin action and incidence of cardiovascular events, pancreatitis, or cancer are not yet sufficient or robust enough to permit firm conclusions regarding associations with incretin-based therapies in humans with diabetes. The forthcoming results of long-term cardiovascular safety studies should provide more conclusive information about the safety of GLP-1R agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in diabetic patients.

### Comparative risk of adverse pancreatic events with GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas among adults with type 2 diabetes at moderate cardiovascular disease risk [^116j39v3]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evidence on acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [GLP-1RA] and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP-4i] therapy is mixed and no studies examined this risk directly across all commonly used classes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) medications, particularly sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and sulfonylureas.

Methods

De-identified claims data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse and fee-for-service Medicare were used to emulate a target trial examining the risks of incident acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among adults with T2D and moderate cardiovascular risk. Propensity scores (estimated using the SuperLearner ensemble method) and inverse probability of treatment weighting emulated random treatment assignment to GLP-1RA, DPP-4i, SGLT2i, or sulfonylurea.

Results

The weighted study cohort included 388,262 patients starting GLP-1RA (N = 44,084), DPP-4i (N = 82,079), SGLT2i (N = 56,463), or a sulfonylurea (N = 205,636). SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of acute pancreatitis compared to DPP-4i (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68–0.98). Conversely, sulfonylurea was associated with higher risk compared to GLP-1RA (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.03–1.56) and SGLT2i (HR 1.32; 95% CI 1.12–1.57). There was no difference in acute pancreatitis risk between GLP-1RA and DPP-4i or GLP-1RA and SGLT2i. The risk of pancreatic cancer was lower with GLP-1RA compared to DPP-4i (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40–0.77). In contrast, risk was higher with SGLT2i and sulfonylurea compared to GLP-1RA (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.12–2.49 and HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.17–2.19, respectively).

Conclusion

GLP-1RA and DPP-4i therapy was not associated with increased risk of adverse pancreatic events. The lower risk of acute pancreatitis with SGLT2i therapy warrants further exploration.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112XCXi1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

The initial search yielded 6671 articles from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The articles were screened for duplicates and subsequently underwent title/abstract screening and full‐text review, which yielded 62 studies to be included in this systematic review. The screening process is further detailed in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
PRISMA Diagram of the included studies.

3.1 Demographic Data

Across the 62 studies, there were a total of 66,232 patients (34,941 male/32,291 female) with a mean age of 58.3 years (14.4 to 68.0), mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years (1.5 to 21.6), mean body mass index (BMI) of 32.6 kg/m² (24.4 to 46.2), and mean follow‐up of 43.5 weeks (1 week to 198 weeks). (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Patient demographics.

The systematic review includes 62 RCTs comparing various GLP‐1 RAs, including various dosages of dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, and tirzepatide. The review also divides studies between those that included patients who continued background medications to maintain glycaemic control and those that did not use background medications. These medications included any combination of metformin, sulfonylureas, insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, Sodium‐Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT‐2i), and other background anti‐diabetic medication except GLP‐1 RAs.

3.2 Study Characteristics

Across the seven domains, most studies were low risk of bias for sequence generation (50/62), incomplete outcome data (54/62), selective outcome reporting (60/62), and other sources of bias (33/62). However, allocation concealment had a substantial amount of unclear ranking (29/62), and high risks of bias were found for blinding of participants/personnel (20/62) as well as blinding of outcomes (23/62). These results are depicted in Tables S1 and S2.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: the benefits by far outweigh the potential risks [^116PNNq7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)–based medications are GLP-1 receptor agonists (incretin mimetics) and inhibitors of the incretin-degrading and incretin-inactivating protease dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which exclusively (GLP-1 receptor agonists) or predominantly (DPP-4 inhibitors) act by enhancing the stimulation of GLP-1 receptors. Their mechanisms of action and clinical effects have been reviewed extensively. With a lot of scientific data relevant to the judgment of these novel medications having accumulated over the past 6 years and the clinical experience of using them in patients with type 2 diabetes, this is a good moment in time to attempt a more general evaluation of the merits and risks associated with incretin-based medications. Such a judgment will have to take into account the core clinical effectiveness (control of glycemia, prevention of diabetes complications), additional effects that are or could be beneficial in type 2 diabetic patients (improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, e.g. weight loss and reductions in blood pressure), aspects of tolerability and safety, and costs. Among the critical issues that have been raised against the use of GLP-1–based medications are their potential role as inducers of acute pancreatitis — perhaps of chronic pancreatitis — and in the long run promoting the development of preneoplastic lesions and thus raising the risk for pancreatic cancer. Rodent studies with longer-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists have raised the issue of a potential proliferative response of thyroid C-cells, giving rise to hyperplasia, adenomas, and, eventually, medullary thyroid carcinomas. Another point of concern is a small rise in pulse rate observed with some GLP-1 receptor agonists (but not with DPP-4 inhibitors). In the point article of this point–counterpoint narrative that precedes this article, Butler et al. cite their significant concerns with these adverse events and make a statement that continued human use may be problematic. With those stated concerns, this counterpoint narrative will discuss the current status of the incretin-based therapies and provide an opinion that the clinical benefits are clearly greater than the potential risks based on the evidence to date.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^1129KsLb]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Our study was specifically designed to circumvent the methodological limitations of the aforementioned observational studiesand randomised controlled trials. Firstly, the use of population based cohorts from six participating sites across three countries strengthens the generalisability of our findings. Secondly, with an overall sample size of close to one million patients followed for up to eight years, our primary analysis was well powered to detect modest but clinically important associations. Thirdly, all patients entering the base and study cohorts were new users of antidiabetic drugs, thus avoiding biases related to the inclusion of prevalent users. Fourthly, confounding by indication was minimised through matching, statistical adjustment, and by comparing users of incretin based drugs with users of sulfonylureas, a drug class sharing similar indications. Finally, latency and protopathic bias were addressed by excluding all exposures initiated in the year before the index date; findings were generally consistent in sensitivity analyses in which the duration of the lag period was varied.

### A prospective, claims-based assessment of the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide compared to other antidiabetic drugs [^111NU95s]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Table 1
Association between liraglutide and treatment-emergent primary inpatient * acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer relative to other specific comparator drugs, and pooled comparator drugs † – intention to treat

The median time between drug initiation and initial diagnosis for pancreatic cancer was 270 days across all drugs; 22% of the diagnoses were within the first 90 days. Initiators of liraglutide or exenatide had no early diagnoses, while 7–28% of cancer diagnoses among comparators were within the first 90 days following initiation. Accordingly, in a separate analysis, we excluded diagnoses during the first 90 days of follow-up. The IR among liraglutide initiators remained the same (19.9/100 000 person-years) and for pooled comparators reduced to 25.2/100 000 person-years. The adjusted RR was 0.82 (95% CI 0.33–2.05), with adjusted RRs for individual comparators ranging from 0.52 to 1.06, and none approaching statistical significance.

The relationship between obesity and cancer is similarly profound. It is estimated that up to 20% of malignancies may be attributed to obesity. A comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship between increasing BMI and elevated cancer risk. Higher BMI was associated with greater incidence of brain, kidney, endometrial, ovarian, liver, and colorectal cancers. Obesity is linked to worse cancer outcomes, including higher cancer mortality and recurrence rates in breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective agents for glycemic control and weight loss in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with demonstrated cardiovascular benefits. However, early concerns about potential associations with pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms led to caution in their long-term use. Reassuringly, a recent large cohort study of over 1.6 million patients with type 2 diabetes found that GLP-1 receptor agonist use was associated with significantly lower risk of 10 out of 13 obesity-associated cancers compared with insulin. This included reductions in pancreatic cancer (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.33–0.50), colorectal cancer (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.46–0.64), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36–0.61). These findings parallel cancer risk reductions seen with bariatric surgery, suggesting that weight loss or metabolic effects may drive the benefit, although a drug-specific effect cannot be excluded.

### Incretin-based glucose-lowering medications and the risk of acute pancreatitis and malignancies: a meta-analysis based on cardiovascular outcomes trials [^115rtPUe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Some epidemiological data have suggested an elevated risk of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer after exposure to glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors. Recently, such outcomes have been assessed and adjudicated as adverse events of special interest in cardiovascular outcomes studies. We performed a meta-analysis of cases of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer as well as any malignant neoplasm reported in cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) with GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. The numbers of cases observed with active drug or placebo (both on a background of standard care) were related to patient-years of observation. Rate ratios and their confidence intervals were calculated for the individual agents as well as for the classes of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. Neither data on individual CVOTs of GLP-1 receptor agonists nor their meta-analysis [rate ratio: 1.05 (0.78–1.41)] indicated a significantly elevated risk of acute pancreatitis. All individual DPP-4 inhibitors displayed a non-significant trend towards an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, which was significant in the meta-analysis [1.75 (1.14–2.70); P = 0.01]. Neither GLP-1 receptor agonists nor DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with a significantly elevated or reduced risk of pancreatic cancer or for the totality of all malignant neoplasms. Based on a large database of randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective cardiovascular outcomes studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, no signal for pancreatic cancer or any malignant neoplasms were detected. However, a 75% risk increase for the development of an acute pancreatitis was seen in the meta-analysis of DPP-4 inhibitor CVOTs.

### The ascending GLP-1 road from clinical safety to reduction of cardiovascular complications [^115J3zLw]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was originally identified as a gut-derived incretin hormone that lowered glycemia through potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Subsequent studies expanded the actions of GLP-1 to include inhibition of glucagon secretion, gastric emptying, and appetite, collectively useful attributes for a glucose-lowering agent. The introduction of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of diabetes was associated with questions surrounding their safety, principally with regard to medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, yet cardiovascular outcome trials subsequently revealed reductions in rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death with a paucity of major safety signals. We discuss the controversies, unanswered questions, and established use of GLP-1R agonists from a mechanistic and clinical perspective. We highlight methods for detection and cellular sites of GLP-1R expression, key uncertainties, recent insights, and experimental caveats surrounding the use of GLP-1R agonists for the treatment of diabetes and the reduction of diabetes-related complications.

¶Non-mutually exclusive categories.

Overall, compared with users of sulfonylureas users of incretin based drugs were younger, had longer durations of treated diabetes, were more likely to be obese, and had higher haemoglobin A1c levels. In contrast, users of incretin based drugs were less likely to have been diagnosed as having microvascular complications of diabetes. Both groups had similar histories of pancreatitis (see supplementary table 3).

Table 2presents the results of the primary and secondary analyses. Compared with use of sulfonylureas, use of incretin based drugs was not associated with an increased risk of incident pancreatic cancer (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.23; fig 2). Similarly, there was no association in the secondary analysis, which categorised the use of incretin based drugs by class (DPP-4 inhibitors, 1.02, 0.84 to 1.24; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, 1.13, 0.38 to 3.38). In other secondary analyses, a cumulative duration of less than one year yielded an increased but non-significant pooled hazard ratio (1.53, 0.93 to 2.51), whereas longer durations of use generated pooled hazard ratios close to or below unity (1–1.9 years, 1.07, 0.82 to 1.39; ≥ 2 years, 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07). The analysis of time since initiation yielded pooled hazard ratios close to the null (1–1.9 years, 1.06, 0.86 to 1.31; ≥ 2 years, 0.93, 0.60 to 1.45). Similar findings were observed with each class of incretin based drug (see supplementary figures 1–17).

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: are the GLP-1 therapies safe? [^114xK2vM]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Regulatory authorities have expressed concerns about the potential risk of acute pancreatitis, thyroid cancer, and renal failure with some or all of the GLP-1–based therapies, warnings that are (as appropriate) conveyed in every pack that is handed to a patient. These concerns are however largely discounted by the manufacturers and those representing their views to physicians, who typically maintain that the risk of pancreatic inflammation is illusory.

Other Antidiabetic Therapies: Oral

Clinical studies have associated sulfonylureas with an increased risk of cancer. A retrospective cohort study of 62 809 people with diabetes found that sulfonylureas significantly increased the risk of developing any solid tumour (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.19–1.54; p < 0.001) as well as colorectal (HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.29–2.53; p = 0.001) or pancreatic cancer (HR: 4.95; 95% CI: 2.74–8.96; p < 0.001). However, owing to the low number of site-specific cancers reported, the evidence is weak.

In vitro and in vivo studies on thiazolidinediones have produced inconclusive results; it is possible that these drugs may increase, decrease or have a neutral effect on the risk of cancer or cancer progression. Pioglitazone has been shown in a longitudinal study to be weakly associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer after 2 years of use. Rosiglitazone was shown to have a neutral effect on the risk of all cancers combined or any common site-specific cancers in a meta-analysis of clinical trials. However, the results were inconclusive, owing to the low incidence of site-specific cancers during these trials.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors indirectly increase the level of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in the body by inhibiting its degradation. The relationships between DPP-4 and cancer biology are complex, and research on these is ongoing. Several studies have found that DPP-4 inhibitors could increase the risk of cancer when used in combination with other agents, including GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, there is currently no evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors increase cancer risk when used alone–.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^115DYrnZ]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Drug groups

Cases and matched controls were classified into one of three mutually exclusive drug groups, defined hierarchically by use of incretin based drugs (DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptin) or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, liraglutide)), alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs; sulfonylureas, alone or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs; and other antidiabetic drugs. We defined the use of these antidiabetic drug classes as receiving at least one prescription at any time before the year immediately preceding the index date (that is, prescriptions received during a one year lag period were ignored for latency purposes and to minimise reverse causality).

The reference category for all analyses was use of sulfonylureas, a drug class typically used in the second line to third line setting, and thus at a similar stage in the clinical course of diabetes as incretin based drugs. In contrast, comparing incretin based drugs with metformin (a first line treatment) or insulin (a last line treatment) may introduce time lag bias, a form of confounding by indication that may be difficult to adjust for in statistical models. Finally, thiazolidinediones have fallen out of favour because of possible adverse events (such as cardiovascularand cancer risks), and thus do not represent the most clinically relevant comparator group.

For the period January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017, the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register and ClininalTrials.gov databases were searched for RCTs in people with T2DM that compared incretin drugs with placebo or other antidiabetic drugs, with treatment and follow-up durations of ≥ 52weeks. Two reviewers screened the studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias independently and in duplicate.

Results

A total of 33 studies (n = 79971), including the 6 CVOTs, with 87 pancreatic cancer events were identified. Overall, the pancreatic cancer risk was not increased in patients administered incretin drugs compared with controls (Peto odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–1.02). In the 6 CVOTs, 79 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 55248 participants. Pooled estimates of the 6 CVOTs showed an identical tendency (Peto OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42–1.01). Notably, in the subgroup of participants who received treatment and follow-up for ≥ 104weeks, 84 pancreatic cancer events were identified in 59919 participants, and a lower risk of pancreatic cancer was associated with incretin-based therapies (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.95).

Conclusions

Treatment with incretin drugs was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in people with T2DM. Instead, it might protect against pancreatic malignancy in patients treated for ≥ 104weeks.

### Use of incretin agents and risk of pancreatic cancer: a population-based cohort study [^116kzB39]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the association between the use of incretin agents and the risk of pancreatic cancer.

Methods

A retrospective population-based cohort study, using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 2007–2012, was conducted. Patients (n = 182428) with at least one non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) prescription and aged ≥ 18years during data collection, were matched one-to-one to control patients without diabetes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and a new user design were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of pancreatic cancer in incretin users (n = 28370) compared with control subjects without diabetes and other NIAD-treated patients. Time-dependent adjustments were made for age, sex, lifestyle, comorbidities and drug use.

Results

The mean duration of follow-up was 4.1years for incretin users. Current NIAD use was associated with a fourfold increased risk of pancreatic cancer [HR 4.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.49–5.24]. This risk was almost doubled among current incretin users as compared with control subjects. Incretin use was not associated with pancreatic cancer when compared with control subjects with diabetes (HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.94–1.96); however, the 'new user' design did show an association between incretin use and pancreatic cancer when compared with control subjects with diabetes. In both cohorts with prevalent and incident users of antidiabetic drugs, the risk of pancreatic cancer almost doubled in those who had recently initiated incretin therapy (up to seven prescriptions), whereas this elevated risk dropped to baseline levels with prolonged use.

Conclusions

We found that incretin use was not associated with pancreatic cancer after adjustment for the severity of the underlying Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The elevated risk of pancreatic cancer in those recently initiating incretin agents is likely to be caused by protopathic bias or other types of unknown distortion. The presence of considerable confounding by disease severity and the lack of a duration-of-use relationship do not support a causal explanation for the association between incretin agents and pancreatic cancer.

### A prospective, claims-based assessment of the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide compared to other antidiabetic drugs [^112pF5Fs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

We evaluated the relationship between liraglutide and acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer in an ongoing post-marketing safety assessment programme.

Methods

Initiators of liraglutide, exenatide, metformin, pioglitazone or groups containing initiators of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas were identified in a US commercial health insurance claims database (1 February 2010 to 31 March 2013) and followed for a median of 15months. We estimated incidence rates (IR/100 000 person-years), rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of new insurance claims with diagnoses of primary inpatient acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer from Poisson regression models.

Results

The IR for acute pancreatitis for liraglutide was 187.5 compared with 154.4 for all non-glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies (adjusted RR 1.10; CI 0.81–1.49). The IR for pancreatic cancer was 19.9 for liraglutide compared with 33.0 for all non-GLP-1-based therapies (adjusted RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.26–1.60).

Conclusion

We did not observe excess risk of either outcome associated with liraglutide relative to individual or pooled comparator drugs.

### Effect of incretin-based therapies on cancers of digestive system among 101 595 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis combining 84 trials with a median duration of 30 weeks [^115JXzQG]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Overall, we analyzed 84 eligible RCTs including 101 595 patients. Our network meta-analysis showed that: (1) there was no evidence to indicate increased cancer risk of digestive system associated with incretin-based therapies in patients with T2DM compared with other antidiabetic agents or placebo; (2) subgroup analysis in patients treated for ≥ 48 weeks, based on mean age, duration, mean HbA1c, and sample size, suggested that incretin-based therapies did not increase cancer risk of digestive system.

In agreement with our findings, Wang et al reported that treatment with incretins was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with T2DM (n = 79 971) in a meta-analysis of RCT (OR: 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.02). Moreover, their subgroup analysis, followed up for ≥ 104 weeks, showed a lower risk of pancreatic cancer was associated with incretin-based therapies (OR: 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.95). An RCT on the sitagliptin versus placebo revealed the 0.3% colon cancer risk among sitagliptin initiators versus 0.5% risk among placebo over 3-year follow-up of treatment. Htoo and colleaguesfound no effect of DPP-4 inhibitors (follow-up 0.7–0.9 years) and GLP-1 RA (follow-up 0.8 and 1.2 years) on colorectal cancer incidence, respectively. An observational study of liraglutide also did not find an association between GLP-1 RA use and pancreatic cancer. In agreement with observational findings, recent cardiovascular outcome trials found no increased risk of pancreatic cancer among alogliptin usersand saxagliptin users, compared with the placebo group. A retrospective cohort analysis of patients with T2DM (n = 209 306) found no association between exenatide use and pancreatic cancer. Another cohort study found that the hazard of pancreatic cancer with DPP-4 inhibitors was lower relative to SU (HR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9) and similar to TZD (HR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.4). Elashoff et al reported cases of pancreatic cancer were 2.9-fold greater with exenatide and 2.7-fold greater with sitagliptin in patients, respectively, compared with other therapies. It is of note that those data, derived from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA-AERS), have some limitations. First, the FDA-AERS database depends on immediate reporting and may be influenced by reporting bias. Second, the AERS database does not provide information about smoking habits, alcohol consumption, obesity or chronic pancreatitis, which are all well-known risk factors in pancreatic cancer.

### Incretin based drugs and the risk of pancreatic cancer: international multicentre cohort study [^115oPP3X]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, although we found that our case definition based on a hospital admission for pancreatic cancer had high positive and negative predictive values (88.2% and 99.9%, respectively), misclassification of the outcome is possible. However, it is unlikely that this misclassification would be differential between users of incretin based drugs and users of sulfonylureas. Furthermore, our overall incidence rate of pancreatic cancer (0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.64 per 1000 person years) is consistent with the incidence rate reported in a Canadian study that linked a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes to the British Columbia Cancer Agency database (0.65, 0.59 to 0.71 per 1000 person years). Secondly, given the observational nature of the study, residual confounding by disease severity remains possible. We addressed this by matching cases and controls on duration of treated diabetes, a proxy for disease severity, as well as adjusting the models for the presence of microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes and number of antidiabetic drugs received before entry to the study cohort. It was not possible to adjust for certain pancreatic cancer risk factors such as physical activity, occupational exposures, diet, and family history. However, as achieving glycaemic control is the main motivation for prescribing incretin based drugs or sulfonylureas, we do not believe these unmeasured variables are differentially distributed across the exposure groups. Thirdly, in the secondary analysis of cumulative duration of use, we observed a high hazard ratio for less than one year (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 2.51). This association is of questionable plausibility given the limited duration of exposure and may point to some residual protopathic bias. Specifically, it is possible that some patients were prescribed incretin based drugs because of worsening glycaemic control as a result of early signs of pancreatic cancer, but were switched to step-up treatment (such as insulin) after failing to achieve glycaemic control in the first months of use. It is also important to note that although the primary analysis was well powered, secondary analyses such as those of duration of use were based on fewer events, thus generating wider confidence intervals. Finally, incretin based drugs are relatively new treatments, limiting the potential duration of follow-up. Importantly, the previous signal was based on spontaneous reports that occurred relatively soon after the availability of incretin based drugs. Thus, our null findings are important and argue against a tumour promoter effect. None the less, given the latency of pancreatic cancer, this association will need to be reassessed once these drugs have been on the market for a longer period.

### What have we learnt from "real world" data, observational studies and meta-analyses [^114jL4Cu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The incretin therapies glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors are now well-established as second and third-line therapies and in combination with insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, there is accumulating evidence of their efficacy and safety from both large multicentre randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies. Cardiovascular outcome trials have confirmed that several of these agents are also non-inferior to placebo with the GLP-1 RA liraglutide and semaglutide recently found to be superior in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events. Observational studies and post-marketing surveillance provide real world evidence of safety and effectiveness of these agents and have provided reassurance that signals for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer seen in clinical trials are not of major concern in large patient populations. Well-designed real world studies complement RCTs and systematic reviews but appropriate data and methodologies, which are constantly improving, are necessary to answer appropriate clinical questions relating to the use of incretin therapies.

### Basal insulin intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes: a review [^116czW3f]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The most commonly reported side effects of GLP-1 RA therapy are gastrointestinal ones (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). These are generally mild to moderate and typically improve over time, resulting in discontinuation of therapy in < 5% of patients in clinical trials; slow dose-titration helps to reduce these effects. Concerns have been expressed regarding the possible association between treatment with GLP-1 RA and acute pancreatitis and/or pancreatic cancer, based on a series of case reports; however, no studies have confirmed that GLP-1 RAs cause pancreatitis, and no evidence of an increased risk was found in a large systematic review and meta-analysis. Furthermore, a recent FDA and European Medicines Agency assessment of evidence from clinical trials and observational studies concluded that 'assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs (i.e. GLP-1 RAs and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors) and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data'. The rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer have been generally low in large long-term CVOT trials. For example, in the ELIXA study in 6068 patients with T2D, pancreatitis occurred in five lixisenatide- and eight placebo-treated patients, and three lixisenatide- and nine placebo-treated patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the SUSTAIN-6 trial including 3297 patients, acute pancreatitis occurred in nine patients in the semaglutide group and in 12 in the placebo group; pancreatic cancer occurred in one and four patients, respectively. Similarly, fewer patients treated with liraglutide in the LEADER trial experienced acute pancreatitis compared with placebo (18 vs. 23 patients, respectively), although the incidence of pancreatic cancer was greater in the liraglutide group (13 vs. 5 patients, respectively). In addition, a recent large, multinational cohort study found that the use of incretin-based drugs was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared with sulfonylureas. Nevertheless, guidelines recommend that GLP-1 RAs should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis and discontinued if acute pancreatitis develops.

### A review of the safety and adverse event profile of the fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide [^114ivNxJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic and Other Cancers

It remains controversial whether or not GLP-1 RA-based therapies increase the risk of developing specific malignant diseases, such as pancreatic carcinoma or thyroid cancer. In a study by Elashoff et al. which analyzed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s database of reported AEs associated with the GLP-1 RA exenatide, they found the human data to be consistent with animal data, showing that GLP-1 RA therapies were associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis. Since pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, there was a concern that chronic use of GLP-1 RA-based therapies might therefore be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer in the long term. However, it has been suggested that this analysis was limited by a reporting bias and, therefore, provides insufficient evidence to make this association. Potential malignant pancreatic events and other cancers were also assessed for causality by an adjudication committee for the LixiLan studies (iGlarLixi vs insulin glargine) and the ELIXA trial (lixisenatide vs placebo) specifically. Similar to the incidence of pancreatitis in the LixiLan trials, the incidence of pancreatic cancer was also low. There was a single case of malignant pancreatic neoplasm reported for the insulin glargine group in LixiLan-O that led to permanent treatment discontinuation, but this case was found to be unrelated to the study drug; there were no incidences of pancreatic cancer in the groups receiving iGlarLixi or lixisenatide. A key constraint of the LixiLan trials was their relatively short duration (30 weeks), though this has been solved by the longer-term ELIXA cardiovascular outcomes trials.

The ELIXA study (lixisenatide, n = 3031; placebo, n = 3032), conducted over a median follow-up period of 25 months, confirmed the low rate of malignant pancreatic neoplasms reported in 3 (< 0.1%) patients treated with lixisenatide compared to 9 (0.3%) patients receiving placebo, a similar imbalance to that seen with cases of pancreatitis in favor of lixisenatide.

### A prospective, claims-based assessment of the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide compared to other antidiabetic drugs [^113Rjs4g]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The IRs of health insurance claims representing acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer among recipients of liraglutide were similar to those among comparators. The findings for acute pancreatitis are similar to estimates from insurance claims analyses regarding exenatide.

The use of large insurance claims databases permits the rapid study of large numbers of patients under routine care. However, some limitations exist in our analysis regarding outcome ascertainment. The median follow-up time for the study subjects was 15 months. While the length of this period may be sufficient for acute pancreatitis, it may be inadequate for the long-latency outcome of pancreatic cancer. These interim results are based on un-adjudicated diagnoses and the IRs for both outcomes are likely overestimated. Up to 40% of individuals with a primary inpatient diagnostic code for acute pancreatitis will not have a confirmed diagnosis. The accuracy of claims-based pancreatic cancer diagnoses is unclear. Limiting to primary inpatient claims is intended to reduce misclassification resulting from 'rule out' diagnosis or prior history of pancreatic cancer.

Patient attributes may impact the choice of specific therapy. For example, latent pancreatic cancer may affect glycemic control and result in the initiation of newer antidiabetic therapies, including liraglutide. Alternatively, physicians may be less likely to prescribe liraglutide to patients with pancreatitis, a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, because concerns have been raised. Physicians may also monitor users of GLP-1RAs more closely for these outcomes, although we observed no claims for pancreatic cancer in the first 90 days of follow-up of liraglutide relative to comparators with up to 28%.

Other methodology issues need to be considered in interpreting these interim findings. There were differences between liraglutide initiators and comparators on several baseline variables. While attempts were made to statistically control for some of these differences, residual confounding may remain. We found similar results using the 'intention to treat' and the 'as treated' approaches, although the 'as treated' analysis may have greater residual confounding because, while exposure status was updated through follow-up, covariate status was not. Similarly, the 'as treated' analysis more strongly assumes that discontinuation of treatment is comparably prognostic for liraglutide and comparators, which is difficult to test.

In summary, we observed no increased risk for acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer in association with liraglutide treatment. Future analyses within this data resource will be based on larger cohorts, more follow-up time, and adjudicated outcomes of interest (through review of medical records). Analyses will consider actual treatment patterns in more detail and explore multiple drug combinations.

### Treatment with incretins does not increase the risk of pancreatic diseases compared to older anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, when added to metformin: real world evidence in people with type 2 diabetes [^115bKUH7]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

In people with metformin-treated diabetes, to evaluate the risk of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and other diseases of the pancreas post second-line anti-hyperglycaemic agent initiation.

Methods

People with Type 2 diabetes diagnosed after 2004 who received metformin plus a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i, n = 50 095), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA, n = 12 654), sulfonylurea (n = 110 747), thiazolidinedione (n = 17 597) or insulin (n = 34 805) for at least 3 months were identified in the US Centricity Electronic Medical Records. Time to developing acute pancreatitis, other diseases of the pancreas and pancreatic cancer was estimated, balancing and adjusting anti-hyperglycaemic drug groups for appropriate confounders.

Results

In the DPP-4i group, the adjusted mean time to acute pancreatitis was 2.63 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.38, 2.88] years; time to pancreatic cancer was 2.70 (2.19, 3.21) years; and time to other diseases of the pancreas was 2.73 (2.33, 3.12) years. Compared with DPP-4i, the insulin group developed acute pancreatitis 0.48 years (P < 0.01) earlier and the GLP-1RA group developed pancreatic cancer 3 years later (P < 0.01). However, with the constraint of no event within 6 months of insulin initiation, the risk of acute pancreatitis in the insulin group was insignificant. No other significant differences were observed between groups.

Conclusions

No significant differences in the risk of developing pancreatic diseases in those treated with various anti-hyperglycaemic drug classes were found.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and 13 obesity-associated cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113B2jDC]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Thirteen human malignant neoplasms have been identified as obesity-associated cancers (OAC), ie, the presence of excess body fat is associated with increased risk of developing cancer and worse prognosis in patients with these specific tumors. Obesity also contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which may further increase the risk and worsen the prognosis of the OACs.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) class of pharmaceuticals are highly effective agents for the treatment of T2D and for achieving weight loss. GLP-1RAs have further been shown to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obesityand to contribute to the resolution of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Because of their efficacy in controlling T2D, obesity, and related comorbidities, we hypothesized that these agents might reduce the risk of the OACs. We recently reported that GLP-1RAs were associated with lower risks for colorectal cancer, an OAC. Otherwise, clinical evidence of the potential clinical benefits of GLP-1RA in preventing OAC has not been systematically assessed. Here we conducted a nationwide multicenter retrospective cohort study in patients with T2D who were prescribed GLP-1RAs vs insulins or metformin to determine whether GLP-1RAs were associated with changes in the risk of each of 13 OACs, including esophageal, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gallbladder, stomach, kidney, ovarian, pancreatic, and thyroid cancer as well as hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma, and multiple myeloma.

### No pancreatic safety concern following glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapies: a pooled analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^114zUHEM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Evidence on the pancreatic safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy has been limited. The objective of the study was to investigate this issue by pooling data on the incidence of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer from four large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

Materials and Methods

Data were extracted from four published cardiovascular outcome trials of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes, and pooled analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment. Peto OR with 95% CI was used for risk evaluation.

Results

The four cardiovascular outcome trials enrolled a total of 33 457 patients with type 2 diabetes and reported 123 patients with acute pancreatitis and 70 patients with pancreatic cancer during the median follow-ups of 2.1 to 3.8 years. There was no increased risk of either acute pancreatitis (Peto OR 0.89 [95% CI 0.63, 1.27]) or pancreatic cancer (Peto OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.53, 1.35]) associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared with placebo when added to standard care.

Conclusions

Combined analysis of the four cardiovascular outcome trials showed that treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists was not associated with an increased risk of either acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our new analysis further supports the previously reported results.

### Incretin-based therapy and risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1172MS7w]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

As for RCTs, due to the relatively restrained and stringent inclusion criteria, potential selection bias might have existed for the enrolled patients, thus reducing the risk of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, disparities between observational studies and RCTs can be ascribed to individual variations. Thus, more large-scale surveillance of both epidemiological and RCTs is needed urgently for further evaluation.

According to the current guidelines, incretin-based therapies are recommended for use as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents such as metformin. In our study, we did not find any increased risk of pancreatic cancer with incretin-based therapies as compared to control.

Duration of the study is possibly the second influential factor for risk of pancreatic cancer. Here, we applied two cut-out points (52 and 104 weeks) to classify the studies into three categories. Surprisingly, we detected a lower incidence of pancreatic neoplasm among those with drug intake for more than 104 weeks in incretin-based groups than those in placebo or non-incretin-based anti-diabetic therapy. This result is probably due to four high-quality large RCTs. They all applied more than 2 years follow-up periods and concluded that pancreatic cancer was uncommon and occurred more often in the placebo group, but this difference was not significant in each trial. A recently reported international multicentre cohort study showed the same results. They reported that duration of more than 2 years of incretin use generated pooled hazard ratio close to or below unity (0.62, 0.36 to 1.07), suggesting lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Although incretin drugs may cause a non-physiological condition by promoting effective beta-cells and suppressing alpha cells, the long-term regular use may promotes a new balance of pancreatic secretion and reduces the possible side effects on exocrine pancreas. However, the longest trial in our study had a 6-year study period, but it may take up to 12 years for initiated pancreatic intraepithelial lesions to develop a parental clone which initiates infiltrating pancreatic carcinomas. Thus, the current RCTs were still not long enough to detect a causal effect of incretin mimetics on pancreatic cancer. Long-term surveillance (> 10 years) of neoplasm on the exocrine pancreas is required in the future studies of incretin-based therapy.

### Comparison of new glucose-lowering drugs on the risk of pancreatitis in type 2 diabetes: a network meta-analysis [^115RNEUk]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore whether new glucose-lowering drugs increase the risk of pancreatitis in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This present network meta-analysis aimed to investigate the risk of pancreatitis associated with the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched. The literature was published from the date of their inception to July 21, 2021, including placebo-controlled or head-to-head trials of 2 new glucose-lowering drugs. The relative ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the risk of GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors for pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes.

Results

Seventeen studies were identified, covered 102 257 participants. The pooled results showed a neutral relationship between GLP-1 agonists and pancreatitis (overall RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.31–3.00) or pancreatic cancer (overall RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.31–4.10) compared with placebo. Meanwhile, DPP-4 inhibitors were not associated with the increased risk of pancreatitis (overall RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.25–11.00) or pancreatic cancer (overall RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.26–2.40). Among them, lixisenatide and saxagliptin may be the safest drugs compared with other drugs according to the ranking of probability. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis confirmed the stability of the core results.

Conclusion

The most obvious finding of this study is that GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are safe with respect to the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer compared with placebo. This conclusion may provide useful evidence for correlated clinical researches.

### Diabetes and cancer: a consensus report [^112LUZUc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Incretin-based therapies

Two recently developed classes of drugs either enhance or mimic the effect of gut-derived incretin hormones that improve glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppress postprandial glucagon levels, and delay gastric emptying. The first of the incretin-based therapies introduced, exenatide, has ∼50% homology with the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while the more recently approved liraglutide is an analog of human GLP-1. Both compounds bind to the GLP-1 receptor to exert agonist activity. The oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors inhibit the action of the ubiquitous enzyme that rapidly degrades many peptides including endogenous GLP-1.

Liraglutide increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer in rats and mice in preclinical tests and was associated with slight increases in serum calcitonin in human trials (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Exenatide, liraglutide, and DPP-4 inhibitors increased β-cell proliferation in animal studies, and in one small study of a transgenic rodent model, the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin was demonstrated to increase pancreatic ductal hyperplasia. No impact of incretin-based agents on human cancer incidence has been reported, likely due to the fact that these newer drugs have not been used in sufficient numbers of patients or for long enough periods of time to fully assess any possible effects on cancer risk.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^116uA5PQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have transformed obesity management, offering substantial weight loss and metabolic benefits. This review examines their expanding role, evaluating efficacy compared to alternative treatments, emerging indications, ongoing challenges, and future directions. Beyond obesity and type 2 diabetes, the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 RAs extends to a range of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, neurodegenerative disease, and substance abuse disorders. While early concerns regarding pancreatic and thyroid cancer have been largely attenuated by recent evidence, issues such as gallbladder and biliary disorders, psychiatric safety, and perioperative aspiration risk require ongoing investigation. Additionally, observations of weight regain after treatment discontinuation and reductions in lean mass highlight the need for long-term, individualized strategies to sustain clinical benefits. The high cost and limited access to these medications raise critical policy and equity challenges. Future research must address these gaps, focusing on long-term safety, optimizing combination approaches, and evaluating the broader clinical and economic implications of widespread GLP-1 RA use.

### A review of practical issues on the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of type 2 diabetes [^112n2rPj]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety Issues, General Warnings and Precautions for the Use of GLP-1 RAs

As a class, GLP-1 RAs are generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events are nausea and vomiting, both of which are usually transient and of mild or moderate severity, and patients can develop tolerance to these adverse effects over time. The frequency of nausea among patients ranges from 13% with dulaglutide (0.75 mg), approximately 20% with liraglutide, prolonged-release exenatide, dulaglutide (1.5 mg) and semaglutide, 26% with lixisenatide and 36% with one-daily exenatide. The rate of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events ranges from about 1% with prolonged-release exenatide to 5% with semaglutide and once-daily exenatide.

Experience is limited on the use of the GLP-1 RAs in patients with severe gastrointestinal diseases, including gastroparesis. Therefore, these drugs are not recommended in these patients.

Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 RAs. According to the SPCs of all GLP-1 RAs, patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, these drugs should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, they should not be restarted. Of note, two recent meta-analyses found no evidence that treatment with GLP-1 RAs increases the risk of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Large, randomized CV outcome trials with GLP-1 RAs have not found any increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancers.

### Effect of incretin-based therapies on cancers of digestive system among 101 595 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis combining 84 trials with a median duration of 30 weeks [^113rQbn9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Incretins are gut peptides which can augment nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion after dietary intake. Incretin-based therapies include incretin mimetics of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and incretin enhancers of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Because of their moderate efficiency in glucose lowering and little side effects of hypoglycemia and weight gain, incretin-based therapies are widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sitagliptin as the first DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) either in monotherapy or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. Then vildagliptin was the second in class, followed by saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin.GLP-1 RAs were first introduced in the United States in 2005. Exenatide was the first approved GLP-1 RA, followed by liraglutide in 2010 and albiglutide and dulaglutide in 2015. Recently great concerns about cancers of digestive system have been raised.GLP-1-based therapies as a potential stimulus to β-cell regeneration have constituted the possibility that exocrine pancreatic cells might be affected simultaneously. Debate about long-term safety of GLP-1 RA therapies follows conflicting reports from preclinical and epidemiological studies regarding risk for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. A cohort study based on real-world drug utilization patterns investigating the risk of colorectal cancer for DPP-4 inhibitors versus other antidiabetic drugs, and GLP-1 RAs versus long-acting insulin indicated that incretin-based therapies did not promote colorectal cancer. Garg et al found no evidence of an increased risk of pancreatitis with exenatide in a retrospective cohort study. Gallwitzreported that the administration of exenatide and sitagliptin may have increased risk of pancreatitis in patients with T2DM. There is a signal for cancer of the pancreas for exenatide in both the US FDA and German regulatory databases and for sitagliptin in the FDA database. Clinical studies completed thus far are insufficient to confirm or exclude an increased long-term risk of pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer with incretin-based therapies.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis by investigating all randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT) to evaluate cancer risk of digestive system related with incretin-based therapies in patients with T2DM.

Incretin-Based Therapy Versus Placebo or Other Anti-diabetic Drugs

There are also differences among control groups within the included 24 studies. Seven trials applied incretin-matched placebo as parallel arms while 17 had non-incretin anti-diabetic drugs for control. Our results indicated decreased risk of pancreatic cancer within groups controlled by incretin-matched placebos (pooled RR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32–0.93, P = 0.025). On the other hand, there was no increase in risk of pancreatic cancer as compared to the non-incretin anti-diabetic therapy (pooled RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.54–2.01, P = 0.902) (Fig. 5 b).

Incretin-Based Monotherapy Versus Combination Regimen

Within 24 trials, 14 studies had incretin-based combination regimen as one of the treatment arms (pooled RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.45–1.90, P = 0.828). The remaining ten studies had evaluated incretin-based monotherapy (pooled RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.38–1.01, P = 0.055). The pooled results indicate that both types of regimens did not increase risk of pancreatic cancer with regards to incretin treatment (Fig. 5 c).

Pancreatic Cancer as Principal Outcome or Not

Nineteen studies considered the incidence of pancreatic cancer to be one of the principal outcome variables (pooled RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.62–2.19, P = 0.630). The remaining five studies investigated pancreatic cancer events as non-principal outcome (pooled RR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.84, P = 0.010) (Fig. 5 d).

### Liraglutide use and evaluation of pancreatic outcomes in a US commercially insured population [^115oLnVJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Approximately 30 million people have diabetes in the United States (US), 1 the majority of which will not meet their therapeutic goals despite treatment with multiple ADs. 2 Incretin‐based drugs, including glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs), are an important addition to the therapeutic options available for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). 3 This class of drugs is associated with a reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), weight loss and minimal risk of hypoglycaemia. 4, 5, 6, 7 A reduced risk of cardiovascular events was also seen for some drugs in this class. 8, 9

After introduction of the first GLP‐1 RA, exenatide twice‐daily, questions were raised about an increased risk of acute pancreatitis (AP) and pancreatic cancer (PC). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency reviewed the totality of existing data but, to date, a final conclusion has not been rendered regarding a causal association between GLP‐1 RA therapies and either AP or PC; therefore, they remain safety risks for these drugs. Both agencies called for more research in this area. 10, 11 Thus, this post‐marketing regulatory requirement supplements the growing body of studies utilizing real world data and methods to address concerns about confounding and bias in observational studies. A previously published brief report provided early results 12; this manuscript presents the final analyses.

### Assessing bladder cancer risk in type 2 diabetes clinical trials: the dapagliflozin drug development program as a' case study' [^114zrKEQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiologic data suggest that people with diabetes are at a significantly higher risk of many forms of cancer. However, it is not clear if diabetes itself is an independent risk factor for cancer, or if the association can be explained by common risk factors such as obesity and a sedentary lifestyle shared between diabetes and several forms of cancer. Specifically, data show that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, with a meta-analysis showing 35% increased risk in patients with diabetes versus a healthy population, although this positive association may be limited to patients with longstanding diabetes and/or to insulin users. One study reported increased odds of bladder cancer in patients with T2DM of ≥ 16 years' standing versus non-diabetics [odds ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 11.2].

Against this background, the influence of glucose-lowering drugs on cancer risk is of great interest, and several therapies have been under scrutiny because of signals for potential increased cancer risk. Due to the relative infrequency of cancer events, detecting a cancer signal in pre-marketing clinical development programs is very difficult. Therefore, assessment should be based on the totality of evidence, including pre-clinical and clinical data, individual case reports, as well as continued monitoring for any potential signals in post-marketing surveillance and longer-term clinical studies.

Data suggest that long-term use of insulin glargine (> 5 years) may increase the risk of breast cancer. However, findings from the ORIGIN trial (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention; ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00069784), which enrolled 12,537 patients and followed them for a median of 6.2 years, found no increased breast cancer risk with insulin glargine versus standard therapy. Further, a potential link between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and pancreatic carcinoma and thyroid cancer has also been of concern in recent years. However, no clear conclusions have been drawn regarding a causal relationship with pancreatic disease (pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis). With regard to thyroid cancer, clinical data have not shown any association between GLP-1 RAs and thyroid cancer in patients with T2DM.

### Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114nbw3M]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This meta-analysis sought to assess the relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4) and the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer by synthesizing data from randomized, controlled trials, in light of the conflicting findings from observational studies and previous meta-analyses.

Methods

Cochrane, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubMed databases that compared the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and that reported pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer events in patients with diabetes mellitus Type 2 (T2DM) were searched using specific terms. Studies were included if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: They were randomized trials comparing DPP-4 inhibitors use in patients with T2DM; The study's duration was longer than 24 weeks; And they reported pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer events. Stata 15 MP was used to analyze the data, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the results.

Findings

A total of 81,737 participants with T2DM were included in the analysis. The results showed that during a mean follow-up period of 24 to 520 weeks, The use of DPP-4 inhibitors was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis (Peto-OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.27) or pancreatic cancer (Peto-OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.30).

Implications

Current evidence fails to validate a significant correlation between DPP-4 therapy and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. However, subgroup analyses showed that sitagliptin was associated with a significant reduction in pancreatitis risk compared to the control group; furthermore, when comparing different types of control medications, a significant decrease in pancreatic cancer risk was observed among DPP-4 users compared to GLP-1 users.

### Incretin action in the pancreas: potential promise, possible perils, and pathological pitfalls [^111f8YyK]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence raising the possibility that incretin-based therapy may be associated with a predisposition to develop pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer generates important hypotheses that require testing in mechanistic preclinical studies and independent validation in large randomized, controlled clinical trials. Pathological pitfalls of incretin-based science include the use of nonspecific antisera and mismatched cases and controls and the generation of nonvalidated hypotheses and irreproducible data. As millions of patients with diabetes are being treated with incretin-based therapies, our collective responsibility to use higher-quality science has never been greater. Underpowered studies using poorly validated reagents or analysis of mismatched cases and controls have a much greater certainty of not being reproducible and do not advance our understanding of incretin action in the pancreas. Emerging pharmacovigilance studies, such as the Safety Evaluation of Adverse Reactions in Diabetes (SAFEGUARD) study should shed additional clarity on the risk-to-benefit ratio of medications used to treat diabetes.

A great deal has been written about incretin action in the pancreas, including statements that are not substantiated or are contradicted by available data. For example, the claim that "production of exendin-4 causes rapid proliferation of intestinal tissue and a 50% increase in the size of the pancreas" in Heloderma suspectum is simply incorrect and is clearly refuted by the actual experimental data cited. The ongoing debate surrounding the mechanisms of action and potential safety of incretin-based therapies reminds one of a quotation variably attributed to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, James Schlesinger, or Bernard Baruch: "Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts". The beauty of science is that it is self-correcting, and provocative experiments and observations that are not highly reproducible are ultimately discarded. Over the next several years we will learn much more about the potential risks and benefits of incretin-based therapies from large, randomized, ongoing cardiovascular outcome studies, with rigorous independent adjudication of adverse events. Thoughtful scientists await the results of these and ongoing pharmacovigilance studies with great interest. The results of these trials will be extremely useful for increasing our understanding of incretin action in not only the cardiovascular system but also the diabetic pancreas.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and cancer risk in adults with obesity… [^111g7jmH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Is taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists associated with the risk of developing cancer among adults with obesity. Findings. In this retrospective cohort study using a target trial emulation design with electronic health records from OneFlorida+, 43 317 individuals taking GLP-1RAs were compared with 43 315 matched nonusers. Taking GLP-1RAs was significantly associated with a reduced risk of overall cancer, particularly for endometrial, meningioma, and ovarian cancers; however, GLP-1RAs were associated with a nonsignificant increased risk of kidney cancer. Meaning These findings suggest taking GLP-1RAs may influence cancer risk, highlighting the need for long-term follow-up to understand underlying mechanisms. Importance Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are widely prescribed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and have recently gained popularity for weight management. However, their long-term impact on cancer risk remains uncertain.

Understanding this association is crucial for patient safety. The incidence rates of the 14 cancers were 13. 6 vs
16. 4 per 1000 person-years, respectively, indicating a significantly lower overall cancer risk among individuals taking GLP-1RAs compared with nonusers. In particular, taking GLP-1RAs was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and meningioma. This retrospective cohort study found that taking GLP-1RAs was associated with a reduced overall risk of cancer, including lower risks of endometrial, ovarian, and meningioma cancers, among patients with obesity or overweight.

However, taking GLP-1RAs may be associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, highlighting the need for longer-term follow-up to clarify the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings.

### Hematologic cancers among patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed GLP-1RAs… [^1153TrBL]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity have been identified as independent risk factors for various cancers, including hematologic cancers. 1 Glucagon-like peptide–1 receptor agonists have emerged as an effective treatment, offering glycemic control, weight reduction, 2 and immune modulation, 3 and are associated with lower cancer risk, specifically solid tumors. 4 However, the association of GLP-1RA with hematologic cancers remains unexplored. This study aims to compare the risks of hematologic cancers in patients with T2D treated with GLP-1RA compared with metformin and insulin. Compared with metformin, GLP-1RA use was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. There was no significant difference in risk of any other hematologic cancer.

Compared with insulin, GLP-1RA use was associated with a significantly lower risk of myeloid leukemia, lymphoid leukemia, monoclonal gammopathy, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis. Across all hematologic cancers, GLP-1RA use was associated with 54% lower risk compared with insulin. The findings of this cohort study suggest that GLP-1RAs are associated with reduced risk of developing several hematologic cancers, particularly MDS and MPN, in patients with T2D. This reduction in risk may be mediated by weight loss, the immunomodulatory properties of GLP-1RAs, or both.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and colorectal cancer risk in drug-naive… [^115fDzhy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eMethods Data Sharing Statement Patients had no prior CRC and had no prior antidiabetic medication prescriptions between matched cohorts in the overall study population and in patients with obesity/overweight. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of the outcome at daily time intervals with censoring applied within a 15-year time window starting from the index event. The cohorts were propensity score matched for demographics, adverse socioeconomic determinants of health, preexisting medical conditions, personal and family history of cancers such as CRC and colonic polyps, benign neoplasms of the colon and rectum, lifestyle factors, medical encounters, and procedures such as colonoscopy.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating type 2 diabetes. GLP-1RAs have pleiotropic effects on lowering plasma glucose, inducing weight loss, and modulating immune functions. 1 Because overweight/obesity is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer, 2 we hypothesize that GLP-1RAs are associated with a decreased risk for CRC in patients with T2D compared with non–GLP-1RA antidiabetics. Consistent findings were observed in women and in men. GLP-1RAs were associated with a lower risk for CRC in patients with obesity/overweight compared with insulin, metformin, or other antidiabetics.

In this cohort study, GLP-1RAs were associated with reduced CRC risk in drug-naive patients with T2D with and without obesity/overweight, with more profound effects in patients with obesity/overweight, suggesting a potential protective effect against CRC partially mediated by weight loss and other mechanisms not related to weight loss.
