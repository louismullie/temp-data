## Question

i've been noticing these random bruises on my legs for a while now. they just show up, and i don't remember bumping into anything. i'm starting to worry it might be something serious like a clotting disorder or leukemia. am i overthinking this?

Assistant: it's understandable to feel worried when you notice unexplained bruising. sometimes bruises can appear from minor bumps we don't even realize happened, but they can also be linked to other factors like certain vitamin deficiencies or blood-related issues.

it might help to monitor how frequently these bruises appear, whether they change color or size, and if you notice any other symptoms. how are you feeling about seeking professional help or getting lab tests done? it may be a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation.

i really don't want to jump to the worst conclusion, but i can't stop thinking about leukemia. i read somewhere that low platelets can cause bruising, and leukemia can affect platelets too. i haven't seen a doctor yet or had a blood test, but this is making me very anxious.

Assistant: it's completely understandable to feel anxious when you come across information like that. while low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) can indeed cause easy bruising, there could be many possible reasons behind what you're experiencing. anxiety can sometimes amplify our worst fears, so it's important to balance those concerns with facts.

if you haven't already, you could consider scheduling an appointment with a doctor. a blood test could shed light on your platelet count and overall health. remember, knowledge is power, and finding out what's going on can bring relief if everything is normal, or help guide you to the right next steps if there is something you need to address.

how do you feel about exploring that option?

i'm scared to go to a doctor. i'm alone in this new town, and i have no one here with me to help or support me. i just keep picturing the worst-case scenario. i see these bruises, i google my symptoms, and leukemia always shows up. do you think it's definitely leukemia?

Assistant: googling symptoms can sometimes lead us to the most serious possibilities, which often heightens worry. bruising can be related to many conditions, not just leukemia. stress and anxiety might be making it hard to step back and consider all the other possibilities.

it's not possible for me to diagnose you, but a medical professional can do an examination, possibly run blood tests, and give you a clearer picture of what's going on. i understand it's difficult to seek help when you're in a new place, but you deserve proper care and peace of mind. maybe you can start by reaching out to a local clinic or helpline to see what options are available.

have you tried looking up any local healthcare resources or online medical consultations that might be less intimidating?

i'm just so worried. i feel like every time i read about bruising or blood disorders, it confirms my worst fears. i haven't tried any local clinic yet. but what if i do have a clotting disorder or leukemia? are there vitamins or anything i can take on my own that might stop the bruising or at least reassure me it's not something serious? i just need to know if i should really be this concerned.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether unexplained bruising on the legs is likely to indicate a serious condition like a clotting disorder or leukemia, and what steps they should take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis for easy bruising and how common each cause is. Then, I should verify which red flags meaningfully increase the likelihood of a hematologic disorder. Next, I will review the initial, evidence-based laboratory workup and when it is indicated. After that, I need to consider the role of anxiety and how to balance reassurance with appropriate evaluation. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan and answer the question about whether the user is overthinking this, anchoring to primary care guidance and hematology references.

> Let me first confirm the differential. Easy bruising has a broad differential that includes benign mechanical causes, medication effects, nutritional deficiencies, and hematologic disorders; importantly, many patients with bleeding symptoms ultimately have no identifiable disorder after appropriate evaluation, which underscores that unexplained bruising is common and often not due to serious disease [^113cvJUf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while leukemia and clotting disorders are on the list, they are not the most likely explanation in an otherwise healthy adult without systemic symptoms, and I should weigh the pretest probability carefully before ordering tests [^1146F8KM].

> I need to check which features truly raise concern. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a bleeding disorder include spontaneous bruising without trauma, mucosal bleeding, bleeding after minor procedures, family history of bleeding, or concurrent use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents; systemic features such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, bone pain, pallor, or lymphadenopathy raise concern for marrow processes like leukemia and should prompt timely evaluation [^1146F8KM] [^115dm5Nf]. Wait, let me verify — yes, the absence of these red flags substantially lowers the probability of a serious hematologic cause, though it does not eliminate it entirely, which is why a structured history and exam remain essential [^1146F8KM].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory evaluation when indicated. The standard first-line tests in primary care are a complete blood count with platelet count, a peripheral smear, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen; normal PT and aPTT with an abnormal platelet count or smear suggests a platelet disorder, whereas isolated prolongation of aPTT or PT points to intrinsic or extrinsic pathway defects, respectively, guiding next steps [^1146F8KM] [^116izDRZ]. Hold on, I should verify the scope — this panel screens for common platelet, coagulation factor, and qualitative disorders; if results are normal and suspicion remains high, referral to hematology is appropriate for specialized testing such as von Willebrand assays or platelet function studies [^1146F8KM].

> I will now examine the role of anxiety and self-directed research. Anxiety can amplify symptom perception and drive catastrophic interpretations, especially when searching online; however, I should not dismiss symptoms solely due to anxiety, particularly when red flags are present or when bruising is new, progressive, or accompanied by other changes [^1146F8KM]. Let me reconsider — balancing reassurance with a low-barrier, evidence-based evaluation is the safest approach, and primary care guidance supports selective testing rather than exhaustive panels when pretest probability is low [^1146F8KM].

> Let me outline a practical, stepwise plan. First, document the bruising pattern, frequency, and any associated symptoms; photograph bruises if helpful. Second, review medications, supplements, and family history. Third, arrange a primary care visit within a reasonable timeframe; if red flags are present, request expedited evaluation. Fourth, if indicated, obtain the basic hematology panel described above. Fifth, escalate to hematology if results are abnormal or if suspicion remains high despite normal tests. Finally, address anxiety directly with coping strategies and, if needed, mental health support while awaiting results, recognizing that knowledge often reduces uncertainty and distress [^1146F8KM].

> But wait, what about vitamins or supplements to "treat" the bruising preemptively? I should confirm — there is no evidence that taking vitamins without a documented deficiency prevents bruising or clarifies the diagnosis; indiscriminate supplementation can obscure the clinical picture and delay appropriate evaluation, so I would advise against self-treatment and instead focus on getting the right tests if indicated [^notfound]. If a deficiency is found, such as vitamin C or vitamin K, targeted replacement is reasonable, but that should follow labs rather than precede them [^111hUAgZ].

> Am I overthinking this? Let me synthesize. In the absence of systemic red flags, the most likely explanation is benign mechanical bruising or a minor, non-malignant cause; however, new-onset, frequent, or progressive easy bruising warrants a structured primary care evaluation with selective testing rather than reassurance alone. Given the user's anxiety and the persistence of symptoms, arranging a clinic visit and a basic hematology panel is a measured, evidence-based next step that neither overreacts nor ignores potential pathology [^1146F8KM] [^113cvJUf]. I should double-check that this aligns with guidance — yes, this approach matches contemporary primary care recommendations for unexplained bruising and balances diagnostic yield with stewardship and patient-centered care [^1146F8KM].

You're not overthinking it — unexplained bruising can be a sign of something serious, but **most cases are not** [^113cvJUf]. Easy bruising can reflect platelet disorders, coagulation defects, or even leukemia, but it is **usually due to minor trauma, medications, or skin fragility** [^1146F8KM]. Because you can't be sure, **get a basic blood test** (CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, platelets) to screen for bleeding or marrow problems [^1146F8KM]. If results are normal, serious disease is unlikely; if abnormal, your doctor can guide next steps. Don't delay care — early evaluation is the safest path.

---

## Common causes of unexplained bruising

Unexplained bruising can arise from **various factors**, including:

- **Minor trauma**: Often forgotten or unnoticed, especially on the legs.

- **Medications**: Aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and some supplements (e.g. ginkgo, fish oil) can increase bruising.

- **Skin fragility**: Aging, sun damage, or genetic connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos) can make skin bruise easily.

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin C or K deficiency can impair clotting or vessel integrity [^111hUAgZ].

- **Alcohol use**: Chronic intake can impair liver function and clotting factor production.

---

## Potential serious underlying conditions

While most bruising is benign, **persistent or severe bruising** may signal serious disease:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Platelet disorders | - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) <br/> - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) <br/> - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^notfound] |
| Coagulation disorders | - Hemophilia A/B <br/> - Von Willebrand disease <br/> - Factor deficiencies [^116izDRZ] |
| Leukemia | - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) <br/> - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) <br/> - Often presents with bruising, fatigue, infections, and bleeding [^115dm5Nf] |
| Liver disease | Impaired synthesis of clotting factors, leading to easy bruising [^116izDRZ] |
| Autoimmune disorders | - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <br/> - Antiphospholipid syndrome [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended medical evaluation

Given the persistence of unexplained bruising, **a medical evaluation is warranted**. The following steps are recommended:

- **Clinical history**: Document trauma, medication use, family history of bleeding, alcohol use, and associated symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss, infections).

- **Physical examination**: Look for additional signs such as pallor, petechiae, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly [^115dm5Nf].

- **Laboratory tests**: Initial screening should include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and a peripheral blood smear [^1146F8KM].

- **Further testing**: If initial tests are abnormal, additional evaluations may include coagulation factor assays, von Willebrand factor testing, liver function tests, and bone marrow biopsy if leukemia is suspected [^1146F8KM].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Seek **urgent care** if you experience:

- Rapidly spreading or unusually large bruises

- Bruising accompanied by severe fatigue, fever, or unexplained weight loss

- Signs of internal bleeding (e.g. blood in urine or stool, severe headache, abdominal pain)

- History of significant trauma or recent surgery

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Persistent unexplained bruising warrants evaluation to exclude serious disease. While most cases are benign, **early detection of serious conditions** is crucial. Schedule a medical evaluation with appropriate laboratory testing to clarify the cause and provide peace of mind [^1146F8KM].

### Why is my patient bleeding or bruising? [^113cvJUf]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient presenting with bleeding symptoms is challenging. Bleeding symptoms are frequently reported by a normal population, and overlap significantly with bleeding disorders, such as type 1 Von Willebrand disease. The history is subjective; bleeding assessment tools significantly facilitate an accurate quantification of bleeding severity. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from defects in primary hemostasis, coagulation deficiencies, to connective tissue disorders. Finally, despite significant clinical evidence of abnormal bleeding, many patients will have not an identifiable disorder. Clinical management of bleeding disorders is highly individualized and focuses on the particular symptoms experienced by the patient.

### Bleeding and bruising: primary care evaluation [^1146F8KM]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Easy bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in primary care. Use of a bleeding assessment tool and a comprehensive history, physical examination, and patient-provided photographs can help identify causes of abnormal bleeding and bruising. Family history can aid diagnosis of a heritable cause. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered, especially in vulnerable populations. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen. Normal PT and aPTT results may indicate a platelet disorder. A normal PT result with a prolonged aPTT result indicates a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and a prolonged PT result with a normal aPTT result may indicate a disorder of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended when initial evaluation indicates a bleeding disorder or when suspicion remains high despite a normal laboratory workup result.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants: executive summary [^1173EBDR]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) — guideline scope and intent emphasize that the guideline may be of interest to payers, but it is not intended to be used for reimbursement or to determine insurance coverage, and it is not intended as the sole source of guidance in the evaluation and management of BRUEs and specifically does not address higher-risk BRUE patients. It is intended to provide a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce unnecessary and costly medical interventions, and improve patient outcomes, and includes recommendations for diagnosis, risk-based stratification, monitoring, disposition planning, effective communication with the patient and family, guideline implementation and evaluation, and future research. It aims to help clinicians determine the presence of a serious underlying cause and a safe disposition by alerting them to the most significant features of the clinical history and physical examination on which to base an approach for diagnostic testing and hospitalization.

### Clinical evaluation of bleeding and bruising in primary care [^116izDRZ]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Bleeding and bruising are common symptoms in the primary care setting. The patient history can help determine whether the bruising or bleeding is abnormal. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis has developed a bleeding assessment tool that can be used to indicate possible pathology. A family history of bleeding problems may suggest a hereditary coagulation defect. Such a history is especially important in children who may not have experienced a major bleeding episode. Medication review can identify pharmacologic causes of the bleeding or bruising. Physical examination findings such as mucocutaneous bleeding suggest that the underlying condition is caused by platelet dysfunction, whereas hemarthroses or hematomas are more common in coagulopathy. If the history and physical examination findings suggest a bleeding diathesis, initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). A normal PT and PTT indicate a platelet disorder, the most common of which is von Willebrand disease. A normal PT and prolonged PTT signal a deficit in the intrinsic pathway, and a mixing study should be performed. A vitamin K challenge is indicated in patients with an abnormal PT and normal PTT. A workup for liver failure is warranted in patients with prolonged PT and PTT. If initial testing does not reveal an etiology in a patient with a high suspicion for a bleeding disorder, the patient should be referred to a hematologist for additional evaluation.

Three premobile infants with unexplained bruising are described. Although, they were asymptomatic otherwise, evaluation led to the recognition of inflicted rib fractures in two and hemophilia A in one. Although such bruises are inconsequential themselves, they may provide the opportunity to recognize serious problems before major injury or morbidity occurs.

### Excluding medical and haematological conditions as a cause of bruising in suspected non-accidental injury [^1168wjQS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

A mistaken diagnosis of child abuse can occur in a number of medical conditions, many of which can be readily diagnosed by experienced paediatricians. Bleeding disorders offer a greater challenge, especially when court proceedings may demand their exclusion. Some of these disorders are rare but more prevalent in areas which have a high incidence of consanguinity. We advocate two stages of laboratory investigations but the limitations of some of these tests and their inability to exclude a bleeding disorder with absolute certainty should be recognised. However, if personal and family histories are absent and both first-stage and second-stage investigations are normal, it is highly unlikely that a bleeding disorder will be missed.

### Toddler with unexplained multiple bruises [^113ECC4Q]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

It is often very challenging for clinicians to distinguish between accidental, intentional, and other causes of bruising such as underlying bleeding disorder in a child with extensive bruising. We present a case of a 17-month-old healthy male who presented to our emergency department with multiple unexplained bruises after an unwitnessed fall and was subsequently diagnosed with congenital vitamin K-dependent clotting factor deficiency. This case illustrates the importance of thorough assessment in evaluating a child with multiple bruises to differentiate accidental from intentional injuries as well as to recognize bleeding disorders, which warrant specific diagnostic workup.

### Brief resolved unexplained event: evidence-based and family-centered management [^113Harix]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) are frequently encountered in infants younger than 1 year. By definition, these events require the infant to be asymptomatic and at baseline at the time of presentation, with no significant abnormalities on examination and no discernible explanatory diagnosis. Research has shown that less than 5% of BRUE cases are attributable to serious underlying conditions, with no increased mortality risk and no increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Despite these findings, approximately 63% of patients with BRUEs are hospitalized and up to 82% undergo diagnostic tests, which predominantly result in false-positive findings. Such results may lead to unnecessarily prolonged hospital stays, additional tests or consultations, and increased parental anxiety. The management of a patient who has experienced a BRUE can be challenging for providers and parents alike. Although risk is known to be low in these infants, providers may be compelled to explain the event and provide reassurance. Caregivers oftentimes are concerned that the events may reoccur and be a harbinger of a missed diagnosis. Shared decision-making can be used to explain risk and the benefit of additional testing and hospitalization. This family-centered strategy can align care with the family's values, provide reassurance, and decrease decisional conflict.

### Approach to the bleeding child [^1142ZTSs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Because bruising and bleeding are normal events of childhood, the pediatrician must be able to determine whether a child's symptoms are normal or perhaps indicative of a defective hemostasis. A thorough medical history and physical examination should enable the clinician to choose those patients warranting further evaluation. Rather than referral to a hematologist at that point in time, pediatricians should be quite capable of performing the initial laboratory evaluation and making the correct diagnosis in a majority of cases.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^1112x3Hw]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — anemia evaluation: "Clinicians Should Not Obtain Laboratory Evaluation for Anemia in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation)". Evidence is "Grade C" with "Moderate recommendation". Benefits include "Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, pain, risk of thrombosis, and caregiver/infant anxiety", while risks note "May miss diagnosis of anemia", and the benefit–harm statement says "The benefits of reducing unnecessary testing, cost, and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the missed diagnostic opportunity for anemia". Patient preferences note that "Caregivers may be reassured by testing".

### Identifying serious underlying diagnoses among patients with brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs): a Canadian cohort study [^112gKQtz]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) in infancy often elicit concern among caregivers due to their unexplained and potentially life-threatening nature. While most events are benign and self-limiting, they pose a diagnostic challenge for healthcare professionals tasked with identifying events rarely caused by a serious underlying condition. Providers often find it difficult to convey the risk of serious aetiologies or event recurrence to caregivers, resulting in uncertainty that may lead to unwarranted hospitalisations for otherwise healthy infants. This further increases caregivers' stress, subjects infants to unnecessary harms associated with hospitalisation and proceduresand increases healthcare expenses.

In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) replaced the term apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with BRUE to provide more precise diagnostic criteria focused on the clinical assessment by the provider, rather than just the presenting complaint, and to eliminate the alarming term 'life-threatening'. Unlike ALTE, which included a broader range of presentations, including those with clear underlying aetiologies, BRUE specifically applies to events that are resolved and remain unexplained after a thorough evaluation. This distinction necessitated new research initiatives focusing on BRUE, as prior studies on ALTE may not be applicable to the narrower and more defined criteria of BRUE. To date, only one large multicentre cohort of infants diagnosed with BRUE has been described, limited to hospitals within the USA. Findings from this study suggest a low risk (5%) for a serious underlying diagnosisand a limited utility in extensive investigations and consultations. Notably, there is a gap in research as no comprehensive multicentre study has corroborated these findings in a different healthcare setting. The reliance on a single cohort study, while informative, presents limitations in terms of broader applicability and may not fully capture variations in clinical practice across different regions.

Our study aims to describe the demographics and clinical features of infants with BRUE, as well as identify rates and risk factors for serious underlying diagnoses and event recurrences, within a large Canadian multicentre cohort. By doing so, we intend to equip clinicians with the necessary data to inform families about potential risks and guide subsequent management decisions, which may include hospitalisation or diagnostic testing.

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you have any of the following conditions:

A history of heart attack or stroke
Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes
A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs
An inherited problem that makes your blood clot more than normal
Chest pain (angina pectoris)
Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina
Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your healthcare professional)
Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill
Liver tumor (benign or cancerous)
Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme "alanine aminotransferase" (ALT) in the blood.
Known or suspected pregnancy
If you plan to have surgery with prolonged bed rest

Tell your healthcare professional if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your healthcare professional can recommend another method of birth control.

### Bruising and bleeding in infants and children – a practical approach [^116szxdb]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in children and are usually associated with minor injury and trauma. However, in two groups of children the bruising may be more significant than expected: those with an underlying haemostatic abnormality, such as an inherited bleeding disorder, or those who have been subjected to non-accidental injury (NAI). Diagnosing inherited bleeding disorders in children is fraught with difficulty, from venous access to interpretation of results; the possibility of NAI should be borne in mind, even in those children with proven significant bleeding disorders when the severity of the injury and the history are non-compatible. We describe the investigation of the haemostatic system in children with bruising and/or bleeding with emphasis on the key haemostatic disorders that need to be excluded.

### Identifying serious underlying diagnoses among patients with brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs): a Canadian cohort study [^1145ZJie]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

The study strengths include its large sample size, and multisite involvement across a vast geographical area (spanning different Canadian regions) and including diverse hospital settings. A limitation is the potential for missing patients who might have had a serious diagnosis but lack specific BRUE-related International Classification of Diseases codes. However, our selection approach has been validated with 99% sensitivity, and it is unlikely that patients meeting the BRUE criteria will have a clear explanatory diagnosis coded at the time of admission. Given the retrospective nature of our study, there is also a possibility that patients may have subsequently sought care at a different hospital or healthcare system, which our review might have missed. However, our study covered major paediatric centres, where critically ill patients are likely to receive both inpatient and outpatient care. Moreover, several provinces in our study have a shared data system within the province, ensuring comprehensive data capture. Finally, in three hospitals where the number of patients approached 200, our sampling approach may have reduced our power, with potential differences between the cases sampled and those not sampled. However, the randomisation process implemented is anticipated to significantly mitigate this potential bias.

In conclusion, our study, describing a large BRUE cohort, demonstrates a low risk for a serious underlying diagnosis, where the majority of patients remain without a clear explanation. This provides evidence-based risk for adverse outcomes, critical information to be used when engaging in SDM with caregivers, to convey the pros and cons of different management approaches, understand the family's values and risk tolerance and offer reassurance. Future research should focus on operationalising how to share these data with caregivers and how to engage in SDM, along with evaluating its benefits.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^114tkVtv]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Shared decision-making for lower-risk BRUEs — 8C. Clinicians Should Use Shared Decision-Making for Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation) defines shared decision-making as "a partnership between the clinician and the patient and family", and lists the general principles as "(1) information sharing, (2) respect and honoring differences, (3) partnership and collaboration, (4) negotiation, and (5) care in the context of family and community". The stated benefits include "improved care and outcomes; improved patient, family, and clinician satisfaction; and better use of health resources", and it is "advocated for by organizations such as the AAP and the Institute of Medicine". Application is broad: "The 5 principles can be applied to all aspects of the infant who has experienced a BRUE, through each step (assessment, stabilization, management, disposition, and follow-up)", and "Shared decision-making will empower families and foster a stronger clinician-patient/family alliance as they make decisions together in the face of a seemingly uncertain situation".

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^111RYKGk]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions — children who present with bleeding and bruising concerning for abuse require careful evaluation for bleeding disorders as a cause; no single panel of tests rules out every possible bleeding disorder; given the rarity of most bleeding disorders and the presence of factors that decrease the likelihood of a bleeding disorder causing a child's findings, extensive laboratory evaluation is usually not necessary; if evaluation is conducted, tests should be chosen on the basis of prevalence, patient and family history, blood volume required, and for ICH, probability of a bleeding disorder causing ICH; testing can be tailored to specific patient factors, and further consultation with a pediatric hematologist is recommended if expanded testing is necessary.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^1161c2nN]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

### Acupuncture in cancer care: recommendations for safe practice (peer-reviewed expert opinion) [^117Hcauu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Modifying acupuncture approaches for specific cancer-related conditions (listed alphabetically)

General recommendation for new unexplained pain or other new symptoms

Severe uncontrolled pain is a medical emergency which should be addressed urgently. New pain or other symptoms (e.g. headache, unexplained nausea, or digestive symptoms) reported by cancer survivors should be investigated thoroughly, by full medical (and radiological, if appropriate) assessment. Care must be taken to ensure they are not a sign of disease progression, recurrence, or onset of second primary cancers, even if acupuncture improves the symptoms.

Once appropriate medical assessment/management is in place and with medical agreement, acupuncture may provide a useful adjunctive symptom management strategy which may help reduce the need, dose, and side effects of analgesic and other medication.

Anti-coagulant therapies

Reports of serious adverse effects from acupuncture in stable anti-coagulated patients are extremely rare. Minor adverse effects which may be more common in anti-coagulated patients include minor bruising and mild, superficial bleeding. Most anti-coagulants (including injectable low molecular weight heparin and direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs)) reach their therapeutic dose immediately but achieving the correct dose of Warfarin often takes more time. Acupuncture should be used with caution if the patient is being anti-coagulated and there are concerns that their anti-coagulation may be unstable, i.e. if the patient has recently been started on Warfarin and they are still in the balancing phase, or their dose has been changed recently, as they may be either under- or over-anti-coagulated. Once the Warfarin dosage is stable and time for blood clotting (as measured by the International Normalised Ratio (INR)) is in the desired range, then acupuncture can be provided with appropriate discussion with the patient of the slightly increased risk of minor bruising or bleeding.

Cachexia/anorexia/low BMI

People with profound cachexia or anorexia and a very low BMI (BMI < 15) have reduced subcutaneous fat and muscle and are theoretically more at risk of needles penetrating an underlying organ, when needling over the front or back of the chest or abdomen. For these patients, superficial rather than deep needling is indicated if using points on the upper torso, including chest, upper trapezius, upper back, and abdomen. Choosing distal points may be a preferable option.

BRUE lower-risk criteria — To be designated lower risk, the following criteria should be met: Age > 60 days; prematurity defined as gestational age ≥ 32 weeks and postconceptional age ≥ 45 weeks; first BRUE (no previous BRUE and not occurring in clusters); duration of event < 1 minute; no CPR required by trained medical provider; no concerning historical features (see Table 2); and no concerning physical examination findings (see Table 3).

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^114VBGBT]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE risk assessment — Patients who have experienced a BRUE may have a recurrent event or an undiagnosed serious condition that confers risk, and by consensus the subcommittee established < 1 minute as the upper limit of a "brief event"; the committee also agreed by consensus that the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be determined by trained medical providers. Infants who do not qualify as lower-risk are, by definition, at higher risk, and thus, pending further research, this guideline does not provide recommendations for the management of the higher-risk infant. The key action statements in this guideline do not apply to higher-risk patients but apply only to infants who meet the lower-risk criteria. Some studies suggest examples of higher risk, including that infants younger than 2 months who experience a BRUE may be more likely to have a congenital or infectious cause and be at higher risk of an adverse outcome, and that infants with multiple events or a concerning social assessment for child abuse may warrant increased observation.

### Clinical presentation of childhood leukaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dm5Nf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Leukaemia is the most common cancer of childhood, accounting for a third of cases. In order to assist clinicians in its early detection, we systematically reviewed all existing data on its clinical presentation and estimated the frequency of signs and symptoms presenting at or prior to diagnosis.

Design

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for all studies describing presenting features of leukaemia in children (0-18years) without date or language restriction, and, when appropriate, meta-analysed data from the included studies.

Results

We screened 12303 abstracts for eligibility and included 33 studies (n = 3084) in the analysis. All were cohort studies without control groups. 95 presenting signs and symptoms were identified and ranked according to frequency. Five features were present in > 50% of children: hepatomegaly (64%), splenomegaly (61%), pallor (54%), fever (53%) and bruising (52%). An additional eight features were present in a third to a half of children: recurrent infections (49%), fatigue (46%), limb pain (43%), hepatosplenomegaly (42%), bruising/petechiae (42%), lymphadenopathy (41%), bleeding tendency (38%) and rash (35%). 6% of children were asymptomatic on diagnosis.

Conclusions

Over 50% of children with leukaemia have palpable livers, palpable spleens, pallor, fever or bruising on diagnosis. Abdominal symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain and abdominal distension are common. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as limp and joint pain also feature prominently. Children with unexplained illness require a thorough history and focused clinical examination, which should include abdominal palpation, palpation for lymphadenopathy and careful scrutiny of the skin. Occurrence of multiple symptoms and signs should alert clinicians to possible leukaemia.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: conditions that predispose to bleeding [^113XhUuw]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Clinical approach to evaluation in suspected abuse with bleeding — In many children with bruising or bleeding concerning for abuse, the evaluation for medical conditions causing or contributing to the findings noted on the physical examination can be completed by assessing the child's presenting symptoms, trauma history, medical history, family history, and medications. Before engaging in a laboratory evaluation, it is important for physicians to consider family history of bleeding or bruising or a history of specific coagulopathies or other conditions with the child's clinical characteristics and/or a previous history of bleeding or bruising; the known presentations and prevalence of the various bleeding disorders, collagen vascular disorders, or other medical conditions under consideration; the medical probability that a specific medical condition might cause or contribute to the child's bleeding or bruising; the statistical characteristics of the proposed laboratory testing; the history of the use of blood products or other factor replacement products that might alter laboratory test results; and the anticipated benefit of identifying conditions that might cause bleeding or bruising.

### Personal practice: how we manage the risk of bleeding and thrombosis in children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [^11149iJ8]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Bleeding and thrombosis are not infrequent problems in children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The exact frequency varies with age, co-morbidity and treatment schedule, but the risk is highest in the first few weeks of treatment when disease and treatment-related haemostatic abnormalities prevail. Recommendations for prevention and management are lacking due to a weak evidence base, resulting in considerable variation in practice. This article describes our personal practice in this area with reference to the available literature on the subject.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Dose: Tell the patient that their dose will be adjusted on a weekly basis until they are on a dose that lowers their platelets to an appropriate level. This will also help the patient to adjust to common side effects. Tell the patient to contact their doctor if they experience tolerability issues, so the dose or dosing frequency can be adjusted [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
Cardiovascular effects: Tell the patient to contact a doctor immediately if they experience chest pain, palpitations, or feel their heartbeat is irregular [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Risk of bleeding: Warn the patient that concomitant aspirin (or other medicines that affect blood clotting) may increase the risk of bleeding. Tell the patient to contact a doctor immediately if they experience signs or symptoms of bleeding (e.g. vomit blood, pass bloody or black stools) or experience unexplained bruising/bruise more easily than usual [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (cyclafem 1 / 35) [^113nqT7x]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Do not use Cyclafem™ 1/35 (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you have any of the following conditions:

A history of heart attack or stroke
Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes
A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs
An inherited problem that makes your blood clot more than normal
Chest pain (angina pectoris)
Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina
Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your healthcare professional)
Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill
Liver tumor (benign or cancerous)
Known or suspected pregnancy

Tell your healthcare professional if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your healthcare professional can recommend a safer method of birth control.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have had:

Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram
Diabetes
Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides
High blood pressure
Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy
Mental depression
Gallbladder, liver, heart or kidney disease
History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods

Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives.

### Identifying serious underlying diagnoses among patients with brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs): a Canadian cohort study [^1131ieEV]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 11 centres within the Canadian Paediatric Inpatient Research Network, including eight children's hospitals and three general hospitals. Annual emergency department (ED) visit volume was between 13 000 and 80 000 patients (median: 49 000). The study protocol has been previously published, and the study is reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement for cohort studies (online supplemental table S1).

Patients were identified using a previously validated approach, based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Canada admission or discharge codes. Health records spanning from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021 were reviewed to determine eligibility. Sampling included all cases within the specified date range, with a cap of 200 patients per site, to prevent the over-representation of any single site. At eight of the 11 sites, every identified patient was reviewed for eligibility. For the remaining three sites exceeding this limit, patients were selected sequentially from a randomised list until the predetermined maximum threshold was met.

Eligibility criteria

The study included infants aged 1–365 days of life who presented to the ED following a BRUE, with no identified clinical cause after a thorough history and physical examination. Exclusion criteria were extreme prematurity (< 28 weeks gestation), newborns on the first day of life, any known pre-existing comorbidity contributing to the BRUE, preceding symptoms, abnormal vital signs on ED presentation or physical examination findings inconsistent with a BRUE diagnosis.

Data collection

Each site designated one to three research assistants trained in data extraction. A sample of local charts (range: 10–37, online supplemental table S2) was assessed by all reviewers at each location, and inter-rater reliability was calculated for key variables (eg, patient eligibility and outcomes of interest), and used to provide further training. Patient and BRUE characteristics not documented in the patient's chart were assumed to be absent. Patients were risk stratified based on current AAP guidelines.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^1157iiUF]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) definition and terminology change: The authors "recommend that the term ALTE no longer be used by the clinicians to describe an event or as a diagnosis", and the term BRUE "should be used to describe events occurring in infants younger than 1 year of age" that are characterized as brief "(lasting < 1 minute but typically < 20–30 seconds)" and resolved, and with "a reassuring history, physical examination, and vital signs at the time of clinical evaluation by trained medical providers". The guideline applies to "infants younger than 1 year", notes that "the presence of respiratory symptoms or fever would preclude classification of an event as a BRUE", and states that BRUEs are also "unexplained". For infants who appear well after such an event, "the risk of a serious underlying disorder or a recurrent event is extremely low".

### Children with signs of abuse: when is it not child abuse? [^113pLK1b]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a problem that is frequently underdiagnosed. Recognition that underdiagnosis of abuse exists has produced a high zeal for identifying cases of child abuse, which has inevitably produced cases of overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis of child abuse is as catastrophic as underdiagnosis. In this case, a family member is often accused of injuring or killing a child at a time when the loss is felt most deeply. This review focuses on 1 specific presentation of child abuse — the child with bruises and bleeding. Many children and adults have coagulation or vascular disorders that predispose them to bruise or bleed excessively with minor trauma. It is very easy for a health care worker to presume that bruising and bleeding is associated with trauma, because the coagulopathies that may explain the findings are often poorly understood. The clinical cases reviewed in this article show the need for an extremely thorough analysis for an underlying bleeding disorder in the bruised or bleeding child being evaluated as a possible victim of child abuse.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^117NMUWa]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction — evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse — notes that "Children often present for medical care with bleeding or bruising that can raise a concern for child abuse" and that "When bleeding or bruising is suspicious for child abuse, careful consideration of medical and nonmedical causes is important". It cautions that "Mistaken diagnosis, whether an inappropriate finding of abuse, a missed case of abuse, or overlooking of a medical cause, can cause harm to the child and his or her family" and that "Infants, in particular, are at high risk of abusive bruising/bleeding; however, bleeding disorders may also present in infancy in a similar manner to abusive bruising or bleeding". Because "The patient's medical and family history of bleeding/bruising, no matter how thorough, cannot completely eliminate a bleeding disorder as the cause of a patient's findings" and "As such, laboratory evaluations are often necessary to detect bleeding disorders", the text emphasizes that "However, the presence of a bleeding disorder does not rule out abuse as the etiology for bruising or bleeding" and "Similarly, the presence of a history of trauma (accidental or nonaccidental) does not exclude the presence of a bleeding disorder or other medical condition". It also states that "recommendations are based on evidence that distinguishes accidental bruising from abusive bruising in children without bleeding disorders and evidence that characterizes bruising in children with congenital bleeding disorders".

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^112N4nts]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — evaluation emphasis and risk cues are outlined as follows: Because "choking and gagging usually indicate common diagnoses such as GER or respiratory infection", their presence "suggests an event was not a BRUE", and the use of "altered level of responsiveness" is identified as "a new criterion". For infants who have experienced a BRUE, "a careful history and physical examination are necessary to characterize the event, assess the risk of recurrence, and determine the presence of an underlying disorder", with recommendations focusing on "infants with a lower risk of a subsequent event or serious underlying disorder", and noting that in the absence of identifiable risk factors, "laboratory studies, imaging studies, and other diagnostic procedures are unlikely to be useful or necessary". If the clinical history or physical examination "reveals abnormalities, the patient may be at higher risk and further evaluation should focus on the specific areas of concern", with examples including that "possible child abuse may be considered" when the history is inconsistent with development or there is unexplained bruising or torn frenulum, "a cardiac arrhythmia may be considered" with a family history of sudden unexplained death in first-degree relatives, and "infection may be considered" with fever or persistent respiratory symptoms.

Results

Cohort description

A total of 1042 patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for BRUE were identified (online supplemental figure S1), with a median age of 41 days (IQR: 13–84 days) (table 1). Prematurity was observed in 152 patients (14.6%), and 320 patients (30.7%) had an abnormal medical history. Abnormal breathing pattern was the most common presentation (65.8%), followed by a change in tone (58.3%). A history of a similar prior event was reported in 343 patients (32.9%). Using the AAP guideline criteria, 977 patients (93.8%) were classified as higher risk BRUE.

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BRUE stratified by the presence of a serious underlying diagnosis

Clinical management

Of the studied cohort, 665 patients were hospitalised (63.8%), with a median length of stay of 1.7 days (IQR: 1.0–3.0 days) (table 2). 67 (10.1%) of hospitalised patients were admitted to the paediatric/neonatal intensive care unit (ICU), including 63 (94%) who were directly admitted from the ED, despite being asymptomatic at the time of presentation. Among the cohort, complications were documented in 162 (15.5%), with false positive testing being the most common (n = 127, 12.2%). A total of 855 patients (82.1%) underwent diagnostic testing, and specialist consultations were conducted with 440 patients (42.2%).

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^111EisZu]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Figure 1 — recommended pathway for evaluation of possible bleeding disorders when child abuse is suspected — directs that when there is a "Clear history of nonabusive trauma or findings of obvious abusive trauma, including but not limited to:

- isolated ear, neck, or genital bruising
- Object or hand-patterned bruising", then "Bleeding disorder evaluation not needed". If that criterion is not met, assess for "Immobile child* or bruising in concerning patterns/locations in a mobile child (see recommendations 2b & 2c)"; when present, proceed with "Immediate Referral to Higher Level of Care, or Obtain: PT, aPTT, VWF antigen, VWF activity (Ristocetin cofactor), Factor VIII level, Factor IX level, Complete blood count with platelet count", and the pathway includes "Consult a pediatric hematologist". If the immobility or concerning-pattern criterion is not met, "Bleeding disorder evaluation not needed", and the footnote clarifies immobility as "Child with age or developmentally related immobility".

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^1144DMLs]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — Strong recommendation: For patients, "most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not". For clinicians, "most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For policy makers, "the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For researchers, "the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations". Conditional recommendation: For patients, "the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For clinicians, "recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, "policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on whether an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented". For researchers, "this recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help to identify possible research gaps".

### Nilotinib (Danziten) [^116Bf9FX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Taking DANZITEN

Advise patients that DANZITEN may not be substitutable, on a milligram per milligram basis, with other nilotinib products. Advise patients to take DANZITEN exactly as prescribed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Advise patients to take DANZITEN doses twice daily approximately 12 hours apart. Advise patients to swallow the tablets whole with water and not to cut, crush, or chew the tablets.

Advise patients to take DANZITEN with or without food. Patients should not consume grapefruit products and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 at any time during DANZITEN treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

If the patient misses a dose of DANZITEN, the patient should take the next scheduled dose at its regular time. The patient should not take two doses at the same time.

 Compliance

Advise patients of the following:

- Continue taking DANZITEN every day for as long as their doctor tells them.

- This is a long-term treatment.

- Do not change dose or stop taking DANZITEN without first consulting their doctor.

Myelosuppression

Advise patients that treatment with nilotinib can cause serious thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms suggestive of low blood counts occur, such as fever, chills or other signs of infection, unexplained bleeding or bruising, or unexplained weakness or shortness of breath [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^112fKJwN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A simple, accurate and easy-to-apply BCDR to identify children at risk of abuse has the potential to save lives. TEN4, developed and validated in a hospital setting, is now being used in a wider population, including primary care and non-trauma settings. Therefore, it is vital that it is tested among these populations. This study has reiterated that any bruise in a pre-mobile child, or in the TEN locations in a mobile child with more than one bruise, should prompt investigations. It does not automatically imply the child has been abused. TEN4 did not discriminate those with an IBD from abuse, and screening for IBD must always be considered.

### Chronic neutrophilic leukemia: new science and new diagnostic criteria [^115KWWGf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical features

CNL is a clinically heterogeneous disease which may present as incidental neutrophilic leukocytosis on a routine blood count or alternatively with a spectrum of constitutional symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, bone pain, easy bruising, pruritus, or gout. The majority of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Of presenting clinical manifestations, fatigue appears to be the most common. In a series of 14 molecularly defined CNL patients, 71% had antecedent chronic leukocytosis lasting a median of 12.5 months (range 5–84 months). Clinical examination may reveal splenomegaly (present in 36% in one series) involving primarily red pulp cords and sinuses, and/or hepatomegaly, but as in CML, lymph node involvement remains relatively uncommon.

There is substantial evidence for an association of CNL with a hemorrhagic diathesis. Reports as early as 1979 describe an "unexplained hemorrhagic tendency" in a portion of CNL patientswhich has been reiterated in later reports. including a considerable number of cases of cerebral hemorrhage. In a report by Bohm, of 14 new cases of CNL reviewed of which 10 had died (mean survival time 14.7 months), the most frequent cause of death was in fact cerebral hemorrhage, seen in six cases. Mechanistically, this bleeding diathesis has been attributed to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and/or potentially to vascular wall infiltration by neoplastic cells. It has been suggested that patients displaying bleeding complications out of proportion to their platelet count be evaluated for acquired von Willebrand's disease and other acquired coagulation and platelet function disorders.

### Brief resolved unexplained event: not just a new name for apparent life-threatening event [^117W9hXd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate patients who presented to the pediatric emergency department with an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) to (1) determine if these patients would meet the criteria for brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE), a new term coined by the American Academy of Pediatrics in May, 2016; (2) risk stratify these patients to determine if they meet the BRUE low-risk criteria; and (3) evaluate outcomes of patients meeting the criteria for BRUE.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who presented to a large urban academic center pediatric emergency department with an ALTE from January 2013 to May 2015 (before the publication of the BRUE guideline). Children ≤ 12 months of age were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision. Two physician reviews were performed to determine if patients met the ALTE diagnostic criteria. Data were then extracted from these charts to complete objectives.

Results

Seventy-eight patients met the diagnostic criteria for ALTE. Only 1 of those patients met the diagnostic criteria for BRUE, but not for low-risk BRUE. This patient underwent an extensive inpatient evaluation and was eventually discharged after monitoring with a benign diagnosis. Most patients did not meet the criteria for BRUE because the event was not unexplained.

Conclusions

Only 1 patient who presented to the ED with ALTE met the criteria for BRUE, and this patient did not meet the low-risk criteria. This study corroborates previous research on BRUE and continues to highlight the importance of conducting a thorough history and physical examination on all patients presenting to the ED with concerning events.

### Five hematologic tests and treatments to question [^117W5ik7]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Choosing Wisely(®) is a medical stewardship initiative led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in collaboration with professional medical societies in the United States. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) released its first Choosing Wisely(®) list in 2013. Using the same evidence-based methodology as in 2013, ASH has identified 5 additional tests and treatments that should be questioned by clinicians and patients under specific, indicated circumstances. The ASH 2014 Choosing Wisely(®) recommendations include: (1) do not anticoagulate for more than 3 months in patients experiencing a first venous thromboembolic event in the setting of major, transient risk factors for venous thromboembolism; (2) do not routinely transfuse for chronic anemia or uncomplicated pain crises in patients with sickle cell disease; (3) do not perform baseline or surveillance computed tomography scans in patients with asymptomatic, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (4) do not test or treat for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia if the clinical pretest probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is low; and (5) do not treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia unless they are bleeding or have very low platelet counts.

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^114SW5HQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Any bruise in a pre-mobile child was strongly predictive of abuse/IBD and bruising in the TEN locations favoured abuse/IBD in mobile children who had more than one bruise recorded. When multiple bruises were recorded in the TEN locations, the likelihood of abuse over IBD increased. However, the poor discrimination between abuse and IBD reiterates the need for a haematological investigation in a child with concerning bruising.

The strong association between any bruise in a pre-mobile child and abuse is well established. Such infants rarely sustain accidental bruises. A recent studyof the causes of bruising in pre-mobile infants highlighted that 54% (26/46) of those with unexplained bruises were found to have been abused. On further investigation, 43% (27/63) of infants with initially 'explained' bruises were recognised as being abused. It is notable that 38% of the abused infants only had a single bruise.

It was unsurprising that the TEN4 bruise categorisation could not discriminate between abuse and IBD, as it was not designed to do so. Widespread bruises occur in both conditions. It was notable, however, that when there were more bruises in the TEN locations, the association with abuse was stronger than with IBD. Jackson et al have previously highlighted the overlap between IBD and suspected abuse, whereby 15% (29/189) of children with IBD had initially presented with bruising concerning for abuse, 79% (23/29) of whom were younger than 5 years. Investigations of any child with bruising must include a screen for IBD. It must also be remembered that both conditions can co-exist.

In this dataset, a mobile child (or one older than 4 months) with a single bruise in a TEN location only was more likely to be found in the accidental than the abuse group and the TEN bruise distribution had no power to discriminate either abuse or IBD from accidental injury in these children.

### Bruising: a neglected, though patient-relevant complication of insulin injections coming to light from a real-life nationwide survey [^112b7bNM]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study was conducted in a specialized setting and using strict methodology to confirm that missing site rotation and needle reuse are significant risk factors for LH. The close relationship between LH and poor metabolic control could suggest that all patients with clear-cut difficulties in achieving optimal control should be checked systematically for LH presence at all insulin injection sites. The same applies to those who experience frequent unexplained hypos or large GV.

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^113YbSJa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In young children who present with concerning patterns of bruising, the differential diagnosis includes accidental injury, physical abuse and coagulation disorders such as inherited bleeding disorders (IBDs). The clinician must identify the cause of the bruising and decide whether the child requires further clinical or child protection investigations.

In 2010, Pierce et al published a pilot study "discriminating bruising characteristics, to model those findings into a decision tool for screening children at high risk for abuse". The Bruise Clinical Decision Rule (BCDR) was developed from 71 children (42 had been abused) admitted to paediatric intensive care units with trauma and examined for bruising. The TEN4 BCDR emerged whereby "bruising on the torso, ear, or neck for a child < 48 months of age and bruising in any region for an infant < 4 months of age, in the absence of a publicly witnessed injury" had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 84% for predicting abuse. TEN4 is gaining momentum internationally as a recommended decision rule across a wider population of children.

We previously described the pattern of bruising in three groups of children: those with suspected abuse, bruises from day-to-day activities and accidents, and children with IBD. This study uses the datasets from these three publications to determine whether the categorisation of bruising used in the TEN4 BCDR can differentiate between these three conditions.

### Can TEN4 distinguish bruises from abuse, inherited bleeding disorders or accidents? [^1134JHNq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Bruising is the most common presentation of accidents, physical abuse and inherited bleeding disorder in young children, and clinicians must differentiate between these three conditions.
The TEN4 bruising clinical decision rule (sensitivity 97%, specificity 84% for abuse in paediatric intensive care unit) is being used in wider clinical settings.
It is important to test the rule in these wider settings.

What this study adds?

These data support further child protection investigations of a positive TEN4 screen in a pre-mobile child and a mobile child with more than one bruise.
TEN4 did not discriminate between inherited bleeding disorder (IBD) and abuse, thus IBD must be excluded in these children.
Estimated sensitivity (68.8%) of TEN4 and specificity (72.1%) for abuse was appreciably lower in this study than previously reported.

- Unusual bruising (bruises that appear without known cause or that get bigger)

- Pink or brown urine

- Red or black, tarry stools

- Coughing up blood

- Vomiting blood, or vomit that looks like coffee grounds

Instruct patients to call their healthcare provider or to get prompt medical attention if they experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding:

- Pain, swelling or discomfort in a joint

- Headaches, dizziness, or weakness

- Reoccurring nose bleeds

- Unusual bleeding from gums

- Bleeding from a cut that takes a long time to stop

- Menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

If patients have had neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, and particularly, if they are taking concomitant NSAIDs or platelet inhibitors, advise patients to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematoma, such as back pain, tingling, numbness (especially in the lower limbs), muscle weakness, and stool or urine incontinence. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to contact his or her physician immediately [see Boxed Warning].

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^111dZpXW]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse — bruising or bleeding in a child can raise the concern for child abuse, and assessing whether findings are the result of trauma and/or a bleeding disorder is critical. Many bleeding disorders are rare, and not every child with bruising or bleeding that raises concern for abuse requires an evaluation for bleeding disorders. Bleeding disorders cannot be ruled out solely on the basis of patient and family history, and the history and clinical evaluation can be used to determine the necessity of an evaluation for a possible bleeding disorder, with prevalence and known clinical presentations guiding the extent of laboratory testing. Significant variability exists in the evaluation of suspected child abuse, and this clinical report aims to reduce variability by providing guidance when suspicious bruising or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is present. On the basis of recent data, it provides updated recommendations for evaluating bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse and identifying bruising that is suspicious for child abuse.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^111baYXj]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Bruising — assessment focus and when laboratory evaluation is generally not needed: Recommendation 2 states that if a child has bruising that is concerning for abuse, the assessment of the need for laboratory testing for bleeding disorders should focus on the specific history offered to explain the bruising, the location and pattern of bruising, and mobility and developmental status of the child. Recommendation 2a specifies that an evaluation for a bleeding disorder is generally not needed when the caregivers' description of trauma sufficiently explains the bruising, when the child or an independent witness can provide a history of abuse or nonabusive trauma that explains the bruising, when object or hand-patterned bruising is present, or when there is bruising to the ears, neck, or genitals. Clinicians should consider that the injury history offered by caregivers might be purposefully misleading if the caregivers have caused the bruising by abusive means, and the text notes that in some cases the constellation of findings with clinical history and physical examination can be so strongly consistent with an abusive injury that further laboratory investigation for medical conditions is not warranted, with the example that a child with a patterned slap mark who describes being hit with an open hand does not require a laboratory evaluation for a bleeding disorder.

Autoimmunity

Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider promptly if they experience any symptoms of potential autoimmune disease. Give examples of important symptoms such as bleeding, easy bruising, petechiae, purpura, hematuria, edema, jaundice, or hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Advise patients of the importance of monthly blood and urine tests for 48 months following the last course of LEMTRADA to monitor for signs of autoimmunity because early detection and prompt treatment can help prevent serious and potentially fatal outcomes associated with these events. Advise patients that monitoring may need to continue past 48 months if they have signs or symptoms of autoimmunity.
Advise patients that LEMTRADA may cause hyperthyroid or hypothyroid disorders.
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms reflective of a potential thyroid disorder such as unexplained weight loss or gain, fast heartbeat or palpitations, nervousness, worsening tiredness, eye swelling, constipation, or feeling cold.
Advise women of childbearing potential of the risks of pregnancy with concomitant thyroid disease. Advise women of childbearing potential to discuss pregnancy planning with their doctor.
Cases of autoimmune hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider right away if they develop signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice and/or dark urine, or bleeding or bruising more easily than normal.
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acquired hemophilia A such as spontaneous bruising, nose bleeds, painful or swollen joints, other types of bleeding, or bleeding from a cut that may take longer than usual to stop.
Advise patients that cases of autoimmune encephalitis can occur after receiving LEMTRADA. This condition may include symptoms such as behavior and psychiatric changes, movement disorders, short-term memory loss or seizures, as well as other symptoms that may resemble an MS relapse.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^115c1zHv]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child physical abuse — laboratory screening key points emphasize that laboratory studies are an important part of the forensic evaluation for injuries in all patients with suspected PCA, and child physical abuse can occur in the presence of an underlying medical disorder; the mere presence of hemophilia or metabolic bone disease does not exclude the diagnosis of child physical abuse. Obtain serum transaminases (AST/ ALT), lipase, hematocrit, and urinalysis in all children undergoing forensic evaluation for child physical abuse. Evaluate serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D levels in cases of unexplained fracture. Obtain specific recommended coagulation studies in all children with "spontaneous" or unexplained hemorrhage, including bruising and intracranial hemorrhage without fracture. Specific laboratory screening is designed to minimize the use of high-dose ionizing radiation from routine CT in all patients while avoiding missed injuries.

### Validation of a clinical decision rule to predict abuse in young children based on bruising characteristics [^111C6KYM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study of patients younger than 4.0 years with bruising. The children presented to 1 of the following 5 pediatric emergency departments: Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Norton Children's Hospital, Rady Children's Hospital, or the University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital. All are tertiary care hospitals with differing patient demographics. This study was approved by the internal review boards at each site. We excluded children with injuries from motor vehicle crashes, known coagulation abnormalities, preexisting severe neuromuscular impairment resulting in spasticity, or severe extensive skin disorders because these conditions would impact expected bruise occurrence and characteristics. All other children had a deliberate skin examination performed by their emergency department practitioners to assess for bruising. Children with at least 1 bruise were eligible for enrollment. Research team members collected data on consecutive patients who underwent a consultation for possible child abuse. A waiver of authorization was granted to allow the research team to abstract data without interfering with the evaluation process. For patients not undergoing an abuse evaluation, the research team obtained written informed consent to collect data designed to parallel the extensive and detailed data collected for abuse consultations. For these patients, we used a structured sampling approach with research shifts as a feasible proxy to consecutive enrollment. Data were deidentified. Methods for our structured sampling enrollment are detailed in a previous publication. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^114sfexX]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This is the first clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics that specifically applies to patients who have experienced an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). This clinical practice guideline has 3 objectives. First, it recommends the replacement of the term ALTE with a new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). Second, it provides an approach to patient evaluation that is based on the risk that the infant will have a repeat event or has a serious underlying disorder. Finally, it provides management recommendations, or key action statements, for lower-risk infants. The term BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of the following: (1) cyanosis or pallor; (2) absent, decreased, or irregular breathing; (3) marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia); and (4) altered level of responsiveness. A BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination. By using this definition and framework, infants younger than 1 year who present with a BRUE are categorized either as (1) a lower-risk patient on the basis of history and physical examination for whom evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management are offered or (2) a higher-risk patient whose history and physical examination suggest the need for further investigation and treatment but for whom recommendations are not offered. This clinical practice guideline is intended to foster a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce unnecessary and costly medical interventions, improve patient outcomes, support implementation, and provide direction for future research. Each key action statement indicates a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^112Hq19F]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Nonmobile children with bruising — simultaneous evaluations and features suggesting a bleeding disorder: Recommendation 2b states that if a nonmobile child has bruising and there is no history of an independently witnessed accidental cause or a known medical cause, an evaluation for bleeding disorders should be conducted simultaneous to a child abuse evaluation. The text adds that any bruising in a nonmobile child is highly concerning for abuse, that bruising in a young infant could also be the first presentation of a bleeding disorder, and that in young infants or children with developmental delays with minimal or no mobility who present with bruising it is recommended that an evaluation for bleeding disorders occur simultaneous to an abuse evaluation. In nonmobile children, bleeding disorders can present with bruising or petechiae in sites of normal handling or pressure, including petechiae at clothing line pressure sites, bruising at sites of object pressure such as in the pattern and location of infant seat fasteners, and excessive diffuse bruising/bleeding if the child has a severe bleeding disorder; absence of these examples does not rule out a bleeding disorder, but their presence might increase the probability of a bleeding disorder.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^116ydh5C]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Guidance for pediatricians — In children who have bruising or bleeding that is suspicious for abuse: complete medical, trauma, and family histories, screening for unusual or restrictive diets, and a thorough physical examination are critical tools, but family and patient medical history alone have not been shown to effectively predict the presence of a bleeding disorder (Recommendation 1). In each case, careful consideration of the possibility of a medical condition causing the bleeding/bruising is essential, and specific elements of the history, developmental status of the child, and characteristics of the bleeding/bruising can be used to determine the need for a laboratory evaluation for bleeding disorders (Recommendations 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4). If evaluation indicates a need for laboratory testing for bleeding disorders, initial testing is focused on condition prevalence and potential to cause the specific findings; tests should be chosen on the basis of their ability to detect specific bleeding disorders that may cause the findings, and in some cases testing may be tailored on the basis of the history, findings, and patient characteristics (Recommendations 5, 6, 8, 9, and 9a). Consultation with child abuse pediatricians and/or pediatric hematologists should be strongly considered in children with bruising/bleeding concerning for abuse, including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and particularly in cases of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) (Recommendation 7). Laboratory testing suggesting or indicating the presence of a bleeding disorder does not eliminate abuse from consideration, and in children with bruising and laboratory testing suggestive of a bleeding disorder, a follow-up evaluation after a change in home setting can provide valuable information regarding the likelihood of a bleeding disorder causing the concerning findings (Recommendation 8a). Children with ICH often receive blood product transfusions, and it is suggested that testing for bleeding disorders in these patients be delayed until elimination of the transfused blood clotting elements (Recommendation 9b). The discovery of new information regarding condition prevalence, laboratory testing, and clinical presentations of bleeding disorders is to be expected, and close collaboration with a pediatric hematologist may be necessary (Recommendation 7).

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^111ChdSx]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lower-risk BRUE — brief monitoring and observation: Clinicians may briefly monitor infants presenting with a lower-risk BRUE with continuous pulse oximetry and serial observations (Grade D, Weak Recommendation). A normal physical examination, including vital signs and oximetry, is needed for a patient who has experienced a BRUE to be considered lower-risk. Pulse oximetry identified more infants with concerning paroxysmal events than cardiorespiratory monitoring alone, and clinicians may choose to monitor and provide serial examinations of infants in the lower-risk group for a brief period of time, ranging from 1 to 4 hours, to establish that the vital signs, physical examination, and symptomatology remain stable.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^111mPXmi]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) definition — Clinicians should use the term BRUE to describe an event occurring in an infant < 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered level of responsiveness. Moreover, clinicians should diagnose a BRUE only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^1138hsiC]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely that a fraction of them might have a relevant provoking cofactor represented by thrombophilia. Others might be worried by the cost associated with testing for thrombophilia; for them, we note that irrespective of whether thrombophilia testing results will be used to start or withhold treatment, the cost of testing is negligible compared with the cost of lifelong anticoagulation (which we considered in our process), likely even after including indirect costs stemming from the treatment of additional events in untreated patients (which we did not consider). Finally, someone might be confused by having "divergent" recommendations for the same condition (thrombosis at unusual sites) depending on the standard of care adopted in a specific setting, whereby testing for thrombophilia is recommended to prolong treatment where the standard of care is short-term treatment duration and not recommended when the standard of care is long-term treatment for everyone. Under the perspective of choosing the best management option for patients with thrombophilia, patients with thrombophilia will indeed receive indefinite treatment because of both recommendations (because of testing in 1 case and regardless of testing in the other). Again, this is the result of a robust, pragmatic, and logical process that assessed the value of testing within the context in which the results of testing will be used.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations

The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends".) or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has the following interpretation:

Strong recommendation

- **For patients**: most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.
- **For clinicians**: most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.
- **For researchers**: the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations.

Conditional recommendation

- **For patients**: most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For clinicians**: clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that they must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on whether an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented.
- **For researchers**: this recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps.

### Unexpected diagnosis in an adolescent with bruises and ecchymosis: celiac disease [^11139j62]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acquired coagulopathy is a rare but challenging diagnosis for pediatric emergency physicians. Although the coagulopathy usually presents with mild skin and mucosal hemorrhages, it also can lead to life-threatening events. Thus, accurate interpretation of hints obtained from a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory findings is essential for the prompt diagnosis and management. This case demonstrates an uncommon cause of coagulopathy; celiac disease that presented with spontaneous bruises and ecchymosis in an adolescent.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: conditions that predispose to bleeding [^116AwA5r]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Clinical characteristics — nonintracranial bleeding — The age and developmental capabilities of the child, history of trauma, and the location and pattern of bruising often provide significant evidence in determining the presence of abusive injury, and in many cases the constellation of findings, taken in conjunction with the clinical history, can be so strongly consistent with abusive injury that a further laboratory investigation for medical conditions is not warranted. For instance, in a verbal child with a patterned slap mark who describes being hit with an open hand at the location of the slap mark, obtaining tests to rule out a bleeding disorder is unlikely to provide useful information; however, because few data exist comparing the specific clinical presentations of bleeding disorders and abuse, in some cases a laboratory evaluation might be necessary to minimize the chances of a misdiagnosis. The presence of a bleeding disorder or other medical condition does not rule out abuse as the etiology for bruising or bleeding, and other symptoms, such as hematemesis, hematochezia, and oronasal bleeding, can be caused by abuse or a bleeding disorder.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — For patients, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas a conditional recommendation means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not" and "Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risk, values, and preferences". For clinicians, strong implies "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional notes "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For policy makers, strong means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional states "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation", while conditional notes "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research.

### Brief resolved unexplained events: analysis of an apparent life threatening event database [^114MLTPs]. Academic Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the proportion of patients previously diagnosed with apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) who would meet criteria for brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) and to identify rates of adverse outcomes in subgroups: ALTE not meeting criteria for BRUE, lower-risk BRUE, and higher-risk ALTE.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a single-center prospective registry of patients diagnosed with ALTE in a tertiary care emergency department from March 1, 1997 to October 31, 2007. We identified the proportion of patients meeting criteria for BRUE, and the proportion of patients with BRUE meeting lower-risk criteria. We assessed outcomes of patients in subgroups.

Results

Seven hundred and sixty-two patients were included. Adverse outcomes included recurrent ALTE (n = 49), aspiration (n = 9), trauma (n = 8), and death (n = 4). Three hundred and twenty-six of 762 (42.8%) met criteria for BRUE. Seventy of 326 (21.5%) met criteria for lower-risk BRUE. Adverse outcomes occurred in 40 of 436 (9.2%) with ALTE not meeting criteria for BRUE, 2 of 70 (2.9%) with lower-risk BRUE, and 23 of 256 (9.0%) with higher-risk BRUE. Of 4 patients who died, 1 had an ALTE not meeting criteria for BRUE and 3 had non-lower-risk BRUE. The BRUE risk criteria identified all BRUE patients that died or had substantial morbidity as higher-risk.

Conclusions

Less than half of patients with ALTE meet criteria for BRUE. Of those who do, one-fifth is lower-risk. In this series, the risk-stratification in the BRUE criteria identified those patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes. Further research is required to risk-stratify patients with BRUE.
