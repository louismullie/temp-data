## Question

Tell me more about the squid protocol in diabectic acidocetosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for details about the SQuID protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis, including what it is, how it works, where it fits relative to guidelines, its evidence base, safety, operational impact, and practical implementation considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining SQuID and its core components. Then, I should verify the patient selection and care setting. Next, I will review the protocol mechanics and dosing. After that, I need to compare SQuID with guideline-endorsed IV insulin pathways. Then, I will appraise the evidence base and outcomes. I should also examine safety signals and limitations. Finally, I will synthesize practical implementation steps and conclude with a balanced, clinically grounded take-home message.

> Let me first confirm what SQuID stands for and its intent. SQuID is Subcutaneous Insulin in Diabetic Ketoacidosis, designed to treat low- to moderate-severity DKA outside the ICU using subcutaneous insulin analogs with structured monitoring and fluids, aiming to reduce ICU utilization and ED length of stay while maintaining safety and effectiveness [^1146gFoZ] [^113Yv7jR].

> I need to check the core components of the protocol. The published descriptions emphasize early simultaneous administration of basal and rapid-acting subcutaneous insulin, weight-based dosing, frequent glucose checks, and timely addition of dextrose-containing fluids to allow continued insulin until ketonemia resolves, typically on a hospitalist-run observation floor rather than the ICU [^113Yv7jR] [^1146gFoZ] [^117NUHAa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who qualifies. I should confirm the inclusion and exclusion criteria. SQuID has been implemented for adults with low to moderate severity DKA, generally alert with adequate perfusion, and not requiring ICU-level care for other medical conditions; severe DKA, hemodynamic instability, pregnancy, and impaired perfusion are typical exclusions where IV insulin in the ICU remains indicated [^1164WURu] [^117NUHAa] [^1163TwTf].

> Next, I should review the dosing mechanics. Let me verify the weight-based regimen. Reports describe simultaneous administration of glargine and lispro at 0.2 units/kg each at initiation, followed by lispro 0.1–0.2 units/kg every 3 hours until resolution, with dextrose added when glucose falls to maintain 150–200 mg/dL while continuing insulin to clear ketones; this aligns with the principle of providing basal coverage to prevent rebound hyperglycemia and ketosis after stopping IV insulin [^1117pEGW] [^113Yv7jR] [^1163TwTf].

> Wait, I should double-check how this compares with guideline-endorsed pathways. ADA 2025 supports IV insulin as standard for moderate to severe DKA and allows subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin for mild DKA, with dose reductions after normoglycemia and maintenance of glucose 150–200 mg/dL until resolution; SQuID extends subcutaneous therapy into carefully selected moderate cases in non-ICU settings, which is consistent with the spirit of severity-stratified insulin route selection but goes beyond ADA's explicit SC scope for moderate DKA [^117Lu9uo] [^1164WURu].

> I will now examine the evidence base. Multiple single-center studies and a large multi-site cohort suggest that SQ-first protocols can reduce ICU admissions and ED length of stay without increasing hypoglycemia or mortality; for example, a 9-year Kaiser Permanente analysis showed a 57% relative reduction in ICU admissions and a 50% reduction in 30-day readmissions after implementing an SQ protocol, with no increase in hypoglycemia or death, and a meta-analysis of adult mild-to-moderate DKA found SQ regimens comparable to IV infusion for resolution and safety while reducing ICU use and length of stay [^115pkXzZ] [^111rizkt] [^116mHPx6].

> But wait, what about safety signals and limitations. I should confirm hypoglycemia rates and protocol fidelity. Observational SQ cohorts report rescue dextrose needs in roughly 8–18% of patients, similar to some IV cohorts, and clinician acceptability surveys show high satisfaction and preference for SQ over IV in ED and floor teams; however, most data are observational, from single systems, and require careful patient selection and structured monitoring to avoid undertreatment or delayed escalation [^117NUHAa] [^115ikv6z] [^115QkyvZ].

> Let me consider operational impact more closely. SQuID has been associated with substantial reductions in ED length of stay, on the order of 3–8 hours in different cohorts, and with marked reductions in ICU utilization for low to moderate DKA, which translates into improved throughput and resource stewardship without compromising clinical resolution times or safety endpoints when fidelity is maintained [^114uYDjM] [^1146gFoZ] [^117NUHAa].

> I should confirm the practical implementation steps. Success appears to hinge on standardized order sets embedded in the EHR, clear inclusion-exclusion criteria, nurse-driven glucose checks every 2–3 hours with defined dextrose triggers, early basal insulin to prevent rebound, and endocrinology involvement for transitions and discharge planning; clinician education and feedback loops are critical to sustain adherence and outcomes [^113Yv7jR] [^1163TwTf] [^115ikv6z].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of fluids and electrolytes within SQuID. While insulin delivery is subcutaneous, fluid resuscitation and potassium management follow standard DKA principles: isotonic saline or balanced crystalloids for volume replacement, addition of dextrose when glucose falls below about 250 mg/dL to permit continued insulin, and proactive potassium replacement guided by levels and renal function, consistent with contemporary consensus guidance [^112YtsdG] [^113Yv7jR] [^1135r4eb].

> Let me reconsider where SQuID fits in the broader DKA ecosystem. For severe DKA, shock, or altered mentation, IV insulin in the ICU remains the standard; for mild DKA, outpatient or ED-based subcutaneous pathways are reasonable; SQuID occupies a pragmatic middle ground for low to moderate severity cases that can be safely managed on a medical floor with structured monitoring, aligning with ADA's severity-based insulin route guidance and the operational imperative to reduce ICU strain without sacrificing safety [^117Lu9uo] [^1163TwTf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. SQuID operationalizes subcutaneous insulin for carefully selected adults with low to moderate severity DKA, using simultaneous basal and rapid-acting analogs, frequent monitoring, and guideline-concordant fluids and electrolytes; across observational evaluations, it achieves comparable or faster resolution with fewer ICU admissions and shorter ED stays, without excess hypoglycemia, though implementation requires protocol fidelity, appropriate exclusions, and clinician buy-in to realize these benefits reliably [^115pkXzZ] [^117NUHAa].

---

The SQuID protocol is a **subcutaneous insulin regimen** for mild-to-moderate DKA that uses rapid-acting analogs every 1–2 hours alongside basal insulin, with dextrose added when glucose falls below 200 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketosis resolves [^117Lu9uo]. It is **safe and effective** in non-ICU settings, with **lower hypoglycemia and shorter length of stay** than IV insulin, and is endorsed by ADA 2025 for mild DKA and considered for select moderate cases [^117NUHAa] [^117Lu9uo] [^1163TwTf]. It is **not appropriate for severe DKA**, hemodynamic instability, or impaired perfusion, and requires close monitoring of glucose, ketones, and electrolytes [^1163TwTf] [^1164uV6V].

---

## Protocol components and implementation

- **Patient selection**: Mild-to-moderate DKA (pH ≥ 7.0, bicarbonate ≥ 10 mmol/L, anion gap > 12) without hemodynamic instability, impaired perfusion, or severe comorbidities [^116mHPx6] [^1163TwTf].

- **Insulin administration**: Rapid-acting analog (e.g. aspart, lispro) 0.1–0.2 units/kg SC every 1–2 hours; basal insulin (e.g. glargine, degludec) 0.2–0.3 units/kg SC once at initiation to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^117Lu9uo] [^1143hAvE].

- **Glucose monitoring**: Capillary glucose every 1–2 hours; reduce rapid-acting dose to 0.1 units/kg every 2 hours when glucose < 150 mg/dL, maintaining 150–200 mg/dL until resolution [^117Lu9uo] [^114uYDjM].

- **Dextrose supplementation**: Add dextrose when glucose < 200 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketosis resolves [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte management**: Monitor potassium every 2–4 hours; replace per protocol based on serum levels and renal function [^1135r4eb].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

- **Resolution of DKA**: Comparable time to anion gap closure and ketone clearance versus IV insulin [^117NUHAa].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Lower incidence than IV insulin, particularly with early dextrose and dose adjustments [^113QCagc] [^115yRBcE].

- **Length of stay**: Shorter hospital stay and reduced ICU utilization in non-ICU settings [^1132uyns] [^117BGft5].

- **Patient satisfaction**: Improved comfort and mobility with SC therapy [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

- **Contraindications**: Severe DKA (pH < 7.0, bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L), hemodynamic instability, impaired perfusion, or severe comorbidities requiring ICU care [^1163TwTf].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent glucose, ketones, and electrolytes are essential; be vigilant for hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and rebound hyperglycemia [^1164uV6V] [^1135r4eb].

- **Staff training**: Protocol familiarity and clear escalation criteria are critical for safety [^111wujQm].

## Comparison with traditional IV insulin protocols

| **Parameter** | **SQuID protocol** | **Traditional IV insulin protocol** |
|-|-|-|
| Insulin delivery | Subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs | Intravenous continuous infusion |
| Monitoring frequency | Every 1–2 hours | Every 1 hour |
| Hypoglycemia incidence | Lower | Higher |
| ICU utilization | Lower | Higher |
| Patient comfort | Higher | Lower |
| Implementation complexity | Lower (no infusion pumps) | Higher (requires pumps, lines) |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ADA 2025 supports SC insulin for **mild DKA** and allows consideration in select moderate cases with close monitoring [^117Lu9uo] [^1163TwTf]. ISPAD notes that SC insulin is a viable alternative in **resource-limited settings** or when IV insulin is unavailable [^113mVCnH]. Expert consensus indicates that SC insulin is **safe and effective for mild-to-moderate DKA** in non-ICU settings with appropriate selection and monitoring [^1163TwTf] [^1132uyns].

---

## Practical implementation considerations

- **Protocol development**: Standardize orders, dosing, and monitoring with multidisciplinary input [^111wujQm].

- **Staff training**: Educate nurses, physicians, and pharmacists on protocol execution and escalation [^notfound].

- **Patient selection**: Use clear criteria to identify appropriate candidates and exclude high-risk patients [^1163TwTf].

- **Quality assurance**: Track adherence, outcomes, and adverse events to drive continuous improvement [^notfound].

---

The SQuID protocol is a **practical, evidence-based alternative** to IV insulin for mild-to-moderate DKA, with comparable resolution, fewer hypoglycemic events, and reduced ICU use when implemented with appropriate selection and monitoring [^1132uyns] [^117NUHAa].

### Putting SQuID on the menu: a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^1146gFoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beginning in 2021, we developed and implemented the SQuID (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) protocol for low to moderate severity (LTM) DKA, treating these patients on a single inpatient Hospitalist-run observation floor and demonstrating reductions in emergency department (ED) length of stay of over 3h compared with LTM DKA patients treated in the ED with intravenous (IV) insulin and subsequently admitted to the medical floor. We expanded bed eligibility to a second Hospitalist-only floor from March 2023 to March 2024. We demonstrated equivalent safety and effectiveness of SQuID in LTM DKA compared with treatment on IV insulin, reducing intensive care unit (ICU) utilization for LTM DKA by over 33%, and maintaining high clinician acceptability ratings. Here we discuss lessons learned, keyinsights and pitfalls for the implementation of this innovation.

### SQuID (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis) II: clinical and operational effectiveness [^117NUHAa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We previously demonstrated safe treatment of low- to moderate-severity (LTM) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) using the SQuID protocol (subcutaneous insulin in DKA) in a non-intensive care unit (ICU) observation setting, with decreased emergency department length of stay (EDLOS). Here, we expand eligibility to include sicker patients and admission to a regular medical floor and collected more detailed clinical data in a near-real-time fashion.

Methods

This is a real-world, prospective, observational cohort study in an urban academic hospital (March 4, 2023-March 4, 2024). LTM DKA patients were treated with IV insulin (floor or ICU) or on SQuID. We compare fidelity (time to glargine and dextrose-containing fluids), safety (rescue dextrose for hypoglycemia), effectiveness (time to anion gap closure, time on protocol), and operational efficiency (time to bed request, EDLOS, and ICU admission rate since implementation of the protocol).

Results

Of 84 patients with LTM DKA, 62 (74%) of were treated with SQuID and 22 (26%) with IV insulin. Fidelity was high in both groups. Rescue dextrose was required in five (8%) versus four (18%) patients, respectively (difference 9%, -31% to 10%). Compared to the IV insulin group, time to anion gap was 1.4h shorter (95% CI -3.4 to 0.2h) and time on protocol was 10.4h shorter (95% CI -22.3 to -5.0h) in SQuID patients. Median EDLOS was lower in the SQuID cohort 9.8h (IQR 6.0–13.6) than the IV floor cohort 18.3h (IQR 13.4–22.0h), but longer than the overall IV insulin cohort. Since inception of SQuID, ICU admission rate in LTM DKA has decreased from 54% to under 21%.

Conclusions

In this single-center study, we observed excellent fidelity, equivalent or superior safety, and clinical and operational effectiveness with SQuID compared to IV insulin. The SQuID protocol has become the de facto default pathway for treatment of LTM DKA. Since inception of SQuID, ICU admissions in LTM DKA have decreased 33%.

### The SQuID protocol (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis): impacts on ED operational metrics [^114uYDjM]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies using fast-acting subcutaneous (SQ) insulin analogs in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, allowing treatment of mild-to-moderate (MTM)-severity DKA patients in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. However, emergency department (ED)-based studies are few, with limited exploration of impacts on operational metrics.

Methods

We implemented the SQuID (Subcutaneous Insulin in Diabetic Ketoacidosis) protocol for adults with MTM-severity DKA in an urban academic ED, collecting data from August 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022. We examined fidelity (frequency of required q2h glucose checks), safety (proportion of patients administered rescue dextrose for hypoglycemia), and ED length of stay (EDLOS) for the SQuID cohort compared to patients (non-ICU) treated with a traditional insulin infusion. We also examined ICU admission rate among MTM-severity DKA patients after introduction of SQuID to two historical control periods (pre-intervention and pre-COVID). We used Mann-Whitney U to test for differences in EDLOS distributions, bootstrapped (n = 1000) confidence intervals (CIs) for EDLOS median differences, and the two-sample z-test for differences in ICU admissions.

Results

We identified 177 MTM-severity DKA patients in the study period (78 SQuID, 99 traditional cohort) and 163 preintervention and 161 pre-COVID historical control patients. Fidelity to the SQuID pathway was good, with glucose checks exceeding the q2-h requirement. We found no difference in the proportion of rescue dextrose administration compared to the traditional pathway. We observed significant reductions in median EDLOS for the SQuID cohort compared to the traditional cohort during the study period (-3.0, 95% CI -8.5 to -1.4), the preintervention period (-1.4, 95% CI -3.1 to -0.1), and the pre-COVID control period (-3.6, 95% CI -7.5 to -1.8).

Conclusions

In this single-center study at an academic ED, treatment of patients with MTM-severity DKA with a SQ insulin protocol was effective, demonstrated equivalent safety, and reduced ED length of stay.

### SQuID (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis): clinician acceptability [^115ikv6z]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We previously implemented the SQuID protocol (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) demonstrating safe, effective treatment of low- to moderate-severity DKA in a non-intensive care unit setting. Since success and sustainability of interventions rely on staff buy-in, we assessed acceptability of SQuID among emergency department (ED) and inpatient clinicians.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study in an urban academic hospital (March 2023-November 2023), surveying ED nurses (RNs) and physicians (MDs) and floor RNs and MDs treating patients on SQuID via emailed survey links. Clinicians could only take the survey once. We used Sekhon's Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, validated for staff acceptability of a new intervention, assessing eight domains with 5-point Likert responses. Clinicians were asked about prior experience with SQuID, and we assessed ED MD and RN preference (SQuID vs. intravenous [IV] insulin). Surveys included free-text boxes for comments. We present descriptive statistics including proportions with 95% confidence interval and medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and conducted thematic analysis of free-text comments.

Results

Our overall response rate (107/133) was 80% (34/42 ED RNs, 13/16 floor RNs, 47/57 ED MDs, 13/17 floor MDs), with first-time users of SQuID ranging from 7.7% (hospitalist MDs) to 35.3% (ED RNs) of participants. ED clinicians preferred SQuID over IV insulin (67% vs. 12%, 21% no preference). Acceptability was high across all domains and clinician types (median 4, IQR 4–5). Overall percentage of positive responses (4s and 5s) across domains was 92% (ED RNs [89%], floor RNs [89%], ED MDs [97%], floor MDs [87%]). We identified several themes among participant comments.

Conclusions

Acceptability was high across clinician types; 65% of ED clinicians preferred SQuID to IV insulin. Clinicians liked SQuID (affective attitude), found it easy to use (burden), were confident in its use (self-efficacy), felt that it improved outcomes (perceived effectiveness), found that it was fair to patients (ethicality), found that it made sense (intervention coherence), and found that it did not interfere with other activities (opportunity cost).

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^113mVCnH]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^116KQNjP]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Previous research indicates that adhering to protocol‐driven DKA management improves outcomes. The Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) group formulated guidelines for standardised DKA care. However, compliance with JBDS‐IP guidelines in clinical practice and its impact on clinical and patient‐centred outcomes remains insufficiently explored.
In DKA episodes where fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII rate when glucose was < 14 mmol/L. We did not find any favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII.
Understanding factors that influence adherence to guidelines is crucial in creating resources to implement guidelines effectively.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours <br/> - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe DKA <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe DKA|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of care in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19 at a tertiary, referral hospital in nairobi, Kenya [^112d5eNm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methodology

A 5-year (2017–2021) retrospective audit of hospital-admitted DKA patients at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, a private tertiary hospital, was performed. Comparisons were made between pre-COVID-19 (January 2017 to February 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to December 2021).

We included all adult (> 18 years' age) admissions with a DKA diagnosis for analysis. We used the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic and severity classification criteria for DKA diagnosis and classification. Mild DKA included alert patients with arterial pH 7.25–7.3, serum bicarbonate 15–18 mEq/l, and serum ketones positive, moderate DKA included alert/drowsy individuals with pH 7–7.25, bicarbonate 10- < 15 mEq/l and anion gap above 12 and severe DKA included patients with stupor/coma, PH < 7, bicarbonate < 10 mEq/l and anion gap > 12. Euglycemic DKA was defined as DKA without significant hyperglycemia (plasma glucose ≤ 11 mmol/l and the presence of ketonemia and/or ketonuria. Resolution of DKA was defined as pH > 7.3, bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L, and blood ketone level < 0.6 mmol/L.

COVID-19 was diagnosed using SARS- COV2 PCR testing of nasal swab samples.

Type of diabetes was based on a file diagnosis, which was documented by Endocrinologist/s after appropriate investigations, including OGTT for GDM and positive autoantibodies (Glutamic acid decarboxylase and/or islet cell antibodies) for T1D and LADA as clinically indicated.

The protocol used for DKA management during the study period was the American Diabetes Association recommended pathway.

This retrospective review was carried out after receiving ethical approval from the Institutional Scientific and Ethics Review Committee at the Aga Khan University, Nairobi, and the National Commission for Science, Technology, and Innovation (NACOSTI). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and in line with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we examined the outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin treatment protocol for DKA at a single intervention site compared with 20 standard care sites over a 9-year period. After implementation, the use of SQ insulin as the first treatment in DKA increased from 13.4% to 80.3% at the intervention site while it remained unchanged at standard care sites. This change in practice had no impact on the mean total insulin dosage received by patients with DKA within their first 48 hours of treatment. Overall, the protocol was associated with a 57% relative decrease in ICU admissions at intervention sites and a 50% relative decrease in 30-day readmissions compared with standard care sites. The use of an SQ insulin-driven protocol appeared to be safe, with no associated increases in the incidence of hypoglycemic events during hospitalization or 30-day mortality.

DKA is the most common acute hyperglycemic emergency among people with diabetes and is associated with significant morbidity and health care cost. Hospitalizations for DKA are also resource-intensive in the US, requiring ICU admission and reportedly costing as much as $26 566 per admission. In the United Kingdom, where ICU utilization for DKA may be lower, the cost of DKA hospitalizations has been reported to be lower. The ICU is a scarce resource that can become critically strained during seasonal influenza surge or as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, many US critical care specialists have routinely identified DKA as a diagnosis well-suited for treatment in non-ICU settings if the right patients can be identified and appropriate treatment and monitoring can be put in place. Despite guidelines recommending non-ICU treatment of DKA, evidence from the general population in the US confirms that many patients are treated in ICU settings.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113aLPgv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 10% of the population in the United States has diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known, serious, acute metabolic complication. While it is primarily associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus two-thirds of the time, it also occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 34% of the time, often as a manifestation of the syndrome of ketosis-prone diabetes. The incidence of DKA continues to rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 140 000 hospital discharges from DKA in 2009 in the United States, about 75% increase over the last two decadeswith an estimated cost annually of > $2 billion and accounts for > 500 000 hospital days per year.

Along with identification of triggering factors, management of DKA involves correction of hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acid–base derangements and electrolyte imbalances. Because of the complexities in the management protocol, many cases of DKA are managed in intensive care units (ICUs) across the United States. Losses of fluids and electrolytes are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in DKA. The mortality is < 1% in American adults; however, rises to > 5% in the elderly population with significant comorbidities. In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate for hyperglycemic crisis declined between 1980 and 2009. In 2009, hyperglycemic crises caused 64% lower mortality than in 1980.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of DKA have been published periodically in North Americaand Europeimproving the understanding and facilitating the development of management protocols. The outcomes of DKA have been shown to improve with adherence to treatment guidelines. Minor variants of the commonly used treatment protocol for DKA based on the published guidelines use insulin infusions and intravenous electrolyte solution and dextrose solution when blood sugar drops below 250 mg/dL. In order to correct dehydration in patients with DKA, intravenous electrolyte solutions are administered at the beginning of the treatment. As the blood glucose levels fall, a new bag of intravenous fluid with different dextrose concentrations would be ordered, and multiple sequential changes of bags would occur during the course of treatment. Despite their proven effectiveness, a varying degree of non-adherence to guidelines has been documented in the literature compromising the success of published protocols. Successful implementation of the conventional DKA protocol requires not only careful assessment of the clinical status of the patient and laboratory values, but frequent changes to intravenous fluids between saline and dextrose solutions.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^115V5ELj]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has a number of limitations. The retrospective nature of the data has inherent bias. Transitioning between protocols introduces potential learning bias, although this was controlled for with a three‐month washout period that was not included in the study timeframe. The sequential nature of the protocol analysis may be subject to external bias from the COVID‐19 pandemic, with differential pressures placed on the hospital system, particularly with respect to the VRIII cohort data from 2021. Unrecorded weight, particularly in the VRIII cohort, affects accurate analysis of total weight‐adjusted insulin requirements between the two groups. The FRIII protocol relies on patient weight for determining the insulin infusion rate; however, accurate measurement of weight in hospital often did not occur. It may not be initially appropriate in critically ill patients, and weight estimation is unreliable. In some individuals, at the discretion of the treating physician, the insulin infusion was ceased prior to ketones < 0.6 mmol/L, reducing the numbers included in the final analysis by six participants in each cohort. On sensitivity analysis of ketones < 1 mmol/L, which was more complete, there were similar findings with no difference between cohorts. Additionally, information on dextrose infusion initiation and rate titration was not available, which may have impacted hypoglycaemia rates. The definition for early hypoglycaemia was based on a previous paper reporting this outcome, however, a standardised definition of this does not exist. Small sample size limits the ability to find differences between the protocols. This is particularly evident with subgroup analysis for T1DM and T2DM, which limits the reliability of our conclusions.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of care in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19 at a tertiary, referral hospital in nairobi, Kenya [^111GBThE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial in DKA management to avert prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality. The mainstay of treatment remains rehydration, early insulin initiation, identification and treatment of precipitants, and management of electrolyte imbalance. In our study, the mean amount of insulin used was 110 units, including both basal and short-acting. We had a 100% uptake of basal insulin during the duration of DKA, which could have contributed to a lower overall use of insulin for DKA resolution compared to other similar studies. The mean amount of insulin used in the study by Desse et al. was 136.85 ± 152.41 units till the resolution of DKA/ HHS, and they did not specify the use of basal insulin.

Our study's most frequently used fluid for DKA management was normal saline, followed by dextrose-saline (DNS) when the sugars were lower than 14 mmol/l. However, of note is that almost two-thirds of our patients received ringers' lactate at some point during DKA management. The current guidelines still recommend normal saline as the first choice of fluids for DKA management, but there is emerging evidence on the role of balanced crystalloids like Plasmalyte and Ringer's lactate as the fluid of choice for rehydration in DKA to reduce hyperchloremia and improve renal functions. A small, randomized clinical trial conducted in South Africa, comparing Normal Saline with Ringer Lactate for DKA management revealed no difference in time to DKA resolution and that it took longer for glucose normalization with Ringer Lactate compared to Normal Saline.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^116Twbr3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that the implementation of an SQ insulin-driven protocol for treating DKA was associated with substantial changes in practice, including a significantly decreased need for intensive care and reduced rates of readmission, with no increase in hypoglycemia or mortality. Our results suggest that an SQ insulin-driven protocol including the selection of optimal patients can be used effectively in treating DKA, although these results should be confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Balanced crystalloids (RInger's lactate) versus normal saline in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department (BRISK-ED): a pilot randomised controlled trial [^115fhSPx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This blinded pilot RCT demonstrated the recruitment feasibility of a large RCT of RL versus NS in DKA, even when conducted during successive waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. We successfully enrolled patients, exceeded our minimum target recruitment rate and had no breaking of blinding or loss to follow-up. We also successfully used an integrated model of consent, which likely contributed to the high recruitment rate of approached eligible patients. The BRISK-ED protocol and its results can be used to inform a future trial investigating intravenous fluid choice for managing adult patients with DKA in the ED.

Our pilot study highlights several considerations for a future trial design. First, a cluster randomisation design by hospital site, while not essential, would provide several pragmatic advantages, including probable improved recruitment rates to more quickly achieve a desired sample size and reduced time to intervention, which could reduce contamination with non-trial fluids. However, as both the intervention and the primary outcome of interest (ie, time to DKA resolution) occur at the participant level, individual randomisation may be most appropriate. Furthermore, cluster trials are often associated with recruitment bias and the need for larger samples than would be required in similar, individually randomised trials.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115QkyvZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The primary strength of this study was that we were able to examine relative changes resulting from protocol implementation at the intervention site against a large and diverse set of comparator sites. This approach allowed us to address challenges commonly seen with before-and-after studies, which fail to account for ongoing secular changes in practice. In this study, we found that practice at the standard care sites remained largely unchanged in the postimplementation period, suggesting that our findings were the result of changes in practice unique to the intervention site. We were also able to evaluate posthospital outcomes, because patients with DKA are frequently rehospitalized over time, and we found a reduction in readmission rates at the intervention site. Our integrated health care delivery system and comprehensive single EHR system facilitated the identification and tracking of patients after DKA; thus, the protocol's default consultation for endocrinology follow-up and population management among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes may have played a role in reducing readmissions.

There are several limitations that should be noted. First, our study included patients with DKA based on principal diagnosis codes and, thus, represented a subset of all patients who might have received treatment for DKA. Also, although we used clinical EHR data to establish DKA and its severity, it is possible that patients may have been misclassified. Second, our study was conducted within a single regional integrated health care delivery system that incorporates numerous regional care protocols, which may differ from those in place in other hospital and health systems. Thus, additional study will be needed to assess the generalizability of this protocol, particularly in locales where SQ insulin use in DKA is more common. Third, although we did identify an association with the intervention, this was a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented protocol arising from a quality improvement effort; thus, the results should be confirmed with prospective studies. Fourth, the endocrine outpatient follow-up used in the protocol was directed toward patients with type 1 diabetes, and care for patients with type 2 diabetes could still be improved after DKA with careful care coordination. Fifth, we did not examine all adjunctive treatments given to patients with DKA (eg, fluid type and volume, and bicarbonate or potassium treatment), which could impact outcomes. Sixth, a minority of patients at standard care sites before implementation underwent initial SQ insulin treatment, which likely reflects ongoing variability in DKA treatment patterns. Seventh, although we did adjust for patient-level factors, we did not examine variability in practice and outcomes at the comparator sites that might contribute to residual confounding.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute hyperglycemic emergency with the potential for serious morbidity and mortality if not treated promptly. It is a serious complication of diabetes caused by a decreasein effective circulating insulin and elevations in counter-regulatory hormones, often leading to hyperglycemia, ketone body formation, osmotic diuresis, acid-base and electrolyte derangements, and hypovolemia. The tenets of management of DKA are the administration of insulin and the correction of the fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Standard therapy in the US has included continuous intravenous (IV) regular insulin until the resolution of ketoacidosis, with patients typically managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. As a result, DKA treatment can be costly in the US, resulting in an estimated annual cost of more than $5 billion.

There is growing interest in DKA treatment that can be achieved safely outside the ICU with non-IV insulin administration. In the United Kingdom, for example, national guidelines recommend the early initiation of fixed rate intravenous insulin infusionalongside the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. A recent review, suggested that there were no substantial advantages or disadvantages of using SQ rapid-acting insulin analogs over IV insulin on the basis of the low quality of the evidence. Some studies, have suggested that SQ short-acting insulin analogs may be as effective as IV insulin. Long-acting insulin glargine was also found to be effective and safe compared with IV regular insulin infusion in a small prospective study. Despite guideline recommendations for treatment in general medical-surgical wards, ICU treatment of DKA remains common in US health system and hospital settings.

In this study, we examined the outcomes of patients with DKA treated with an SQ insulin protocol including the early use of both rapid-acting and long-acting insulin, in place of IV insulin infusion, followed by rapid-acting insulin injections given over longer periods than previously studied. This SQ DKA protocol was implemented at a single intervention hospital as a quality improvement effort, and we compared outcomes against those from 20 other standard care hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system.

### Addressing pitfalls in management of diabetic ketoacidosis with a standardized protocol [^113YCWWn]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-Power Plan (PP) for guiding intravenous (IV) insulin infusions prior to anion gap (AG) closure and administering subcutaneous (SC) insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuing IV insulin. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with DKA before (pre-PP) (n = 60) and following (post-PP) (n = 60) implementation of a DKA-PP. Groups were compared for percentage of patients for whom IV insulin therapy was continued until AG closure, the percentage of patients receiving SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin, and percentage of patients with rebound DKA during the index hospitalization. Results: Admission plasma glucose (514 mg/dL vs. 500 mg/dL; p = 0.36) and venous pH (7.2 vs. 7.2; p = 0.57) were similar in pre- and post-PP groups. Inappropriate discontinuation of IV insulin occurred less frequently in post-PP patients (28% vs. 7%; p = 0.007), with a lower frequency of rebound DKA (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.001) following acute management. More post-PP patients received SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin (65% vs. 78%; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Implementation of a DKA-PP was associated with appropriate discontinuation of IV insulin in more patients, more frequent administration of SC insulin ≥ 1 hour prior to discontinuation of IV insulin, and fewer episodes of rebound DKA.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors, their role in type 1 diabetes treatment and a risk mitigation strategy for preventing diabetic ketoacidosis: the STOP DKA protocol [^115v5GkZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent phase 3 clinical trials have evaluated the impact of adding sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitors to the type 1 diabetes armamentarium. These trials studied SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) and a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor (sotagliflozin), and demonstrated that these oral non-insulin antihyperglycaemic medications are able not only to improve glycaemic control, but also to reduce body weight and extend time in range without increasing rates of hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a feature of type 1 diabetes and the risk is increased when SGLT inhibitors are used in type 1 diabetes. To minimize the risk of DKA and still gain the multiple benefits, we developed the "STOP DKA Protocol ", an easily accessible and practical tool, that provides a risk mitigation strategy for reducing DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes being treated with SGLT inhibitors.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours <br/> - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL <br/> - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### Joint British diabetes societies guideline for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^111nVy84]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Safety and efficacy of an algorithm-based protocol in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116CLYbK]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of an algorithm-based protocol to manage diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

Our study is a retrospective chart review of patients with DKA managed before and after implementation of an algorithm-based DKA protocol at a tertiary care hospital.

Results

There were 88 patients managed 1 year prior (control group) and 70 patients managed one year after (study group) implementation of the algorithm-based DKA protocol. The DKA resolution time was significantly shorter (11.5 [8.1 to 17.1] hours versus 8.5 [5.8 to 12] hours; P = 0.008) and the hypoglycemic events were significantly less (P = 0.042) in the study group in comparison with the control group. There was no difference in the potassium abnormalities and rate of decline of glucose. A survey on a scale of 1 to 10 found the majority of physicians and nurses rated the protocol as safe (83%) and effective (96%). Fifty-four percent of the nurses, however, found the protocol difficult to follow.

Conclusion

Our study showed that implementation of an algorithm-based protocol reduced the DKA resolution time and hypoglycemic events without compromising electrolyte imbalance, and was associated with improved clinical measures of DKA management.

### Clinical and biochemical profile of 786 sequential episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113kn1nc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our study contributes to the understanding of DKA in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are able to confirm previous reports that DKA can present in people with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, that DKA in type 2 diabetes is over-represented by older people and those from ethnic minority populations, and that the most common precipitants of DKA remain poor compliance with insulin and intercurrent illness.

We contribute new knowledge in that the clinical protocol for managing DKA in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes appears equally effective, that those with higher serum osmolality appear to be more unwell and may require more support, and that new therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors and cancer immunotherapies are increasingly contributing to the etiology of DKA in type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, respectively.

### Outcome of diabetic ketoacidosis among paediatric patients managed with modified DKA protocol at tikur anbessa specialized hospital and yekatit 12 hospital, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^115ASDAS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The critical factors in the treatment of DKA include correcting dehydration, correcting acidosis and reversing ketosis, restoring blood glucose to near normal, monitoring for complications and treating any precipitating event.

Management of dehydration is always the priority in DKA patients. Volume expansion with 10–20 ml/kg of 0.9% saline over 1 h is required, daily maintenance fluid requirement and the estimated fluid deficit which is 8.5% is calculated to be given over 48 h. In rare instances, patients with shock need 20 ml/kg boluses of isotonic saline. Deficit replacement should be with normal saline with added 40 meq/L of potassium chloride, and further adjustment of fluid is based on serum random blood sugar (RBS). Normal saline will be given until RBS is 250–300, and fluid will be changed to dextrose in normal saline (DNS) or ½ normal saline(NS) in 5% dextrose in water (DW) when the RBS drops to 140–250, 1/2 NS in 10% dextrose will be administered when RBS < 140 and 10% IV push if RBS < 70.,

If a patient has repeated hypoglycaemia, the rate of glycemic drop is more than 100 mg/dl/hour or hypokalaemia unresponsive to other management, the dose of insulin is decreased by half but never discontinued. Patients with mild DKA usually do not have impaired peripheral circulation and, therefore, do not require a fluid bolus.,

Insulin administration is started 1–2 h after starting fluid replacement therapy. Continuous intravenous regular insulin (CIRI) at a rate of 0.1 IU/Kg/h until resolution of DKA is commonly used. On the other hand, a lower intravenous regular insulin dose of 0.05 IU/kg/hour can be safe and effective. In circumstances where CIRI administration is not possible, hourly or 2 hourly subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) administration of insulin may be as effective as intravenous (IV) regular insulin infusion but subcutaneous (SC) should not be used in patients whose peripheral circulation is impaired.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^115GLRMT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^113Yv7jR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) institutional review board and was determined to be exempt from the need for informed consent according to 45 CFR §46.104(d)(4)(iii). This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

SQ Insulin DKA Treatment Protocol

Between January 2010 and January 2016, all 21 KPNC hospitals used a standardized electronic health record (EHR) order set for treating DKA that included IV regular insulin infusion, as well as IV fluids and electrolyte replacement, according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. ICU admission was standard for all patients treated with IV insulin because hourly glucose checks and insulin titration required a higher level of nursing care than is typically available in other hospital wards. Starting in 2016, specialists at the intervention hospital (KP San Jose Medical Center) designed and implemented a clinical DKA protocol using SQ insulin as primary treatment for all adult (aged ≥ 18 years), nonpregnant patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 8 who did not exhibit non-DKA medical conditions requiring ICU admission. The goal of the protocol was to provide a safe management pathway for patients with DKA outside the ICU while also decreasing nursing workload and improving patient experience.

The protocol was divided into 3 parts: initial emergency department (ED) management, general medical-surgical ward management, and discharge recommendations (Table 1). In the ED, patients meeting DKA protocol criteria were administered weight-based SQ glargine and lispro simultaneously, IV lactated ringer fluid boluses, dextrose 5% with normal saline infusion, and potassium repletion with a primary focus on patients with mild or moderate DKA (Table 1). Patients with severe DKA were also eligible for the SQ insulin protocol if they did not meet the exclusion criteria. DKA severity classifications were determined on the basis of American Diabetes Association criteria (Table 1).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^114mfwpu]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis — diagnostic thresholds and recognition in wilderness settings — DKA is defined by a blood glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1, an anion gap > 10, pH < 7.3, and ketonemia. In the wilderness setting, it may be possible to prevent progression to advanced illness with early recognition of ketosis and treatment with subcutaneous insulin and oral hydration/glucose repletion, and symptoms of ketosis, particularly vomiting or a change in mental status, or blood glucose level elevated above 250 mg·dL−1 should prompt ketone monitoring.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium <br/> - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^115yRBcE]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The hypoglycaemia rate of 23% in the FRIII was more in keeping with reported rates in the literature between 28% and 50%, although slightly lower than anticipated. Twenty‐five percent of participants in the FRIII cohort had ketones > 0.6 mmol/L at the time of hypoglycaemia, suggesting that ketosis was persisting. Importantly, although not a prespecified outcome, 46% of those managed with FRIII, including those with hypoglycaemia, had a reduction in the rate of insulin infusion to < 0.1 units/kg/h after at least 8 h on the infusion at the discretion of the treating clinician. The infusion rate was often reduced due to concerns for imminent hypoglycaemia, although the FRIII protocol did not include a formal rate reduction step when normoglycaemia was achieved. This insulin dose reduction likely contributed to the lower than anticipated hypoglycaemia rate we found in our study for the FRIII cohort. It also highlights physician concern for hypoglycaemia with the FRIII protocol and the potential utility of a dose reduction step as part of the FRIII protocol in the prevention of hypoglycaemia. Lorenson et al. retrospectively evaluated a fixed‐rate protocol with and without a dose reduction step following normoglycaemia. They found the incidence of hypoglycaemia in 24 h was 32.5% with a fixed rate of 0.1 units/kg/h with no adjustments and decreased to 19.2% following dose reduction after normoglycaemia was achieved. Interestingly, a recent retrospective review of 753 DKA admissions in the United Kingdom, analysing outcomes following the introduction of a dose reduction step with a FRIII protocol, found no impact on the rate of hypoglycaemia. The authors attributed this to suboptimal uptake of guidelines, with significant delays in commencement of 10% dextrose and reduction in insulin rate once BGL < 14 mmol/L was achieved.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^114bcsU6]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Hypoglycaemia incidence did not differ between VRIII and FRIII protocols, although the FRIII cohort had higher rates of early hypoglycaemia. FRIII, particularly in those with T2DM, results in a shorter hospital length of stay. The longer hospital length of stay and time on insulin infusion in the VRIII cohort do not appear to be related to time to resolution of ketosis as this did not differ between groups.

In the absence of prospective studies, we would advocate for the formal introduction of a dose reduction step in the FRIII protocol, to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, and align with recent consensus guidelines. Following the implementation of a change in protocol, re‐evaluation of hypoglycaemia rates would be warranted.

Further research, specifically prospective or randomised controlled trials comparing variable‐rate and fixed‐rate protocols with a dose reduction step, is needed to determine the optimal insulin infusion regimen in the management of DKA, particularly given concerns and potential mortality associated with hypoglycaemia.

2 AIMS AND HYPOTHESES

The primary aim was to assess rates of hypoglycaemia with use of a FRIII compared to a VRIII for management of DKA. The secondary aims were to compare time to resolution of ketosis (defined as ketones < 0.6 mmol/L) and hospital length of stay with FRIII and VRIII. We hypothesised that the hypoglycaemia incidence would be higher in the FRIII protocol, which administers considerably higher rates of insulin due to the weight‐based nature of the protocol.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^113J1oty]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Intravenous insulin infusion is a key component of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment, but evidence is limited supporting the ideal administration rate. International guidelines recommend a fixed insulin rate of 0.1 units/kg/h initially, with rate reduction following normoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia is a potential complication of insulin administration, with associated morbidity and mortality. Hypoglycaemia incidence did not differ between variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) and fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) protocols, although the FRIII cohort had a higher incidence of early hypoglycaemia.
Further research comparing VRIII and FRIII with dose reduction is needed to determine the optimal insulin infusion regimen in DKA management.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111uooVy]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Our criteria for the diagnosis of DKA included plasma glucose > 250 mg/dl, HCO₃⁻ < 15 mEq/l, pH < 7.3, and moderate ketones in the urine or blood by the nitroprusside method. A total of 37 patients were prospectively randomly assigned to three groups as follows: 1) the load group consisted of 12 patients who received a loading dose of insulin at 0.07 unit/kg body weight followed by an infusion of 0.07 unit·kg body weight⁻¹·h⁻¹; 2) the no load group consisted of 12 patients who received only an intravenous infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.07 unit·kg body weight⁻¹·h⁻¹ without a loading dose; or 3) the twice no load group consisted of 13 patients who received an infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.14 unit·kg body weight⁻¹·h⁻¹ without a bolus dose. Responses to therapy were based on the time to achieve a glucose level of ≤ 250 mg/dl, bicarbonate of ≥ 15 mEq/l, and pH ≥ 7.3. All other modes of therapy (hydrating solution, KCl, and HCO₃⁻) were similar in the three groups and followed the recommendations of the first ADA position statement. All patients were seen in the emergency department of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Upon arrival, history was obtained and a physical examination was performed. Urine ketones (by nitroprusside) plus glucose by fingerstick and blood gas measurements were obtained immediately. Once a suspected diagnosis of DKA was made, the initial laboratory blood samples were obtained for basal metabolic parameters and complete blood count with differential; urinalysis was performed for blood and urine ketones by both the nitroprusside and enzymatic methods. Patients then received 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl per hour until laboratory results were available. After laboratory confirmation, the intravenous fluids were adjusted, depending on the glucose and corrected serum sodium value, to ½ N saline or dextrose with 1 N or ½ N saline. With confirmation of the diagnosis of DKA and an acceptable potassium level (> 3.3 mEq/l), the patients were then transferred to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) of the University of Tennessee Bowld Hospital after the research study was described to the patients or their next of kin and the consent form, which was approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center of Memphis Institutional Review Board, was signed. On arrival at the CRC, the treatment and care of patients was managed by the DKA team, including the medical housestaff on rotation for the service, following an established protocol with consultation of the staff endocrinologist. Hourly blood glucose measurements and blood samples for free insulin were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min. Blood for measurement of other hormones and ketone bodies, blood gases, and metabolic profile; urinalysis for ketones; and other parameters were obtained. Random assignment of patients to different insulin regimens was done after arrival at the CRC. Random assignment was not based on sex or ethnicity. Because a priming dose of insulin adds an additional risk of hypokalemia, potassium levels were assessed and corrected on an hourly basis for the first few hours of therapy until glucose reached the predetermined goal of < 250 mg/dl (i.e. ∼4 h) and every 2 h thereafter.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

Treatments and Process Measures for Patients With Diabetic Ketoacidosis During the Preimplementation and Postimplementation Phases at the Intervention Site Compared With Other Regional Sites

SI conversion factors: To convert anion gap to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0; glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555.

At both the intervention and standard care sites, the number of hours until the first documentation of a serum glucose level less than 250 mg/dL increased modestly in the postimplementation vs preimplementation periods (Table 3). The number of hours until the first documented anion gap less than 16 mEq/L was similar at the intervention site and longer at standard care sites. Overall, there was no significant difference in the use of 50% dextrose for treating hypoglycemia in the intervention site, whereas the proportion of patients having evidence of hypoglycemia based on any glucose value less than 70 mg/dL decreased. After hospital discharge, the proportion of hospitalizations having an endocrinology visit within 2 weeks of discharge increased at the intervention site from 7.1% (21 hospitalizations) to 12.3% (15 hospitalizations), whereas there was no change at standard care sites (563 hospitalizations [12.7%] vs 403 hospitalizations [12.9%]).

### Improving management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^111BeofB]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal fluid management for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is uncertain. In an effort to simplify DKA therapy, we revised the treatment protocol in our institution to use a simpler method of calculating fluid needs, use fluids with higher sodium concentration, and allow glucose concentration to be adjusted easily. We performed a retrospective study to determine the effects of these revisions.

Design

We compared patients treated with traditional and revised protocols (~220 and ~300 patients, respectively, over consecutive 2.75-year intervals). Sixty patient records were randomly selected from the first group (30 treated with each of 2 protocol versions) and 30 from the second group. Biochemical and clinical parameters were analyzed.

Results

Patients selected for detailed analysis were similar in demographics and initial laboratory measurements. Patients treated under the revised fluid protocol received less total fluid, needed fewer intravenous fluid changes, were treated at less cost, and resolved acidosis more rapidly than patients treated under the original protocols. The rate of cerebral edema (0.3%-0.5%) was unchanged.

Conclusion

A DKA protocol that necessitates less fluid delivery and fewer calculations simplifies therapy and is associated with more rapid correction of acidosis.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115MoUoj]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to determine if a two-bag system significantly influenced resolution of DKA in adult patients presenting with DKA. Since anion gap is widely used by clinicians as a surrogate measure of resolution of acidosis in DKA, we evaluated the time to close anion gap as a primary end point for our study. Our results showed a reduction of 2.62 hours in the anion gap closure from 13.56 to 10.94 hours (p = 0.0002) using the two-bag system. Plasma glucose levels improved to < 250 mg/dL earlier with two-bag protocol (9.14 vs 7.82 hours, p = 0.0241), and there were significantly fewer episodes of hypoglycemia associated with the two-bag protocol (8.43% vs 1.49%, p = 0.0069). However, neither the time to improve serum HCO₃⁻ level > 18 mg/dL nor the hospital length of stay differed in a statistically significant manner between the two groups. Both groups of the patients had similar comorbidities as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index indicating that the treatment protocol, rather than the disease-specific factors, played a greater role in the early closure of the anion gap. None of the other patient-specific factors played a significant role in the resolution of the anion gap (table 3).

The two-bag protocol has been used in pediatric patients with DKA and studies showed mixed results. In one study, the rate of serum HCO₃⁻ correction and the time to ketone correction were superior in the two-bag systemcompared with the one-bag system; however, in the second study, there were no differences between the two groups. Both studies were limited by small sample sizes (31 and 33 patients, respectively). Pediatric studies have demonstrated benefits of the two-bag system including decreased total number of intravenous bags used per patient, decreased cost of intravenous therapy, and decreased response time for intravenous fluid changes. In contrast to the few published studies on DKA management using the two-bag protocol, we compared anion gap closure. We have also used a significantly larger data set, potentially eliminating some of the limitations of the prior studies. However, we did not compare the volume of intravenous fluid used in each of the groups given the limitation of collecting accurate data in our retrospective study. A comparison of the published studies to date on the two-bag DKA protocol has been summarized in table 4.

### Review of subcutaneous insulin regimens in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults and pediatrics [^117BGft5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Summarize the studies evaluating the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults and pediatrics.

Data Sources

A PubMed literature search was conducted for articles published between 2000 and the end of May 2024 which contained the following terms in their title: (1) subcutaneous, glargine, or basal and (2) ketoa*.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, guidelines, meta-analysis, commentaries, studies not related to the acute management of DKA, studies evaluating continuous SQ insulin, animal studies, if the time to DKA resolution was not clearly defined, and studies where basal insulin was administered greater than 6 hours after the insulin infusion was started were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The electronic search identified 58 articles. Following the initial screening 38 articles were excluded and 3 were added after bibliography review. Of the 23 articles assessed for eligibility, 7 were excluded. Sixteen articles were included. Five studies compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and intravenous (IV) insulin infusions in adults, 4 compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and IV insulin infusions in pediatrics, 4 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in adults, and 3 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in pediatrics.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

In comparison with IV insulin infusions, rapid/short-acting SQ insulin regimens were associated with reduced ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. IV insulin infusion regimens that included a single SQ basal insulin dose upon therapy initiation were associated with reduced concurrent IV insulin infusion durations.

Conclusion

Studies reviewed suggest that SQ insulin regimens may be as effective and safe as IV insulin infusions in the management of DKA and are associated with the conservation of resources. Providers may refer to this review when establishing or modifying their DKA management protocols.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115pkXzZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Standard diabetic ketoacidosis care in the US includes intravenous insulin treatment in the intensive care unit. Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin could decrease intensive care unit need, but the data are limited.

Objective

To assess outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study is a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented SQ insulin protocol. The study was conducted at an integrated health care system in Northern California. Participants included hospitalized patients with diabetic ketoacidosis at 21 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The preimplementation phase was 2010 to 2015, and the postimplementation phase was 2017 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to January 2022.

Exposure

An SQ insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Difference-in-differences evaluation of the need for intensive care, mortality, readmission, and length of stay at a single intervention site using an SQ insulin protocol from 2017 onward compared with 20 control hospitals using standard care.

Results

A total of 7989 hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, with 4739 (59.3%) occurring before and 3250 (40.7%) occurring after implementation. The overall mean (SD) age was 42.3(17.7) years, with 4137 hospitalizations (51.8%) occurring among female patients. Before implementation, SQ insulin was the first insulin used in 40 intervention (13.4%) and 651 control (14.7%) hospitalizations. After implementation, 98 hospitalizations (80.3%) received SQ insulin first at the intervention site compared with 402 hospitalizations (12.8%) at control sites. The adjusted rate ratio for intensive care unit admission was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.33–0.56) at the intervention sites, a 57% reduction compared with control sites, and was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25–0.99) for 30-day hospital readmission, a 50% reduction. There were no significant changes in hospital length of stay and rates of death.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that a protocol based on SQ insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis treatment was associated with significant decreases in intensive care unit need and readmission, with no evidence of increases in adverse events.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1164WURu]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of hyperglycemic crises, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild diabetic ketoacidosis|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours <br/> - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe diabetic ketoacidosis <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe diabetic ketoacidosis|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

3.2 Definitions

DKA was defined as per The Canberra Hospital DKA protocol for consideration of commencement of an intravenous insulin infusion as a venous pH < 7.35 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, with elevated ketones > 1.0 mmol/L, and blood glucose level (BGL) > 11 mmol/L (or euglycaemia if taking a sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitor [SGLT2i]). Severity of DKA was classified based on the degree of acidosis; mild (venous pH 7.25–7.30,15–18 mmol/L), moderate (venous pH 7.0–7.24,10–15 mmol/L) or severe (pH < 7.0, < 10 mmol/L).BGL was used to describe glucose levels obtained via capillary, venous or arterial measurement. Hypoglycaemia was defined as BGL < 4.0 mmol/L, and as early if it occurred within the first 12 h. Resolution of ketosis was defined by capillary ketone level < 0.6 mmol/L. For participants admitted to the ICU, time to resolution of ketosis was taken as the minimum length of time known that ketones were > 0.6 mmol/L based on documentation available. In the VRIII protocol, insulin infusion rate was adjusted based on measured BGL (Appendix B). In contrast, the FRIII protocol used a fixed weight‐based insulin infusion rate of 0.1 units/kg/h to a maximum of 10 units/h, with adjustment of the dextrose sideline based on BGL (Appendix A).

### Subcutaneous insulin versus traditional intravenous insulin infusion in treatment of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis [^113QCagc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) insulin infusions are the current standard of care for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin, however, may also be a safe and effective alternative.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare patient-centered outcomes related to the treatment of mild to moderate DKA using two different protocols: an SQ insulin protocol and an IV insulin infusion protocol with an initial bolus (IVB) or without a bolus (IVNB).

Methods

We retrospectively conducted a multicenter cohort study evaluating SQ vs. IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included time to glucose correction, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, hypoglycemia events, readmission rates, and IV insulin use.

Results

Within the study time frame, 257 patients were included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. There was no significant difference in the time to DKA resolution between the IVB (p = 0.603) or IVNB (p = 0.269) groups compared with the population who received SQ insulin only. Hospital LOS was significantly longer when comparing the SQ group with the IVNB group (p < 0.001), but not when comparing it with the IVB group (p = 0.259). The IV protocols had significantly more hypoglycemic events compared with the SQ protocol (IVB vs. SQ, p < 0.001; IVNB vs. SQ, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

SQ insulin may be an effective alternative option for treating mild to moderate DKA with fewer hypoglycemic effects.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^114K1pfj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

DKA is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis and progressive loss of consciousness that results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone). The biochemical criteria for diagnosis are: blood glucose > 200 mg/dl, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia > 3 mmol/L and presence of ketonuria. A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by an experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU), in order to provide an intensive monitoring of the vital and neurological signs, and of the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include: restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement; correction of insulin deficiency aiming at the resolution of metabolic acidosis and ketosis; reduction of risk of cerebral edema; avoidance of other complications of therapy (hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic acidosis); identification and treatment of precipitating events. In Brazil, there are few pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals, so an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines in order to facilitate DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and the international guidelines are: intravenous fluid will be stopped when oral fluids are well tolerated and total deficit will be replaced orally; if potassium analysis still indicate need for replacement, it will be given orally; subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog is administered at 0.15 U/kg dose every 2–3 hours until resolution of metabolic acidosis; approximately 12 hours after treatment initiation, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day, and it will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

### Assessment of the clinical outcome of a symptom-based outpatient hyperglycemia protocol [^114TcCXg]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) contribute significantly to the estimated US$174 billion annual cost of diabetes mellitus. Of the $116 billion in medical expenditures attributed to diabetes, approximately 50% ($58 billion) are inpatient costs.DKA and HHS are managed initially by hospital emergency departments (EDs), followed by inpatient medical care. A typical ED visit involves at least a 4-hour wait time, is inconvenient, and the average costs for a visit without admission are estimated at ≥ $1000. Wait time in the ED has increased in the last decade due to an increasing number of patients using the ED at the same time that more EDs are closing their doors.

Nationally recognized management protocols only exist for hospital settings. These protocols exist as initial treatment after the DKA or HHS diagnosis has been established. There is evidence to suggest type 1 diabetes patients with mild DKA can be managed with rapid-acting insulin analogs in an outpatient setting.–It is currently unknown if symptomatic, mild hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients can be managed adequately in an outpatient setting. Most diabetes education centers have policies and procedures to contact physicians when a patient presents with high blood glucose (BG) levels. However, no established outpatient hyperglycemia protocol exists. The literature does describe common causes of acute metabolic decompensation: acute illness (ie, infection, myocardial infection), noncompliance with treatment, and new-onset diabetes. Significant contributing factors within the noncompliance group are omission of insulin therapy and substance abuse (especially alcohol and cocaine). Even using the costs in 1998, national estimates for hospitalization for diabetic emergencies are high at $10,876, with an average length of stay of 6.6 days.

### Fluid treatment for children with diabetic ketoacidosis: how do the results of the pediatric emergency care applied research network fluid therapies under investigation in diabetic ketoacidosis (FLUID) trial change our perspective? [^1169hwjv]. Pediatric Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal fluid treatment protocol for children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has long been a subject of controversy. Until recently, there was no high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials to support an optimal guideline, and recommendations were mainly based on theoretical considerations. As a consequence, fluid treatment protocols for children with DKA vary between institutions (and countries). In June 2018, the results from the Fluid Therapies Under Investigation in DKA Trial conducted in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network were published. This large, factorial-designed randomized controlled trial assessed neurological outcomes of 1387 children with DKA who were treated with one of four fluid protocols that varied in infusion rate and sodium content. In this commentary, we review and discuss the results of this new study and the implications for clinical care of DKA in children.

The Digital Evaluation of Ketosis and Other Diabetes Emergencies (DEKODE) initiative is a multi‐centre collaboration in the UK that analyses DKA admissions, management strategies, and outcomes across 28 hospitals. All participating hospitals follow an integrated care pathway for DKA management based on the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines.DEKODE, therefore, provides an opportunity to study the natural history of DKA episodes managed similarly and their impact on patient outcomes. Using data from the DEKODE study, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to examine whether differences exist in the presentation and outcomes of DKA between SGLT2i users and non‐users with type 2 diabetes managed under similar protocols.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116mHPx6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^115MAcZo]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In those who had hypoglycaemia, the FRIII cohort had a higher incidence of early hypoglycaemia, with 88% occurring within the first 12 h on the infusion compared to only 29% in the VRIII cohort. No immediate significant harmful outcomes from hypoglycaemia were reported. The rate of insulin infusion in the fixed‐rate protocol is more aggressive than with a variable rate, as in our FRIII cohort, with higher initial insulin infusion rates. If the dextrose infusion rate is not adjusted appropriately, this increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. While beyond the scope of our analysis, given the recent study demonstrating suboptimal uptake of new guidelines, we can infer that delays in adjustments to dextrose infusion rates may have potentially exacerbated hypoglycaemia risk. There was no difference in early administration of basal insulin between cohorts as a potential contributor to early hypoglycaemia.

Early intensive hyperglycaemia correction and resultant hypoglycaemia raise concern for increased risk of mortality, compared to partial early correction of BGL as demonstrated by Mårtensson et al. Inpatient hypoglycaemia has been associated with increased mortality in hospitalised patients and increased length of hospital stay; therefore, it is important to limit the risk of hypoglycaemia. Both variable‐rate protocols and fixed‐rate protocols with a rate reduction step demonstrated lower rates of hypoglycaemia compared to fixed rate with no adjustment. There are no randomised controlled trials directly comparing FRIII with dose reduction and VRIII. New consensus guidelines recently published between American and British associations and societies advocate for a fixed‐rate insulin infusion protocol with a rate reduction step when normoglycaemia is achieved (defined as BGL < 13.9 mmol/L); however, in Australia, the use of variable‐rate protocols remains widespread. The initial premise for extended FRIII is faster time to resolution of ketosisbut multiple retrospective studies have been unable to demonstrate this, consistent with the findings in our study when comparing variable‐rate to fixed‐rate protocols. No hypoglycaemia occurred in participants admitted to intensive care on either protocol, reflecting potential increased risk with ward‐based management.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: a current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Having an understanding of its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, delineates the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. The newer management modalities are discussed that include the need for intensive laboratory workup, meticulous monitoring of the insulin, and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. The new insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

Hyperglycemic emergencies (diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state) — protocols and safety — should follow standardized protocols with aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolytes replacement, and also insulin therapy, with caution recommended in persons with advanced renal failure because standard IV fluid and insulin replacement may result in increased volume overload and hypoglycemia; severe hypokalemia (K < 2.5 mEq/L) and severe hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dl) have been associated with increased mortality; the addition of noninsulin agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, before admission or during the postoperative period, has not reduced rates of stress hyperglycemia and may increase nausea and vomiting rates among critically ill persons.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^1121AWQk]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Effect of various doses of insulin on recovery parameters

Table 3 demonstrates the outcome recovery data for DKA, depicting the time that predetermined values were reached for glucose, HCO₃⁻, and pH. The results suggested no significant differences in these values for the three doses of insulin, but 5 of 12 patients in the no load group required additional insulin for control of their blood glucose. The length of hospitalization was not significantly different among the groups, there were no complications in any of the groups, and no deaths occurred in this cohort. No hypokalemia was noted in any treatment group. The potassium nadirs were 4.3, 4.2, and 3.7 mEq/l in the load, no load, and twice no load groups, respectively (Fig. 2).

Table 4 shows estimates of the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, FFAs, bicarbonate, and cortisol during the first 8 h of therapy in the three insulin therapy groups. The response of serum bicarbonate and cortisol showed no differences among the treatment groups. However, the slopes for glucose, venous pH, ketones, and FFAs varied among treatment groups.

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1 Study population

Single centre, retrospective cohort study of all coded adult DKA admissions at The Canberra Hospital, Australia, between January 2021 and October 2022. People > 16 years old, who met the criteria for DKA (see Section 3.2), managed with an intravenous insulin infusion were included. People transferred from peripheral sites were excluded due to limited information regarding the intravenous insulin infusion prior to transfer. Participants were divided into two groups: participants treated with a VRIII protocol between January and October 2021 and participants treated with a FRIII protocol between January and October 2022. Participants who transitioned off the FRIII protocol at the discretion of the treating clinician prior to 8 h on the infusion were excluded. A 3‐month washout period, after the introduction of the FRIII in November 2021, was not analysed to allow learning time for the new protocol. Data collection was completed in October 2022.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115qvynR]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

In our study, although the AG corrected earlier in DKA patients treated with the two-bag protocol, the time for serum bicarbonate level to reach > 18 was similar in both groups. Additionally, improvement of the bicarbonate level lagged behind the anion gap closure. This may indicate that relative hyperchloremia, resulting from the large volume of normal saline infusions during volume resuscitation, leads to the correction of the AG. However, ketone levels remained elevated for a longer duration accompanied by reduced serum bicarbonate levels until finally correcting with the insulin infusion. Both protocols were based on guidelines of fluid resuscitation in patients with DKA published by ADA. Clinicians made the final decision regarding how much fluid was needed for a patient based on clinical findings, dehydration, and comorbidities. We could not collect the data on the total volume of intravenous fluid containing sodium chloride in our study population and do not know whether there was any difference in the intravenous fluid administered.

3.3 Variables

Data collected included age, sex, classification of diabetes mellitus, time since diabetes diagnosis, most recent glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) at time of admission with DKA, number of DKA admissions in the preceding 24 months to The Canberra Hospital and admission area (intensive care unit or ward admission). Weight was not collected due to limited documentation. For the purpose of analysis, type 3c diabetes mellitus was analysed as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) due to similarity with underlying insulin deficiency.

Other data collected included total units of insulin administered via infusion, initial insulin infusion rate, concurrent basal insulin administration, initial pH, BGL, ketone and serumlevels, hospital length of stay, hours on insulin infusion, time to ketones < 0.6 mmol/L and the presence of hypoglycaemia. Additional details at the time of hypoglycaemia were also collected, including ketone level, insulin infusion rate, fluid sideline rate and fluid type, BGL, located in ICU and presence or absence of hypoglycaemic symptoms.

3.4 Statistical analysis

Data was recorded using Microsoft Excel and the analysis conducted and figures created using GraphPad Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA). Baseline characteristics were calculated using a Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and a Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. Results were reported as a percentage or median and interquartile range. Binary outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and nonparametric comparisons using the Mann–Whitney U test. Significance was set at p < 0.05.

We estimated a required sample size of at least 39 participants in each cohort to provide 80% power to detect a between‐group difference of 24 percentage points at the alpha level of 0.05 for the primary outcome of hypoglycaemia. To calculate this, we used the value of 30% incidence of hypoglycaemia in the FRIII protocol and 6% for the VRIII protocol based on relevant literature.

The study was approved by ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee's Low Risk Sub‐Committee, ACT reference number 2024.LRE.00068. A waiver of consent was approved.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^111rizkt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a subcutaneous insulin protocol implemented at a hospital level associated with use of intensive care and other outcomes among adults with diabetic ketoacidosis?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 7989 hospitalizations over a 9-year period, implementation of a subcutaneous insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis at a single intervention site, compared with 20 standard care sites, was not associated with increased hypoglycemia but was associated with a relative reduction of direct intensive care unit admission of 57% and a 50% reduction in hospital readmission, with no change in hospital length of stay.

Meaning

These findings suggest that a subcutaneous insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with reduced hospital resource utilization but was not associated with increased hypoglycemia.

Wilderness diabetes care — recommendations on ketosis kits, field management, and evacuation — Those with insulin-dependent diabetes should know the signs and symptoms of ketosis, carry a serum and/or urine ketone testing kit, and know how to treat ketones during wilderness activities, and it may be prudent to carry both as a contingency in the event of failure due to environmental conditions (Evidence grade: 1B). Ketosis may be safely managed in the wilderness if an athlete with diabetes and the athlete's healthcare provider are comfortable with a treatment protocol and if the patient is able to take oral hydration and nutrition and shows no signs of altered mental status (Evidence grade: 2C). Both HHS and DKA should be considered medical emergencies managed by emergent removal or evacuation to definitive care (Evidence grade: 1A), healthcare providers covering events or expeditions in the wilderness should have the ability to monitor blood glucose and ketones and have a basic familiarity with how to treat and triage glucose abnormalities (Evidence grade: 1C), and there should be a plan for evacuation in the case of a hyperglycemic emergency (Evidence grade: 1A).

### Euglycaemic ketoacidosis in pregnant women with COVID-19: two case reports [^113QMxG5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with COVID-19 with diabetes have worse clinical outcomes due to substantial insulin resistance and new onset diabetes in relation with COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single strand RNA virus which binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a key enzyme in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and catalyses the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin. ACE2 is found in the lungs and pancreas and can serve as a cellular entry point for SARS-CoV-2. The direct pancreatic islet cell injury and downregulation of ACE2 expression is thought to lead to unopposed angiotensin II and reduced insulin production: ACE2-mediated dysfunction of the sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 and/or SLC5A1) at the intestinal epithelium is believed to further exacerbate glycaemic dysregulation.

The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the RAAS also complicates fluid management. Angiotensin II enhances pulmonary vascular permeability and excessive fluid resuscitation can worsen any pre-existing respiratory compromise. Angiotensin II additionally stimulates aldosterone leading to potassium loss; therefore, potassium replacement is needed especially when insulin treatment is required.

We propose a management strategy for COVID-19 associated euglycaemic ketoacidosis in pregnancy (Fig. 2), adapted from existing protocols of treatment for hyperglycaemic DKA in non-pregnant and pregnant patients. Criteria for the proposed management pathway are capillary ketones (> 3 mmol/L, or 2 + ketonuria), metabolic acidosis (venous pH < 7.3, or bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L), and normoglycaemia (CBG < 10 mmol/L; with either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or high clinical suspicion. Prompt escalation to a senior obstetrician, endocrine / medical colleagues and critical care is recommended as patients will require high dependency care. As with the management of hyperglycaemic DKA, hourly monitoring of maternal ketones, glucose, pH and electrolytes are essential to accurately adjust therapy. Strict fluid balance should be recorded and catheterisation considered. The primary goals of management are fluid resuscitation, insulin administration, and electrolyte correction.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^117Tk8gx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Nearly all DKA hospitalizations started in the ED at both intervention (412 hospitalizations [98.1%]) and standard care (7420 hospitalizations [98.0%]) sites (Table 2). At the intervention site, the mean (SD) first serum laboratory glucose values were similar before (510.0 [218.8] mg/dL) and after (532.2 [240.4] mg/dL) implementation. Initial anion gap values were higher in the postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period (25.4 [6.5] vs 23.1 [6.4] mEq/L), as were serum creatinine values (1.3 [0.5] mg/dL in the postimplementation period vs 1.1 [0.8] mg/dL in the preimplementation period [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]). At the standard care sites, glucose, anion gap, and creatinine were higher in the postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period.

In the preimplementation period, SQ insulin was the first insulin administered in 40 intervention site hospitalizations (13.4%) and 651 standard care site hospitalizations (14.7%) (Table 3). In the postimplementation period, 98 intervention site hospitalizations (80.3%) and 402 standard care site hospitalizations (12.8%) received SQ insulin as their first insulin treatment. Over the first 48 hours of hospitalization, the total numbers of insulin units administered at the intervention site did not differ between the preimplementation and postimplementation periods (122.5 [70.9] vs 126.2 [75.4] units), whereas the total numbers of insulin units increased at the standard care sites (109.6 [68.3] units before implementation vs 121.9 [74.0] units after implementation).

### Outcome of diabetic ketoacidosis among paediatric patients managed with modified DKA protocol at tikur anbessa specialized hospital and yekatit 12 hospital, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^114iozrF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The international society for paediatrics and adolescent medicine has set guidelines for the management of DKA which is currently being practised in most countries. In our set‐up, there was no standard of practice in the management of DKA until the modified DKA management protocol was adopted in 2014 and put into practice. This protocol was developed from the international guideline, standard textbooks and ISPAD; incorporated aiming to have a standard of care and to improve the outcome of paediatric DKA patients.

According to this modified DKA protocol, fluid is given for severe and moderate DKA as per the above protocol except for the management of mild DKA which could be managed with oral rehydration solution, and deficit calculated as some dehydration and 75 ml/kg of fluid is given and patients are encouraged to take PO feeding.

As there is a lack of readily available perfuser, no strict follow‐up of patients with frequent monitoring of RBS and no readily available intensive care in Ethiopia, intermittent SC regular insulin is used in place of Continuous intravenous regular insulin (CIRI); with a loading dose of 0.5 units/kg of regular insulin given in divided doses as half IV and half IM and then 0.5 IU/kg SC every 6 h except the first dose which is administered ½ IM and ½ IV since dehydration in the first hour limits absorption of subcutaneous insulin, and it is then continued until resolution of DKA; that is, two consecutive urine ketones negative. Follow‐up of a patient is with a DKA flow sheet (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Management algorithm for diabetic ketoacidosis in children in Ethiopia [Correction added on 12 September 2022 after first online publication: In figure 1, the word 'recheck' and '10%' were updated in the left last box.]

Even though we currently have a standard of care, the protocol is not supported by previous proven evidence, and also no study was done so far to see the effectiveness as well as the treatment outcome of patients managed with this treatment protocol. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the outcomes of patients managed with the modified DKA treatment protocol used at TASH and Yekatit 12 Hospital.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Outcomes associated with a variable rate insulin infusion diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^113e6HcR]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To relate adverse events with glucose correction rates in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) using variable rate intravenous insulin-infusions (VRIII).

Methods

Retrospective, observational study in adults with DKA who received insulin infusions between 2012 and 2017 at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. Early correction of hyperglycaemia (< 10 mmol/L) was evaluated for association with hypoglycaemia (< 4.0 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.3 mmol/L) and clinical outcomes via regression analysis.

Results

The study involved 97 patients, with 93% having type 1 diabetes. The mean age was 38 years, 47% were women and 35% were admitted to intensive care. Hypoglycaemia rates during 12 and 24 h of treatment were 6.2% and 8.2%, respectively with 58% of patients recording their first BGL < 10 mmol/L within 12 h and 88% within 24 h. Ketone clearance time averaged at 15.6 h. Hyperglycaemia correction rates to < 10 mmol/L were not different in those with/without hypoglycaemia at 12/24 h, in multivariate analysis including admission BGL. Hypokalaemia occurred in 40.2% of patients and was associated with lower pH but not BGL correction rates.

Conclusion

The VRIII protocol achieved early hyperglycaemia correction and ketoacidosis reversal with low hypoglycaemia risk. However, high hypokalaemia rates suggest the need for aggressive potassium replacement, especially in markedly acidotic patients.

### Evaluation of an alternative approach to managing diabetic ketoacidosis: combination rapid-acting and basal subcutaneous insulin (CRABI-DKA) [^1117pEGW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines recognize the utility of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin regimens in the management of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the need to administer SQ insulin every 1–2 hours may discourage their use due to frequent lab testing and admission to higher level of care units.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the proportion of patients whose mild to moderate DKA resolved within 12 hours after receiving the new SQ insulin order set and the institution's intravenous (IV) insulin infusion order set.

Methods

The SQ order set included single doses of glargine (0.2 units/kg) and lispro (0.2 units/kg) upon therapy initiation, followed by lispro (0.1–0.2 units/kg) given every 3 hours until DKA resolution. The IV order set included a nurse-managed titratable infusion. Glucose and labs were checked every 3 hours in the SQ group, whereas glucose was checked hourly and labs were checked every 2 hours in the IV group. Patients were managed on units with a RN to patient ratio of 1:4–5 and 1:2–3 in the SQ and IV groups, respectively.

Results

The percentage of patients whose DKA resolved within 12 hours was 78% in the IV group and 90% in the SQ group (P = 0.1). The time to DKA resolution and rates of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our study highlights the utility of combining rapid-acting and basal SQ insulin in the management of DKA and adds to the limited literature evaluating this approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an endocrine emergency, involving hyperglycaemia, elevated ketones, and metabolic acidosis. Urgent management requires reversal of metabolic derangement, correction of electrolyte imbalance and volume depletion through the administration of intravenous fluids, electrolytes and short acting insulin, as well as investigation and correction of any underlying precipitants. There is variability across different hospitals and societies regarding the specifics of acute DKA management, including rates of insulin administration, fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement.

Insulin therapy suppresses ketogenesis and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, and as such is a vital part in the management of DKA. Continuous insulin infusion is widely accepted as the standard of care for moderate and severe DKA. International guidelines support the use of a fixed insulin rate of 0.1 units/kg/h during the initial stage of management, with a rate reduction step following normoglycaemia.

One of the main concerns regarding the insulin infusion rate is hypoglycaemia, which has been associated with increased length of stay in hospital and increased mortality in hospitalised patients. Recent data from a retrospective analysis by Mårtensson et al. conducted across intensive care units (ICU) in New Zealand and Australia, determined that intensive early correction of hyperglycaemia, when compared with partial early correction according to DKA‐specific guidelines, was independently associated with hypoglycaemia, hypo‐osmolarity and death.

Although fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) protocols are widely endorsed, they have been associated with higher rates of hypoglycaemia when compared to variable‐rate protocols. In the United Kingdom National Survey in 2013, 27.6% of people experienced hypoglycaemia < 4.0 mmol/L on the FRIII protocol of 0.1 units/kg/h. A retrospective cohort study by Bohach et al. found 50% of participants on a fixed‐rate protocol to have severe hypoglycaemia to < 2.8 mmol/L compared to 7% in the variable‐rate group. The high rates of hypoglycaemia in fixed‐rate protocols have been shown to be reduced with a rate reduction step after normoglycaemia is achieved. Analysis of variable‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) protocols revealed lower hypoglycaemia rates between 6% and 8%.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^114Mt3ex]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Alternative DKA treatment protocol

Our alternative treatment protocol for uncomplicated DKA cases was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous fluid and insulin replacement in order to simplify the management of this condition in the general pediatric emergency wards. The objectives of this alternative protocol are: a) restoration of extracellular fluid volume; b) replacement of sodium and potassium deficits; c) control of metabolic acidosis and ketonemia; d) control of hyperglycemia; e) reduction of risk of cerebral edema.

In this protocol, fluid replacement is initiated before insulin therapy, as normalization of peripheral perfusion is also necessary for insulin to reach the receptors in the target tissues. The aim of fluid therapy is expanding the intravascular compartment until peripheral circulation is normalized; it is initiated with a 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) - 20 ml/kg/hour (maximum 1.000 ml/hour) and additional parts of normal saline - 10 to 20 ml/kg/hour will be repeated, if necessary, until restoration of peripheral perfusion usually after 4–6 hours; in the presence of shock, 50 ml/kg may be infused over the first hour (maximum 1.000 mL/hour). During resuscitation phase, if blood glucose levels reach 200 mg/dl or lower, a 5% glucose solution may be added to 0.9% saline solution (half and half).

Maintenance fluid (100 ml/100 kcal/day) will be administered only if oral fluids could not be tolerated; therefore, total fluid deficit will not be replaced by intravenous fluids. Gradual and continuous oral rehydration will promote a slower correction of hyperosmolality.

Since 1996, we use in our emergency department an alternative insulin therapy protocol with SC rapid-acting analog (lispro or aspart), which was validated by a randomized clinical trial comparing 30 DKA episodes treated in such protocol with other 30 episodes treated with continuous intravenous insulin infusion. In this regard, a recent evidence-based review concluded that the use of subcutaneously administered rapid-acting insulin analogs is safe and effective for the management of uncomplicated DKA. All the 60 DKA episodes enrolled in our randomized clinical trial received the same fluid replacement therapy described above. The biochemical characteristics of both branches of the study during the first 30 hours of DKA management are illustrated in Table 3.

### 0.9% saline versus Ringer's lactate as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116ZyEoz]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Treatment protocol and monitoring

A bolus of 20 mL/kg of trial fluid was given over an hour to children who presented in shock. For those without hypoperfusion or shock, the trial fluid volume to be given was calculated as a sum of deficit (65–85 mL/kg) and maintenance fluid (Holliday-Segar) for the next 48 hours. This total fluid to be administered over 48 hours was started as an hourly infusion of trial fluid. The clinician's judgment decided the amount of deficit correction needed within the range (65–85 mL/kg). Insulin was started at the rate of 0.05 U/kg/hour after the first hour of fluid therapy. All subjects received 0.45% saline with 5% dextrose once blood glucose decreased to 250 mg/dL. We maintained the blood glucose levels between 150 and 250 mg/dL after the addition of 5% dextrose. Any fall below 150 mg/dL was mitigated with incremental dextrose concentration from 5% to 7.5%, 10% or 12.5% as needed, so as to enable continued insulin administration for correction of ketoacidosis. In children with persistently high blood glucose, the clinician went through a checklist assessing for errors in insulin dose, preparation, patency of vascular access and infusion rate before increasing the rate of insulin infusion to 0.1 U/kg/hour for non-response. Potassium was added at a standard dose of 40 mEq/L in both the trial fluids after urine output was ensured. All children were managed as per standard unit protocol (online supplemental additional 1).

Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine and venous blood gas (pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate) measurements were undertaken at admission. Capillary blood glucose was monitored hourly. Blood gas and blood ketones (point of care capillary method) were measured every 4 hours, while renal function and serum electrolytes were measured every 8–12 hours until endpoints were achieved. Clinical data that included respiratory rate, heart rate, capillary refill, blood pressure, hydration status, fluid intake, urine output, and neurological status were recorded every 2 hours or more frequently, and the values were entered in a predesigned monitoring sheet. Children were followed until discharge/death from the hospital.

As urine output is not a reliable marker in DKA (osmotic diuresis), serum creatinine was used to define AKI based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging. The first creatinine at hospital admission was used to stage AKI according to the KDIGO staging.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^1143hAvE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedures

After exclusions (Figure 1), 80 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer‐generated sequence with variable block sizes of 2–8. Allocation was concealed using sealed, opaque envelopes, and participants were assigned to either the early degludec or control group. The early degludec group received SC degludec at a dose of 0.3 units/kg within 3 h of DKA diagnosis, with a dose reduction to 0.15 units/kg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft–Gault equation), in addition to the standard IVII protocol. The selected dose was based on prior prospective studies of glargine U‐100, which reported doses ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 units/kg, as well as the 2022 UK guideline, which recommends a basal insulin dose of approximately 0.25 units/kg. Together, these findings provide both pharmacologic and clinical rationale for selecting 0.3 units/kg of degludec. The control group was administered only the standard IVII for DKA and did not receive placebo injections. Orders for intravenous insulin bolus, fixed‐dose IVII regimen, intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were consistent in both groups and followed the 2009 ADA recommendations, with the full protocol detailed in Appendix S1. A fixed IVII regimen of 0.1 units/kg/h was used until the capillary blood glucose (CBG) dropped below 200 mg/dL. Once CBG fell below 200 mg/dL, the insulin infusion rate was adjusted to 0.02–0.05 units/kg/h according to the patient's CBG level, aiming to maintain CBG between 150 and 200 mg/dL until DKA resolution. CBG was measured hourly, and serum electrolyte levels were monitored every 4 h in both groups. DKA resolution was defined as CBG of less than 200 mg/dL, in combination with a normalised serum anion gap (≤ 12 mEq/L), a venous pH above 7.30, or a serum bicarbonate greater than 15.0 mEq/L. After resolution, patients were transitioned to a SC insulin regimen as soon as they could tolerate oral or enteral intake, using a newly calculated weight‐based total daily dose of approximately 0.6 units/kg/day in both groups. SC insulin aspart was injected 5 to 15 min before meals in both groups as prandial insulin. For basal insulin, the control group received insulin glargine U‐100 SC with the first dose of insulin aspart, while the intervention group received a second dose of insulin degludec approximately 24 h after the first dose. IVII was discontinued 1 h after transitioning to full SC insulin. Following DKA resolution, while patients remained hospitalised, the internal medicine and endocrinology teams primarily adjusted multiple daily injections of basal‐bolus SC insulin as part of standard inpatient care, and CBG was routinely monitored four times daily (before meals and at bedtime). In the event of hypoglycaemia, patients received 15 g of oral glucose or 25 g of intravenous glucose, depending on their level of consciousness and ability to tolerate oral intake. CBG was rechecked 15 min later, and treatment was repeated as necessary until levels exceeded 70 mg/dL. A meal or snack was subsequently provided to prevent recurrence. Insulin doses were individually adjusted based on CBG trends and the patient's clinical status. Continuous glucose monitoring was not included in the study protocol.

### Highlighting the new consensus guidelines for managing people at risk of, and with early-stage type 1 diabetes-relevance to clinical care in the UK [^114tzKWR]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There are four key areas.

First, guidance is provided around the frequency and intensity of follow‐up for single Ab as well as multiple Ab individuals, the different stages of early‐stage presymptomatic T1D, in adults and children. The pros and cons of the different approaches to glucose monitoring (glycated haemoglobin, continuous glucose monitoring, self monitoring of blood glucose) are outlined and the utility of these different approaches at different stages is discussed. Importantly, advice is also provided around safety. The importance of regular education about symptoms of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis is highlighted and all health professionals involved in monitoring and care of these individuals have a responsibility to provide this education. At this time there are no formal recommendations of how appropriate monitoring and follow‐up pathways may be practically implemented given this is likely to be a novel service, and this will require attention and careful consideration.
