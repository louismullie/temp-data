## Question

A 54-year-old male comes to the clinic to initiate care with a new physician. He has no complaints at this time. When taking his history, the patient says his medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension both of which are well managed on his medications. His medications are metformin and lisinopril. A review of systems is negative. While taking the social history, the patient hesitates when asked about alcohol consumption. Further gentle questioning by the physician leads the patient to admit that he drinks 5–6 beers per night and up to 10–12 drinks per day over the weekend. He says that he has been drinking like this for "years". He becomes emotional and says that his alcohol is negatively affecting his relationship with his wife and children; however, when asked about efforts to decrease his consumption, the patient says he has not tried in the past and doesn't think he has "the strength to stop". Which of the following stages of change most accurately describes this patient's behavior?
A. Contemplation
B. Preparation
C. Action
D. Maintenance

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which stage of change most accurately describes a 54-year-old man with heavy, long-standing alcohol use who acknowledges harm to his relationships, expresses low self-efficacy, and has not yet attempted to reduce his drinking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions of the transtheoretical stages of change. Then, I should verify the patient's current behavior and timeline for any intention to change. Next, I will examine his expressed motivation, self-efficacy, and any concrete planning or action. Finally, I will compare this profile to each stage and confirm the best match, while double-checking for common pitfalls in staging ambivalent patients.

> Let me first confirm the stage definitions so I don't jump to conclusions: precontemplation is no intention to change within 6 months, contemplation is intending to change within 6 months, preparation is intending to act within 30 days, action is behavior change for 0–6 months, and maintenance is sustained change beyond 6 months. Some models include termination for permanent change, but the core five suffice here.

> Now, I need to check the patient's current behavior and stated intentions. He reports 5–6 beers nightly and up to 10–12 drinks on weekends for years, with no prior attempts to cut down, and when asked about decreasing consumption he says he hasn't tried and doubts he has the strength to stop. There is no mention of setting a quit date, making a plan, or taking any steps toward change, which argues against preparation or action [^115HN37t].

> Hold on, let's not conflate awareness of harm with readiness to change. He clearly recognizes negative consequences — his alcohol use is harming relationships with his wife and children — and he becomes emotional discussing this, indicating problem recognition and ambivalence rather than denial. However, recognition alone does not equal preparation or action, and his statement about lacking the strength to stop signals low self-efficacy and no imminent behavioral commitment, which aligns with contemplation rather than preparation or action [^115HN37t] [^116dqYiU].

> I should confirm the time frame for intention. He has not tried to reduce use in the past and does not articulate a plan to change now, which places him outside preparation and action; by contrast, his expressed concern and emotional reaction suggest he is thinking about change, even if vaguely, fitting the "intending to change within 6 months" window of contemplation rather than the "within 30 days" criterion for preparation [^115HN37t].

> Let me consider each option carefully and double-check for inconsistencies. Preparation would require a near-term plan or small steps toward change, which are absent here; Action would require current behavior change, which is not happening; Maintenance would require sustained change beyond 6 months, which is not applicable; Precontemplation would fit if there were no intention or awareness, but his acknowledgment of harm and relationship impact pushes him past precontemplation into contemplation, where awareness coexists with ambivalence and low readiness to act immediately [^115HN37t] [^111PfJWE].

> But wait, what if the emotional expression and hesitation indicate preparation? Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered about that, but preparation requires concrete steps or a near-term commitment, such as setting a quit date or initiating small changes, which he has not done; thus, the balance of evidence supports contemplation as the most accurate stage assignment today [^115HN37t].

> Final answer: Contemplation, because the patient recognizes significant alcohol-related harm and expresses ambivalence and low self-efficacy without any concrete plans or recent attempts to change, matching the definition of intending to change within 6 months but not within 30 days [^115HN37t].

---

The patient is in the **contemplation stage** of change. He recognizes that his alcohol use is harmful and negatively affects his relationships, but he has not yet made a concrete plan or taken steps to reduce consumption. This stage is characterized by **ambivalence and low self-efficacy**, as evidenced by his statement that he lacks the strength to stop. Appropriate clinical actions include motivational interviewing to resolve ambivalence, enhance self-efficacy, and support progression to preparation and action [^116M3rwt] [^111SMqvz].

---

## Stages of change model

The **transtheoretical model** outlines five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance [^115HN37t]. These stages reflect a person's readiness to change and guide tailored interventions [^112Y6n4X].

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Precontemplation | No intention to change in the next 6 months |
| Contemplation | Intends to change within 6 months; aware of pros and cons |
| Preparation | Plans to act within 30 days; has specific plan |
| Action | Has changed behavior within the last 6 months |
| Maintenance | Sustained change for more than 6 months |

---

## Patient's stage of change

The patient is in the **contemplation stage**: he acknowledges harm and expresses a desire to change but has not yet committed to specific steps. Key indicators include:

- **Awareness of harm**: Recognizes negative impact on relationships and emotions.
- **Ambivalence**: Expresses doubt about ability to change ("I don't think I have the strength to stop").
- **No concrete plan**: Has not attempted to reduce or quit.

---

## Clinical implications and interventions

In the contemplation stage, **motivational interviewing (MI)** is effective for resolving ambivalence, enhancing self-efficacy, and supporting progression to preparation and action [^116M3rwt] [^115B94p7]. Recommended strategies include:

- **Express empathy**: Validate feelings and reduce resistance [^116M3rwt].
- **Develop discrepancy**: Highlight gaps between current behavior and goals [^116M3rwt].
- **Roll with resistance**: Avoid confrontation; explore ambivalence [^116M3rwt].
- **Support self-efficacy**: Build confidence in ability to change [^111SMqvz].

---

## Conclusion

The patient is in the **contemplation stage**, recognizing harm but lacking a concrete plan. MI can help resolve ambivalence, build self-efficacy, and support movement toward preparation and action [^116M3rwt].

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111JEAzC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to assess whether the patient is at risk of developing severe and/or complicated alcohol withdrawal, or complications from alcohol withdrawal. Use a validated risk assessment scale and an assessment of individual risk factors, in addition to current signs and symptoms.

### Conflict management and resolution [^1133WGPt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

When people work collaboratively, conflict will always arise. Understanding the nature and source of conflict and its progression and stages, resolution, and outcome is a vital aspect of leadership. Causes of conflict include the miscomprehension of communication, emotional issues, personal history, and values. When the difference is understood and the resultant behavior properly addressed, most conflict can be settled in a way that provides needed change in an organization and interrelationships. There are serious consequences of avoiding or mismanaging disagreements. Informed leaders can effectively prevent destructive conflicts.

### Women's views on moderate and low alcohol consumption: stages of the subjective transition from pregnancy to postpartum [^117XcLrP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In our study, we found that pregnant and breastfeeding women generally perceive alcohol consumption as a risk to the health of the child and would like to control this risk to a large extent. Adherence to the abstinence rule is particularly sought during pregnancy which, however, does not necessarily exclude occasional and low level consumption from the point of view of some women. Based on this perception, a range between occasional alcohol consumption up to the zero-tolerance limit is described as an acceptable way of dealing with the risk from the mothers' point of view.

Many women express a need for guidance and counselling by health care professionals at some stages of the transition to motherhood. The stages identified can be used as pointers to address the subject of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding in real life settings. The long-term perspective offers insights into women's changing needs during the transition from pregnancy to breastfeeding. The stage of pregnancy that has not yet been (medically) confirmed should be taken more into account, as women experience themselves as particularly vulnerable during this time. This also applies to the early stage of pregnancy until the epidemiological and perceived risks of miscarriage decreases. The results of the study therefore suggest that individual and low-threshold counselling services should be offered to women with low to moderate alcohol consumption. If possible, family centred counselling should take place before or in the stage around conception and be continued within the framework of continuous care models until the end of the breastfeeding period.

### Patient reflections, challenges, and supports related to early liver transplant for severe alcohol-associated liver disease [^114C8b7U]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Theme F: Feelings of shame or stigma and new self-worth

Several participants described engaging in self-reflection after the liver transplant to process and make sense of the transplant experience, self-identities, or their relationships. Participants mentioned striving to "be a better person" or a better version of themselves compared with the person they were before the transplant. Some participants expressed that they initially felt shame or embarrassment for having allowed the liver disease to advance to the point of a liver transplant. Yet, participants also described eventually finding a new sense of self-worth: they felt worth "saving" because their health care providers had determined they were deserving of a liver transplant. Participants noted that the liver transplant experience had allowed them to confront their unhealthy alcohol use more openly. Many felt secure revealing their alcohol use histories and ELT to family and friends. But the comfort level was generally lower for disclosing to work colleagues because of a fear of negative professional consequences. Many participants felt others saw them differently, either positively (eg, overcoming adversity and toughness) or negatively (eg, being an "alcoholic, dirty bum").

Theme G: Reconnecting with others and redefining boundaries

Participants generally perceived improved interactions with others, such as spending more time with loved ones or reconnecting with family. A few participants specifically attributed the change to sustained alcohol abstinence. Some participants described having more patience and being less prone to frustration or anger. Others reported being more attentive and present with personal relationships, as well as being more willing to engage in social events. A few participants described setting new boundaries in relationships, particularly with people who drink alcohol. Other participants noted redefining interactions with friends or family when around alcohol, such as declining alcohol themselves while permitting others to drink. In contrast, 1 participant described worsened interpersonal interactions with family and spouse because of depressive or aggressive mood effects from transplant-related medications.

### Does progressive stage transition mean getting better? A test of the transtheoretical model in alcoholism recovery [^111Ckckb]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To test two central assumptions of stage movement in the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) vis-à-vis alcoholism recovery: (assumption 1) individuals making a forward transition to the action-oriented stages (i.e. preparation/action) will manifest relatively greater drinking improvements than their counterparts remaining in the pre-action stages (i.e. pre-contemplation, contemplation); and (assumption 2) individuals remaining in the pre-action stages across time will not demonstrate clinically relevant improvement in drinking outcomes.

Design and Setting

Secondary data analyses of data from Project MATCH, a large multi-site alcoholism treatment-matching study.

Measurements

At baseline and 3 months post-treatment, the following variables were measured: stage-of-change (based on the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment measure and the most recent stage assignment algorithm), drinks per drinking day (DDD) and percentage days abstinent (PDA).

Findings

Six of the eight tests of assumptions 1 and 2 failed to support the basic tenets of the TTM. Our study demonstrated that individuals making a progressive stage transition to the action-oriented stages (i.e. preparation/action) do not necessarily manifest greater improvements in drinking-related behavior than individuals remaining in the pre-action stages (i.e. pre-contemplation, contemplation), and that individuals remaining in the pre-action stages over time actually do manifest statistically significant and clinically important improvements in drinking-related behavior.

Conclusions

Our findings challenge not only the criterion validity associated with stage movement in the TTM account of alcoholism recovery, but also recent TTM-based substance abuse treatment approaches which systematically promote forward stage transition as a primary clinical goal and marker of therapeutic success.

### Impact of different personality dimensions (NEO five-factor inventory) on the outcome of alcohol-dependent patients 6 and 12 months after treatment [^111EtAPG]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that outpatient treatment might be equally effective as inpatient treatment for alcohol-dependent patients. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which patient group benefits most from outpatient treatment. Some personality traits such as emotional instability and high neuroticism are known risk factors for relapse after treatment. The purpose of the following study was to investigate the possible relationship between personality traits, measured by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and outcome after an intensive outpatient treatment program. Seventy-four alcohol-dependent patients who had completed the outpatient treatment program were included. Patients were examined at the beginning and end of the treatment, and 6 and 12 months after completion of the treatment. At the 6- and 12-month follow-up, 97% of the patients were successfully located and personally interviewed. Analyses revealed that 54 patients (73%) had been abstinent for the entire 12-month follow-up period. Twenty patients (27.4%) were found to be non-abstinent. Of these patients, 10 (13.5%) were found to be improved and 10 (13.5%) to have relapsed. Results indicate a remarkable stability of NEO-FFI scores over time, giving evidence for the usefulness of this instrument for the assessment of personality dimensions in alcohol-dependent patients. Patients who relapsed within 12 months after treatment had significantly higher scores on the personality domains of "neuroticism" and lower scores on the personality domains of "conscientiousness" than abstainers. These results are in line with prior research on this topic.

### An exploration of the dynamic longitudinal relationship between mental health and alcohol consumption: a prospective cohort study [^115xef2y]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

No coupling (baseline) model

The top third of Table 4 refers to the baseline model (in which alcohol use and mental health do not influence changes in each other). A significant autoproportional effect for alcohol consumption was found (β = -0.42, CI -0.52 to -0.33) but not for mental health. The coefficient was negative, indicating that those drinking more made greater reductions in their alcohol consumption between phases.

Alcohol consumption producing change in mental health model

The middle third of Table 4 shows estimates for a model where alcohol use affected upcoming change in mental health, but mental health had no effect on change in alcohol consumption. The alcohol autoproportional effect was significant (β = -0.43, CI -0.52 to -0.33) but not the mental health parameter. The coupling parameter was also non-significant. This model was compared with the baseline model, but offered no significant improvement in fit (Table 2).

Mental health producing change in alcohol consumption model

The estimates concerning the model in which mental health scores affected upcoming change in alcohol consumption, but alcohol consumption had no effect on changes in mental health are presented in Table 3. A significant autoproportional effect was found for alcohol consumption (β = -0.50, CI -0.60 to -0.40) but not mental health. The coupling parameter was significant (γ = -0.31, CI -0.52 to -0.10) in this instance, and was negative, meaning that those with better mental health made greater reductions in their drinking. This model was an improvement over the baseline model (Table 2; P < 0.01).

### Perceptions of alcohol risk among HIV / hepatitis C coinfected patients [^115VzFWc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined how patient perceptions of alcohol risk, provider discussions about alcohol, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) differed among HIV-HCV coinfected patients in primary care.

Methods

Between April, 2016 and April, 2017, we conducted a screening survey with patients in an HIV primary care clinic in Seattle, Washington, who had chronic HCV coinfection or a history of chronic HCV infection who had successfully cleared their infection with treatment.

Results

Of 225 participants, 84 (37%) were active drinkers (drank ≥ 2–4times/mo in past 3 months). Of those with little to no use for ≥ 3 months, 65 (29%) were former drinkers with a history of alcohol use and 76 were abstainers with no such history. Former drinkers and abstainers were more likely than active drinkers to perceive that any drinking was unsafe (69% vs 58% vs 31%; P < 0.001). Former drinkers were more likely to report a physician's recommendation to stop drinking than active drinkers (63% vs 47%; P = 0.05). The great majority (87%) of former drinkers decided to stop or reduce drinking on their own (most often in response to a nonhealth life event) and only 13% acknowledged doing so on their doctor's prompting. HCV treatment was not associated with former or active drinking status.

Conclusions

Our findings underscore the importance of educating not only HIV-HCV patients about the effects of alcohol use but also HIV clinicians about delivering consistent counseling about alcohol avoidance. Understanding the reasons that HIV-HCV coinfected persons make changes in their alcohol use could drive novel interventions that reduce the negative consequences of drinking.

### Does stage tailoring matter in brief alcohol interventions for job-seekers? A randomized controlled trial [^112UFzar]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether or not a stage tailored intervention is more effective than a non-stage tailored intervention of the same intensity in reducing alcohol use among job-seekers with unhealthy alcohol use, and whether initial motivation to change is a moderator of efficacy.

Design

A three-group randomized controlled trial with 3-, 6- and 15-month follow-ups.

Setting

Three job agencies in Germany.

Participants

A total of 1243 job-seekers with unhealthy alcohol use were randomized to (i) stage tailored intervention based on the transtheoretical model of change (ST), (ii) non-stage tailored intervention based on the theory of planned behaviour (NST) and (iii) assessment only (controls). Participants received feedback letters and manuals at baseline and 3months later.

Measurements

Piecewise latent growth models were calculated measuring change in 'alcohol use' from baseline to month 3 (active intervention phase) and from months 3 to 15 (post-intervention phase, primary outcome). Motivation to change was included as a 4-point continuous measure.

Findings

All groups reduced alcohol use from months 0 to 3 (controls: mean = -0.866, NST: mean = -0.883, ST: mean = -0.718, Ps ≤ 0.001). Post-intervention (months 3–15), low-motivated individuals in the ST group showed a greater reduction than those in the control group (β = 0.135, P = 0.039, Cohen's d = 0.42) and in the NST group (β = 0.180, P = 0.009, Cohen's d = 0.55). In contrast, compared to the ST group (β = 0.030, P = 0.361), alcohol use decreased more strongly with higher initial motivation in the NST group (β = -0.118, P = 0.010).

Conclusions

Among job-seekers with high levels of alcohol consumption, an intervention tailored to motivational 'stage of change' was more effective than a non-stage tailored intervention for reducing alcohol use 15 months after baseline assessment in participants with low initial motivation to change.

### Perceived health status, alcohol-related problems, and readiness to change among medically hospitalized, alcohol-dependent patients [^116dqYiU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol dependence is prevalent among medically hospitalized patients, and acute illness has the potential to increase motivation to change and provide a therapeutic window for treatment of alcohol dependence. This study evaluated the correlations of readiness to change drinking behavior with perceived physical and mental health status and specific alcohol-related consequences of medical inpatients.

Design and Measurements

The study was a cross-sectional survey of 50 clinically recognized and subsequently confirmed alcohol-dependent patients admitted to general internal medicine teaching services with no evidence of chronic cognitive functional deficits. We estimated correlations of process-of-change variables (problem recognition, ambivalence about change, and taking steps to change drinking) with measures of patient perception of general physical and mental health status and self-reported alcohol-related consequences.

Results

Problem recognition (r = -0.31, P = 0.028) and ambivalence about change (r = -0.41, P = 0.003), but not taking steps to change drinking (r = -0.26, P = 0.072) were significantly associated with perceived physical health. Perceived mental health was not associated with these variables, but greater alcohol-specific consequences were typically associated with greater recognition, ambivalence, and intent to change.

Conclusions

Among alcohol-dependent patients with acute medical illness requiring hospitalization, poorer perceived health status was associated with increased recognition of drinking problems and thoughts about changing drinking behavior. Future research should evaluate if problem recognition and ambivalence modify treatment involvement and outcomes following hospitalization and if hospital-based interventions designed to link medical conditions and their treatment to alcohol dependence enhance recognition and ambivalence.

### Transdiagnostic clinical staging for childhood mental health: an adjunctive tool for classifying internalizing and externalizing syndromes that emerge in children aged 5–11 Years [^117VK9kq]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluate the Clinical Utility of Staged Care

Staged care needs to be formally evaluated for its comparative effectiveness compared to treatment as usual. At the individual level, attention should be given to evaluating whether stratifying treatment selection based on stage and illness type results in better clinical outcomes compared to those based on a conventional diagnosis. Outcomes should include assessment of changes in symptoms and distress, as well as the ability of stage-based interventions to prevent illness progression to advanced stages (McGorry et al.). At population level, evaluation entails examining whether stage care in childhood has the potential to improve accessibility/ equity, acceptability/ satisfaction, efficiency/ expenditure/ cost, effectiveness/ outcomes, appropriateness and care continuity/ coordination, while ultimately reducing the occurrence of mental health difficulties within childhood and over the life course (Sawrikar et al.).

Global Sustainable Development in Using Clinical Staging

The final suggestion circles back to the initial premise of this article: sustainable development in mental health (Patel et al.). Substantial attention has been given to reforming mental health care to include prevention alongside intervention to reduce the global burden of disease associated with mental illness (Institute of Medicine). In line with this, clinical staging has the potential to guide population health-oriented systems of care providing promotive, preventive, and curative services, as well as ensuring adequate provision for rehabilitation and long-term care (Sawrikar et al.). However, current research into applications of clinical staging is generally limited in scope, i.e. investigating the validity and utility of staging in youth or adult mental health, in clinical care settings, in well developed countries. Global sustainable development in using clinical staging requires aligning it with a convergence model of mental health, recognising evidence from research examining developmental, biological, and social determinants of mental health (Patel et al.). For instance, an ongoing need exists for integrating global perspectives in achieving sustainable development goals. Social environmental factors may have a substantial role in determining prognosis in child mental health in low-middle income countries through differences in gene-by-environment interactions and epigenetic mechanisms or impacts on treatment (Compton & Shim; World Health Organization). Such considerations to social determinants of mental health are overlooked in clinical staging so far (Shah et al.). We suggest that integrating social and biological factors in risk stratification as presented in Tables 1 and 2 could profoundly help in optimizing clinical staging in childhood mental health.

### Managing alcohol use disorder in primary health care [^111okQQ9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Brief Advice in Primary Health Care

Brief advice delivered in primary health care is commonly 5–10 min in duration and often based on the 'FRAMES principles' and the 'Five As'. FRAMES is an acronym summarising the key components of brief advice: feedback (on the client's risk of having alcohol problems); responsibility (change is the client's responsibility); advice (provision of clear advice when requested); menu (what are the options for change?); empathy (an approach that is warm, reflective and understanding); and self-efficacy (optimism about the behaviour change). The five As are: (1) assess alcohol consumption with a brief screening tool, followed by clinical assessment as needed; (2) advise patients to reduce alcohol consumption to lower levels; (3) agree on individual goals for reducing alcohol use or abstinence (if indicated); (4) assist patients in acquiring the motivations, self-help skills or support needed for behaviour change; and, (5) arrange follow-up support and repeated counselling, including the referral of dependent drinkers to specialty treatment.

A series of systematic reviews over 15 years, covering a total of 56 unique primary health care-based randomised controlled trials, has consistently found that, up to 12-months follow-up, commonly the longest period studied, brief advice is effective in reducing heavy drinking, leading to lower average alcohol consumption, a reduction in alcohol-related problems, and reduced health care utilisation and mortality outcomes.

Delivery by a range of practitioners has beneficial effects, and there is little evidence to suggest that any one profession of provider performs better or worse than another. Further, there is little evidence to suggest that the content of the advice is important for the outcome, or that longer or more sophisticated advice leads to better outcomes than shorter or less sophisticated advice. So, it seems that the length, complexity and sophistication of the advice are less important than the actual contact between provider and patient. Further, two systematic reviews that studied outcomes amongst control groups in studies of brief advice found consistent evidence of reduced drinking. Thus, what is termed screening or assessment reactivity may be additional elements of the positive effects of brief advice.

Most of the evidence for brief advice has focused on adults aged between 18 and 65 years, rather than young or older people. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that brief advice works just as well for the young and elderly as it does for adults.

### The American psychiatric association practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder [^1121femb]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to psychiatric evaluation, APA 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain quantitative behavioral measurement to detect alcohol misuse and assess its severity in the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients with suspected AUD.

### The impact of alcohol on clinical outcomes in established psychosis: a longitudinal study [^116eEBno]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Alcohol use disorders are common among people with psychosis and are associated with poorer prognoses. In psychosis patients, there are inconsistent findings regarding the link between alcohol disorders and clinical symptomatic outcomes. This study examined the relationships between alcohol consumption and specific clinical outcomes, including affective symptoms, in psychosis.

Methods

Participants were recruited from secondary care services in the United Kingdom. Two hundred and ten participants whose substance use met inclusion for an alcohol disorder were compared with other substance users (n = 117) on baseline demographic, clinical and substance use variables. The alcohol subgroup was assessed at three time-points, with repeated measures of psychopathology and alcohol use over a 2-year period. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to examine whether change in alcohol use was associated with change in clinical outcomes. We controlled for a wide range of potential confounds, including other substance use.

Results

A small but specific effect was evident for change in the quantity of alcohol consumed on change in depression (adjusted coefficient for 10 total units over 90 days: 0.0015, P = 0.047). Alcohol consumption was not associated with subsequent severity of psychotic symptoms (adjusted coefficient for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale general for 10 average daily units 0.2492, P = 0.420) or severity of anxiety symptoms (adjusted coefficient for 10 average daily units 0.0534, P = 0.473).

Conclusions

For people with psychosis, the most detrimental effect of alcohol consumption appears to be its effect on mood. Some of this effect seems to be reversible, with drinking reduction associated with subsequent mood improvement.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113V4SF3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that the following individual factors may increase the risk of complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal:

- concomitant use of other addictive substances

- positive blood alcohol concentration in the presence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal

- signs or symptoms of co-occurring psychiatric disorders

- presence of multiple risk factors.

### Recent advances in behavioral addiction treatments: focusing on mechanisms of change [^112EucAT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In the latter half of the 20th century, research on behavioral treatments for addictions aimed to develop and test effective treatments. Among the treatments found to be at least moderately effective, direct comparisons failed to reveal consistent superiority of one approach over another. This ubiquitous finding held true despite underlying theories that differed markedly in their proposed causal processes related to patient change. In the 21st century, the focus of treatment research is increasingly on how treatment works for whom rather than whether it works. Studies of active treatment ingredients and mechanisms of behavioral change, while promising, have yielded inconsistent results. Simple mediation analysis may need to be expanded via inclusion of models testing for moderated mediation, mediated moderation, and conditional indirect effects. Examples are offered as to how these more complex models can lead to increased understanding of the conditions under which specific treatment interventions will be effective and mechanisms of change operative in improving behavioral treatments for addictions.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114WfQdT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder terminology — illicit opioid use, maintenance medications, medication management, moderation management, and motivational interviewing — is defined to guide clinical care as follows: Illicit opioid use (including nonmedical use) is the use of an illicit opioid or a prescribed medicine for reasons other than those intended by the prescriber, including use in higher doses or different routes than intended. Maintenance medication(s) are pharmacotherapy on a consistent schedule for persons with addiction, usually with an agonist or partial agonist, which mitigates against the pathological pursuit of reward and/or relief and allows remission of overt addiction-related problems. Medication management comprises services that focus on the appropriateness, effectiveness, and safety of medications for a given patient, including monitoring and evaluating response, dose titration, education and adherence support, and referrals to promote ongoing engagement in treatment, optimize medication response, and prevent relapse. Moderation management is a behavioral change program and national support group network that empowers individuals to accept personal responsibility for choosing and maintaining their own path, whether moderation or abstinence, and promotes early self-recognition of risky drinking behavior. Motivational interviewing is described via layperson, practitioner, and technical definitions, including a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion.

### Women's views on moderate and low alcohol consumption: stages of the subjective transition from pregnancy to postpartum [^11678ZJs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Changing alcohol consumption in daily life

Our findings show that alcohol consumption changes during the transition from pregnancy to breastfeeding, with the identified stages characterised by periods of change. In the first stage, when pregnancy is not yet confirmed, most of the women we interviewed consumed alcohol, but avoided drinking large amounts or strong alcohol. Only a few women had stopped drinking altogether before pregnancy. This result has been reported before and suggests that alcohol consumption is higher in this stage than after pregnancy is confirmed. In the second stage, when the pregnancy is recognised but not yet publicly known, all women reduce their alcohol consumption significantly, but some consume very small amounts of alcohol in certain situations in order not to reveal the secret of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy is known, women develop different strategies around abstinence during the third stage, only few of them allowing themselves some small amounts of alcohol linked to special events. Shortly after birth, in the fourth stage, alcohol consumption is not an issue for the women interviewed, as they are challenged by caring for the new-born. In the last fifth phase after birth, particularly first-time mothers describe a reduction of alcohol consumption compared to the time before pregnancy.

The change in alcohol consumption is particularly pronounced in early pregnancy, when women change their usual drinking habits to the extent that they completely stop or drastically reduce their alcohol consumption. The change is also clear up to six months after birth, when women slowly resume alcohol consumption. This finding is consistent with results from previous studies indicating this marked adjustment around early pregnancy, as well as that alcohol consumption increases again after the birth of the child. In particular, first-time mothers describe that alcohol consumption before getting pregnant is closely linked to certain social activities, having a glass of wine with friends. For some women abstaining from alcohol is therefore accompanied by a reduction in social participation and women experience the state of being excluded or different as part of their transition to motherhood. The withdrawal from social life also applies to some extent to the postnatal period, which leads to a lower alcohol consumption. Here, the women in our sample not only experience a normatively based ostracism of the "drinking mother" but also describe a certain physical intolerance that is connected with alcohol consumption. Some women who are already caring for small children report that their alcohol consumption is already reduced significantly.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^113uRp2h]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the reasons for the reduction in alcohol consumption and AUDIT-C score by SBI, we focused on behavioral changes in alcohol use using a TTM. Interestingly, the results showed a significant difference in the composition of the behavioral change stages between the intervention and control groups at 3 months, suggesting that the proportion of "Precontemplation" stage decreased and that of "Action" stage increased in the intervention group. Therefore, it is possible that these behavioral changes contributed to the decrease in alcohol consumption values and AUDIT-C scores in the intervention group. Although studies have reported that genetic information feedback reduces alcohol consumption, the factors that contribute to this reduction have not been examined. Therefore, this study provides the first evidence that SBI reduces alcohol consumption, possibly through behavioral changes. Nevertheless, the extent to which the elements of SBI contribute to changes in drinking behavior is currently unclear. Future studies should address this issue in more detail.

In contrast, a significant reduction in alcohol consumption in the intervention group was attenuated from 3 to 6 months and a significantly greater reduction in alcohol consumption was observed in the intervention group compared with the control group at 3 months but not at 6 months. This result suggests that the alcohol consumption-reducing effect of SBI does not persist in the long term. A recent umbrella review concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) show effectiveness in the relative long-term (more than 6 months) reduction of alcohol consumption. Both CBT and MI are usually conducted over multiple sessions; reports of some cases indicate that more sessions induce a greater reduction in alcohol consumption than a single session. Because the SBI was implemented only once in this study, future studies should investigate the effectiveness of multiple educational campaigns conducted on a periodic schedule (e.g. once every 3–6 months) to sustain the effectiveness of the SBI.

### Painful medical conditions and alcohol use: a prospective study among older adults [^112K7fDD]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine associations between older adults' baseline painful medical conditions and their 10-year drinking behavior, and whether personal and life context characteristics moderate these associations.

Methods

At baseline, then, 1, 4, and 10 years later, late-middle-aged community residents (M = 61 years; N = 1,291) were surveyed regarding their painful medical conditions, use of alcohol, and personal and life context characteristics. Latent growth modeling was used to determine concurrent and prospective relationships between painful medical conditions and 10-year drinking behavior, and moderating effects of personal and life context characteristics on these relationships.

Results

At baseline, individuals reporting more numerous painful medical conditions consumed alcohol less frequently, but had more frequent drinking problems, than did individuals with fewer such conditions. Being female and having more interpersonal social resources strengthened the association between painful medical conditions and less ethanol consumed. For men more so than women, more numerous painful medical conditions were associated with more frequent drinking problems. Baseline painful medical conditions alone had no prospective effect on 10-year change in drinking behavior, but being older and having more interpersonal social resources made it more likely that baseline painful medical conditions would predict decline over time in frequency of alcohol consumption and drinking problems.

Conclusions

Late-middle-aged individuals who have more numerous painful medical conditions reduce alcohol consumption but nonetheless remain at risk for more frequent drinking problems. Gender, age, and interpersonal social resources moderate the influence of painful medical conditions on late-life alcohol use. These results imply that older individuals with pain are at little immediate or long-term risk for increased alcohol consumption, but clinicians should remain alert to drinking problems among their older pain patients, especially men.

### Behavioral interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis [^114EM2Jz]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral health interventions are often gauged with a dichotomous outcome, "success" or "failure". Hidden by this dichotomy is a series of behavior changes that can be followed with the Transtheoretical Model (stages of change). There has been little consideration, however, about whether this information can and should be used in cost-effectiveness analysis. We review the stages of change model and its applications to behavioral health interventions. We then discuss analytical methods for including stages of change, or similar behavior change models, in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This is typically not done but it may be critical for study design and for interpreting CEA results.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^113LzHxY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation in the absence of any secondary causes including excessive alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication, viral infection, or hereditary disorders. NAFLD is progressive and has a wide spectrum of histological characteristics from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. Once NASH has developed, progressive fibrosis may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease is the mildest disease state of hepatocyte steatosis in the course of pathological development of NAFLD. Once simple fatty liver disease develops to the stage of fatty liver hepatitis, the related death rate could reach 11.77 cases in every 1,000 people each year. At the simple fatty liver disease stage, appropriate nursing interventions, combined with diet and exercise instruction, psychological care, and health education are of great significance to the progression and treatment of NAFLD. Such early intervention in the simple fatty liver disease stage is essential to prevent its further development into fatty liver hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. However, most patients and some clinicians do not have sufficient awareness of the dangers of the disease.

Epidemiological surveys have shown that NAFLD patients have very low compliance with almost all types of physical activities recommended by the guidelines. Therefore, it is difficult to promote and maintain patients' behavior changes. The Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change was proposed by the American psychologist Prochaska. It focuses on the subject's psychological needs and the process of behavior change, and believes that behavior change is a phased, spiral, and gradual development process. Individualized interventions are given according to the patient's behavior transition stage to ensure that the patient's self-management ability is spirally increased and maintained. A transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification plan awakens the patient's consciousness in the pre-intention stage, enables the patient to have a clear understanding of their own disease, thereby generating emotions for positive changes. The core of its behavioral intervention is the change of philosophy, which is consistent with the processes of "concept-behavior" and "passive-active", thereby enhancing patients' health beliefs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of management on a lifestyle modification plan for patients with simple fatty liver disease based on the transtheoretical model promoted behavior change and related physiological and biochemical indicators during 12 months follow-up.

### Revising the preventive paradox: the Swiss case [^112t1yPW]. Addiction (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine Kreitman's preventive paradox of alcohol consumption and its revisions by Stockwell and colleagues and by Skog, with regard to alcohol-related social harm in Switzerland, and to shed light on the reporting of alcohol-related social harm in the low-volume drinking, non-binging subpopulation. The paper compares occurrence and severity of social harm in four subgroups defined by average consumption (volume) and binge drinking. Stage-of-change membership was used to further distinguish low-risk drinkers who might have changed their drinking patterns from those who had not.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Telephone interviews were conducted with 1256 current drinkers of a probabilistic two-stage sample of the general population of Switzerland. Moderate and hazardous mean consumption (volume) was defined by means of a quantity-frequency instrument. Daily average consumption of 20 g was set as the cut-off point for women, and 30 g for men. Binge drinking was defined as taking four or more drinks on an occasion for women, and five or more for men. Structural equation modelling was used to construct a severity scale of six alcohol-related consequences: work problems, accidents and problems with the police, with friends, with a partner or with the family. Explanatory factor analysis was used to assign drinkers to motivational stages of change.

Findings

Moderate drinkers in terms of volume reported more problems than hazardous drinkers, which confirms Kreitman's view. Binge drinkers reported more problems than non-binge drinkers, confirming the view of Stockwell and colleagues. Binge drinkers were more numerous in the moderate drinking group, which constituted the majority of drinkers, in accordance with Skog's view. Binge drinkers in the moderate-volume and hazardous-volume drinking groups did not differ significantly as to either severity or number of problems. Approximately 40% of moderate-volume, non-binge drinkers who reported alcohol-related social harm had already changed their consumption pattern, which indicated that reported harm was related to an earlier drinking pattern.

Conclusions

As Skog has pointed out, the second-order preventive paradox of binge drinking reappeared, in that most binge drinkers were found to occur in the drinker group with low average consumption. Findings also indicate that, with respect to social harm, a preventive strategy aimed at the majority of the population, but on heavy-drinking occasions rather than on mean consumption, may be valuable.

### Revisiting preaddiction [^11124BhX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The directors of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism have proposed new efforts to enable earlier identification and intervention for harmful substance use and its consequences. As editors of The ASAM Principles of Addiction Medicine, we fully support this goal. The word "preaddiction" has been suggested as a diagnostic label to describe individuals who would be targeted for early intervention. In this commentary, we offer that "unhealthy substance use" would be a better descriptor than "preaddiction" and review several potential barriers to be addressed in order to maximize the impact of introducing this new paradigm.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115B94p7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — AUD treatment initiation and engagement (Recommendation IV.12) states that when feasible, alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment should be initiated concurrently with alcohol withdrawal management as cognitive status permits. Clinicians should offer to initiate pharmacotherapy for AUD as cognitive status permits, explain the range of evidence-based treatment services available in the community, and engage patients with these options, and may offer information about local recovery support groups, including 12-step groups. To the fullest extent possible, patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal management should be engaged, if not initiated, in treatment for AUD as soon as cognitive status permits, and this engagement should be considered part of the withdrawal management process and should not be delayed until withdrawal management is complete. Motivational interviewing or enhancement, delivered in primary care settings, has been demonstrated to reduce alcohol and other drug use and to help engage patients in AUD treatment. Regular follow-up visits at least monthly for a year in Level 1-WM settings may increase chances of continued recovery, although the Guideline Committee did not find strong evidence to support this statement.

### Theories related to changing clinician practice [^116AArvk]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article provides a theoretic exploration of the microprocesses of clinician practice change in the context of adopting and implementing evidence-based treatments. The two most important internal clinician or microlevel factors involved in behavior change are identified as motivation and ability. The authors focus on factors related to motivation and present their own theory of the cognitive-affective processes for motivation to change. In the discussion of their theory, the authors highlight leverage points for possible interventions. Finally, the authors show how their microlevel theory relates to other prominent, more macrolevel-oriented theories of clinician practice change.

### Applying an intersectional lens to alcohol inequities: a conceptual framework [^116k4bMD]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

An individual's sense of cultural, racial or ethnic pride can also influence alcohol consumption. A strong sense of pride may protect against discrimination and mood disorders, though its effects vary across social categories. For example, among Latino adolescents, increased ethnic pride has been shown to directly reduce alcohol consumption in girls but not boys. Further, for Asian and Black Americans, moderate identification with their racial/ethnic group has been shown to buffer the impact of discrimination on psychiatric disorders (including AUD), whereas for several other groups, high racial/ethnic identification intensifies this impact.

At the interpersonal level, power dynamics shape all relationships. For example, in healthcare, clinical interactions are inherently asymmetrical, with providers holding professional power and patients relying on them for care. Intersecting socio‐demographic factors linked to social positions (e.g. gender or race), further influence these power imbalances. For example, Black American women have reported unequal treatment when seeking substance use treatment and feeling 'silenced' by healthcare providers. Additionally, factors like healthcare literacy (healthcare domain, individual level), insurance coverage (healthcare domain, individual level) and comorbidities (biological domain, individual level) can further affect a patient's negotiating power, reflecting the relational nature of the IAIF.

Power dynamics within intimate relationships are also important, particularly in heterosexual relationships where traditional gender roles and structural inequalities position men as dominant. Harms from alcohol extend beyond the drinker, and there are clear gendered inequalities in who is affected by others' drinking. Although men consume more alcohol and engage in riskier drinking patterns, women often disproportionately experience harms, ranging from intimate partner violence (IPV) to negative impacts on family functioning, mental health, social isolation and economic well‐being. Male alcohol use is an established risk factor for IPV against women, while women's heavier drinking can increase their risk of victimization. Men's drinking further affects children, contributing to family violence and emotional neglect. In the USA, gender differences in alcohol's harm to others (AHTO) vary by the type of harm and the affected person's own drinking. While other socio‐demographic factors – such as age and ethnicity – also influence these second‐hand effects, intersectional inequities in AHTO remains understudied.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^115UwR28]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease patients have very low compliance with almost all types of physical activities. A transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification plan awakens the patient's consciousness in the pre-intention stage. Aim to evaluate whether a management by stages of change plan based on the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change promoted behavior change for patients with non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease.

Methods

Patients with simple fatty liver diagnosed from July to December 2019 were randomly divided into the transtheoretical model and non-transtheoretical model groups. Primary outcome was change in health belief and health behavior based on questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood lipids, body mass indexes, and waist circumference 12-months after intervention.

Results

Of 200 enrolled patients 194 were analyzed (non-transtheoretical model group n = 98, transtheoretical model group n = 96). After intervention, total health belief scores (120.91 ± 4.94 vs. 118.82 ± 5.48) and total health behavior scores (131.71 ± 5.87 vs. 119.96 ± 7.12) were higher in the transtheoretical model group (all P < 0.05). Blood lipids, body mass index, and waist circumference more obviously improved in the transtheoretical model group (all P < 0.05).

Conclusion

A transtheoretical model-based lifestyle modification intervention can be effectively applied to patients with non-alcoholic simple fatty liver.

### Motivation to reduce alcohol consumption and subsequent attempts at reduction and changes in consumption in increasing and higher-risk drinkers in england: a prospective population survey [^115oQJiL]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

We investigated the hypothesis that being motivated to reduce alcohol consumption at the initial survey was associated with actual attempts during the 6 months to follow‐up using logistic regression, and the hypothesis that initial motivation was associated with changes in consumption at follow‐up by a difference‐in‐differences (DID) model. The DID model was specified as a repeated‐measures ordinal regression with random‐intercepts to adjust the models for consumption at the initial survey and to account for repeated measurements of individuals (i.e. at initial survey and at 6‐month follow‐up). The DID interaction term between time and motivation defined the additional impact of being motivated to reduce consumption on consumption over and above the average population change over time.

Models were adjusted for interview wave, season of interview or follow‐up, sex, age, social position, life stage (single, pre‐family, family, post‐family), ethnic group, qualification and history of trying to reduce consumption at initial survey and/or had 'at least one serious attempt to cut down drinking in previous 6 months'. As a result of missing covariate data, 22 observations were removed in the multivariable models. Results are reported as parameter estimates or odds ratios (OR), 95% profile likelihood confidence intervals (CI) and P ‐values (where 0.05 is regarded as the threshold for statistical significance), while in addition approximate Bayes factors h 1 versus h 0 (BF 10) were calculated based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values following the methodology in Wagenmakers 15. Relative effects were estimated using least squares mean contrasts of the mean AUDIT‐C score for the DID effect = 0 versus 1, relative to the AUDIT‐C score at DID = 0 at follow‐up.

### Alcohol consumption, hypertension, and cardiovascular health across the life course: there is No such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach [^112Rq3eK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

It is important to remember that people consume alcohol for pleasure and most do so responsibly. The majority of researchers do not actively advocate that people stop drinking but merely seek to emphasize that reductions in consumption can reduce one's overall risk of prematurely developing disease and/or dying. However, this subtle point can occasionally be lost in translation when findings from studies are communicated to the public via the media (sometimes without the involvement of the researchers themselves in this process). As such, public health professionals can quickly be branded as enemies of the people 17 for being perceived as trying to push a temperance agenda upon people who are perfectly content with their current level of consumption. Nevertheless, it is clear that a substantial proportion of the population are not fully aware of the risks associated with (even minimal) alcohol consumption, 18 and there is evidence that those who believe alcohol confers cardioprotective effects tend to drink more on average than those who do not. 19 As such, it is important that the evidence base for alcohol consumption and health continues to be debated in public (including the strengths, limitations, sources of bias, and degree of uncertainty of the collective pool of knowledge). But perhaps rather than messages simply re‐stating that drinking alcohol (or not drinking as it may be) is associated with an increased risk of disorder X, that can sometimes be perceived as condescending (and may lead to people disengaging), 20 they might instead be packaged in a way that is easily interpretable and/or tailored to an individual, such as absolute differences in risk for someone of their age with otherwise similar characteristics.

It is also important to remember that health is dynamic and there is no such thing as a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to managing risk. An individual's decision to drink, and at what level, should be motivated by their own personal circumstances. 3 Population‐level initiatives, such as recommended drinking limits, can only go so far, after which individual‐level approaches are needed. Therefore, it is vital that an open and honest dialogue about alcohol consumption be initiated and maintained. 18 What level of alcohol consumption might be considered acceptable for 1 individual may not be for another; equally, an individual might wish to consider changing their drinking habits if their situation changes. Ultimately, our job boils down to empowering an individual to make an informed decision about their level of alcohol intake and how this may influence their long‐ and short‐term health through transparent communication.

### Stage of change and motivation to healthier lifestyle in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115mN7ku]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Backgrounds & Aims

Healthy diet and physical activity are the treatment cornerstones of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); their effectiveness is however limited by difficulties in implementing lifestyle changes. We aimed at determining the stage of change and associated psychological factors as a prerequisite to refine strategies to implement behavior changes.

Methods

We studied 138 consecutive NAFLD patients (73% male, age 19–73 years). The diagnosis was confirmed by liver biopsy in 64 cases (steatohepatitis, 47%). All cases completed the validated EMME-3 questionnaire, consisting of two parallel sets of instruments (for diet and physical activity, respectively) and providing stages of change according to transtheoretical model. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with stages making behavioral changes more demanding.

Results

The individual profiles were variable; for diet, no cases had precontemplation as prevalent stage of change (highest score in individual profiles); 36% had contemplation. For physical activity, 50% were classified in either precontemplation or contemplation. Minor differences were recorded in relation to associated metabolic complications or steatohepatitis. Logistic regression identified male sex (odds ratio, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.69–12.08) and age (1.70; 1.20–2.43 per decade) as the independent parameters predicting precontemplation or contemplation for diet. No predictors were identified for physical activity.

Conclusions

NAFLD cases have scarce readiness to lifestyle changes, particularly with regard to physical activity. Defining stages of change and motivation offers the opportunity to improve clinical care of NAFLD people through individual programs exploiting the powerful potential of behavioral counseling, an issue to be tested in longitudinal studies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^117VU6eH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to assess the quantity, frequency, and last consumption time of alcohol in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of alcohol withdrawal to determine whether they are experiencing or at risk for developing alcohol withdrawal. Consider using a scale to screen for unhealthy alcohol use (such as the AUDIT-Piccinelli Consumption), acquiring information from collateral sources (such as family and friends), and obtain a laboratory test providing some measure of hepatic function for this assessment.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^114qET3X]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Need for guidelines is described as providing psychologists guidance on roles, patient populations, or practice settings based on current research and professional consensus, differing from clinical practice guidelines that make treatment recommendations based primarily on systematic reviews of efficacy. The current professional practice guidelines were developed recognizing that clinical practice guidelines emphasize research, particularly treatment efficacy, with relatively little guidance regarding clinical expertise or patient characteristics, culture, and preferences; thus, there is a need to discuss both of these factors in evidence-based psychological practice in health care. A foundational approach is outlined in which treatment extends beyond any particular theory, orientation, method, set of techniques, diagnosis, or health condition, and typical intervention elements include conducting a psychological assessment, developing a treatment plan, cultivating and maintaining an effective therapeutic relationship, tailoring services to patient characteristics, culture, and preferences, assessing progress and outcomes over time, and modifying the clinical approach when it does not produce the desired outcomes.

### Alcoholics anonymous attendance, decreases in impulsivity and drinking and psychosocial outcomes over 16 years: moderated-mediation from a developmental perspective [^111vPaZq]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine whether decreases in impulsivity account for links between Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance and better drinking and psychosocial outcomes, and whether these mediational 'effects' are conditional on age.

Design

A naturalistic study in which individuals were assessed at baseline, and 1, 8 and 16 years later.

Setting

Participants initiated help-seeking through the alcohol intervention system (detoxification programs, information and referral centers).

Participants

Individuals with alcohol use disorders and no prior history of substance abuse treatment at baseline [n = 628; 47% women; mean age = 34.7 years (standard deviation = 9.4)].

Measurements

Self-reports of impulsivity and drinking pattern at baseline and year 1, duration of AA (number of weeks) in year 1 and drinking (alcohol use problems, self-efficacy to resist drinking) and psychosocial outcomes (emotional discharge coping, social support) at baseline and follow-ups.

Findings

Controlling for changes in drinking pattern, decreases in impulsivity were associated with fewer alcohol use problems, better coping and greater social support and self-efficacy at year 1, and better coping and greater social support at year 8. Decreases in impulsivity statistically mediated associations between longer AA duration and improvements on all year 1 outcomes and indirect effects were moderated by participant age (significant only for individuals 25 years of age or younger).

Conclusions

Decreased impulsivity appears to mediate reductions in alcohol-related problems over 8 years in people attending Alcoholics Anonymous.

### Systematic review of symptom-level networks of alcohol use disorder [^112L9RYN]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of established AUD symptom networks

Although still evolving, the established AUD symptom network studies present several promising avenues for research and treatment. The first notable contribution of this work lies in elucidating the relative importance of different symptoms. In our review, Larger/Longer and Physical/Psychological Problems emerged as central nodes across studies, underscoring their potential as focal points in clinical intervention. Yet, it is important to note that interpreting centrality metrics is increasingly recognized as a complex task.

Another contribution of the current work is the comparison between population and clinical samples. By examining similarities and differences among these groups, and within subpopulations (e.g.), researchers and clinicians can gain insights into common and unique AUD mechanisms. Differences in networks might suggest pre‐clinical symptoms or vulnerabilities for AUD, or they may reveal distinct states of health and disorder. However, it is crucial to consider that these group differences might also stem from methodological issues, such as biases in sample selection and the approach to measuring symptoms (e.g. via self‐report or clinical interview). For example, a professional diagnosis is thought to offer a more reliable assessment of the clinically significant challenges faced by individuals with addiction compared with self‐reported questionnaires, which can sometimes be influenced by varying levels of self‐awareness or shame to endorse problems with drinking. Lastly, the first steps have been made in describing AUD symptom dynamics, including its onset and maintenance. This aspect, mentioned in several of the reviewed articles, becomes particularly salient in studies like those of Conlin et al. which uniquely considered temporal factors. More work is needed to learn how AUD symptoms change over time.

### 'Ageing with an alcohol problem is not what I envision': reclaiming agency in shaping personal ageing trajectory and recovery from alcohol problems [^116SDxbb]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants often avoided seeking treatment because they feared they would be instructed to abstain from alcohol, an outcome which did not match their wish of reducing their drinking. Many had attempted to reduce their drinking level but found it difficult to change. When explaining their unsuccessful effort and worsening of the situation, participants used phrases such as ' feeling powerless', 'being stuck in a situation that I don't want to identify with', 'never thought I would fall this deep', and 'not feeling the effect of alcohol as before despite drinking more'. Participants did not like that they increasingly ' sought comfort in a bottle '.

Once alcohol became a problem which could not be easily resolved, participants experienced shame and guilt. They avoided disclosing the problem to their close ones because they were afraid of facing stigma and losing their social network. A participant said: '… the closer you are the more judgmental you are…, I've chosen not to talk about it [drinking] with my closest ones… ' (P7). Alcohol problems were not visible in other contexts such as workplace because participants drank more at home or outside the work hours and because they often fulfilled their responsibilities. They were able to control their drinking level when socializing with colleagues and friends. Participants managed their relationships by drinking less when with their family and friends. Once family members noticed the problem, they expressed their disapproval which increased feelings of shame and hesitancy to seek help as '… I noticed that it is not good if my spouse goes and points the finger every time [my spouse] thinks I drink too much. Because in some way it even becomes counterproductive… that it's okay to drink as long as [my spouse] doesn't see, or notice… ' (P9). Other participants stated that it took them too long to admit to family members that they had an alcohol problem and when they did, their family reacted with grief and anger. A participant elaborated, '… shame and guilt made me not seek help earlier… after many years, I laid my cards open and told my children that I had an alcohol problem… They cried… they could not accept their [parent] had such problem… I experienced they felt contempt for me… the image they had about me was gone… ' (P5). In summary, participants initially viewed alcohol as integral to social life and enjoyment, but gradually experienced the negative consequences of heavy drinking.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use to identify recent alcohol use, especially in patients unable to communicate or provide an alcohol use history, taking into account the range of time (window of detection) in which the test can detect alcohol use. Do not dismiss the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the test result is negative.

### Stage-based interventions for smoking cessation [^111PfJWE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The transtheoretical model is the most widely known of several stage-based theories of behaviour. It proposes that smokers move through a discrete series of motivational stages before they quit successfully. These are precontemplation (no thoughts of quitting), contemplation (thinking about quitting), preparation (planning to quit in the next 30 days), action (quitting successfully for up to six months), and maintenance (no smoking for more than six months). According to this influential model, interventions which help people to stop smoking should be tailored to their stage of readiness to quit, and are designed to move them forward through subsequent stages to eventual success. People in the preparation and action stages of quitting would require different types of support from those in precontemplation or contemplation.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to test the effectiveness of stage-based interventions in helping smokers to quit.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('stage* of change', 'transtheoretical model', 'trans-theoretical model*, 'precaution adoption model', 'health action model', 'processes of change questionnaire', 'readiness to change', 'tailor') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. The latest search was in August 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials, which compared stage-based interventions with non-stage-based controls, with 'usual care' or with assessment only. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment, and those which measured stage of change but did not modify their intervention in the light of it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the dose and duration of intervention, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome was abstinence from smoking for at least six months. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to estimate a pooled risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found 41 trials (> 33,000 participants) which met our inclusion criteria. Four trials, which directly compared the same intervention in stage-based and standard versions, found no clear advantage for the staging component. Stage-based versus standard self-help materials (two trials) gave a relative risk (RR) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.39). Stage-based versus standard counselling (two trials) gave a relative risk of 1.00 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.22). Six trials of stage-based self-help systems versus any standard self-help support demonstrated a benefit for the staged groups, with an RR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.59). Twelve trials comparing stage-based self help with 'usual care' or assessment-only gave an RR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). Thirteen trials of stage-based individual counselling versus any control condition gave an RR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.42). These findings are consistent with the proven effectiveness of these interventions in their non-stage-based versions. The evidence was unclear for telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes or training of doctors or lay supporters. This uncertainty may be due in part to smaller numbers of trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on four trials using direct comparisons, stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents. Thirty-one trials of stage-based self help or counselling interventions versus any control condition demonstrated levels of effectiveness which were comparable with their non-stage-based counterparts. Providing these forms of practical support to those trying to quit appears to be more productive than not intervening. However, the additional value of adapting the intervention to the smoker's stage of change is uncertain. The evidence is not clear for other types of staged intervention, including telephone counselling, interactive computer programmes and training of physicians or lay supporters. The evidence does not support the restriction of quitting advice and encouragement only to those smokers perceived to be in the preparation and action stages.

### Lifestyle changes after cancer treatment in patients and their partners: a qualitative study [^112Leq9t]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on increasing awareness of cancer-treatment-related toxicity and a general growing insight into healthy behaviors, specific nutrition and physical activity guidelines for patients with cancer have been developed. These guidelines advise achieving and maintaining a healthy weight by eating unprocessed foods that are high in fiber, not drinking alcohol (or at least limiting it to one drink per day), and being physically active for at least 150 min per week. Oncologists acknowledge the need to advise their patients on a healthy lifestyle, but do not necessarily follow up on this need, and sometimes do not know how to provide adequate advice. They experience certain barriers to providing lifestyle guidance, such as lack of time, lack of guidelines, or hesitations due to fearing loss of connection with their patients by bringing up health behaviors. However, the vast majority of both patients with cancer and the people in their social network see advice on diet, weight, and physical activity as beneficial. They also see their doctor as the right person to provide this, and only a few feel that this advice would be insensitive or blame the patient. Patients themselves also reported that they knew about the benefits of a healthy diet and were motivated to know more, but that they did not receive professional advice about this.

Previous studies on cancer survivors have reported that, even though they are at a higher risk for long-term health consequences, rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are similar to the general population. In young adult patients with cancer, worse health behaviors were also reported, as women tended to smoke more often than their peers, and men ate less fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, a cancer diagnosis in itself is not enough to motivate durable beneficial health behavior change in cancer survivors. In order to actually instigate lifestyle changes, cancer patients need an environment that is supportive. Social support, in particular support from their spouse or partner, may have an important impact on the motivation and ability of the patient with cancer to change his or her lifestyle. For example, attempts to increase exercise or stop smoking may be more successful and durable if a partner is supportive or shows the same behavior. After prostate cancer, an involved and supportive partner can increase adherence to a pelvic floor exercise program. Furthermore, cancer patients' and partners' health behavior was found to be highly comparable with respect to physical activity, and eating fruit and vegetables. When patients and partners were more equal in their health behaviors, they were also more satisfied with the relationship and experienced their partner as being more supportive.

### The stages of change questionnaire as a predictor of trauma patients most likely to decrease alcohol use [^111GYUWG]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Research has shown that negative trauma-related consequences of drinking can predict readiness to change drinking behavior. These findings are confined to patients with positive blood alcohol levels at admission. The current study extends such findings by examining whether stage of readiness to change among all adult trauma activations admitted to the emergency department for 24 hours or more can be used to predict a change in behavior at followup.

Study Design

Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to a Level II trauma center between December 1, 2001, and January 31, 2003, with a trauma activation were eligible to participate. Enrolled patients were screened for alcohol use and readiness to change with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Short Form Stages of Change (SFSC), respectively, within 2 days of discharge. Blood alcohol level (BAL) was obtained for all study patients. Six to 18 months after discharge, patients were followed up with the AUDIT. The ability of the SFSC to predict change in alcohol behavior at followup was analyzed by multiple regression.

Results

Of 253 eligible patients, 146 patients were enrolled and had BAL taken. Most were men (64%) and 36% were women. Mean positive BAL (n = 57) was 186 mg/dL (range 10 to 537 mg/dL). Of these, 23% (13 of 57) met AUDIT criteria for harmful drinking and 47% (27 of 57) met criteria for dependent drinking. Even among those with undetectable BAL (n = 89), harmful or dependent drinking was identified by the AUDIT for 11% (10 of 89). A readiness to change was common among those reporting harmful or dependent drinking (26%) at baseline. The SFSC independently and significantly predicted change in drinking behavior among the 72 patients with followup (p = 0.05). Patients indicating greater readiness to change at baseline were those more likely to decrease their consumption pattern at followup.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that administering the brief SFSC questionnaire to all trauma patients and providing assistance to those demonstrating a willingness to change may prove to be an effective strategy for reducing problem alcohol use.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^114298gr]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Addiction definition — Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry, reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors; addiction is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response, and without treatment or engagement in recovery activities addiction is progressive and can result in disability or premature death.

### Motivational factors and negative affectivity as predictors of alcohol craving [^116BtPij]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Craving is thought to play an important role in alcohol use disorders. The recent inclusion of "craving" as a formal diagnostic symptom calls for further investigation of this subjective phenomenon with multiple dimensions. Considering that alcohol-dependent patients compensate negative physical/emotional states with alcohol, the aim of this study is to investigate alcohol craving and its correlation with drinking measures and affective personality dimensions. A sample of 135 alcohol-dependent patients (104 males and 31 females) was collected from a clinical setting. Subjects self-rated their cravings (Penn Alcohol Craving Scale) and the stage of change. Several personality scales were also administered. Craving was related to drinking status, abstinence time, age, and taking steps. After controlling for these conditions, psychological characteristics related to low self-concept, neuroticism, cyclothymic affective temperament, depression, and hostility were found to be predictors of craving in sober alcohol-dependent patients. Our results support craving as a component of the phenomenology of alcohol dependence and highlight the presence of unpleasant feelings as predictors of craving in sober alcohol-dependent patients without co-occurring psychiatric conditions. The predisposition to experience negative emotions may induce a stronger craving response and increase the likelihood of a first drink and a subsequent loss of control.

### A 42-year-old man considering whether to drink alcohol for his health [^111vreM5]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol consumption is widespread and, in excess, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, a consistent body of observational evidence has found that individuals who consume alcohol within recommended limits have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than do abstainers. These observations have led many to consider small amounts of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy. Mr Q, a 42-year-old man who has consistently sought ways to preserve his health, is at a crossroads in his discussions with his physicians about the health effects of his regular, limited alcohol intake. The discussion reviews the epidemiology of drinking in the United States, the established effects of moderate alcohol intake on key pathophysiological biomarkers and pathways, the strengths and limitations of observational evidence linking alcohol intake to lower risk of coronary heart disease, other chronic diseases linked to moderate alcohol intake, and a framework in which Mr Q can discuss the potential risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with his physicians.

### Brief alcohol intervention – where to from here? Challenges remain for research and practice [^1154dnvR]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Brief intervention (BI) is intended as an early intervention for non-treatment-seeking, non-alcohol-dependent, hazardous and harmful drinkers. This text provides a brief summary of key BI research findings from the last three decades and discusses a number of knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Five areas are described: patient intervention efficacy and effectiveness; barriers to BI implementation by health professionals; individual-level factors that impact on BI implementation; organization-level factors that impact on BI implementation; and society-level factors that impact on BI implementation. BI research has focused largely upon the individual patient and health professional levels, with the main focus upon primary health care research, and studies are lacking in other settings. However, research must, to a larger degree, take into account the organizational and wider context in which BI occurs, as well as interaction between factors at different levels, in order to advance the understanding of how wider implementation of BI can be achieved in various settings and how different population groups can be reached. It is also important to expand BI research beyond its current parameters to investigate more ambitious long-term educational programmes and new organizational models. More widespread implementation of BI will require many different interventions (efforts, actions, initiatives, etc.) at different interlinked levels, from implementation interventions targeting individual health professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours concerning alcohol issues, BI and behaviour change counselling to efforts at the organizational and societal levels that influence the conditions for delivering BI as part of routine health care.

### Diabetes… [^114MkDWX]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. The most common treatment for type 1 is insulin replacement therapy, while anti-diabetic medications and lifestyle modifications can be used to manage type
2. Hypoglycemia is a recognized complication of insulin treatment used in diabetes. An acute presentation can include mild symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and palpitations, to more serious effects including impaired cognition, confusion, seizures, coma, and rarely death. Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes may lower the glycemic threshold at which symptoms occur, meaning mild symptoms may not appear before cognitive deterioration begins to occur. Hearing loss is another long-term complication associated with diabetes. Based on extensive data and numerous cases of gallstone disease, it appears that a causal link might exist between type 2 diabetes and gallstones.

People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing gallstones compared to those without diabetes. There is a link between cognitive deficit and diabetes; studies have shown that diabetic individuals are at a greater risk of cognitive decline, and have a greater rate of decline compared to those without the disease. Diabetes increases the risk of dementia, and the earlier that one is diagnosed with diabetes, the higher the risk becomes. The condition also predisposes to falls in the elderly, especially those treated with insulin. Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood. Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults is the diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults; it has a slower onset than the same condition in children. Given this difference, some use the unofficial term "type 1. 5 diabetes" for this condition.

Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, based on age rather than a cause. LADA leaves adults with higher levels of insulin production than type 1 diabetes, but not enough insulin production for healthy blood sugar levels. Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes. The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the liver's glucose production. Adverse childhood experiences, including abuse, neglect, and household difficulties, increase the likelihood of type 2 diabetes later in life by 32%, with neglect having the strongest effect. Antipsychotic medication, SSRI, and SNRI side effects are also potential risk factors.

Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes. Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes. Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase insulin resistance. Unofficial Insulin resistance in the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease has been termed by some researchers as Type 3 diabetes, though this label is also rejected by some to avoid confusion with other types classified as Type 3. "Type 4 diabetes" has been used to describe age-related insulin resistance in lean mice. Neither of these terms are commonly used in human health care.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^116H6ytY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient's behavioral transition stage was assessed in combination with the different performances at each stage of the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change. A behavioral change assessment questionnaire was used for evaluation, which was developed by the Cancer Prevention and Research Center of the United States and translated into Chinese by Guo Zhiping et al. In order to ensure the uniformity of the survey of the two groups of patients' scales, the instructions, guiding terms, and evaluation methods were filled in uniformly before the survey. The investigators distributed them to the patients on the spot and explained them one by one. The patients filled them out and returned them directly. If the patients could not fill them out, the investigators consulted the patients, and their relatives filled them out, and checked them back with the patients for confirmation. The content of the questionnaire was "Please tell us your actual status truthfully according to the options". Before starting the intervention, the definition of each stage was explained to the patient. The investigator evaluated it accordingly and divided the patient into the pre-intent stage group, the intention stage group, the preparation stage group, the action stage group, and the maintaining stage group according to the behavior change stage they are in. During the first 6 months of the study, the evaluation was conducted once every month, and once every 2 months for the next 6 months. Patients were graded as good behavioral changes if transformation of thought and behavior met the criteria for entering the next stage; medium behavioral change if after the intervention, thought and behavior changed only a little and stay at the original stage; and bad behavioral changes if the patient's behavior regressed instead of being paid attention to. For patients with good behavioral changes, encouragement and affirmation were given, and they proceeded to the next stage in order. For patients who had remained in a stage over two evaluations, the reasons for not progressing were analyzed and interventions were performed again until the patient reached the maintaining stage. Evaluation and grouping ran throughout the entire research stage.

### Perspectives in implementing a primary care-based intervention to reduce alcohol misuse [^117BTz7M]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening followed by brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. Our study, Options Regarding Consumption of Alcohol (ORCA), was one of the studies included in an evidence review that comprised 23 RCTs. ORCA was designed to test whether a primary care-based intervention would reduce alcohol misuse among patients who screened positive for risky or hazardous drinking. Data collection occurred between 1995 and 1999; data analysis was conducted in 2000–2002. Study design and implementation built from a behavioral counseling research paradigm with four components: (1) population-based screening; (2) centralized delivery of intervention components; (3) involvement of primary care practitioners to motivate and reinforce behavior change; and (4) personalization of intervention components. In this paper, we assess the study features using the Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary Model domains. As a randomized trial, the study included some explanatory features (e.g., standardized follow-up surveys administered by study personnel); however, several aspects of the study were highly pragmatic. Practicable recruitment and training of providers, embedding population-based screening in pre-visit surveys, and keeping the delivery of the primary care intervention components consistent with the tempo and competing priorities of practice are three key features that contributed to the study's success and relevance to the USPSTF.

### Does readiness to change predict in-session motivational language? Correspondence between two conceptualizations of client motivation [^113ukn6v]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Client language reflecting motivation for changing substance use (i.e. change talk) has been shown to predict outcomes in motivational interviewing. While previous work has shown that change talk may be elicited by clinician behaviors, little is known about intrapersonal factors that may elicit change talk, including clients' baseline motivation for change. The present study tested whether in-session change talk differs between clients based on their readiness for change.

Design and Setting

First-session audio recordings from Project MATCH, a large multi-site clinical trial of alcohol treatments.

Participants

Project MATCH out-patients (n = 69) and aftercare patients (n = 48) receiving motivational enhancement therapy (MET).

Measurements

Client language from first-session MET was coded using the Sequential Code for Observing Process Exchanges. Readiness and stages of change were assessed using both categorical and dimensional variables derived from the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment and the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale, administered prior to first treatment sessions.

Findings

Stage of change scales followed some of the expected correspondence with change talk, although the associations were generally small in magnitude and inconsistent across measures and treatment arms. Higher overall readiness did not predict more overall change talk, contemplation had mixed associations with preparatory change talk, and preparation/action did not predict commitment language.

Conclusions

Motivational language used in initial sessions by people receiving counselling for excessive alcohol consumption does not appear to be associated with readiness to change as construed by the Transtheoretical Model.

### Women's views on moderate and low alcohol consumption: stages of the subjective transition from pregnancy to postpartum [^112Hqt8M]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption during pregnancy and breastfeeding is associated with a risk for the child's healthy development. Nevertheless, about 16 to 25% of all women in the European region, including Switzerland, consume alcohol during pregnancy and probably even more during breastfeeding. Little is known about how women perceive this risk and how risk perception changes during the transition to motherhood. The present study aims to explore the subjective transition from the woman's perspective, focusing on perceptions of alcohol as a risk, changes in alcohol consumption in daily life and experienced support from health professionals in this period.

Methods

The longitudinal qualitative, semi-structured interview study was jointly designed and conducted by health sociologists and midwifery researchers. Using the theoretical framework of sociocultural risk and life course transition, we interviewed 46 women from the French and German speaking part of Switzerland during pregnancy and until six months after birth.

Results

In our study, we found that pregnant and breastfeeding women perceive alcohol consumption as a risk to the health of the child. Abstinence is sought especially during pregnancy, but this does not preclude occasional and low-level consumption according to some women. Alcohol consumption and risk perception change during the transition to motherhood. We identified five stages that characterise this transition in terms of alcohol consumption and risk perception. From the women's perspective, there was a lack of counselling from health professionals, and the women expressed a desire for respectful and more individualised counselling.

Conclusion

Many women express a need for guidance and counselling by health care professionals at some stages of the transition to motherhood. The stages identified can be used as pointers to address the subject of alcohol consumption in professional practice. The stage around conception and early pregnancy should be taken more into account, as women experience themselves as particularly vulnerable during this time. Low-threshold counselling services should be therefore offered to women before or in the stage around conception and be continued until the end of the breastfeeding period.

### Metformin… [^1134DNQP]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Metformin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. It has a small risk of causing low blood sugar. High blood lactic acid level is a concern if the medication is used in overly large doses or prescribed in people with severe kidney problems. Metformin is a biguanide anti-hyperglycemic agent. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues, and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake. Efficacy Treatment guidelines for major professional associations, including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the European Society for Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association, describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal.

A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke when comparing metformin monotherapy to other glucose-lowering drugs, behavior change interventions, placebo or no intervention. In individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo. However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone.

The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes. Weight change Metformin use is typically associated with weight loss. It appears to be safe and effective in counteracting the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable. Use with insulin Metformin may reduce the insulin requirement in type 1 diabetes, albeit with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Contraindications Metformin is contraindicated in people with:

- Severe renal impairment below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)
- Known hypersensitivity to metformin
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects than most other antidiabetic medications. The most serious potential adverse effect of metformin is lactic acidosis; this complication is rare, and seems to be related to impaired liver or kidney function. Metformin is not approved for use in those with severe kidney disease, but may still be used at lower doses in those with kidney problems. Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1. 0 to 1.

### Motivation as a predictor of drinking outcomes after residential treatment programs for alcohol dependence [^115VDp5P]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients' motivation to change their substance use is usually viewed as a crucial component of successful treatment. The objective of this study was to examine whether motivation contributes to drinking outcomes after residential treatment for alcohol dependence.

Methods

Our sample included 415 Swiss patients from 12 residential alcohol treatment programs. We statistically controlled for important predictors, such as sex, employment, alcohol consumption before admission, severity of alcohol dependence, severity of psychiatric symptoms at admission, and alcohol-related self-efficacy at discharge. Abstinence, alcohol consumption, and time to first drink were used as primary outcome measures and were assessed 1 year after discharge from treatment.

Results

Action-oriented motivation to change substance use had a modest impact on drinking outcomes. At the 1-year follow-up, only the Taking Steps subscale of the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale and alcohol-related self-efficacy were found to be significant predictors of abstinence and the number of standard drinks.

Conclusions

The impact of action-oriented motivation at admission to residential treatment is modest but still relevant, compared with other outcome predictors. It may be useful to focus treatment on improving action-oriented motivation to reduce substance use.

### The clients' perspective on change during treatment for an alcohol problem: qualitative analysis of follow-up interviews in the UK alcohol treatment trial [^111Ha8x2]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To develop a model of change during and following professional treatment for drinking problems, grounded in clients' accounts.

Participants

Subsets of consecutively selected clients of the UK Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT), followed-up at 3 months (n = 211) and 12 months (n = 198) after randomization. Location Five statutory and non-statutory alcohol problems treatment agencies in three areas of England and Wales. Data Open-ended interviews conducted according to a brief interview guide, leading to 400–800-word post-interview reports used for analysis (tape-recordings used for auditing purposes).

Analysis

Reports analysed by a team according to grounded theory principles, involving an iterative process with successive refinement of interviewing and analysis with each successive batch of data.

Findings

A model of change from the clients' perspective was developed. Treatment was seen by clients as facilitating various changes in ways of thinking and/or increased support of various kinds from family and friends, along with new ways of acting in relation to drinking or more generally. For many those changes had led to an appreciation of the benefits accruing to them. Treatment was seen as part of a broader treatment system which included pretreatment assessment, forms of help additional to the trial treatment, plus an element of self-directed change during and following treatment. Taken with awareness of worsening alcohol-related harms, triggering events and external influence to seek treatment (the catalyst system), to which clients continued to refer following treatment, the change process is depicted as a complex, ongoing set of systems in which a trial treatment is embedded.

Conclusions

Models of change should be broadened so that treatment is seen as a complex system of parts, facilitating a nexus of cognitive, social and behavioural changes, embedded within a broader system of events and processes catalysing change. Such a model helps explain the relative absence of between-treatments outcome differences in UKATT and in the alcohol problems treatment and more general psychotherapy research literatures.

### Assessing' stage of change' in current and former smokers [^111Wc4Kk]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

The concept of 'stage of change' is widely used by researchers and clinicians in the field of smoking cessation. Our aim was to assess the validity of three staging questionnaires and of the concept of 'stage of change' itself.

Setting and Participants

Survey on the Internet in 1025 ever smokers, retest after 8 days in 318 people (31%), follow-up after 32 days in 451 people (44%).

Measurements

Three measures of 'stage of change'.

Findings

Participants (83–93%) were classified in the same stage by all pairs of questionnaires, and 15% changed stage during an interval of 8 days. Including quit attempts in the 'preparation' stage had a large impact on stage distributions, because 18–24% of smokers who had decided to quit in the next 30 days were downgraded to the 'contemplation' stage as they had not made a quit attempt in the previous year. The 'action' stage included 5–7% of occasional smokers. Quit attempts during the past 7 days and 30 days were better predictors of smoking cessation than quit attempts during the past 12 months. Baseline stage and a continuous measure of intention predicted smoking abstinence at follow-up.

Conclusions

These results reflect theoretical and methodological problems with the concept of stage of change. 'Stage' covers four different variables: current behaviour, quit attempts, intention to change and time since quitting. These variables are combined in a somewhat haphazard manner, none of them is measured comprehensively, and intention and time are continuous variables categorized by arbitrary cutpoints. Measuring each of these four variables independently may be preferable to using an incomplete mix of these elements.

### A systematic review of volitional personality change research [^114pLdwV]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Personality traits could be actionable targets for public interventions because they have been theorized to impact health, well-being, and relationships and many people are intrinsically motivated to change aspects of their personality. However, the mere desire to change one's personality seems to be only weakly related to actual trait changes, with associations differing across studies and traits. Thus, interventions may be needed to successfully promote VPC. We found promising evidence for the efficacy VPC interventions, with an average effect of d = 0.22 for desired personality trait change. These changes appeared to last over up to 12 months and could be detected in both self- and other-reports of personality. However, there still is little evidence for the specific change mechanisms and moderators, leaving it open what constitutes or may affect a successful VPC intervention.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111NFt91]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider acquiring additional information about risk factors by interviewing family, friends, and caregivers about the patient's history of alcohol withdrawal, seizures, and delirium, as appropriate. Obtain written or verbal consent from the patient in non-emergent situations before speaking with or consulting collateral sources.

### The stability of baseline-defined categories of alcohol consumption during the adult life-course: a 28-year prospective cohort study [^114r9GiV]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Such papers illustrate how the direction and timing of longitudinal changes to drinking behaviour throughout the adult life‐course may represent important modifiers of disease risk that are largely overlooked by contemporary research. Although the number and frequency of repeated measures reported by existing studies are variable, and no study is yet to capture drinking behaviours throughout the whole adult life‐course 7, 33, the use of repeated measures is important if differences in risk between heterogeneous consumption trajectories are to be understood more clearly and sensitive periods identified during which particular alcohol consumption behaviours may be most harmful, aiding the targeting of alcohol reduction interventions 34. To date, however, there is no consistent approach to handling such data, with some opting to restrict analyses to participant whose consumption was stable within pre‐defined limits 35, or else categorizing participants according to whether their drinking increased, decreased or remained stable over a given period of time 13. In addition, there is no clear agreement concerning the appropriate means of classifying drinkers who cease consumption prior to baseline measurement. A number of proposals have been put forward, including an intention‐to‐treat approach, which assigns former drinkers with a current drinking value predicted to be most representative of their prior consumption 36, or the use of a retrospective life grid as a means of soliciting participants to estimate their past consumption 37. Although the best approach for dealing with both issues will differ to some extent according to the aim of the study and the data available, the incorporation and treatment of longitudinal data for the analysis of alcohol‐related risks represents an important area for future debate.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^1157oCet]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 5 — Psychologists aim to cultivate and maintain effective therapeutic relationships, therapist characteristics, and change principles, noting that psychological treatment is provided in the context of a collaborative professional relationship and that the quality of the therapeutic relationship is associated with treatment outcome. Nonspecific "common factors" — including the therapeutic relationship, therapist skills and traits, change principles, and patient characteristics — affect treatment outcome independent of specific techniques, are shared between different therapeutic orientations, and likely account for as much, if not more, outcome variance as the technique itself. The therapeutic relationship powerfully predicts patient outcomes across treatment modalities, therapeutic orientations, treatment delivery mechanisms, and patient age groups, and is characterized by several interrelated facets including empathy, congruence, goal consensus and collaboration, and rupture repairs. Psychologists are mindful that this is not a question of therapeutic relationship OR technique, but relationship AND technique, and applying specific evidence-based techniques in the context of the therapeutic relationship appears to produce incremental benefits for the patient beyond the positive change attributed to "nonspecific factors" such as the therapeutic relationship. Empathy has been conceptualized both as an intrapersonal therapist trait and an interpersonal and interactional relationship quality, with three functional components of empathy — automatic affective sharing, self-other awareness, and conscious perspective-taking and self-regulation including the capacity to inhibit one's own perspective while attending to someone else's — and therapy researchers differentiate among three modes of therapeutic empathy, including establishment of rapport, moment-to-moment attunement to the patient's communication, and understanding of the patient's current experiencing within the context of their personal history. Like empathy, congruence has intrapersonal and interpersonal facets; the intrapersonal facet is characterized by genuineness, personal awareness, and authenticity, and the interpersonal facet includes the capacity to articulate one's experience to another person transparently. Psychologists aspire to build congruent therapeutic relationships by being open to joint experiencing with patients, owning their emotions and reactions, and being willing to reflect on their experiences aloud in therapy, with congruent responses that may include targeted self-disclosure or articulation of one's own thoughts and feelings; to maintain congruence over time, psychologists attempt to recognize moments of incongruence and then engage in self-reflection to facilitate a return to greater authenticity.

### Association between smoking and alcohol-related behaviours: a time-series analysis of population trends in england [^116wZwCd]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

If monthly changes in smoking prevalence are associated with changes in prevalence of high‐risk drinking, assessing whether there are corresponding changes in motivation to stop smoking and to reduce alcohol consumption in high‐risk drinkers and attempts to stop smoking and attempts to reduce alcohol consumption in high‐risk drinkers could help to identify the underlying mechanism. Corresponding changes in these variables would suggest that associations between prevalence changes arise from common motivational factors operating at a population level, or reciprocal motivational influences. If there are no corresponding associations between these motivational variables, it suggests that factors relating to capability or the physical or social context may underlie the association. As noted above, this could be because of reductions in smoking and drinking cues or pharmacological interactions.

Thus, this study sought to address the following questions:
Is there an association in England between changes in monthly prevalence of smoking and high‐risk drinking?
Are there corresponding associations between motivation to stop smoking and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption in high‐risk drinkers, and attempts to stop smoking and attempts to reduce alcohol consumption in high‐risk drinkers?

### Identification and treatment of alcohol use disorder [^113a9rs4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol use disorder:

- **Definition**: AUD, according to DSM-5-TR, is characterized by a pattern of alcohol consumption that results in problems associated with ≥ 2 potential symptoms of tolerance, withdrawal, increased amount of alcohol consumed over time, difficulty in controlling drinking, neglect of activities, ineffective efforts to reduce use, craving, failure to fulfill major role obligations, recurrent alcohol use in hazardous situations, time spent drinking or recovering from alcohol, and drinking despite physical/psychological problems in the past year.
- **Pathophysiology**: AUD is caused due to genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: The neurobiological disturbances due to habitual drinking cause AUD, which increases the risk of damage to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, immune, nervous, and other systems. AUD causes increased morbidity and mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AUD is associated with increased mortality from all causes of death (mortality rate ratio, 3.0–5.2).

### Self-defining memories in recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients [^114VhdpN]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with alcohol dependence have been shown to be impaired in recalling specific autobiographical events, yet little is known on how changes in the memory of these events may impact their self-representation. In this study, we examined Self-Defining Memories (SDMs), a specific type of autobiographical memory that plays a key role in the construction of personal identity, in 25 patients with alcohol dependence, abstinent from alcohol from 10 days to 6 months, compared to 28 control subjects. We observed that SDMs in patients were significantly less specific and included more reference to alcohol than those of controls. Patients also reported more SDMs with negative emotional valence and higher emotional intensity. These results suggest that recently abstinent alcohol-dependent patients may be prone to define themselves by negative events referring to alcohol consumption, which may contribute to an unfavorable perception of their self and subsequently of their ability to remain abstinent. These findings should be taken into account to optimize psychological approaches in the treatment of alcohol-dependence.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^114QDKfE]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Collaborative treatment planning in psychological practice — psychologists seek to participate in collaborative treatment planning with patients and others when appropriate. Shared decision-making is the process through which the psychologist, the patient, and, when appropriate, others jointly discuss treatment options to develop a treatment plan consistent with the patient's goals and needs, and treatment planning typically includes consideration of the relative benefits and risks of each treatment option as well as the possibility of no treatment, and it is documented as part of the informed consent process. Psychologists strive to engage patients and appropriate others in collaborative discussions about treatment, typically begin treatment planning by ensuring that patients understand their rights and responsibilities related to treatment in accordance with the ethical mandate for informed consent, and seek to share information about different treatment methods, the efficacy of each method, and the associated risks and side effects; they also acknowledge when the efficacy of a particular treatment has not been adequately evaluated. When recommending a treatment, they strive to rely on the best available research, their clinical expertise, applicability of the treatment to the setting and patient characteristics, as well as patient values and preferences, and they aim to avoid treatments that have been discredited or found harmful. Psychologists actively seek patients' input during treatment planning, frequently inquire about patients' goals for treatment and work towards agreement on how they will collaborate to achieve these goals, aspire to respect their patients' autonomy and do not coerce them to participate in an unwanted or aversive treatment, and in most cases, the patient makes the final treatment decision. Exceptions include situations involving immediate risk to the patient or others, crises and threats to safety or stability, or lack of decisional capacity; at times, crisis situations and patient safety may compel psychologists to provide services in the absence of patient consent, in which instances they attempt to involve relevant others in treatment decisions as appropriate and share important information and decisions with the patient to the extent possible, and when stabilization and safety are attained, more collaborative discussions can occur. When research evidence is limited, psychologists attempt to proceed cautiously based on the best available research relevant to the clinical situation, their clinical expertise, consultation with knowledgeable colleagues, and patient input; psychologists appreciate that no treatment is universally efficacious and that different patients may respond differently to any given treatment, and if a patient has a history of non-response to a given treatment, the psychologist attempts to understand why the prior treatment was not successful, tries to assess any current treatment barriers, and recommends the most suitable treatment course based on the information learned.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^112kg13b]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether brief interventions using the combined classification of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) together with behavioral changes in alcohol use can reduce excessive alcohol consumption. This study aimed to examine the effects of a brief intervention based on the screening of ALDH2 and ADH1B gene polymorphisms on alcohol consumption in Japanese young adults.

Methods

In this open-label randomized controlled trial, we enrolled adults aged 20–30 years who had excessive drinking behavior (average amount of alcohol consumed: men, ≥ 4 drinks/per day and women, ≥ 2 drinks/per day; 1 drink = 10 g of pure alcohol equivalent). Participants were randomized into intervention or control group using a simple random number table. The intervention group underwent saliva-based genotyping of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes (ALDH2 and ADH1B), which were classified into five types. A 30-min in-person or online educational counseling was conducted approximately 1 month later based on genotyping test results and their own drinking records. The control group received traditional alcohol education. Average daily alcohol consumption was calculated based on the drinking diary, which was recorded at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The primary endpoint was average daily alcohol consumption, and the secondary endpoints were the alcohol-use disorder identification test for consumption (AUDIT-C) score and behavioral modification stages assessed using a transtheoretical model.

Results

Participants were allocated to the intervention (n = 100) and control (n = 96) groups using simple randomization. Overall, 28 (29.2%) participants in the control group and 21 (21.0%) in the intervention group did not complete the follow-up. Average alcohol consumption decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months in the intervention group but not in the control group. The reduction from baseline alcohol consumption values and AUDIT-C score at 3 months were greater in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.001). In addition, the behavioral modification stages were significantly changed by the intervention (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Genetic testing for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and health guidance on type-specific excessive drinking may be useful for reducing sustained average alcohol consumption associated with behavioral modification.

### Readiness to change and brain damage in patients with chronic alcoholism [^116kMWhp]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

High motivation to change is a crucial triggering factor to patients' engagement in clinical treatment. This study investigates whether the low readiness to change observed in some alcoholic inpatients at treatment entry could, at least partially, be linked with macrostructural gray matter abnormalities in critical brain regions. Participants comprised 31 alcoholic patients and 27 controls, who underwent 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging. The Readiness to Change Questionnaire, designed to assess three stages of motivation to change (precontemplation, contemplation and action stages), was completed by all patients, who were then divided into "Action" (i.e., patients in action stage) and "PreAction" (i.e., patients in precontemplation or in contemplation stage) subgroups. The PreAction subgroup, but not the Action subgroup, had gray matter volume deficits compared with controls. Unlike the patients in the Action subgroup, the PreAction patients had gray matter abnormalities in the cerebellum (Crus I), fusiform gyri and frontal cortex. The low level of motivation to modify drinking behavior observed in some alcoholic patients at treatment entry may be related to macrostructural brain abnormalities in regions subtending cognitive, emotional and social abilities. These brain volume deficits may result in impairment of critical abilities such as decision making, executive functions and social cognition skills. Those abilities may be needed to resolve ambivalence toward alcohol addiction and to apply "processes of change", which are essential for activating the desire to change problematic behavior.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^112XS3ns]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease patients have very low compliance with almost all types of physical activities. A transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification plan awakens the patient's consciousness in the pre-intention stage. Aim to evaluate whether a management by stages of change plan based on the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change promoted behavior change for patients with non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease.

Methods

Patients with simple fatty liver diagnosed from July to December 2019 were randomly divided into the transtheoretical model and non-transtheoretical model groups. Primary outcome was change in health belief and health behavior based on questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood lipids, body mass indexes, and waist circumference 12-months after intervention.

Results

Of 200 enrolled patients 194 were analyzed (non-transtheoretical model group n = 98, transtheoretical model group n = 96). After intervention, total health belief scores (120.91 ± 4.94 vs. 118.82 ± 5.48) and total health behavior scores (131.71 ± 5.87 vs. 119.96 ± 7.12) were higher in the transtheoretical model group (all P < 0.05). Blood lipids, body mass index, and waist circumference more obviously improved in the transtheoretical model group (all P < 0.05).

Conclusion

A transtheoretical model-based lifestyle modification intervention can be effectively applied to patients with non-alcoholic simple fatty liver.

### Effectiveness of genetic feedback on alcohol metabolism to reduce alcohol consumption in young adults: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^1118xVYc]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

The AUDIT and AUDIT-C were assessed. The AUDIT (10 items, 40-point scale) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a screening method for excessive drinking. The question items and response options for AUDIT are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1; they are rated by summing the number of relevant options for the question items. The validity and effectiveness of the Japanese version of the AUDIT have been validated by Hiro et al. At present, in terms of screening and brief intervention for excessive drinking in Japan, an AUDIT score of 7 or less is considered low-risk drinking, whereas an AUDIT score of 8 or more suggests excessive drinking. The AUDIT-C is a simple screening test (12-point scale) consisting of the AUDIT Questions 1–3. In Japan, a score of ≥ 6 for men and ≥ 4 for women is considered excessive drinking.

Moreover, the five stages of change in drinking behavior include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The stages of change model is a theory used to understand current motivational perceptions and stages of behavior change to provide more appropriate health guidance. Specifically, the survey required responses from the following five options: "precontemplation" with no intention to change behavior within 6 months, "contemplation" with intention to change behavior within 6 months, "preparation" with intention to change behavior within 1 month, "action" with less than 6 months since behavioral change, and "maintenance" with more than 6 months since behavioral change.

### Why behavior change is difficult to sustain [^111n2DAp]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Unhealthy behavior is responsible for much human disease, and a common goal of contemporary preventive medicine is therefore to encourage behavior change. However, while behavior change often seems easy in the short run, it can be difficult to sustain. This article provides a selective review of research from the basic learning and behavior laboratory that provides some insight into why. The research suggests that methods used to create behavior change (including extinction, counterconditioning, punishment, reinforcement of alternative behavior, and abstinence reinforcement) tend to inhibit, rather than erase, the original behavior. Importantly, the inhibition, and thus behavior change more generally, is often specific to the "context" in which it is learned. In support of this view, the article discusses a number of lapse and relapse phenomena that occur after behavior has been changed (renewal, spontaneous recovery, reinstatement, rapid reacquisition, and resurgence). The findings suggest that changing a behavior can be an inherently unstable and unsteady process; frequent lapses should be expected. In the long run, behavior-change therapies might benefit from paying attention to the context in which behavior change occurs.

### Systematic review of frameworks used to conceptualise health pathways of individuals diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases [^115HN37t]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Transtheoretical model

The transtheoretical model of behavioural change, or the stages of change model, was proposed by Prochaska and DiClemente. Originally focusing on cessation of tobacco use, they suggested that behaviour change occurs in discrete stages: precontemplation (not thinking about stopping), contemplation (planning to stop between 31 days and 6 months in the future), preparation (planning to stop within 30 days), action (having stopped for 0–6 months) and maintenance (having stopped for > 6 months). Another iteration included a sixth stage of change, termination (individual has permanently stopped). In all stages, individual self-efficacy is necessary to implement the behaviour change.

Proponents of the transtheoretical model argue the model has enhanced health promotion interventions by highlighting the need to tailor interventions (beyond smoking cessation) according to the particular stage at which target individuals are situated, thereby improving effectiveness. Critics have argued that the time periods defining the stages are arbitrary, that the model unjustifiably assumes that individuals make coherent and stable plansand that important factors in behaviours change (such as reward and punishment) are unacknowledged. Nonetheless, authors have used constructs of the transtheoretical model to complement self-regulatory models (including the common-sense self-regulation model), arguing that this adds predictive valueand enables a delineation between initial versus long-term behaviour change.

### Trends in use of alcohol-free or low alcohol drinks in attempts to reduce alcohol consumption in great britain, 2020–2024: a population-based study [^113rSzk3]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Furthermore, the study compared the profiles of people at risk using: (i) alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks and evidence-based support; (ii) alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks without evidence-based support; (iii) evidence-based support without alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks; or (iv) neither (ie, unaided or using other support such as hypnotherapy or acupuncture). Given there is no conclusive evidence on whether alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks are an effective reduction tool, from a public health perspective, it would be concerning if a rise in the use of alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks to reduce alcohol consumption meant people at risk relied even less on evidence-based methods. Furthermore, it is important to consider the impact of alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks on different populations, particularly people who are dependent on drink. Research suggests that alcohol-free and low alcohol drinks might increase cravings and the desire to drink among people with alcohol use disorder. Even if alcohol-free and low alcohol drinks are shown to be effective in helping people who are dependent on drink to cut down, combining them with other support, such as behavioural therapy, is advisable, especially for severe alcohol use disorders to help manage negative emotional states and cravings.

Specifically, the study addressed the following research questions (RQs) among adults drinking at increasing and higher-risk levels (operationalised as an AUDIT-C score of 5 or above)who attempted to restrict their consumption in the past year in Great Britain between 2020 and 2024:

Have there been changes over time in the proportion who reported using alcohol-free and low alcohol drinks in any or specifically serious attempts to reduce alcohol consumption?
To what extent have changes in any attempts differed by age, gender, socioeconomic position, nation and alcohol consumption level?
Has the sociodemographic and drinking profile among those using alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks in attempts to reduce alcohol consumption changed over this period?
Have there been changes over time in the proportion who tried to restrict their consumption in the past year by using (i) alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks and evidence-based support; (ii) alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks but not evidence-based support; (iii) evidence-based support but not alcohol-free/low alcohol drinks; or (iv) neither?

### How many alcoholic drinks might benefit an older person with hypertension? [^114GcysX]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Lowering alcohol intake reduces blood pressure and hence cardiovascular risk. However, abstainers have an increase in cardiovascular risk and the advice to reduce intake to low levels may not be sound. This review examines the effects of lowering alcohol consumption in terms of blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD). The relationship between both CHD and stroke and alcohol consumption, and the benefits and disadvantages of alcohol consumption in the general population, are discussed. Where available, the results of large meta-analyses are reported. It is concluded that the hypertensive patient over the age of 60 who drinks over 16 drinks per week should be advised to reduce his or her alcohol intake but a daily drink may be advisable and the patient should not stop drinking entirely. It is not suggested that the non-drinker should start drinking, but most hypertensives are over the age of 60 when community studies suggest that drinking alcohol does more good than harm.

### Qualitative study of changes in alcohol use among HIV-infected adults entering care and treatment for HIV / AIDS in rural southwest Uganda [^111ghzsu]. AIDS and Behavior (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The goal of this qualitative study was to examine how HIV-infected persons entering into care and treatment for HIV worked to change their alcohol use over time. We examined patterns of change as described in qualitative interviews, as well the impact of social and psychological factors on efforts to reduce alcohol intake. A majority of study participants appeared to cease or reduce alcohol intake over the study period. Some also returned to or increased their drinking again. Reasons for decreasing or ceasing alcohol consumption included: (a) advice against drinking received from clinic staff; (b) interference with fulfillment of social obligations; (c) negative impact on financial security; and (d) threatened social standing in the community. Competing with these reasons were a number of incentives to drink, including reinforcement of social relationships, stress relief, and overall pleasure and enjoyment gained from alcohol consumption. The result was a "moral tug of war" — with some participants trying to balance the "pull" of perceived benefits of drinking with the "push" of negative consequences from continued alcohol use.

Notably, we identified three influences on patterns of alcohol use related to HIV-infected status. Participants responded strongly to hearing from clinicians that continued alcohol use would undermine the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. Conversely, some found abstinence challenging while coping with the emotional turmoil brought on by their new HIV diagnosis. In addition, a fear that sudden unexplained abstinence might result in attributions of HIV-infected status by others contributed to the "pull" toward continued drinking. Otherwise, influences on efforts at changing drinking behavior appeared not to be directly related to one's HIV status.

In fact, most of the influences on drinking behavior identified for this HIV-infected, rural Ugandan population appear similar to those described for general populations in resource-rich locations. Using alcohol to facilitate social inclusion, cope with stress, and enhance pleasure have been reported repeatedly in studies carried out across age ranges in the US. Documentation of cross-cultural similarities in the reasons people drink and/or try to cut down or stop has implications for thinking about how to intervene on hazardous alcohol use in the Ugandan setting, i.e. interventions that have been effective in other populations may be useful in reducing alcohol consumption in persons with HIV in Uganda as well.

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^111SMqvz]. APA (2021). High credibility.

APA Guidelines on Evidence-Based Psychological Practice in Health Care — change principles, patient characteristics, and tailoring are emphasized as contributors to outcomes: beyond the therapeutic relationship and therapist characteristics, several change principles cutting across different treatment methods are associated with better outcomes, including promoting treatment credibility, cultivating patients' positive expectancies, offering patients opportunities to practice and learn new behaviors, and fostering corrective experiences. Translating these principles into practice involves providing patients with an informed, compelling, and individualized rationale for the proposed treatment and thoughtfully addressing questions and concerns to build their trust in the treatment approach; when working with patients who have low expectancies, therapists strive to adopt an affiliative and supportive attitude, as this stance is associated with better outcomes among these patients. Psychologists also endeavor to display appropriate emotion in therapy and to create a safe space for patients to express, process, and explore their own emotions. Among the "common factors" are patient characteristics, including positive characteristics, motivation for treatment, greater self-efficacy, and higher levels of functioning, all of which are associated with better treatment outcomes, and treatment outcomes also improve when psychologists adapt psychotherapy to patient race, ethnicity, religion, spirituality, reactance level, stage of change, coping style, and preferences. Based on this research, an effective approach to therapy cultivates patients' positive expectancies, fosters their self-efficacy, and provides them with opportunities to apply and control their problems through the new skills and abilities that they developed in therapy; certain dynamic techniques — connecting current feelings to the past, identifying recurrent patterns, and attending to similarities among relationships — are most effective when the therapeutic relationship is strong, and investment in the therapeutic relationship may be particularly critical in psychotherapy with individuals who have PTSD, other trauma-related disorders, attachment disorders, or personality disorders.

### Two years on, a perspective on MAFLD [^1143kaw5]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A further concern if we fail to progress the disease terminology is that we would need to ask the patient his or her alcohol consumption at the first visit and then give a label of 'NAFLD'. It has even been suggested by a few that, for some patients, this can be perceived as destigmatising. We know that alcohol consumption can change over the life course, including multiple reports indicating changes during COVID-19 as just one example. Furthermore, recent alcohol consumption rather than that earlier in life is associated with the risk of alcohol-related cirrhosis. So does that mean a patient can have NAFLD and then if he/she drinks above the acceptable limits he/she has ALRD when reviewed a year later, and then if he/she stops drinking in another year has NAFLD again? This is patently ridiculous if the patient remains throughout with metabolic risk factors.

Apart from the liver injury, alcohol consumption is associated with extrahepatic diseases overlapping with MAFLD such as hypertension, diabetes, cancers and atrial fibrillation. In all these other fields, alcohol consumption is considered a risk factor with no false dichotomisation, as we in hepatology undertake. It has also been argued that, in liver, both diseases have similar histological features and, thus, can be confusing. This is precisely the value of positive diagnostic criteria for all diseases that a person might suffer from.

Are patients with liver diseases such as viral hepatitis immune NAFLD? To the contrary, using the MAFLD criteria, a considerable proportion of these patients has MAFLD. Is it logical to use the term NAFLD despite having other liver diseases or acknowledging the use of alcohol?Is it not high time that we correct the ambiguity?

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^116aA5wV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

For the patients in the transtheoretical model group, a transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle amendment plan was formulated. The transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change believes that individual behavior changes can be divided into 5 stages: (1) Pre-intention stage: The patient has poor knowledge of healthy lifestyles, is not aware of the harm caused by the unhealthy lifestyles, and has no plan to change within 6 months; (2) Intention stage: The patient has realized the shortcomings in his/her daily lifestyle and plans to change it within 6 months; (3) Preparation stage: The patient has established a goal for changing his/her lifestyle, and occasionally controls diet and strengthens exercise, which has not been regular; (4) Action stage: The patient has been able to observe a healthy lifestyle, but this has been no more than 6 months; (5) Maintaining phase: The patient has gotten through behavioral changes, which means they are strictly abiding by the principles of diet and exercise for more than 6 months. Ten intervention strategies can be implemented corresponding to these 5 stages. Pre-intention stage: (1) Awareness awakening, (2) Vivid relief, (3) Self-efficacy; Intention stage: (4) Self-reassessment, (5) Environmental reassessment; Preparation stage: (6) Self-liberation, (7) Helping relationships; Action stage: (8) Counter-condition; Maintaining phase: (9) Strengthen management, (10) Stimulus control. For these 10 intervention strategies, there are a series of matching intervention measures, which can be modified according to the actual situation during the implementation process.

### Gender-specific effects of comorbid depression and anxiety on the propensity to drink in negative emotional States [^117VFDzb]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and depression are the main contributors to the global burden of mental and neurological disorders 1. Clinical 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and epidemiological 7, 8, 9 findings indicate frequent comorbidity of AUDs with depression and anxiety, resulting in poor treatment outcomes and frequent complications, including suicide. Analyses suggest that such comorbidity may represent an important subtype of AUD and call for development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcomes 10, 11. Specifically, the distinction between alcohol‐induced depression, which often resolves during early abstinence 12, and non‐alcohol‐induced depression, which is also frequent in alcoholics 13, is challenging and complicates selection between treatment options 14, 15. Hence, studies investigating differential impact of alcohol‐induced and non‐alcohol‐induced depression on phenotypical presentation and course of AUDs are highly important 12, 16, 17.

Evidence indicates that depression and anxiety combined with alcohol use may create a feed‐forward cycle of increasing each other's intensity that develops and supports comorbidity 18. This feed‐forward cycle may include a stress‐response system, which contributes to increased craving and corresponding neuroendocrine changes 19, 20. Craving is a major component of AUDs and an important treatment target 21, 22. Based on epidemiological and clinical data, craving was reinstated among diagnostic criteria for AUDs 23, 24. Our recent findings and previous reports associated craving intensity with the post‐treatment relapse 25, 26, 27, 28. Available self‐rating instruments 21, 29, 30 assess the intensity of craving, while leaving aside its emotional and motivational dimensions 31. Conversely, the Inventory of Drinking Situations 32 and its revised version Inventory of Drug Taking Situations (IDTS) 33 identify negative and positive reinforcing motives versus temptation corresponding to preferred drinking situations 32, 34, 35, 36. This approach is consistent with a three‐pathway model of craving: attributing the desire for rewarding properties of alcohol (i.e. positive/reward craving); the desire for drinking to reduce tension, stress reactivity and negative emotions (i.e. negative/relief craving); and obsessive thoughts about drinking (i.e. temptation craving) to corresponding dysregulation in dopamine/opioid, glutamate/gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin neurotransmission systems, respectively 37.

Application — Psychologists strive to respect patient characteristics, culture, and preferences by partnering with the patient in clinical decision-making and endeavor to attend to these attributes throughout the treatment course. They seek to adapt their clinical approach to presenting concerns, for example recognizing that patients with a trauma history often avoid thinking and talking about their trauma — which impedes emotional processing and delays symptom resolution — and that trust-building may be necessary before detailed discussion. They also address that patients who are depressed typically have difficulty initiating responses, and efforts to break tasks into components and to overcome inertia increase the likelihood of treatment success. Psychologists attempt to tailor treatment to stage of change because the same treatment may not be appropriate for all; patients in the contemplation stage may need therapy quite different from those in the action stage, and therapeutic approaches that increase insight, awareness, and emotional salience may be more useful during earlier stages, whereas approaches fostering behavioral change may be more effective in later stages. Given evidence for tailoring to sociocultural backgrounds, psychologists attempt to develop familiarity with culturally informed approaches; meta-analytic results indicate that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups tend to have better therapy outcomes when they participate in culturally adapted mental health interventions compared to traditional or unadapted interventions, and adaptations for a particular cultural group are more effective than those delivered to individuals from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Effective cultural adaptation requires understanding patients' preferred language and incorporating culturally relevant explanations of mental illness, while balancing identification and validation of treatment needs with sensitivity to culture and preferences.

### Emergency department-initiated tobacco control: a randomised controlled trial in an inner city university hospital [^1148hipi]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Baseline screening

The computerised screening tool at baseline, using a mouse-only technique requiring no typing, consisted of a question on motivation to change smoking behaviour according to the transtheoretical model of behaviour change:"When do you wish to stop smoking?". Those answering "Not within the next 6 months" were considered unmotivated smokers (ie, smokers in the precontemplation stage), those answering "Within the next 6 months but not within the next 4 weeks" were considered ambivalent smokers (ie, smokers in the contemplation stage) and those answering "Within the next 4 weeks" were considered to be motivated smokers (ie, smokers in the preparation stage). Study participants were additionally administered the validated German versionof the Fagerstroem test for nicotine dependence (FTND), a detailed smoking history which includes questions on smoking history (duration of smoking, age at onset, attempts to quit during the last 12 months and partner's smoking status). Further questions focused on alcohol consumption (hazardous alcohol consumption defined as ⩾5 points on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test – Primary Care (AUDIT-PC)scale), illicit drug consumption, and socioeconomic parameters according to the German Health Survey 1998. Overall, a maximum of 80 questions were asked, which took approximately 20 min. The questioning took place in the ED during waiting times for treatment or diagnostic procedures. Routine medical treatment was given priority over study assessment procedures.

### Prospective correlates of drinking cessation: variation across the life-course [^111FTzaj]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess age variation in correlates of drinking cessation.

Design

Prospective study of a US general population sample.

Setting

Face-to-face household interviews.

Participants

Past-year ≥ monthly drinkers interviewed at baseline and 3-year follow-up (n = 14 885).

Measurements

Baseline values and selected changes over follow-up in alcohol consumption, alcohol use disorder (AUD), socio-demographic and health characteristics, other substance use and psychiatric comorbidity were used to predict drinking cessation in three age groups.

Findings

Correlates of drinking cessation varied over the life-course, with pregnancy/presence of an infant, nicotine or drug use disorder, incident AUD, cluster A personality disorder, liver disease and incident retirement being important at younger ages and high-school graduation, family income ≥ $70 000, volume of ethanol intake, Asian race/ethnicity, mood disorder and incident cardiovascular disease being significant at older ages. Age-invariant correlates included smoking cessation over follow-up, odds ratio (OR) = 2.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62–4.92] to 3.45 (2.20–5.39); college education, OR = 0.42 (0.27–0.65) to 0.54 (0.36–0.83); black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, OR = 1.74 (1.18–2.29) to 1.88 (1.21–2.93) and 1.58 (1.11–1.25) to 1.73 (0.83–3.63), respectively, and months since last drink, OR = 1.24 (1.13–1.36) to 1.29 (1.19–1.39).

Conclusions

Factors associated with ceasing alcohol use in US adults appear to differ over the life-course, reflecting age variation in both their prevalence and impact and supporting the importance of role transitions and health problems (the 'sick quitter' effect). The most consistent correlates of drinking cessation included factors reflecting ability/inability to give up potentially addictive substances and factors associated with perceived acceptability of drinking and subgroup-specific drinking contexts that might facilitate/impede continued drinking.

### Change lifestyle modification plan / transtheoretical model in non-alcoholic simple fatty liver disease: a pilot randomized study [^116cTER9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that intervention with the Transtheoretical Model and Stages of Change increased personal health belief, sense of implementation capability, sense of being threatened, and total health belief scores more than routine health guidance. The transtheoretical model also increased the number of cases with excellent and good health behavior, and blood lipids, body mass index, and waist circumference improved. These findings suggest that the transtheoretical model improved the health beliefs, established healthy behaviors, and reduced the weight of patients with simple fatty liver disease.

Currently, establishment of a healthy lifestyle is the main intervention for NAFLD treatment. This has recently led to the innovative nursing models of NAFLD, such as behavioral intervention models, solution focused approaches, and problem-based learning health education models. They have a certain effect on motivating patients to establish healthy behaviors. But these models have not been personalized for patients in terms of health beliefs, which often leads to a lack of confidence and compliance and limits the adherence duration. Only when a person has the motivation to change from deep in his heart, can he actually put it to action. The core of implementing a transtheoretical model-oriented lifestyle modification and intervention for simple fatty liver disease patients is to change the patient's philosophy and enhance the patient's decision-making ability for behavior change, thereby motivating patients to establish and maintain healthy lifestyles. The results of the study showed that the level of health behavior after transtheoretical model was better than that of the controls who had routine health guidance.

### Behavior modification in primary care: the pressure system model [^113yCofj]. Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The leading causes of death in the United States are predominantly attributable to modifiable behaviors. Patients with behavioral risk factors for premature death and disability, including dietary practices; sexual practices; level of physical activity; motor vehi cle use patterns; and tobacco, alcohol, and illicit sub stance use, are seen far more consistently by primary care providers than by mental health specialists. Yet models of behavior modification are reported, debated, and revised almost exclusively in the psychology literature. While the Stages of Change Model, or Transtheo retical Model, has won application in a broadening array of clinical settings, its application in the primary care setting is apparently quite limited despite evidence of its utility [Prochaska J, Velicer W. Am J Health Promot 1997;12:38–48]. The lack of a rigorous behavioral model developed for application in the primary care setting is an impediment to the accomplishment of public health goals specified in the Healthy People objectives and in the reports of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The Pressure System Model reported here synthesizes elements of established behavior modification theories for specific application under the constraints of the primary care setting. Use of the model in both clinical and research settings, with outcome evaluation, is encouraged as part of an effort to advance public health.

### Patient reflections, challenges, and supports related to early liver transplant for severe alcohol-associated liver disease [^115F6daL]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Period 1. Life before severe illness from ALD

Participants shared their experiences related to alcohol use before becoming severely ill from ALD. Three themes emerged:

Theme A: Alcohol as a "constant" part of life

Nearly all participants described alcohol as a "constant" or "regular" part of their lives before becoming severely ill. Many participants disclosed that they started using alcohol in their teens or 20s. Some participants described daily, "heavy" alcohol use or noted that using alcohol had become "routine". Other participants shared they began drinking alcohol "heavily" when their lives hit a "low" point, such as a difficult marriage or divorce. Participants indicated that they had used alcohol to cope with depression, anxiety, or stressful situations. Participants also observed that alcohol was pervasive in their surroundings. For example, they described social norms of drinking with family, work colleagues, or for leisure.

Theme B: Alcohol use negatively affecting relationships and work

Most participants shared that their alcohol use had negatively affected personal relationships or work life. For instance, participants recounted "strained" relationships with spouses, children, siblings, or parents. Situations arose where participants avoided family members, neglected familial responsibilities, or clashed with loved ones over ongoing alcohol use. Moreover, some participants linked their alcohol use to missed professional opportunities, stating they "paid less attention" to their careers. One participant speculated that attaining an executive-level management position would have been possible had he been "more sober". In contrast, a few participants emphasized that they had ensured alcohol use did not affect their relationships or work life.

Theme C: Feeling "stuck" in the cycle of drinking

Some participants expressed that they had desired to "break" their alcohol addiction cycles but did not know how to stop consuming alcohol, feeling "stuck in a rut". Some participants mentioned attempts to seek a therapist or "rehab". One described "put[ting] myself in the hospital" to quit using alcohol but then relapsing while home alone during a stressful period in life. In contrast, a few participants explained they were unaware of falling severely ill until it was too late to seek addiction treatment. The participants described they could "handle [alcohol] remarkably well" and were "functional"; however, in hindsight, they would characterize their patterns of behavior as detrimental.

### Mechanisms of behavior change in alcoholics anonymous: does alcoholics anonymous lead to better alcohol use outcomes by reducing depression symptoms? [^113Lu7b5]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Indices of negative affect, such as depression, have been implicated in stress-induced pathways to alcohol relapse. Empirically supported continuing care resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), emphasize reducing negative affect to reduce relapse risk, but little research has been conducted to examine putative affective mechanisms of AA's effects.

Methods

Using lagged, controlled, hierarchical linear modeling and mediational analyses this study investigated whether AA participation mobilized changes in depression symptoms and whether such changes explained subsequent reductions in alcohol use. Alcohol-dependent adults (n = 1706), receiving treatment as part of a clinical trial, were assessed at intake, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months.

Results

Findings revealed elevated levels of depression compared to the general population, which decreased during treatment and then remained stable over follow-up. Greater AA attendance was associated with better subsequent alcohol use outcomes and decreased depression. Greater depression was associated with heavier and more frequent drinking. Lagged mediation analyses revealed that the effects of AA on alcohol use was mediated partially by reductions in depression symptoms. However, this salutary effect on depression itself appeared to be explained by AA's proximal effect on reducing concurrent drinking.

Conclusions

AA attendance was associated both concurrently and predictively with improved alcohol outcomes. Although AA attendance was associated additionally with subsequent improvements in depression, it did not predict such improvements over and above concurrent alcohol use. AA appears to lead both to improvements in alcohol use and psychological and emotional wellbeing which, in turn, may reinforce further abstinence and recovery-related change.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114WDZbT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to inform patients that safe management of alcohol withdrawal may require a transfer to a more intensive care level, including an inpatient setting. Obtain the patient's consent for transfer if signs indicate that ambulatory setting management is not safe or effective.

### Progressive stage transition does mean getting better: a further test of the transtheoretical model in recovery from alcohol problems [^113iWpmr]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To test two central assumptions of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) regarding recovery from alcohol problems: (i) individuals making a forward transition from pre-action to action stages will show greater drinking improvements than those remaining in pre-action stages; and (ii) individuals remaining in pre-action stages will not demonstrate improvements in drinking outcomes.

Design and Setting

Large, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of treatment for alcohol problems [United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT)].

Measurements

Stage of change, drinks per drinking day and percentage days abstinent at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups.

Findings

In support of TTM assumption 1, improvements in drinking outcomes were consistently greater among clients who showed a forward stage transition (Cohen's d = 0.68) than among those who did not (d = 0.10). Two tests of assumption 2 showed a significant improvement in drinking outcomes in non-transition groups, inconsistent with the TTM; one test showed a significant deterioration and the other showed equivalent drinking outcomes across time. An explanation is offered as to why, under the relevant assumption of the TTM, clients in non-transition groups showed small changes in drinking outcomes.

Conclusions

In contrast to a previous study by Callaghan and colleagues, our findings largely support the TTM account of recovery from alcohol problems in treatment. The discrepancy can be explained by the use in our study of a more reliable and valid method for assigning stage of change.

### Effect of a novel brief motivational intervention for alcohol-intoxicated young adults in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^116M3rwt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Interventions

The brief MI model (Box) was developed and pretested in a previous phase of the project, described in details elsewhere. The control intervention (BA) included (1) brief structured feedback based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (ie, hazardous alcohol use based on a cut-off score of eight or more, (2) information on alcohol risks based on a 1-page illustration leaflet, and (3) advice to reduce alcohol use and follow recommended guidelines provided on the reverse. Those with an AUDIT score greater than 16 (ie, probable alcohol use disorder) were offered referral to specialized alcohol treatment. The BA included no booster sessions.

Box.
Brief Motivational Intervention Description

The brief MI used 3 strategies: Taking time to build a meaningful relationship by using relational factors such as empathy, acceptance, and collaboration. Eliciting patients' change talk, softening their sustain talk, and strengthening their ability and commitment to change. Providing information and advice while supporting patients' autonomy (including feedback and discussion about being admitted in the ED with alcohol intoxication).
The brief MI followed 3 steps: Exploring current situation (eg, ED admission context, emotional aspects, alcohol use) and important things in life (ie, raising ambivalence/discrepancy). Evoking change in a hypothetical future (ie, resolving ambivalence/decreasing discrepancy). Planning change (ie, concrete next steps).
When necessary, clinicians discussed and facilitated referral to alcohol treatment. After the baseline session, the clinician sent a letter summing up the discussion (ie, context, discussion, aims, and encouragements) to the participant by mail or email, according to participant's choice.
Based on participant's agreement, a booster session by phone was conducted after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to continue the discussion and follow-up participants' progress and/or challenges.

Seven qualified research clinicians (master-level psychologists) provided both interventions, acting as addiction liaison consults for the study participants. ED staff did not deliver interventions in order to avoid additional workload and because liaison consults and interventions delivered by addiction specialists have been shown to have higher treatment fidelity. Research clinicians had clinical experience and basic motivational interviewing skills (ie, highly empathic and nonconfrontational style) that are important predictors of alcohol-related brief MI outcomes. Research clinicians were specifically trained to provide the interventions and supervision was provided biweekly throughout the project by a senior clinician expert in motivational interviewing.

- risks to self from continued use of alcohol, such as physical health, occupational functioning, legal involvement

- risk to others from continued use of alcohol, such as impaired driving.

### Temporal pathways of change in two randomized controlled trials for depression and harmful drinking in goa, India [^116rc2ny]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based psychological treatments (PTs) are recommended as the first line of treatment for depression and alcohol use disorders (AUD) – two leading causes of global burden of mental disorders for women and men respectively (World Health Organization). Worldwide, brief PTs delivered by non-specialist providers (NSPs) have been successful at treating adult depression and AUDs (Van Ginneken et al; Hoeft et al; Singla et al.). Despite their effectiveness, it remains unclear how these treatments achieve their effects. Identifying temporal pathways of how key treatment and patient variables influence clinical outcomes may illuminate how PTs operate, guiding clinicians, and researchers to predict individual patient trajectories and develop more effective interventions (Cook et al; Kraemer).

The current study explored specific treatment- and patient-level variables that may influence the effectiveness of lay counselor delivered treatments for depression and harmful drinking. Each treatment was the subject of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), delivered in primary care settings in Goa, India. The Healthy Activity Program (HAP) – a brief, culturally adapted version of behavioral activation (BA) treatment for depression (Chowdhary et al.) – was found to be more effective than enhanced usual care (EUC) in reducing depressive symptoms and improving remission rates at the primary end-point of 3-months (Patel et al.). Similarly, the Counselling for Alcohol Problems (CAP) Program – a brief, motivational interviewing (MI)-informed PT for harmful drinkers (Nadkarni et al.) – was found to be more effective than EUC in increasing abstinence and remission rates at 3-months post-enrollment (Nadkarni et al.).

As per Magill et al. we defined treatment variables as treatment processes or counselor skills that predict patient behaviors or long-term effects. Patient behaviors were those enacted by the patient that were potentially associated with the outcomes of interest (i.e. average daily drinking scores and depressive symptoms at 3-months, post enrollment). Fig. 1 shows the study's hypothesized pathways of change in each trial, whereby both treatment-specific and general skills in early sessions would influence the subsequent patient behaviors (patient activation in HAP or change and counterchange talk in CAP) which would, in turn, influence the clinical outcome post-treatment. We also hypothesized that patient behaviors would mediate the effects of therapy quality on clinical outcomes.

### Motives for physical activity in the adOption And maintenance of physical activity in men with alcohol use disorders [^116FiygX]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Within the self-determination theory and the trans-theoretical model (stages of change) frameworks, we investigated motives for physical activity adoption and maintenance in men with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Fifty Ugandan patients completed the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3) to assess exercise motives, the Patient-centred Assessment and Counselling for Exercise (PACE) to determine stage of change and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The relationship between motives for physical activity and stage of change was investigated using ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe tests. Multivariate analyses found significantly higher levels of introjected, identified and integrated motivation in the action and maintenance stage versus the pre-action stage. There were no differences in intrinsic motivation between the stages of change. Our results suggest that in order to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle the most important source of motivation comes from the benefits that may be obtained rather than from the inherent pleasure or challenge associated with it. The study provides a platform for future research to investigate the importance of autonomous motivation within physical activity interventions for people with AUD.

### 'Ageing with an alcohol problem is not what I envision': reclaiming agency in shaping personal ageing trajectory and recovery from alcohol problems [^116P8xhm]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Category 3.2. Getting the right support to set personal goals and resolve alcohol problems

Participants confided that they did not want to quit drinking. Their goal was to maintain lower risk consumption and continue 'enjoying a beer or a glass of wine with dinner' or 'drinking during weekends and holidays'. As a result, they avoided abstinence-based treatments. They had not received alcohol treatment from social services either because they had stable financial and housing conditions. As a group, however, they had frequent medical comorbidities and accessed healthcare services. Several noted that their trusted general practitioner or psychiatrist recommended they seek care at the specialist outpatient alcohol treatment clinic. The recommendation motivated initiating contact with the clinic and booking an appointment.

The respondents appreciated that clinicians at the clinic asked them to identify personal recovery goals and that they were able to negotiate achievable goals and recovery strategies. They continued their treatment because the clinicians respected their goal setting autonomy, trusted their capacity to implement negotiated strategies and provided guidance instead of directives. A participant said, '… the therapy itself doesn't instruct you how much exactly you should drink. I mean, their way of putting it up is different. They ask you, what is your goal and then they try to help you with motivational ideas… ' (P4).

Establishing a working therapeutic partnership with care providers was important for the participants. They mentioned that building trust and having an open dialogue with clinicians required time and depended on the partnership dynamics. Respondents appreciated the clinicians' non-confrontational and gentle motivational approach. The patient/clinician partnership was a key ingredient for participants' recovery '… I finally got in touch with [psychologist] who guided me well through this period… //… we talk about everything possible… [the psychologist] is so supportive and understanding… is not judgmental but can also ask those tricky questions that I have to start thinking about… we have had a long-term contact and the relationship has become very meaningful for me… [the psychologist] is the right person in the right place' (P5).

In addition to incorporating participants' autonomy in setting goals and negotiating strategies, participants stated that clinicians provided them with feedback during treatment which strengthened their agency to reduce their alcohol consumption. Feedback included information about health risks associated with high alcohol consumption, interpretation of initial and follow up liver function test results, and reflection on strategies participants applied to achieve set goals.

### Alcohol milestones and internalizing, externalizing, and executive function: longitudinal and polygenic score associations [^114tt7cD]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is a major global health concern, typically beginning in adolescence and accounting for over 5% of global death and disability and 20% of deaths of those aged 20–49 in the U.S. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the most prevalent (29.1% lifetime) and comorbid psychopathologies. At the same time, few receive treatment (7.6%–19.8%;), and there are high relapse rates among those who do. Despite appreciable advances in AUD research, differentiation between the causes and consequences of AUD as it progresses is incomplete. Given the substantial burden of alcohol involvement, it is of critical public health interest to better understand the developmental course of alcohol use and AUD in relationship to genetic liability and behavioral precipitants and/or sequelae.

The neurobiological stage-based model of addiction postulates that alcohol-induced alterations in neural circuits promote three addiction stages — Binge/Intoxication, Withdrawal/Negative Affect, and Preoccupation/Anticipation — that broadly correspond with impulsivity/incentive salience, negative emotionality, and reduced executive function, respectively. Stimulation of neural reward circuits positively reinforces escalating use and potentiates impulsive behaviors (Binge/Intoxication). Following continued heavy use, alcohol intake becomes predominantly negatively reinforcing and compulsive, functioning to alleviate negative affect and withdrawal (Withdrawal/Negative Affect). Repeated alcohol-reward and alcohol-relief pairings beget craving and preoccupation with alcohol use (Preoccupation/Anticipation) and a loss of control over alcohol use arising from impaired prefrontal control of circuits that drive reward- and affect-related processes.

Other models of addiction emphasize the predispositional role of traits aligned with these addiction stages (i.e. impulsivity, negative emotionality, and EF) in the initial use of alcohol and development of problems. The neurodevelopmental model theorizes that typical patterns of uneven brain development during adolescence and young adulthood drive developmentally normative increases in impulsivity, negative affect, and urgency, as well as reduced executive control, that confer vulnerability to the positive and negative reinforcing properties of alcohol and to preoccupation. Broadly, models of AUD suggest that trait-like differences in impulsivity, negative affect, and EF may indicate predispositional risk for AUD development and/or consequences of alcohol exposure. However, few studies have evaluated longitudinal bidirectional relationships between AUD stages and these 'stage-based' behavioral indicators.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111PHGva]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

DSM-5 criteria — alcohol use disorder describe a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended; there is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use; a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects; craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol; recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home; continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol; important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use; recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous; alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol; tolerance, as defined by either a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect or a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol; and withdrawal, as manifested by either the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol or alcohol (or closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
