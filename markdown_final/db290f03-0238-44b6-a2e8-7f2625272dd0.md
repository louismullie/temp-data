## Question

esophageal varicies nonbleeding management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of non-bleeding esophageal varices, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to stratify bleeding risk and when to screen. Then, I should verify the indications for primary prophylaxis and the choice between nonselective beta-blockers and endoscopic band ligation. Next, I will review dosing, titration, and monitoring for beta-blockers, followed by the EBL protocol and surveillance. After that, I need to consider special populations and decompensated states, and finally I should confirm what not to do and synthesize a practical algorithm with follow-up intervals anchored to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification framework and screening thresholds, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. I should verify that compensated cirrhosis with clinically significant portal hypertension, typically defined by HVPG greater than 10 mmHg or liver stiffness by transient elastography greater than 25 kPa, warrants screening and consideration of nonselective beta-blockade even without documented varices, and that Baveno VII allows deferral of screening endoscopy in compensated patients with platelets at least 150,000 and liver stiffness 20 kPa or less, with endoscopy triggered once thresholds are crossed or decompensation occurs [^111nb3um] [^111Cnsyr] [^112h9f9o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who needs prophylaxis; I need to check the size and features of varices that mandate treatment. Large esophageal varices, medium-sized varices with high-risk stigmata such as red wale marks, or Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis are clear indications for primary prophylaxis, whereas small varices without high-risk features generally do not require prophylaxis, though I should remember that small varices with red wale marks or Child-Pugh C may merit beta-blockers per AASLD 2017, so I should confirm stigmata carefully on endoscopy before deciding [^114zDEkq] [^114sb7P6] [^117F1yzY].

> Next, I should review the two evidence-based options for primary prophylaxis and weigh them thoughtfully. Nonselective beta-blockers reduce portal pressure and have favorable effects beyond variceal bleeding prevention, while endoscopic band ligation directly obliterates varices; both reduce first bleeding and mortality compared with no intervention, and guidelines endorse either strategy based on patient factors and local expertise, so I need to ensure the choice aligns with comorbidities, preferences, and access to endoscopy [^117F1yzY] [^116sHTuk] [^111uAdHy].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic choice and dosing, because carvedilol versus traditional NSBBs matters. Carvedilol is preferred in many contemporary guidelines for its added alpha-1 blockade and greater HVPG reduction, with typical dosing starting at 6.25 mg daily and titrating to 12.5–25 mg daily as tolerated, targeting a resting heart rate around 55–60 bpm while maintaining systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg; I should double-check that heart rate and blood pressure targets are used pragmatically rather than chasing a fixed dose, and that I monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and fatigue at each visit [^111nb3um] [^111Cnsyr] [^114utSLf].

> I need to ensure I am not missing contraindications or situations requiring dose adjustment. In severe or refractory ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute kidney injury, hepatorenal syndrome, or systemic hypotension, I should decrease or temporarily hold nonselective beta-blockers and reassess once hemodynamics improve; carvedilol may be particularly undesirable in severe ascites due to its potent vasodilatory effects, so I should confirm hemodynamic status before continuing therapy [^1114rn13] [^113oDfdm] [^1132a14t].

> Let me consider endoscopic band ligation as the alternative when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. The protocol is serial ligation every 2–4 weeks until eradication, followed by surveillance endoscopy at 3–6 month intervals in the first year and then every 6–12 months thereafter; I should confirm that patients understand the need for repeated procedures and that we plan for recurrence surveillance from the outset [^111Cnsyr] [^117XadQ1].

> But wait, what if the patient already has clinically significant portal hypertension without varices on screening; should I start a beta-blocker anyway. The PREDESCI trial and subsequent guidance support initiating nonselective beta-blockade in compensated cirrhosis with CSPH to reduce decompensation risk, so I should discuss this preventive strategy and its rationale with the patient, even if varices are not yet present [^111MnRzs] [^111nb3um].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, strict application of Baveno VI/VII noninvasive thresholds may miss high-risk varices, so I should have a lower threshold for endoscopy and consider beta-blockade broadly for variceal prophylaxis; in cystic fibrosis–related liver disease, adult screening can follow Baveno-like thresholds, whereas pediatric data are insufficient and decisions should be individualized; in noncirrhotic portal hypertension, principles are similar but anatomy and hemodynamics may shift the balance toward endovascular strategies if bleeding risk is high, so I need to tailor accordingly [^114Ug2Pq] [^112h9f9o] [^115RgiUV].

> Hold on, I should verify what not to do, because harmful or unsupported practices persist. Combination therapy with nonselective beta-blockers plus band ligation is not recommended for primary prophylaxis, routine serial endoscopy is not needed once a patient is established on beta-blockers without new decompensation, and there is insufficient evidence to support beta-blockers solely to prevent varice formation in patients without varices, so I should avoid these pitfalls [^1148vbJE] [^116u43KQ] [^115FQpnQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure the follow-up cadence is aligned with guidelines. Screen all patients with cirrhosis at diagnosis and then periodically based on risk, using noninvasive thresholds where appropriate; if medium-large varices or high-risk features are present, offer carvedilol as first-line pharmacologic prophylaxis or EBL if beta-blockers are contraindicated; if small varices without high-risk stigmata are found, observe with repeat endoscopy in 1–2 years, but initiate beta-blockade if red wale marks or Child-Pugh C are present; after EBL eradication, surveil every 3–6 months in year one and then every 6–12 months, and if on beta-blockers, monitor heart rate, blood pressure, renal function, and sodium at regular intervals and adjust therapy as clinical status fluctuates [^111Cnsyr] [^117F1yzY] [^114zDEkq].

> Finally, I should confirm that patient education and shared decision-making are embedded, because adherence and procedural tolerance drive outcomes. I will explain the rationale for prophylaxis, the risks and benefits of beta-blockers versus EBL, the need for ongoing surveillance after eradication, and the circumstances under which therapy should be modified or temporarily held, ensuring the plan is documented and revisited at each visit to maintain alignment with evolving liver disease status and patient preferences [^117F1yzY] [^111Cnsyr].

Non-bleeding esophageal varices are managed by **risk stratification** and **primary prophylaxis** to prevent first bleeding [^117F1yzY]. Patients with medium/large varices or high-risk features (Child-Pugh B/C, red wale marks) should receive **nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB)** [^111nb3um] (carvedilol preferred) or undergo **endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)** [^114zDEkq]; NSBBs are favored for their added benefits and lower serious adverse events than EVL [^11748oRz]. Small varices without high-risk stigmata are monitored with periodic endoscopy, and NSBBs are considered if risk increases [^114sb7P6]. Avoid combining NSBBs with EVL for primary prophylaxis [^1148vbJE], and tailor therapy to patient preference, tolerability, and local expertise [^117F1yzY].

---

## Risk stratification and screening

Risk stratification guides management: screen all patients with cirrhosis at diagnosis and repeat every 2–3 years if no varices are found; if small varices are present, **repeat endoscopy in 1–2 years** [^112rXehi]. Noninvasive thresholds (platelets ≥ 150,000/µL and liver stiffness ≤ 20 kPa) can obviate screening in compensated patients, but endoscopy is still required if these thresholds are not met or if the patient decompensates [^112h9f9o].

| **Variceal size** | **Risk of bleeding** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Small (< 5 mm) | Low | Surveillance endoscopy every 1–2 years [^112h9f9o] |
| Medium (5–10 mm) | Moderate | NSBB or EVL [^117F1yzY] |
| Large (> 10 mm) | High | NSBB or EVL [^117F1yzY] |

## Pharmacological prophylaxis

### Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB)

- **Mechanism**: Reduce portal pressure via beta-1 and beta-2 blockade, decreasing cardiac output and splanchnic blood flow [^116sHTuk].
- **Agents**: Propranolol, nadolol, carvedilol (preferred for its additional alpha-1 blockade and greater HVPG reduction) [^111nb3um].
- **Efficacy**: Reduces first variceal bleeding by ~50% and is cost-effective [^113WotvB].
- **Limitations**: Side effects (hypotension, bradycardia, fatigue, sexual dysfunction); contraindications include asthma, bradycardia, and severe peripheral vascular disease [^113oDfdm].

---

### Carvedilol

Carvedilol is **preferred** for its superior HVPG reduction and fewer serious adverse events than EVL [^111nb3um] [^11748oRz]. Typical dosing starts at 6.25 mg/day and is titrated to 12.5–25 mg/day or to a heart rate of 55–60 bpm if tolerated [^111MnRzs].

---

## Endoscopic prophylaxis

### Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)

- **Mechanism**: Mechanical obliteration of varices via banding, reducing bleeding risk [^111uAdHy].
- **Efficacy**: Comparable to NSBB in preventing first bleeding; preferred when NSBBs are contraindicated or not tolerated [^111Cnsyr] [^11534Ett].
- **Limitations**: Procedure-related complications (ulceration, bleeding, dysphagia); requires sedation and serial sessions [^111uAdHy].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy with NSBB plus EVL is **not recommended** for primary prophylaxis due to increased adverse events without added benefit [^1148vbJE].

---

## Surveillance and follow-up

Surveillance entails periodic endoscopy to detect progression and guide therapy; after EVL, repeat endoscopy every 3–6 months until eradication, then annually [^notfound]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, recognition of bleeding signs, and when to seek care [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: NSBBs may be contraindicated; consider dose reduction or discontinuation in severe circulatory dysfunction or refractory ascites [^1114rn13].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, especially when side effects or procedural risks are concerns [^117F1yzY].
- **Resource availability**: Choice between NSBB and EVL may depend on local expertise and access [^117F1yzY].

---

Non-bleeding esophageal varices are managed by **risk-based primary prophylaxis** with NSBBs or EVL, with NSBBs (especially carvedilol) generally preferred; small varices are surveilled, and combination therapy is avoided.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

Each statement was then assessed for level of evidence by the following criteria: (a) high level of evidence; further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, (b) moderate level of evidence; further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the recommendation and (c) low level of evidence; further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

The conference was supported by an unrestrictive grant from the GI Research Fund of the Institute of Digestive Disease of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Industry support was not provided to avoid potential influence on the process of consensus development. Mandatory written disclosure of financial conflicts of interest within 24 months before the meeting was obtained from all voting participants.

In this updated consensus meeting, it was decided that the statements should focus on guiding clinical management of NVUGIB rather than on clarifying clinical concepts. There should be minimal overlap or repetition between this updated statement and the previous Asia-Pacific consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleedingunless new evidence had arisen that might change the recommendation. The panel also decided to report the statements that had not reached consensus as these are also considered useful in providing guidelines for the clinical management of such patients. Therefore, the first part of this report consists of consensus statements categorised under (1) pre-endoscopic management, (2) endoscopic management, (3) post-endoscopic management. The second part consists of statements that were rejected after deliberations and debate among panel members. These latter statements point towards new management concepts or strategies, but they are not accepted as recommendations because of insufficient evidence in the existing literature.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^111NwZ4u]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains an important emergency condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. As endoscopic therapy is the 'gold standard' of management, treatment of these patients can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic treatment, endoscopic haemostasis and post-endoscopic management. Since publication of the Asia-Pacific consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) 7 years ago, there have been significant advancements in the clinical management of patients in all three stages. These include pre-endoscopy risk stratification scores, blood and platelet transfusion, use of proton pump inhibitors; during endoscopy new haemostasis techniques (haemostatic powder spray and over-the-scope clips); and post-endoscopy management by second-look endoscopy and medication strategies. Emerging techniques, including capsule endoscopy and Doppler endoscopic probe in assessing adequacy of endoscopic therapy, and the pre-emptive use of angiographic embolisation, are attracting new attention. An emerging problem is the increasing use of dual antiplatelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Guidelines on the discontinuation and then resumption of these agents in patients presenting with NVUGIB are very much needed. The Asia-Pacific Working Group examined recent evidence and recommends practical management guidelines in this updated consensus statement.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^116sczUY]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70–90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

Secondary prophylaxis after the rebleeding of GOV

The secondary prophylaxis time for cirrhosis after acute (esophageal or gastric) variceal bleeding was within 1 week (52.6%) or 1–4 weeks (47.4%) in developed countries and 1–4 weeks (63.9%) in developing countries. The timing of secondary prophylaxis did not significantly differ between endoscopists in developed and developing countries (χ² = 4.523, P = 0.104).

Most endoscopists chose medication and endoscopic therapy as the preferred secondary prophylactic measures in both developed (83.1%) and developing countries (77.8%). The measures for secondary prophylaxis did not significantly differ between endoscopists in developed and developing countries (χ² = 5.0749, P = 0.166; Table 5).

Table 5
Secondary prophylaxis after acute variceal bleeding

* Medication is oral beta blocker therapy

Basis for the selection of the above management preference

When they were asked about the factors influencing the selection of the above management measures, endoscopists in both developed and developing countries acknowledged the following as influencing factors: personal preference and experience, published medical evidence or literature, and national or local society guidelines. However, the influence of published medical evidence was more on endoscopists in developing countries than on those in developed countries. There was no significant difference in factors affecting endoscopists in developing and developed countries (P = 0.278; Table 6).

### Endoscopic screening for esophageal varices in cirrhosis: is it ever cost effective? [^112kLDuW]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the management of patients with compensated cirrhosis recommend universal screening endoscopy followed by prophylactic beta-blocker therapy to prevent initial hemorrhage in those found to have esophageal varices. However, the cost-effectiveness of this recommendation has not been established. Our objective was to determine whether screening endoscopy is cost-effective compared with empiric medical management in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Decision analysis with Markov modeling was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of 6 competing strategies: (1) universal screening endoscopy (EGD) followed by beta-blocker (BB) therapy (EGD→BB) if varices are present, (2) EGD followed by endoscopic band ligation (EBL) (EGD→EBL) if varices are present, (3) selective screening endoscopy (sEGD) in high risk patients followed by BB therapy if varices are present (sEGD→BB), (4) selective screening endoscopy followed by EBL (sEGD→EBL) if varices are present, (5) empiric beta-blocker therapy in all patients, and (6) no prophylactic therapy ("Do Nothing"). Cost estimates were from a third-party payer perspective. The main outcome measure was the cost per initial variceal hemorrhage prevented. The "Do Nothing" strategy was the least expensive yet least effective approach. Compared with the "Do Nothing" strategy, the empiric beta-blocker strategy cost an incremental $12,408 per additional variceal bleed prevented. Compared with the empiric beta-blocker strategy, in turn, both the EGD→BB and the EGD→EBL strategies cost over $175,000 more per additional bleed prevented. The sEGD→BB and sEGD→EBL strategies were more expensive and less effective than the empiric beta-blocker strategy. In conclusion, empiric beta-blocker therapy for the primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage is a cost-effective measure, as the use of screening endoscopy to guide therapy adds significant cost with only marginal increase in effectiveness.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^111X1ff8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of bleeding gastric varices (GV) presents a unique challenge for patients with portal hypertension. Despite over thirty years of diagnostic and treatment advances standardized practices for bleeding GV are lacking and unsupported by adequate evidence. There are no definitive natural history studies to help with risk assessment or prospective clinical trials to guide clinical decision making. Available literature on the natural history and management of gastric varices consists of case series, restricted cohort studies, and a few small randomized trials, all of which have significant selection biases. This review summarizes the available data and recommendations based on expert opinion on how best to diagnose and manage bleeding from gastric varices. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations.

Questionnaire

The items included in this questionnaire were determined by consultation and discussion with members of the collaborative group, comprising gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and endoscopists. The questionnaire (supplementary file) was divided into five parts as described below, with all parts except for the last one presented as single-choice questions.

The first part queried the following characteristics of the respondent, all questions are single choices: (1) Country of practice, (2) Participant's name, (3) Participant's e-mail address, (4) Years of independent gastroenterology /endoscopic experience, (5) practice settings, and (6) How many patients with gastric varices does the participant's institution treat in a year.

The second part of the questionnaire queried about the primary prophylactic given for the bleeding of GOV as follows: (1) In a patient with non-bleeding medium or large esophageal varices, how do you prevent bleeding? (2) In patients with non-bleeding large gastric varices, what do you do?

The third part queried the participants about the timing of the preferred endoscopic treatment for the bleeding of GOV as follows: (1) When do you perform endoscopy in a hemodynamically stable patient with fresh blood hematemesis and cirrhosis? (2) What is your preferred initial endoscopic therapy for active gastric cardia variceal bleeding? (3) What is your preferred initial endoscopic therapy for gastric fundic variceal bleeding?

The fourth part queried about secondary prophylactic measures for the bleeding of GOV in cirrhosis as follows: (1) When do you start measures to prevent rebleeding and secondary prophylaxis after acute (esophageal or gastric) variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis? (2) What is your preferred secondary prophylactic measure?

The fifth part queried the participants about their preferred endoscopic treatment: What is the basis for the selection of the above management preferences?

### Esophageal bleeding disorders [^114PJevh]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Management of esophageal bleeding disorder remains a challenging problem. This review focuses on studies published in previous 12 months that provided further understanding on the appropriate treatment of various esophageal bleeding disorders. Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding will also be discussed in this review.

Recent Findings

With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacological treatments, mortality of variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Apart from its major role in initial treatment of variceal bleeding, mounting evidence shows that band ligation is a safe alternative to beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis and may even be used as an adjunct to the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt to obviate the need of long-term surveillance. While vasoactive agents remain the most important pharmacological treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis is also increasingly recognized to play a role in prevention of variceal rebleeding. The benefit of beta-blocker has now been extended to halt the progression of esophageal varices and combination of beta-blocker and band ligation remains the most cost-effective treatment strategy for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Other new treatments such as endoloop and recombination factor VII have produced promising results. The clinical courses of variceal bleeding in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and acute necrotizing esophagitis are now better defined.

Summary

There are significant advances in the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding and further understanding on the management and clinical courses of various esophageal bleeding disorders.

### Ectopic varices: anatomical classification, hemodynamic classification, and hemodynamic-based management [^117S7evR]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices are dilated splanchnic (mesoportal) veins/varicosities and/or are dilated portosystemic collaterals that can occur along the entire gastrointestinal tract outside the common pathologic variceal sites. Ectopic varices are complex and highly variable entities that are not fully understood. Ectopic varices represent 2%-5% of a gastrointestinal tract variceal bleeding. However, ectopic varices have a 4-fold increased risk of bleeding when compared with esophageal varices and can have a mortality rate as high as 40%. All treatment strategies and techniques have been utilized in managing these potentially mortal varices and have shown poor outcomes. The debate of whether to manage these varices by decompression with a transjugular portosystemic shunt, or other portosystemic shunts, vs transvenous obliteration is unresolved. The rebleed rates after transjugular portosystemic shunt decompression are 20%-40%. The rebleed rates after transvenous obliteration and the mortality rate at 3–6 months are 30%-40% and 50%-60%, respectively. Hemodynamically from an etiology standpoint, there are 2 types: occlusive (type-b) and nonocclusive (oncotic or type-a). Hemodynamically from a vascular-shunting standpoint, there could be a component of portoportal or portosystemic shunting or both with varying dominance. This is the basis of the new classification system described herein. Management strategies (decompression vs sclerosis) are discussed. The ideal management strategy is a treatment that leads to prompt hemostasis but also addresses the etiology or hemodynamics of the ectopic varices. It is the hope that with better understanding, description, and categorization of ectopic varices comes a more systematic approach to this rare but menacing problem.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^1156XstK]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) — recurrent or refractory bleeding management is outlined as follows: In patients who rebled after endoscopic therapy, a second attempt at endoscopic hemostasis is typically advised, and in patients treated initially with thermal therapy who rebled, additional thermal therapy might be possible, or mechanical therapy with a clip could be applied; Hemospray should also be considered as rescue therapy. Prior endoscopic therapy can be suboptimal due to ulcer characteristics, the use of epinephrine injection monotherapy or single use of a hemostatic powder for a high-risk lesion, or if thermal or mechanical therapy did not adequately control bleeding for technical reasons. The main options in cases of endoscopic failure with rebleeding or refractory bleeding are transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and surgery; with high technical and clinical success rates, TAE has been shown to be equally effective, with trends toward lower 30-day mortality rates compared with surgical intervention, and studies of TAE have shown fewer complications than surgery, albeit with higher rebleeding rates. Embolization is most effective when active extravasation can be demonstrated, or if a site can be endoscopically prelocalized before empiric embolization; studies of embolization show that multiple or large duodenal ulcers, gastritis, coagulopathy, or multi-organ failure are believed to contribute to clinical failures, and the choice of embolic agent should also be taken into account as different agents influence rebleeding rate, risk of recanalization, and subsequent ischemic complications. An important point is that prophylactic TAE of high-risk ulcers after successful endoscopic therapy is not recommended; given patient complexity, the choice among repeat endoscopy, surgery, and TAE must be decided on a case-by-case basis, and for optimal clinical outcomes in refractory bleeding, a multidisciplinary approach is required involving gastrointestinal endoscopists, intensivists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and in some cases hematologists and/or oncologists.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 1–3 for NVUGIB: Endoscopic therapy should achieve hemostasis in the majority of patients with NVUGIB. Initial management of the patient with NVUGIB should focus on resuscitation, triage, and preparation for upper endoscopy, and after stabilization, patients with NVUGIB should undergo endoscopy with endoscopic treatment of sites with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata for rebleeding. Endoscopists should be familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of currently available tools and techniques for endoscopic hemostasis, and be comfortable applying conventional thermal therapy and placing hemoclips.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^111n7GtF]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — gastric and ectopic varices management: Initial management of bleeding gastric or ectopic varices should be identical to bleeding esophageal varices, including vasoactive therapy, antimicrobials, conservative transfusion strategy, and endoscopic evaluation within 12 hours. Patients with bleeding gastric or ectopic varices should have contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging to define anatomy of portosystemic collaterals or venous thrombosis. In patients who underwent ECI as the main therapy, the addition of NSBBs is recommended to prevent rebleeding, in absence of contraindications, and repeat endoscopic treatment at intervals every 2–4 weeks until obliteration with long-term surveillance should be performed. Patients with bleeding GV from isolated splenic vein thrombosis should be evaluated for splenectomy, splenic vein stenting, or splenic artery embolization.

### Challenges in the management of esophagogastric varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis – A narrative review [^1146QsMr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advancements in pharmacological, endoscopic, and radiographic treatments have emerged in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices or variceal hemorrhage. These advances have been in several areas, including the role of screening and primary prophylaxis (preventing an initial variceal bleed), evaluation and management of acute esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, and in preventing variceal rebleeding. Therefore, we believe there is a need for an updated, evidence-based "narrative review" on this important clinical topic that will be relevant for internists, hospitalists, intensive care unit physicians, and those in training. We believe the guidance presented in this narrative review will enhance daily medical practice of health care professionals and has the potential to improve quality of care for these complex patients.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^113x2oNu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage

Perioperative volume overload can increase portal pressure and precipitate bleeding from esophageal varices. Other possible contributing factors include postoperative hepatic dysfunction and portal venous thrombosis. Variceal hemorrhage represents a medical emergency to be managed in the intensive care unit.

Resuscitative measures to preserve the respiratory and circulatory systems should be promptly initiated. A restrictive transfusion strategy aiming at hemoglobin levels of 7–9 g/dl has been associated with decreased re-bleeding and mortality rates. Antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone for up to 7 days is indicated to address the increased risk of bacterial infections and also to decrease the risk of re-bleeding and mortality. Infusion of vasoactive agents (somatostatin, terlipressin, and octreotide) for 2 to 5 days has been associated with lower mortality and transfusion requirements.

An urgent endoscopy should be completed no longer than 12 h from presentation. Elastic band ligation represents the first-line endoscopic intervention for esophageal varices, but sclerotherapy is an excellent alternative for difficult cases. Elastic band ligation has proven more effective than sclerotherapy in terms of the number of required sessions, as well as re-bleeding and mortality rates. A non-specific beta-blocker (propranolol or nadolol) is indicated after the vasoactive infusion is discontinued.

Balloon tamponade is reserved for temporary control of ongoing variceal bleeding while definitive therapy is being arranged. TIPS should be considered pre-emptively in high-risk patients, or in refractory or recurrent hemorrhage, as improved mortality rates have been observed.

Table 3 summarizes current recommendations for the management of hemorrhage from esophageal varices.

Management of variceal hemorrhage

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Coagulation disorders of cirrhosis confer an increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage. As previously indicated, conventional coagulation tests do not reflect these risks, and an increased INR is not necessarily protective for thromboembolic events. Although detailed guidelines remain unavailable, thromboprophylaxis is recommended in most patients, and certainly in high-risk situations.

### Endoscopic treatment for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: a survey comparing between developed and developing countries [^117JvL3M]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention for the bleeding of GOV in cirrhosis

Among treatment options for non-bleeding medium-to-large esophageal varices, most endoscopists in developed countries chose oral beta-blocker therapy (50.9%), whereas most endoscopists in developing countries chose both endoscopic intervention and drug therapy (38.9%). The choice of treatment for non-hemorrhagic medium-to-large esophageal varices did not significantly differ between developed and developing countries (χ² = 5.153, P = 0.076).

For treating gastric varices, in developed countries, most endoscopists chose medicine to manage non-hemorrhagic large gastric varices (71.9%), and relatively fewer endoscopists chose prophylactic endoscopic treatment (14.0%) or follow-up (14.0%). Conversely, in developing countries, nearly half of endoscopists chose prophylactic endoscopic treatment (36.1%) or follow-up (19.4%). These findings suggest that compared with developing countries, in developed countries, endoscopists were significantly more likely to use medicine to manage non-hemorrhagic large gastric varices (χ² = 7.882, P = 0.019; Table 2).

### Portal hypertension and variceal bleeding in patients with liver cancer: evidence gaps for prevention and management [^114Ug2Pq]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Portal hypertension (PHT) and HCC are 2 major complications of cirrhosis that often coexist in the same patient and impact the prognosis, especially in patients with acute variceal bleeding. In this review, we aim to discuss the best strategy for PHT screening and primary prophylaxis, as well as the management of acute variceal bleeding, to improve the management of PHT in HCC patients.

Results

Recent therapeutic advances observed in the management of HCC, notably through the advent of immunotherapy, have led to a clear improvement in the survival of patients. The prevention of complications related to underlying cirrhosis, such as PHT and acute variceal bleeding, is now part of the management of HCC patients. The Baveno VII conference recently redefined screening and prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis. However, data regarding the applicability of these criteria in patients with HCC have been sparse. From our point of view, the Baveno criteria are not appropriate to exclude high-risk esophageal varices (EV) in HCC patients, and endoscopy should be performed except in HCC patients with a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 25 kPa, who should benefit from nonselective beta-blockers (NSSBs) without performing endoscopy. We are also in favor of using NSBBs as primary prophylaxis in patients with EV regardless of the size and with gastric varices since these patients display clinically significant PHT.

Conclusions

Appropriate evaluation and treatment of PHT remain major issues in improving the outcomes of HCC patients. Many questions remain unanswered, opening the field to many areas of research.

### Management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1112pdab]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common medical emergency, with a reported mortality of 2–10%. Patients identified as being at very low risk of either needing an intervention or death can be managed as outpatients. For all other patients, intravenous fluids as needed for resuscitation and red cell transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 70–80 g/L are recommended. After resuscitation is initiated, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the prokinetic agent erythromycin may be administered, with antibiotics and vasoactive drugs recommended in patients who have cirrhosis. Endoscopy should be undertaken within 24 hours, with earlier endoscopy considered after resuscitation in patients at high risk, such as those with hemodynamic instability. Endoscopic treatment is used for variceal bleeding (for example, ligation for esophageal varices and tissue glue for gastric varices) and for high risk non-variceal bleeding (for example, injection, thermal probes, or clips for lesions with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel). Patients who require endoscopic therapy for ulcer bleeding should receive high dose proton pump inhibitors after endoscopy, whereas those who have variceal bleeding should continue taking antibiotics and vasoactive drugs. Recurrent ulcer bleeding is treated with repeat endoscopic therapy, with subsequent bleeding managed by interventional radiology or surgery. Recurrent variceal bleeding is generally treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In patients who require antithrombotic agents, outcomes appear to be better when these drugs are reintroduced early.

There is a paucity of consensus among endoscopists in both developing and developed countries regarding the preferred initial endoscopic therapy for non-bleeding medium-to-large esophageal varices, active gastric cardia variceal bleeding, and gastric fundic variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Similarly, there is considerable variation in the time of secondary prophylaxis after acute (esophageal or gastric) variceal bleeding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The findings of this study indicate that the medical burden and prognosis of patients with cirrhotic gastroesophageal varices vary between developing and developed countries. Further high-quality clinical research is required to identify more appropriate treatments for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. In addition, it is of paramount importance to provide continuing education and training for endoscopists.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^111bSgeR]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^115QNDuE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Active bleeding from a varix.
Stigmata of recent bleeding (white nipple or clot on a varix).
If there is no other source of bleeding and nonbleeding varices are identified:

(a) If after EGD with EVL the bleeding is controlled, IV vasoactive agents should be continued for 2–5 days and upon their discontinuation the patient should be started on NSBB, titrated to HR 55–60 and SBP > 90 mmHg. Once IV vasoactive agents are discontinued, IV prophylactic antibiotic can also be discontinued.
(b) If during EGD the bleeding cannot be controlled, a self-expandable metal stent or a balloon tamponade can be used as a bridge to rescue TIPS. Self-expandable esophageal stents have greater efficacy and less complications than balloon tamponade and can remain in place longer than balloon tamponade (7 days versus 24 h).
(c) If after EGD with EVL the patient has a recurrent VH while still hospitalized, a rescue TIPS should be performed. Patients that are at a higher risk for 5-day failure (rebleeding or death) and who would therefore require a rescue TIPS are those in CTP-C. However, rescue TIPS in these patients is associated with a high mortality.
(d) A preemptive TIPS (pTIPS), that is, a TIPS placed before the patient rebleeds ('fails') and requires a rescue TIPS has been shown to be associated with an improved survival in a select group of patients at a high risk of failure. The definition of these patients is still fluid. An initial randomized trial in mostly alcohol- and HCV-associated cirrhosis, showed pTIPS done within 72 h of admission, in patients with CTP-C (10–13 pts) and CTP-B with active bleeding during endoscopy had a 25% absolute risk reduction in mortalityA subsequent RCT and a recent meta-analysis also supported the survival benefit of pTIPS in patients CTP-C (10–13 pts) and in patients CTP-B > 7 who were actively bleeding at endoscopy. As such, risk stratification using CTP score is very important as it will affect the therapeutic decisions. A limitation overall from all pTIPS studies has been the need to place TIPS within 72 h of admission, which is complicated in many centers and the exclusion of an important proportion of patients commonly seen in the clinical setting including those older than 70–75 years, with heart failure, CTP-C (14–15 pts) creatinine above 2.5 mg/dl, hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan among other exclusion criteria.

Chronic hepatitis C after sustained virologic response (SVR) — esophageal varices risk and proposed variceal bleeding management: A cohort of 444 patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis was divided into 218 with stage 1 and 226 with stage 2, with a median follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 1–12.6 years); in stage 1, SVR was associated with fewer new varices (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11–0.48; P < .001), whereas in stage 2, SVR was not associated with fewer further varices (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03). Based on the available literature, a proposed practical approach is: no varices — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years and no further screening if negative; small varices, no treatment — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years with further actions as stated; prior primary prophylaxis with β-blockers and/or band ligation — repeat after 6–12 months and repeat after 1–2 years once low risk; decompensated or prior bleeding — close surveillance and/or treatment as already instituted. Although updated Baveno VI guidance supports risk stratification using a TE cutoff of < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150,000/μL to identify patients at low risk who may not require screening endoscopy, in post-SVR populations such data are not yet available and application of these cutoffs should be approached with caution and on an individual-patient basis.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114mBeic]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — risk stratification scores: The Glasgow-Blatchford score ranges from 0–23, and patients with a score of 0 or 1 can be managed as an outpatient. The Rockall score requires endoscopic evaluation to determine the full score. The AIMS-65 includes Systolic BP (< 100 mm Hg), INR (> 1.5), and Age (> 65 years), and reports AIMS-65 score (% inpatient mortality): 0 (0.3%), 1 (3.2%), 2 (5.3%), 3 (10.3%), 4 (16.5%), 5 (24.5%). These risk assessment scores cannot precisely identify individual high-risk patients who will die from gastrointestinal bleeding if they do not receive an intervention, but may have a clinical role in identifying patients who are at very low risk for mortality and may be amenable to outpatient medical care/endoscopy.

### Endoscopic hemostasis in acute esophageal variceal bleeding [^117UmmaX]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is a milestone event for patients with portal hypertension. Esophageal varices bleed because of an increase in portal pressure that causes the variceal wall to rupture. AVB in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The initial management of these patients includes proper resuscitation, antibiotic prophylaxis, pharmacologic therapy with vasoconstrictors, and endoscopic therapy. Intravascular fluid management, timing of endoscopy, and endoscopic technique are key in managing these patients. This article reviews the current endoscopic hemostatic strategies for patients with AVB.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^112h9f9o]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Esophageal varices screening and management in adults and children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are addressed as follows: The CFF recommends that adults with CF and advanced liver disease with esophageal varices be managed according to the relevant most current published guidelines, such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases or the Baveno group. In adults with compensated cirrhosis, the initial screening endoscopy may be deferred if the platelet count is ≥ 150,000 and the liver stiffness, as measured by TE, is ≤ 20 kPa, with endoscopic surveillance initiated once thresholds are crossed and performed every 1–2 years thereafter. The CFF cannot provide a recommendation for or against endoscopic variceal surveillance in children with advanced liver disease due to insufficient evidence. Contextual data report that in a CFF registry review from 2003 to 2012 the mean age was 18.1 years, 3.6% were documented to have cirrhosis, the 10-year cumulative risk for variceal bleed was 6.6%, and the mean age of first variceal bleed was 18.8 years (range 0.89–45.14).

### Management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatments [^1113r6AJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

EUS-guided treatments are gaining popularity in the diagnostic and therapeutic fields. Thanks to its capacity to offer direct access to targeted lesions that are difficult to explore, treat lesions under visualizing guidance, detect the specific blood flow, and check the therapeutic effectiveness, EUS-guided therapies have been proved to be powerful tool in the treatment of various conditions. As mentioned in this review, EUS-guided treatment is a technique with promising therapeutic potential for NVUGIB, especially in cases where standard endoscopic treatments failed, as it has shown effectiveness with high safety profile in most cases. Meanwhile, concerns regarding the role of EUS-guided hemostasis for both variceal and non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding still exist, especially in case of active bleeding at the time of the treatment. Overall, we believe the application of EUS-guided therapies in NVUGIB will expand with the further development of EUS technology. However, the literature regarding this field is scarce and limits to case report and case series. Large randomized clinical controlled trials seem to be warranted.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^112CUxdB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Gastric variceal (GV) bleeding — initial endoscopic evaluation should confirm bleeding source and attempt classification of variceal bleeding site. Preprocedural administration of a promotility agent and utilization of a therapeutic endoscope or advanced suctioning device are advised because intragastric blood frequently obscures the cardia or fundus and underlying GV. Once the fundus is clear and GV identified, a standard classification system should be applied, and it is important to fully classify the presence of esophageal varices (EV) at endoscopy because definitive therapies for bleeding GV vary in their effect on subsequent EV bleeding risk. Initial therapy for bleeding GV should focus on acute hemostasis for hemodynamic stabilization with a plan for further diagnostic evaluation or transfer to a center with expertise in GV management, recognizing that temporizing measures are often not definitive and that endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection (ECI) or endovascular treatments are often not feasible in the acute diagnostic setting.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^112Rs5po]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and best practice advice statements regarding the use of endoscopic therapies in treating patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 10 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. This expert review also reflects the experiences of the authors who are gastroenterologists with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to treat patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Endoscopic therapy should achieve hemostasis in the majority of patients with NVUGIB. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Initial management of the patient with NVUGIB should focus on resuscitation, triage, and preparation for upper endoscopy. After stabilization, patients with NVUGIB should undergo endoscopy with endoscopic treatment of sites with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata for rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Endoscopists should be familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of currently available tools and techniques for endoscopic hemostasis, and be comfortable applying conventional thermal therapy and placing hemoclips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Monopolar hemostatic forceps with low-voltage coagulation can be an effective alternative to other mechanical and thermal treatments for NVUGIB, particularly for ulcers in difficult locations or those with a rigid and fibrotic base. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Hemostasis using an over-the-scope clip should be considered in select patients with NVUGIB, in whom conventional electrosurgical coagulation and hemostatic clips are unsuccessful or predicted to be ineffective. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Hemostatic powders are a noncontact endoscopic option that may be considered in cases of massive bleeding with poor visualization, for salvage therapy, and for diffuse bleeding from malignancy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Hemostatic powder should be preferentially used as a rescue therapy and not for primary hemostasis, except in cases of malignant bleeding or massive bleeding with inability to perform thermal therapy or hemoclip placement. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopists should understand the risk of bleeding from therapeutic endoscopic interventions (eg, endoluminal resection and endoscopic sphincterotomy) and be familiar with the endoscopic tools and techniques to treat intraprocedural bleeding and minimize the risk of delayed bleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In patients with endoscopically refractory NVUGIB, the etiology of bleeding (peptic ulcer disease, unknown source, post surgical); patient factors (hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, multi-organ failure, surgical history); risk of rebleeding; and potential adverse events should be taken into consideration when deciding on a case-by-case basis between transcatheter arterial embolization and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Prophylactic transcatheter arterial embolization of high-risk ulcers after successful endoscopic therapy is not encouraged.

### Cost-effectiveness of screening, surveillance, and primary prophylaxis strategies for esophageal varices [^113WotvB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for varices is recommended in patients with cirrhosis to institute primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding. Our aim was to compare the cost-effectiveness of four strategies, including no screening/no prophylaxis, universal screening and primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers, universal screening and primary prophylaxis with variceal ligation, and universal institution of primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers without screening.

Methods

We constructed a Markov simulation model in two hypothetical cohorts of 50-yr-old patients with cirrhosis (one compensated and one decompensated), who were followed for 5 yr. Transition probabilities were derived from the medical literature, and costs reflected Medicare reimbursement rates at our institution.

Results

In patients with compensated cirrhosis, screening and primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers is associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3605 per year of life saved. The results were most sensitive to the prevalence of varices and risk of variceal bleeding. In patients with decompensated liver disease, primary prophylaxis without screening was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1154 per year of life saved. The results were most sensitive to the cost of beta-blockers and endoscopy.

Conclusions

Screening for varices is an affordable strategy in compensated liver disease, whereas universal primary prophylaxis with beta-blockers is cost-effective in decompensated patients.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114VTWJz]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept — agreement: 100%, level of evidence: moderate)

The timing of endoscopy in patients with NVUGIB is a matter of debate. The previous Asia-Pacific Working Group consensus recommended 'endoscopic intervention within 24 hours of onset of bleeding in patients at high risk". A systematic review concluded that endoscopy within 12 hours did not improve clinical outcome. It has also been pointed out that in patients at very high risk who are haemodynamically unstable and in patients presenting with massive haematemesis, endoscopy should be performed as soon as they are stabilised with resuscitation.

Several studies examined the role of urgent endoscopy (within 12 hours) in the management of NVUGIB. In a retrospective cohort of 361 patients, it was found that patients who underwent urgent endoscopy had a greater than fivefold increased risk of adverse outcome (death, inpatient rebleeding, surgery or radiological intervention or repeated endoscopic therapy). In a subgroup analysis from this study, time to endoscopy was not significant as a predictor of worse outcome, hence less prognostic in the high-risk patients than in lower-risk patients. A nationwide cohort study included 12 601 patients with peptic ulcer disease. It suggested that patients with haemodynamic instability or American Society of Anesthesiology score of 3–5 had reduced in-hospital mortality if receiving endoscopy within 6–24 hours after admission. However, the exact timing within 24 hours is still not clear. A nationwide survey from the UK included 4478 patients. It showed that earlier endoscopy (< 12 hours) was not associated with a lower mortality, or need for surgery, compared with endoscopy offered within 24 hours.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varies, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of the underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in noncirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^11748oRz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search to identify the peer-reviewed original and review articles using keywords of EUS, NVUGIB, and hemostasis. The references of pertinent studies were manually searched to identify additional relevant studies. A total of 20 articles were found, including 15 case reports and 5 case series. – The identifications of patients (including type of lesion, type of bleeding, and previous treatments), details of procedures (including specific type of treatment, type of needle), and main outcomes (including technical and clinical outcomes, and complications) for each study were reviewed. A total of 44 patients were induced and divided into different classifications according to the treatments.

### Management options for gastric variceal hemorrhage [^116juxJt]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Varices are one of the main clinical manifestations of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Gastric varices are less common than esophageal varices but are often associated with poorer prognosis, mainly because of their higher propensity to bleed.

Observations

Currently, treatments used to control and manage gastric variceal bleeding include β-blockers, endoscopic injection sclerotherapy, endoscopic variceal ligation, endoscopic variceal obturation, shunt surgery, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), and modified BRTO. In the past few decades, Western (United States and Europe) interventional radiologists have preferred transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts that aim to decompress the liver and reduce portal pressure. Conversely, Eastern radiologists (Japan and South Korea) have preferred BRTO that directly targets the gastric varices. Over the past 20 years, BRTO has evolved and procedure-related risks have decreased. Owing to its safety and efficiency in treating gastric varices, BRTO is now starting to gain popularity among Western interventional radiologists. In this review, we present a comprehensive literature review of current and emerging management options, including BRTO and modified BRTO, for the treatment of gastric varices in the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

Conclusions and Relevance

Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration has emerged as a safe and effective alternative treatment option for gastric variceal hemorrhage. A proper training, evidence-based consensus and guideline, thorough preprocedural and postprocedural evaluation, and a multidisciplinary team approach with BRTO and modified BRTO are strongly recommended to ensure best patient care.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^113t32Zc]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^111Ki1fQ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Gastric varices (GV) epidemiology and bleeding risk in portal hypertension (pHTN) show that the prevalence of GV is estimated between 17% and 25% in patients with pHTN, whereas esophageal varices (EV) are present in up to 65%. GV bleeding is often more severe, with an incidence of 16%–45% at 3 years and associated with higher mortality, and similar rates of bleeding and mortality from GV are reported for patients with noncirrhotic compared with cirrhotic pHTN.

### Management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatments [^113cZGAE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

EUS has rapidly expanded from diagnostic modality to therapeutic technique in different directions because the emerging new accessories have broadened the use in recent years. It offers access to arterial and venous vasculature of abdomen and mediastinum with real-time image, which makes it possible to perform targeted therapeutic procedures to abnormal vessels. Besides, Doppler ultrasound (US) endoscope can be used to detect the arterial blood flow and predict the risk of recurrent bleeding before and after hemostasis procedures. We notice that EUS has been great application and has positive clinical impact on the treatment of gastroesophageal varices.

Nevertheless, researches about EUS-guided treatment in NVUGIB remain scarce, and the role in this direction still lacks the support of clinical comparative research, especially in cases of refractory gastrointestinal bleeding. This article aims to summarize current literature regarding EUS-guided interventions in NVUGIB as well as to discuss the specific procedures, the effectiveness, and possible clinical outcomes of EUS-guided management.

### Band ligation versus no intervention for primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices [^111uAdHy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The presence of oesophageal varices is associated with the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic variceal ligation is used to prevent this occurrence but the ligation procedure may be associated with complications.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of band ligation versus no intervention for primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices.

Search Methods

We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 9 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing band ligation verus no intervention regardless of publication status, blinding, or language in the analyses of benefits and harms, and observational studies in the assessment of harms. Included participants had cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no previous history of variceal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors extracted data independently. The primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and I² values as a marker of heterogeneity. In addition, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTTB) for the primary outcomes. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains; determined the certainty of the evidence using GRADE; and conducted sensitivity analyses including Trial Sequential Analysis.

Main Results

Six randomised clinical trials involving 637 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One of the trials included an additional small number of participants (< 10% of the total) with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension/portal vein block. We classified one trial as at low risk of bias for the outcome, mortality and high risk of bias for the remaining outcomes; the five remaining trials were at high risk of bias for all outcomes. We downgraded the evidence to moderate certainty due to the bias risk. We gathered data on all primary outcomes from all trials. Seventy-one of 320 participants allocated to band ligation compared to 129 of 317 participants allocated to no intervention died (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70; I² = 0%; NNTTB = 6 persons). In addition, band ligation was associated with reduced risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.72; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 61%; NNTTB = 5 persons), serious adverse events (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 44%; NNTTB = 4 persons), and variceal bleeding (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.69; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 56%; NNTTB = 5 persons). The non-serious adverse events reported in association with band ligation included oesophageal ulceration, dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal and throat pain, heartburn, and fever, and in the one trial involving participants with either small or large varices, the incidence of non-serious side effects in the banding group was much higher in those with small varices, namely ulcers: small versus large varices 30.5% versus 8.7%; heartburn 39.2% versus 17.4%. No trials reported on health-related quality of life. Two trials did not receive support from pharmaceutical companies; the remaining four trials did not provide information on this issue.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found moderate-certainty evidence that, in patients with cirrhosis, band ligation of oesophageal varices reduces mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal bleeding, and serious adverse events compared to no intervention. It is unlikely that further trials of band ligation versus no intervention would be considered ethical.

### Diagnostic model of esophageal varices in alcoholic liver disease [^115bvHWt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices may cause life-threatening bleeding with attendant high hospital cost. Since effective preventive modalities for variceal hemorrhage have been established, early detection of esophageal varices is critical for prevention of bleeding. Currently, endoscopic screening is widely recommended to patients who have the diagnosis of cirrhosis. However, the diagnosis of cirrhosis relies on histological evaluations, which is costly and invasive, and endoscopic screening also burdens medical resources. Recent cost-effectiveness studies suggested that empiric prophylaxis with beta-blockers may be viable in comparison with endoscopic screening in patients with cirrhosis. However, this issue need to be also evaluated taking account of societal and patient perspectives and is not yet decided. An accurate non-invasive diagnostic model to predict the presence of esophageal varices may reduce unnecessary endoscopic procedures and prophylactic medication and improve cost-benefit of these approaches. Use of an accurate serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may also improve accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic models. Hyaluronic acid, a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis, has been reported to have a high diagnostic performance in assessing the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In this issue, a non-invasive diagnostic model including hyaluronic acid was shown to have excellent performance in excluding the presence of medium to large esophageal varices in severe alcohol abusers. Based on current evidence, the strategy of using a non-invasive diagnostic model together with a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may improve cost-benefit in the prevention of variceal hemorrhage among patients with alcoholic liver disease. The independent verification of such diagnostic models is needed.

### Varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a new view of an old problem [^1129v9fH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of portal hypertension in cirrhosis has evolved over time, leading to improvements in the care and survival of patients with varices and variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients who achieve a significant reduction in portal pressure. In addition to better treatment strategies and improved therapeutic options, the issue of risk stratification has become essential to identify different patient subpopulations that require a different treatment. We now recognize that the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage must be taken in the context of other complications of cirrhosis (ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice) and that the goals of therapy should be based on the presence of such complications. Evolving knowledge of the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms at each of the stages of cirrhosis also has evolved and will continue to lead to improvements in therapy. This review focuses on the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage with respect to refinements in the risk stratification of patients with cirrhosis.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114utSLf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Esophageal varices (EV) are found in approximately 30% of patients with cirrhosis at the time of first diagnosis. EV bleeding is a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension, responsible for almost 80% of all bleeding episodes in patients with cirrhosis. The annual rate of variceal hemorrhage ranges from 5–15%, depending on the presence of several risk factors. In addition, variceal rebleeding occurs at a rate of 63% within a time frame of 1–2 years. Despite the improvement in management procedures, EV hemorrhage still accounts for high mortality rates.

Guidelines support the use of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) such as propranolol or nadolol for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Carvedilol is a potent beta-blocker, with mild anti-alpha 1 adrenergic activity that causes downregulation of intrahepatic resistance and an additional decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), that has been used for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage. Evidence suggests that only 40% of patients treated with NSBBs reach appropriate HVPG levels. The use of carvedilol has been associated with hemodynamic regulation in 56% of propranolol non-responders. However, the efficacy of carvedilol compared with standard-of-care approaches remains to be demonstrated. To provide a thorough summary of existing evidence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of carvedilol for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^111MnRzs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, in the recent Baveno portal hypertension consensus conference, the recommendation was to consider the use of NSBB in patients with compensated cirrhosis and evidence of CSPH with the purpose of preventing cirrhosis decompensation (i.e. not only VH but also ascites). This paradigm shift was mostly based on the results of the PREDESCI trial, a multicenter randomized trial studying the effect of NSBB in preventing decompensation of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. In the study, 201 patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with none or small varices, were randomized to NSBB (propranolol 40–160 mg twice a day or carvedilol 6.25–25 mg daily) versus placebo. The results showed that the primary outcome, which was any decompensation (ascites, VH, hepatic encephalopathy) or death, was significantly lower in the NSBB group compared with the placebo group (17% versus 27%, HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–0.97). The difference was mostly driven by ascites, which is usually the first and most common decompensation to occur. Progression to large varices (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.30–1.21) was also lower in the NSBB group. In addition, carvedilol seemed to outperform propranolol with lower rates of ascites, death, and greater reduction in HVPG. The new paradigm would aim at using NSBB to prevent any decompensation rather than only VH and therefore patients who would benefit from carvedilol would be not only those with high-risk varices but also those with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH, which are at the highest risk of developing any decompensation.

In compensated patients who cannot receive NSBB, EGD should be performed and, in the presence of high-risk varices, EVL would be performed to prevent variceal hemorrhage (Figure 2).

### Shunt as an effective alternative for esophageal varices… [^116QBzvB]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Treatment options for acute or recurrent hemorrhage secondary to esophageal varices now include the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. TIPS provides physicians with a treatment option other than surgery during acute bleeding episodes. Sahagun and associates observed 100 consecutive patients who had TIPS performed for acute or recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage, and who were refractory to medical management and had advanced liver disease. Patients were studied prospectively after the TIPS procedure to evaluate recurrent hemorrhages, survival rates, indicators for hepatic decompensation, short- and long-term shunt patency and complications. Study results showed that the procedure did reduce portal pressures. Ten complications, including pulmonary edema, hepatic arterial injury and sepsis, and one death associated with the procedure were reported. The cumulative survival rate was 85 percent at 30 days, 71 percent at one year and 54 percent at two years.

Recurrent hemorrhage occurred in 20 percent of patients at one year and in 25 percent at two years. Clinical parameters demonstrated an improvement in the patients with ascites, but hepatic encephalopathy also increased. Forty-seven percent of the patients needed intervention during the study to maintain shunt patency. The authors conclude that TIPS provides an alternative procedure in patients with acute or recurrent esophageal varices and avoids the risks associated with surgical intervention. If performed appropriately, TIPS can reduce the risk of hemorrhage from varices while having no impact on the patient's eligibility for liver transplant.

### Ligation or propranolol for esophageal varices?… [^113SwSG4]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices often spontaneously bleed; this condition is associated with mortality rates of 30 to 70 percent. Consequently, various therapies have been used to treat patients with bleeding from hepatic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. The most effective medical therapy is use of a nonselective beta blocker, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of first bleeding episodes and bleeding-related mortality. However, side effects often limit the use of these drugs. More aggressive therapies include endoscopic sclerotherapy and variceal ligation. Because of conflicting results in some studies, sclerotherapy is no longer recommended. Sarin and colleagues performed a prospective randomized trial that compared the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ligation and propranolol therapy in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. Treatment was stopped if the heart rate dropped below 55 beats per minute or if the systolic blood pressure was less than 80 mm Hg.

Patients assigned to the ligation group underwent ligation at the first endoscopy session or within 24 hours, with as many bands as possible placed in the distal 5 to 7 cm of all variceal columns. Endoscopic ligation was performed weekly until varices were obliterated or reduced to grade 1 size. After ligation was complete, patients underwent endoscopy monthly for three months, then once every three months until the 18-month end point. Any varices that recurred and became grade 2 or more were treated with repeat ligation. During the study period, four patients in the ligation group and 12 patients in the medication group experienced variceal bleeding. In three of the four patients from the ligation group, the bleeding occurred within the first six weeks, before all of the varices could be eradicated. After 18 months of follow-up, the cumulative risk of bleeding was 43 percent in the propanolol group and 15 percent in the ligation group.

The authors conclude that in patients with significant grade 3 or grade 4 esophageal varices, rubber band ligation is superior to propranolol therapy in preventing primary bleeding. They suggest further study to evaluate the combination of these two therapies in hopes of achieving even better results.

### Esophagogastric varices without hepatic cirrhosis… [^115RgiUV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis of the liver is the most common cause of portal venous congestion, congestive splenomegaly, and bleeding from esophagogastric varices. In some cases, however, portal venous congestion and its sequelae occur although the liver is not cirrhotic and even though the usual tests of hepatic function give normal findings. In the majority of cases without hepatic cirrhosis, some obstruction in the extrahepatic part of the portal venous system can be demonstrated by portal venography. The descriptive term, "extrahepatic portal obstruction, " is often applied to this group of lesions in contradistinction to the term, "intrahepatic portal obstruction, " which describes the results of the several types of cirrhosis of the liver. There remain a few patients with portal venous congestion who have neither cirrhosis of the liver nor demonstrable obstruction in the extrahepatic portion of the portal venous system. The cause of portal congestion in these cases is not clear. Intrahepatic portal.
