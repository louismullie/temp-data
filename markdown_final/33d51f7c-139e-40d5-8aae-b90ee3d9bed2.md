## Question

For a 66-year-old with two prior Pap smears at ages 59 and 63, is any further Pap testing necessary?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any further Pap testing is necessary for a 66-year-old who has had two prior Pap smears at ages 59 and 63, and what the guideline-concordant next step should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal "exit" criteria for stopping screening after age 65. Then, I should verify whether her documented history satisfies those criteria, including both the number and timing of negative tests. Next, I will consider risk implications of incomplete prior screening and the ASCCP risk thresholds that inform management if results are abnormal. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, guideline-based recommendation for immediate action and counseling points, ensuring I verify assumptions like presence of the cervix and average-risk status.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and assumptions: she is 66 years old, average risk, with two prior negative cytology-only screens (ages 59 and 63), no documented HPV testing, and no reported history of CIN2+ or hysterectomy — although I need to check and explicitly confirm both the absence of prior CIN2+ within 25 years and that a cervix is present because these materially change recommendations for stopping screening and whether screening is indicated at all after hysterectomy for benign disease [^112SZ5vg] [^115bRwwh].

> Next, I should review the exit criteria across major guidelines so I don't miss any nuances. The USPSTF advises no screening after age 65 if there has been "adequate prior screening", defined as either 3 consecutive negative cytology results, or 2 consecutive negative cotests, or 2 consecutive negative primary hrHPV tests, all within the previous 10 years, with the most recent test within 5 years [^112SZ5vg] [^1138eCs9]. ACP best practice statements align with stopping after age 65 when a woman has either 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cotests within 10 years, with the most recent within 5 years [^114DpxFj]. ACS similarly recommends stopping at 65 if there is no CIN2+ in the prior 25 years and adequate documented negative screening in the prior 10 years, most recent within 5 years, preferably using HPV-based strategies [^112SZ5vg].

> Now, I will examine her record against those criteria. She has only two documented cytology results (ages 59 and 63), so she does not meet the "3 negative cytology" pathway; she has no HPV tests, so she cannot meet the "2 negative cotests" or "2 negative primary HPV" pathways; her most recent test was at 63, so the timing requirement of "most recent within 5 years" is satisfied, but the quantity requirement is not — so she does not meet any guideline's definition of adequate prior screening and should not stop at 65 based on the information available [^113Zbh6p] [^114DpxFj] [^112SZ5vg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering risk context. Women with incomplete screening histories from ages 50–64 have higher subsequent cervical cancer risk compared with those with regular screening, and a single screen at 60–64 reduces risk but does not confer the low-risk profile of consistently screened peers; this supports completing an "exit" protocol rather than stopping now [^112ECPAt]. I should also anchor management to the ASCCP risk-based framework: routine 5-year return is appropriate only when the estimated 5-year CIN3+ risk is at or below the HPV-based threshold, and 3-year return aligns with the cytology-based 5-year CIN3+ risk threshold of approximately 0.55% after a negative cytology; without the required sequence of negatives, I cannot assume her risk is below those thresholds [^112MKveH] [^114vBr6p].

> Let me think about the most efficient, guideline-concordant way to complete exit screening now. My first instinct is to say: Option 1, do primary HPV testing now at age 66; if negative, she would meet the "2 consecutive negative HPV tests" criterion and could stop — Wait, let me verify that because it sounds too quick. On re-check, a single negative primary HPV test now would be only one, not two; she would still lack the second consecutive negative HPV test required within 10 years, so she would not meet exit criteria with just one negative HPV result now [^113Zbh6p] [^112SZ5vg]. I should correct that: the fastest path to meet exit criteria immediately is cytology alone now; if negative, she will have three consecutive negative cytology results within 10 years (59, 63, 66) with the most recent within 5 years, fulfilling ACP/USPSTF/ACS criteria to discontinue screening at this time, provided no history of CIN2+ in the last 25 years and no other high-risk conditions [^114DpxFj] [^113Zbh6p] [^112SZ5vg].

> That said, I should also consider the test performance trade-offs in a postmenopausal patient. HPV-based testing is more sensitive than cytology and detects more CIN2+/CIN3+ at the exit round, though it may prompt more colposcopies; however, even a negative cotest or primary HPV test now would not by itself satisfy the "two consecutive negative HPV-based tests" exit pathway given her lack of prior HPV-based testing, so HPV-based testing now would generally oblige an additional HPV-based negative in the future to stop, which delays exit unnecessarily compared with a single cytology now that completes the three-cytology pathway [^116eJSNY] [^114WG6ab] [^112SZ5vg].

> I need to ensure we have a clear abnormal-results plan because a positive result changes everything. If her next test is abnormal, management should follow the 2019 ASCCP risk-based guidelines (equal management for equal risk), which apply to patients over 65 as well; thresholds for colposcopy, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year surveillance are determined by her immediate and 5-year CIN3+ risks using current results plus history, and older patients who do not meet exit criteria should continue age-appropriate management so long as health status and feasibility permit [^114vBr6p] [^111REEQ3].

> But wait, what about implementation challenges and common pitfalls? Many women do not have adequate prior screening by age 65, and de-implementation has been slow and uneven; therefore, I should double-check her records across health systems before assuming tests are missing, and if documentation remains incomplete, proceed to complete exit screening rather than stopping by age alone [^114MKiey] [^115DDG3d]. Counseling should clarify that "stop at 65" is contingent on documented adequate prior negatives and absence of CIN2+, aligning with USPSTF and ACS positions [^1138eCs9] [^112SZ5vg].

> Final recommendation: I should confirm she still has a cervix and no history of CIN2+ in the last 25 years; assuming average risk and presence of the cervix, she does not meet exit criteria today, so she should be screened now. To complete exit most efficiently, obtain cytology alone now; if negative, she will have three consecutive negative cytology results within 10 years with the most recent within 5 years, and screening can be safely discontinued thereafter; if HPV-based testing is chosen instead, be explicit that a single negative HPV-based test will not meet the "two consecutive negatives" requirement and will generally necessitate another HPV-based negative later before stopping; any abnormal result should be managed per 2019 ASCCP risk-based guidelines [^114DpxFj] [^1138eCs9] [^112SZ5vg] [^114vBr6p] [^115bRwwh].

No, a 66-year-old woman with only two prior Pap smears at ages 59 and 63 **does not meet criteria to stop screening** [^1138eCs9]. She needs **one more Pap** to reach the minimum of three consecutive negative cytology results or two negative cotests within 10 years, with the most recent within 5 years [^112SZ5vg] [^114DpxFj]. If the next test is negative, she can then stop screening; if abnormal, manage per guidelines [^111REEQ3].

---

## Current cervical cancer screening guidelines

The USPSTF [^1138eCs9] and ACS [^114z1TnQ] recommend stopping screening at age 65 only with **adequate prior screening** and no history of CIN2+ in the past 25 years. Adequate prior screening is either **three consecutive negative cytology results** or **two consecutive negative cotests** (cytology plus HPV) within the past 10 years, with the most recent within 5 years [^114DpxFj] [^113Zbh6p]. If these criteria are not met, **screening should continue** until they are fulfilled [^1138eCs9].

---

## Application to the patient scenario

The patient has had only two Pap smears at ages 59 and 63, which **does not meet the minimum requirement** of three consecutive negative cytology results or two negative cotests within the past 10 years; therefore, she is not yet eligible to discontinue cervical cancer screening [^112SZ5vg].

---

## Recommended next steps

Given her screening history, **the following steps are recommended**:

- **Perform one additional Pap smear** (cytology alone or cotesting with HPV) to meet the minimum screening criteria [^114DpxFj].
- **If the next screening result is negative**, she may then discontinue screening according to current guidelines [^1138eCs9].
- **If the next screening result is abnormal**, follow appropriate management guidelines based on the specific abnormality detected [^114vBr6p].

---

## Risks associated with inadequate screening

Inadequate screening **increases the risk of cervical cancer**, particularly in older women [^115XdjRQ]; those aged 65 and older who have not been adequately screened have a higher risk than women who have been regularly screened [^111vj25e]. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that patients meet the minimum screening criteria before discontinuing screening.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

A 66-year-old woman with only two prior Pap smears at ages 59 and 63 does not meet criteria to discontinue cervical cancer screening. She **should have one additional Pap smear** to meet minimum screening requirements. If the next result is negative, she may then discontinue screening according to current guidelines; if abnormal, appropriate follow-up and management should be initiated.

### Risk of cervical cancer associated with extending the interval between cervical-cancer screenings [^117Hgs7u]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Although contemporary guidelines suggest that the intervals between Papanicolaou tests can be extended to three years among low-risk women with previous negative tests, the excess risk of cervical cancer associated with less frequent than annual screening is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We determined the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia among 938,576 women younger than 65 years of age, stratified according to the number of previous consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests. Using a Markov model that estimates the rate at which dysplasia will progress to cancer, we estimated the risk of cancer within three years after one or more negative Papanicolaou tests, as well as the number of additional Papanicolaou tests and colposcopic examinations that would be required to avert one case of cancer given a particular interval between screenings.

- **Results**: Among 31,728 women 30 to 64 years of age who had had three or more consecutive negative tests, the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 was 0.028 percent and the prevalence of grade 3 neoplasia was 0.019 percent; none of the women had invasive cervical cancer. According to our model, the estimated risk of cancer with annual Papanicolaou tests for three years was 2 in 100,000 among women 30 to 44 years of age, 1 in 100,000 among women 45 to 59 years of age, and 1 in 100,000 among women 60 to 64 years of age. These risks would be 5 in 100,000, 2 in 100,000, and 1 in 100,000, respectively, if screening were performed once three years after the last negative test.

### The risk of developing cervical cancer in the elderly: who benefits from screening after the age of 60 [^112ZrpK9]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Low credibility.

In the Netherlands, women can exit the screening program when tested hrHPV negative at the age of 60. However, Dutch guidelines include the advice to perform follow-up screening after 5 years, and up to 10 years after treating cervical abnormalities after the age of 55. The recent introduction of the more sensitive hrHPV test for screening purposes decreases the chance of CIN in the following years compared with cytology screening; however, people aged over 60 may not have been offered this test. HPV-prevalence data from Northern Europe, covering ages up to 65+ years, have indicated a moderate rebound after menopause in people with normal cytology. A few people will acquire a new hrHPV infection after the age of 65. However, it is suggested that most cervical cancers in older people are the result of infections acquired many years previously because a persisting risk is associated with an early age at first intercourse. Although latent hrHPV infections sometimes lead to precancerous changes later in life, a substantial proportion of older people who test hrHPV positive may already have subclinical precancerous cells.

In a Danish population, regular screening is offered to people with a cervix up to 64 years with an HPV check-out test at age 60–64. Catch-up hrHPV testing was offered to people with a cervix aged 69 and above. It showed a 30.2% participation rate with an average age of 74.6 years. An overall hrHPV positivity rate of 4% was found, which shows no sign of rebound hrHPV prevalence after menopause, and it did not reflect the relatively high cervical cancer incidence.

This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

- **Five-year return clinical action threshold**: This approximates the risk for a patient following a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing.

- **Three-year return clinical action threshold**: This approximates the risk for a patient following a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years.

- **One-year return**: Recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the clinical action threshold for colposcopy.

- **Colposcopy clinical action threshold**: This approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: Should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity [^113R5QwA]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

A time-limited transition plan and clinical decision-support tools are needed to facilitate adoption of HPV testing at 5-year intervals and to improve the quality of care provided to women. The rationale for recommending these alternatives in this transition period should be transparent and should not misrepresent the facts or use scare tactics to maintain the status quo for vested interests. A "risk calculator" and decision-support tool will help optimize cervical screening and management but must be user-friendly, presenting the necessary information in a clear and direct manner to assist the busy clinician.

A major challenge in providing optimized cervical screening to women in the United States is the lack of compliance with any guideline, primarily resulting in overscreening with HPV testing. A recent survey of primary care physicians and obstetrician-gynecologists found that approximately 30% of them would recommend asymptomatic women aged 30 years and older undergo annual screening with HPV testing. Financial incentives or disincentives may be a solution, but the jury is still out as to whether payment-for-performance strategies improve adherence.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cervical cancer, the ACS 2020 guidelines recommend starting cervical cancer screening at age 25 for patients with a cervix. Screening should ideally use primary HPV testing every 5 years through age 65 (preferred). If primary HPV testing is not available, screening with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years is considered acceptable.

### 2012 updated consensus guidelines for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112vw4Sw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

A group of 47 experts representing 23 professional societies, national and international health organizations, and federal agencies met in Bethesda, MD, on September 14–15, 2012, to revise the 2006 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines. The group's goal was to provide revised evidence-based consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) following the adoption of cervical cancer screening guidelines incorporating longer screening intervals and co-testing.

In addition to literature review, data from almost 1.4 million women in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care Plan provided evidence on risk after abnormal tests. Where data were available, guidelines prescribed similar management for women with similar risks for CIN 3, AIS, and cancer. Most prior guidelines were reaffirmed.

- **Updates include**:
	- Human papillomavirus-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance results are followed with co-testing at 3 years before return to routine screening and are not sufficient for exiting women from screening at age 65 years.
	- Women aged 21–24 years need less invasive management, especially for minor abnormalities.
	- Postcolposcopy management strategies incorporate co-testing.
	- Endocervical sampling reported as CIN 1 should be managed as CIN 1.
	- Unsatisfactory cytology should be repeated in most circumstances, even when HPV results from co-testing are known, while most cases of negative cytology with absent results are addressed accordingly.

### Screening history among women with invasive cervical cancer in an academic medical center: Will we miss cancers following updated guidelines [^113ob6jM]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Updated guidelines for the screening and management of cervical cancer in the United States recommend initiating Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at age 21 and screening less frequently, with less aggressive management for abnormalities. We sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect the detection of invasive cervical cancer, particularly among women under 30 years of age.

Patients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Prior screening history was obtained, and patients were divided into two groups based on age: those under 30 years and those 30 years or older. The two groups were then compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to diagnosis.

A total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers of the cervix. Thirteen patients were younger than 30, while 96 patients were 30 or older. The mean time from a normal Pap test to the diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 and older (p < 0.001). The mean time from a normal Pap test to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 and older.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^116tJhXY]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Low credibility.

- **Essential changes from prior management guidelines**: Recommendations are based on risk, not results. Recommendations for colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of results and history (including unknown history). The same test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results.

- **Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients**: Repeat HPV testing or co-testing at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities following a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest). At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal.

- **Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded**: Expedited treatment (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy) was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined. For non-pregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for non-pregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology).

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^112ECPAt]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There is little empirical data on the absolute benefit of cervical screening between ages 60–64 on subsequent cancer risk. We estimate the incidence of cervical cancer up to age 84 in women with and without a cervical cytology test at age 60–64, by screening histories aged 50–59. The study is a population-based case-control study of women born between 1928 and 1956 and aged 60–84 between 2007 and 2018. We included all such women diagnosed with cervical cancer in England as well as an age-matched random sample without cancer. Women with a hysterectomy were excluded. Exposure was cervical cytology between ages 50–64. The main outcome was the 25-year cumulative risk of cervical cancer between ages 60–84.

We found that eight in every 1,000 (8.40, 95% CI: 7.78 to 9.07) women without a screening test between age 50–64 develop cervical cancer between the ages of 60–84. The risk is half: 3.46 per 1,000 (95% CI: 2.75 to 4.36) among women with a test between age 60–64 but no cervical screening test at age 50–59. The absolute difference in risk is equivalent to one fewer cancer for every 202 such women screened. The highest risk (10.01, 95% CI: 6.70 to 14.95) was among women with abnormal screening at ages 50–59 and no tests at 60–64. The 25-year risk among women with a screening test every five years between age 50–64 was just under two in 1,000 (1.59, 95% CI: 1.42 to 1.78). Results suggest the upper age of screening should be dependent on previous screening participation and results.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American Cancer Society [^112SZ5vg]. CA (2020). High credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that individuals with a cervix initiate cervical cancer screening at age 25 years and undergo primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years through age 65 years (preferred). If primary HPV testing is not available, individuals aged 25 to 65 years should be screened with cotesting (HPV testing in combination with cytology) every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years (acceptable). This is a strong recommendation. The ACS further recommends that individuals aged over 65 years who have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years, discontinue all cervical cancer screening (qualified recommendation).

These new screening recommendations differ in four important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations:

- **Preferred screening strategy**: Primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable where access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not yet available.

- **Starting age for screening**: The recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years.

- **Testing strategies**: Primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone (when primary testing is not available), is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years.

- **Guideline transitional nature**: The guideline is transitional, meaning options for screening with cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing for cervical cancer screening is available without barriers.

### Delayed diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer after negative evaluation for atypical glandular cell Pap smear: Does age matter [^116Qzcz8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

At initial evaluation, 1 in 6 women with atypical glandular cells (AGCs) on Pap smear has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer. Years later, a greater-than-expected incidence of "significant delayed diagnoses" has been reported in women who had negative initial evaluation results. This study aimed to test the premise that AGC represents a lesser future risk for CIN 2/CIN 3/carcinoma in situ (CIS) and cancer after negative evaluation results in a population diagnosed at a young age (< 35 years).

- **Materials and methods**: The cohort study consists of 43,000 community health center patients who had 83,542 Pap smears (1997–2010). Among these, 213 were diagnosed with AGC, and 117 met inclusion criteria. The completed evaluation was consistent with American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines without finding CIN 2/CIN 3/CIS or cancer. Follow-up lasted for longer than 1 year. Categorical data were evaluated with χ.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period that averaged 85.3 months, the cohort had a mean of 4.5 Pap smears, reporting 46 cytological diagnoses of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 3 diagnoses of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 10 repeated diagnoses of AGCs. Two CIN 2/CIN 3/CIS lesions, 1 cervical cancer, and 1 endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia were confirmed on biopsy. The average age of patients at the index Pap smear was 34.2 years (range = 15–64 years). Compared with a published report where the average age at index Pap smear was 41.5 years, our cohort developed a total of 4.3% significant delayed diagnoses versus 10.8%.

Primary data sources

Where available, primary data are used to calculate risk estimates to develop risk-based recommendations in the context of clinical action thresholds. Inclusion of studies from diverse populations is critical to ensure the generalizability of recommendations. The benefit of primary data analyses is that risk estimates can be tailored to specific requirements for guideline development, for example, by allowing derivation of subsets of the population for specific indications (e.g. triage, surveillance) or by allowing estimation of risk for time intervals that are relevant for clinical action thresholds (e.g. immediate, 1-year, 3-year risk) using comparable risk models. Enduring Guidelines recommendations are primarily developed for US clinicians and patients. Therefore, primary data analyses will focus on diverse, US-based studies that are representative of the population for which the recommendations are developed. They will assess screening and management approaches specific to the United States that may differ from international settings, and evaluate the assays and specific assay configurations that have received regulatory approval in the United States.

Specific data requirements vary depending on the topic under review. As a general principle, data supporting new recommendations need to come from sufficiently powered studies to ensure risk estimates are precise. For each guideline area, different sets of studies are used, depending on the availability of relevant data. Two NCI-funded studies will provide primary data for several Enduring Guidelines areas.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: Should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity [^112CBwTE]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Because clinical trials and observational studies do not often collect data on, or have sufficient sample sizes to directly measure the harms of screening, the number of women referred to colposcopy has been used as a proxy for measuring harms. No women, no matter how well educated, enjoy getting a positive cancer screening result, nor do they want to be referred to colposcopy for a pelvic examination and biopsy. This can lead to finding some cases of transient intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2) associated with a benign HPV infection that could be overtreated.

- **Guiding principles of screening**: No test or intervention has perfect (100%) sensitivity. Thus, fundamental to developing guidelines for screening is accepting that more could always be done to prevent, treat, or provide care for a disease with increased harms and added cost. If cervical cancer prevention is the only consideration for women's health and well-being, the logical but ludicrous conclusion is that all adult women should undergo hysterectomy to remove the cervix, akin to prophylactic oophorectomy in breast cancer susceptibility gene-positive women for whom there is no screening alternative for preventing ovarian cancer. Alternatively, women could be co-tested every 6 months (vs. every 3 or 5 years) to further reduce cervical cancer risk if cost is not an issue. These absurd examples illustrate the problem of screening recommendations for cervical cancer prevention that do not consider the impact on women's overall health and society.

It is in this context of balancing benefits and harms f

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^113mAUDY]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Under the assumption that the observed relative risks associated with screening are causal, the population impact of screening different groups of women currently aged 60–64 years on cervical cancer rates (over 25 years) is presented. The annual rates of cervical cancer in England for ages 60–84 years are 9.3 per 100,000 women (equivalent to 12.1 per 100,000 women with a cervix). Projections for the cohort of women aged 65–69 years in this study suggest that their 25-year risk (from their 60th birthday) will be 3.58 per 1000.

Screening at ages 60–64 years since the year 2000 is projected to have reduced cervical cancer rates in women aged 60–84 years in England by an average of 0.60 per 1000 women (i.e. from 4.18 to 3.58 per 1000). Cervical cancer rates in women with a cervix in England over the age of 60 years could be further reduced by 1.26 per 1000 (from 3.58 to 2.32 or by 35%) if all those not currently screened aged 60–64 years were screened once between these ages. More than three-quarters (1.02 per 1000 or 28%) of this added benefit could be achieved by screening the 20.7% who have not attended screening since age 50 years.

The 20-year risk of cervical cancer following five-yearly screening between ages 50–64 years was 1.60 in 1000 women (95% CI: 1.43–1.79); this risk increased to 2.55 in 1000 (95% CI: 2.35–2.76) for women who were screened irregularly between ages 50–64 years. The risk in women not screened between ages 50–64 years was 6.16 in 1000 (95% CI: 5.64–6.

### Screening for cervical cancer: Will women accept less [^114d6zcK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

U.S. professional organizations increasingly agree that most women require Papanicolaou smear screenings every 2 to 3 years rather than annually, and that most elderly women may stop screening. This study aimed to describe the attitudes of women in the United States toward less intense screening, specifically focusing on less frequent screening and the eventual cessation of screening.

- **Methods**: We conducted a random-digit-dialing telephone survey of women in 2002, achieving a response rate of 75% among eligible women reached by telephone. A nationally representative sample of 360 women aged 40 years or older, with no history of cancer, was surveyed about their acceptance of less intense screening.

- **Results**: Almost all women aged 40 years or older (99%) had experienced at least one Pap smear, with most (59%) undergoing screening annually. When asked to choose their preferred frequency for screenings, 75% preferred at least annual screenings (12% chose screening every 6 months). Less than half (43%) were aware of recommendations advocating less frequent screening. Upon being advised of such recommendations, half of the women believed that the recommendations were based on cost. Sixty-nine percent stated they would try to continue being screened annually, even if their doctors recommended less frequent screenings with comparable benefits. Only 35% of women believed there might come a time they would stop getting Pap smears; among these, nearly half indicated they would not cease until after age 80. The strongest predictor of reluctance to reduce the frequency of screening was a belief that cost was the basis of current practices.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: Introduction to the scope and process [^117S4XFi]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

If the working group determines that there is sufficient evidence and a favorable benefit-harms trade-off for a new test or approach, draft clinical recommendations are developed by the working group using a standardized procedure. When risk estimates are available, recommendations are usually based on where the calculated risk estimates fall with respect to the clinical action thresholds. This approach is referred to as "management according to risk".

There may be exceptions to the risk-based approach, such as the example of HPV18-positive negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, for which colposcopy referral is recommended. This recommendation is not based on the CIN3+ risk — which is below the colposcopy threshold — but because of a disproportionately high risk of cancer attributed to HPV18. When data are insufficient for risk-based recommendations, recommendations may be made based on expert opinion.

Recommendations use the terminology previously established for the 2019 guidelines process:

- **Recommended**: When there are good data to support use and no other option is acceptable.
- **Preferred**: When the option is the best (or one of the best) among multiple options.
- **Acceptable**: When it is one of multiple options when data do not clearly favor any single option or when there are data indicating that another approach is superior.
- **Not recommended**: When there is weak evidence against use and marginal risk for adverse consequences.
- **Unacceptable**: When there is good evidence against use.

The evidence supporting all recommendations is crucial for their formulation and implementation.

### Adherence to cervical cancer screening guidelines among women aged 66–68 years in a large community-based practice [^114MKiey]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The 2012 national cervical cancer screening guidelines recommended cessation of screening after age 65 years in women with adequate prior screening. In this retrospective cohort study, adherence to these screening exit guidelines was examined.

- **Methods**: Women who turned age 66 years in 2012–2013 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California were followed through age 68 years for cervical cancer screening uptake. Adequacy of prior screening was assessed between age 56 and 65 years using electronic medical records. Guideline adherence was determined based on the screening pattern between age 66 and 68 years. Patient- and physician-level correlates for guideline adherence were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Data collection and analyses were conducted in 2018.

- **Results**: A total of 14,778 women were included; 24% did not have adequate prior screening by age 65 years. Among those without adequate prior screening, the proportion screened after age 65 years ranged from 71% (177 of 249) in those whose most recent test was abnormal to 3% (34 of 1,330) in those who did not have any testing in 10 years. The prior screening pattern was the only factor associated with screening after age 65 years. Of those with adequate prior screening, 10% (1,135 of 11,295) continued to receive screening after age 65 years. Frequent office visits and having a male primary care physician were associated with continuing screening after age 65 years.

- **Conclusions**: A considerable proportion of women did not have adequate prior screening by age 65 years. Of these, a large proportion did not adhere to recommended guidelines.

### Time to de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices: A narrative review [^115DDG3d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). Low credibility.

Screening in women over 65 years began following the 2003 USPSTF Grade D recommendation for cervical cancer screening, which was reaffirmed in both 2012 and 2018. The original Grade D recommendation was based on evidence from 12 observational studies published between 1995 and 2000, rather than a single landmark study. In an analysis of Medicare claims data, Qin et al. found that screening rates achieved a relative reduction of 50.5% by 2016, decreasing from 19.0% in 2002 to 9.4% in 2016, 14 years after the guideline was issued.

The observed trends were consistent across race and ethnicity, with the age-adjusted rate of screening consistently highest among non-Hispanic white women. Although this study could not determine whether women had prior adequate screening, hysterectomy, or a history of cervical cancer or abnormal screening results, to our knowledge, it is the only study using a national US sample with an observation period encompassing pre-guideline and post-guideline screening rates. In summary, the de-implementation of cervical cancer screening in women over age 65 spanned 16 years, with 3 years between the publication of supporting evidence and guideline release (2000–2003) and another 13 years between the guideline release and 50% reduction in screening (2003–2016).

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: Introduction to the scope and process [^115kuwT7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

Overview of cervical screening and management guidelines in the United States: The figure summarizes the continuum from cervical screening to management and treatment of cervical precancers for the prevention of cervical cancer and related US guidelines. The Enduring Guidelines process primarily addresses the management of abnormal screening results but may extend to specific questions related to screening and treatment. HPV, human papillomavirus; USPSTF, US Preventive Services Task Force.

The risk-based framework uses clinical action thresholds that were defined in the 2019 consensus process. For example, for an immediate risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or worse (CIN3+) of 4% or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable for a risk ranging from 25% to 59%, and expedited treatment is preferred for a risk of 60% or higher. Surveillance intervals of 1, 3, and 5 years are based on 5- and 3-year risk-based clinical action thresholds. To expand existing recommendations, risk estimates are calculated from studies evaluating new and established technologies, and the placement of these risk estimates in the context of clinical action thresholds guides management.

The guiding principles for risk-based guidelines are to balance the benefits of screening and management in terms of detecting and treating CIN3+ to prevent invasive cancer against potential harms, including treatment risks, pain, stress, lost time, and expense associated with colposcopies unlikely to detect CIN3+ and treatment of lesions unlikely to progress to cancer.

### Screening for cervical cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115bRwwh]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cervical cancer, specifically concerning indications for screening, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend not obtaining screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.

### Screening history preceding a diagnosis of cervical cancer in women age 65 and older [^115XdjRQ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the antecedent screening of women 65 years of age and older diagnosed with cervical cancer.

- **Methods**: Screening histories of women 65 years of age and older who were diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2003 and 2008 were examined utilizing the organization's databases and the regional Cancer Registry. Stopping screening was recommended at age 65 for members who had either three consecutive negative Pap smears or a single negative Pap smear plus HPV test ("cotest").

- **Results**: From 2003 through 2008, there were 56 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members 65 years of age and older diagnosed with cervical cancer. During the same period, there were 1,323,100 woman-years of membership in women age 65 and older. The risk of invasive cancer among women age 65 and older was 4.2/100,000/year in 2003–2008. Of those diagnosed, 33 out of 56 (59%) had one or more Pap smears prior to diagnosis. Of these 33 women, 14 (25%) had three consecutive negative Pap smears prior to diagnosis. Three of 46,401 women with one or more negative cotests at age 65 and older were subsequently diagnosed with invasive cancer during 132,639 women-years of follow-up, which is 2.3/100,000/year.

- **Conclusions**: Most cervical cancers diagnosed at age 65 and older occur in women who have not met the criteria for stopping screening. A few cancers will continue to occur at age 65 and older despite multiple negative tests, as is true in other age groups. Currently, there is no evidence that these cancers would be prevented with continued screening at ages 65 and older.

### Cervical cancer screening in average-risk women: Best practice advice from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians [^112uCfuv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The purpose of this best practice advice article is to describe the indications for screening for cervical cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk women aged 21 years or older.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should not screen average-risk women younger than 21 years for cervical cancer.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Clinicians should start screening average-risk women for cervical cancer at age 21 years once every 3 years with cytology (cytologic tests without human papillomavirus [HPV] tests).

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should not screen average-risk women for cervical cancer with cytology more often than once every 3 years.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Clinicians may use a combination of cytology and HPV testing once every 5 years in average-risk women aged 30 years or older who prefer screening less often than every 3 years.

- **Best practice advice 5**: Clinicians should not perform HPV testing in average-risk women younger than 30 years.

- **Best practice advice 6**: Clinicians should stop screening average-risk women older than 65 years for cervical cancer if they have had 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within 5 years.

- **Best practice advice 7**: Clinicians should not screen average-risk women of any age for cervical cancer if they have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^117BF2Q3]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Screening intensity prior to age 65 is prognostic of risk thereafter. Women with regular screening between the ages of 50 and 64 are at low risk of cervical cancer up to age 84. However, those who have not been screened at ages 50 to 64, or those with positive screening tests, are at high risk of developing cervical cancer.

Regardless of screening history at ages 50 to 59, women who attend screening at ages 60 to 64 are at lower risk thereafter. While acknowledging that the magnitude of the impact of screening estimated here could be affected by confounding, we interpret this association as causal partly due to a substantial body of evidence suggesting that cervical screening can greatly reduce the risk of cervical cancer.

Since the underlying risk is much greater in those not screened at ages 50 to 59, the absolute benefit of a screen at ages 60 to 64 is eight times greater among women who were unscreened at ages 50 to 59 compared to those who were well screened and had a test at ages 60 to 64. Without screening, about 8.4 per 1000 women (with a cervix) in England currently aged 60 to 64 would get cancer by age 84, but a single test between ages 60 to 64 would prevent 4.9 of those 8.4 cancers. Five-yearly screening from age 50 to 64 (i.e. three screens) would prevent about 6.8 (i.e. 8.40 minus 1.59) of those cancers.

### Navigating the cervical cancer screening guidelines for women aged older than 65 years [^113VdF6n]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

One of the most notable changes stemming from consensus guidance in 2012 is the cessation of cervical cancer screening in low-risk women aged older than 65 years. Despite evidence provided for this recommendation, implementation in clinical practice can be challenging, with resistance from patients and providers. This NAMS Practice Pearl reviews data supporting this recommendation and provides clinicians with confidence as we counsel our patients.

### Human papillomavirus testing in the last cervical screening round at age 60–64 years [^116f97HE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

The extent of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of both CIN 2 or worse and cervical cancer in this population should continue to be monitored. With cytology screening, between six and eight women underwent CIN treatment at any age for every case of cervical cancer saved. This relationship is still largely unknown for HPV testing, particularly for older women in whom fewer life-years are gained by preventing cancer. Nevertheless, women's remaining life expectancy is increasing. In Denmark, it is currently almost 22 years for women aged 64 years, whereas just 10 years ago, it was approximately 20 years. This period is long enough even for newly developed CIN 2 or CIN 3 to develop into cervical cancer. Hence, the extent of overdiagnosis in the "exit" round is becoming smaller in younger birth cohorts compared to what must have been the case not so long ago.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^111REEQ3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Low credibility.

If patients over age 65 years undergo HPV testing, cotesting, or cytology, management according to guidelines for patients aged 25 to 65 years is recommended. If surveillance testing is recommended for either a history of abnormal screening results or treatment for precancer, discontinuing surveillance is unacceptable if the patient is in reasonably good health and testing is feasible. Discontinuation of surveillance is recommended for patients with a limited life expectancy.

Screening for patients older than 65 years should follow national guidelines. However, approximately 20% of cervical cancers occur in patients older than 65 years. To mitigate cancer risk in patients older than 65 years, previous consensus management guidelines included continued testing in patients with abnormal results as well as those who do not meet exit criteria. Although the sensitivity of cytology, HPV testing, and colposcopy seem to be higher in premenopausal than postmenopausal patients, evidence indicates that screening in patients older than 65 years is associated with a lower risk of the subsequent development of cervical cancer. Because cessation of routine screening is recommended in adequately screened patients at the age of 65 years, data on the prognostic value of specific screening test results in older patients are limited. However, as cancer rates remain appreciable beyond the age of 65 years, and cancer diagnostic procedures such as mammography, breast biopsy, etc. continue to be pertinent, ongoing evaluation is crucial.

### Cancer screening test use - United States, 2013 [^112HrPf2]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

For this report, screening histories were examined only for persons in age groups recommended for routine screening. However, nearly one-fourth of persons aged 51–65 years and 30% of those aged 65–75 years reported no recent cervical cancer and CRC screening, respectively, thus some might reach upper age limits for routine screening without adequate prior screening. Although USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for cervical cancer among average-risk women aged > 65 years or for CRC among adults aged 76–85 years, screening might be indicated for some adults in these older groups who were not screened adequately when they were in a younger age group for which routine screening was recommended.

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, **NHIS data** are self-reported and not verified by medical records. Second, the response rate was 61%, and nonresponse bias is possible despite adjustments for nonresponse. Third, although age-adjusted percentages for screening are presented that are consistent with Healthy People 2020 targets overall, percentages for subgroups are not age-adjusted. Fourth, **Pap test data** for 2003 were excluded because hysterectomy status was unknown. Fifth, screening guidelines and NHIS screening questions have changed over time. Sixth, **confidence intervals** were wide for some subgroups, indicating estimate imprecision. Finally, **diagnostic tests** rather than screening tests might have been reported by some respondents, possibly leading to overestimates of screening.

Increased efforts are needed to reach Healthy People 2020 targets.

### Cervical cancer screening: Evidence behind the guidelines [^116Ax6hH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cervical cancer screening involves a complex process of cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, colposcopy, and a multitude of algorithms for the identification of preinvasive disease and the prevention of invasive disease. High-risk HPV is a prerequisite for the development of almost all types of cervical cancer; therefore, a test for high-risk HPV has become an integral part of new screening strategies. Major changes to screening guidelines in the last decade include the initiation of screening at age 21 years, conservative management of young women with abnormal cytology, extended screening intervals for women aged 30 years and older, and cessation of screening in low-risk women at age 65 years. This review focuses on the evidence that has led to evidence-based guidelines. Evidence regarding primary HPV testing, as well as post-vaccine-based screening strategies, will also be reviewed.

### It's time to re-evaluate cervical cancer screening after age 65 [^113wf4hj]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Cervical cancer screening guidelines currently recommend the cessation of cervical cancer screening after age 65, despite 20% of new cervical cancer cases occurring in this age group. The US population is aging, research methodologies examining cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have evolved, and changes in sexual behaviors and the rates of hysterectomies among women have been observed. Guidelines do not adequately address these changes and may be missing significant opportunities to prevent cervical cancer cases and deaths in older women. Furthermore, racial disparities in cervical cancer outcomes may be exacerbated by not addressing the preventive health needs of older women through cervical cancer screening.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: Should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity [^115GUgsF]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

- **HPV testing every 5 years vs. 3 years**: Similar small increases in sensitivity as co-testing can also be achieved programmatically by screening more frequently, every 3 years with HPV testing, compared with HPV testing every 5 years. However, screening every 3 years with HPV testing will similarly increase costs of screening to that of co-testing. Another consequence of screening more frequently is that more benign, transient HPV infections and associated CIN 2 will be found. That is, screening more frequently shifts the emphasis from detecting persistent HPV infections that are more strongly linked to CIN 3 or greater to transient HPV infections, some of which manifest as CIN 2 diagnoses. Because some CIN 2 diagnoses do not represent true precancers, they can result in unnecessary excision treatments, which have been linked to preterm delivery, a relevant outcome for women who are still considering bearing children.

- **Concerns with screening intervals**: One concern of using 5-year (vs. 3-year) intervals for screening, applicable to both HPV testing and co-testing, is the increased likelihood of women missing the next screen. This is a legitimate concern and applies mainly to women switching healthcare systems because electronic medical records from one health system are generally not shared with another. Cloud computing-based strategies, in which the electronic medical records are kept on an individual basis ("personal health record") and accessed by health systems, are one potential future solution to overcome these barriers to providing care for individuals across healthcare systems.

### The next generation of cervical cancer screening: Should guidelines focus on best practices for the future or current screening capacity [^112qN8fq]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

As practice evolves, underlying rates of precancer will change. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination will drive down rates of infection and subsequent pre-cancer, and HPV testing, which detects more disease at the initial screen, results in lower rates of precancer in subsequent screening rounds. This, in turn, affects the accuracy of any given test (both in terms of positive and negative predictive value), and thus, appropriate recommendations or guidelines and priorities will likewise need to be updated. To complicate implementation, rates of HPV vaccination and access to screening, particularly HPV testing, vary widely in different parts of the United States and the world.

What is the role of a guideline? Guidelines are intended to standardize care using the best available evidence supplemented by expert opinion to decrease rates of disease and improve the health of populations. To be successful, guidelines must be implementable and useful to patients and providers in a wide variety of clinical and programmatic settings that may have varied resources and priorities. Testing and treatment options also need to be culturally and emotionally acceptable to patients. Thus, to be effective, guidelines must be evidence-based but also flexible, and they must reflect the roles of access, acceptability, availability, and cost of different testing and management options. Furthermore, for screening guidelines to have the maximum impact on preventing cancer, they must incorporate easy and straightforward recommendations.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: Introduction to the scope and process [^116zdtWu]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). High credibility.

- **Objectives**: The Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines (Enduring Guidelines) effort is a standing committee that continuously evaluates new technologies and approaches to cervical cancer screening, management, and surveillance.

- **Methods and results**: The Enduring Guidelines process will selectively incorporate new technologies and approaches, provided there is adequate supportive data, to more effectively improve cancer prevention for high-risk individuals and decrease unnecessary procedures in low-risk individuals. This manuscript describes the structure, process, and methods of the Enduring Guidelines effort. By using systematic literature reviews and primary data sources, the risk of precancer will be estimated, and recommendations will be made based on these risk estimates in the context of established risk-based clinical action thresholds. The Enduring Guidelines process will consider health equity and health disparities by ensuring the inclusion of diverse populations in the evidence review and risk assessment and developing recommendations that offer a choice of well-validated strategies adaptable to different settings.

- **Conclusions**: The Enduring Guidelines process will enable the rapid updating of existing cervical cancer screening and management guidelines when new technologies are approved or new scientific evidence becomes available.

### Equal management of equal risks: What should be used as the standard for cervical cancer prevention [^115FCNUo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Until very recently, the most common practice in the United States was to recommend annual Pap smears. Although it is widely acknowledged that this practice lacked a clear scientific rationale, was significantly insensitive, and profoundly inefficient, it was responsible for a dramatic drop in the incidence of invasive cervical cancer, becoming the U.S. standard of care.

There is no credible evidence anywhere that Pap smears at 3-year intervals provide the same cancer protection as annual Pap smears. The assertion remains unchanged, even though randomized controlled clinical trials with cancer endpoints cannot be conducted. Gage et al. have published the observed risk of cancer at 1 year and at 3 years following a single negative Pap, demonstrating that the risks are three-fold higher at 3 years, with the confidence intervals widely separated. Sawaya et al. have also reported that this increased risk is present even in women with multiple negative preceding Paps. While the absolute risks in the immediate few years following a single test are small, the cumulative risks over a woman's lifetime are more intimidating. Although the assessment of absolute risks varies among models, no model suggests that the cancer protection from annual versus 3-year Pap smears is identical.

- **US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations**: It has been the preference of the USPSTF to recommend Pap smears every 3 years. This longstanding recommendation has had no discernible effect on clinical practice in the United States outside of federally funded clinics.

In Kaiser Permanente Northern California, it was possible…

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112MKveH]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Low credibility.

When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return clinical action threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks following a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the clinical action threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds.

Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest, reach the 3-year return threshold. Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

### Effectiveness of cervical screening with age: Population based case-control study of prospectively recorded data [^113ipceg]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The benefit associated with being screened twice by age 26 has been a topic of discussion. It has been argued that screening becomes fully effective only once a woman has been screened twice. Consequently, women screened at ages 20–24 and again at age 25 may derive greater benefits from screening after age 25 than those first screened at age 25.

To investigate this, we compared women screened at both ages 20–22 and 23–25 with those first screened only at ages 23–25. In an analysis of cancers diagnosed between ages 26.5 and 29, restricted to women screened between ages 23 and 25 (inclusive), the odds ratio for stage IB+ cancer associated with also being screened between ages 20 and 22 (inclusive) was 0.90 (0.38 to 2.2). For all cancers (including stage IA), the odds ratio was 1.1 (0.62 to 2.0).

U.S. cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend screening cessation at the age of 65 years, provided women have adequate previous screening and no history of precancer. Women living with HIV are at higher risk of cervical cancer than women living without HIV. Furthermore, limited data exist to quantify the risk of cervical cancer among women who otherwise would qualify for screening cessation.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine whether guidelines recommending women to discontinue cervical cancer screening at the age of 65 years are appropriate for women living with HIV.

- **Study design**: Semiannual Papanicolaou testing was performed as part of surveillance visits in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Launched in October 1994, this federally funded U.S. multisite cohort study enrolled 3,678 women living with HIV and 1,304 women living without HIV. We included data collected through September 2019 onward. Conventional Papanicolaou tests were collected at scheduled 6-month visits and assessed centrally according to the 1991 Bethesda System criteria. Results were analyzed among women at least 65 years of age. The primary endpoint was high-grade cytology, including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; atypical glandular cells; atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade lesions; and malignant cytology. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare continuous variables, and Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate risk estimates.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: introduction to the scope and process [^1142CDgK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Enduring guidelines activities are needed in at least four different areas:

1. When new technologies for cervical screening or management receive regulatory approval, it is necessary to assess their potential and, if appropriate, develop clinical recommendations for their use.
2. When new risk data become available, recommendations may need updating to reflect improved evidence, particularly when previous recommendations were based on expert opinion.
3. When population prevalence of HPV infections or precancers substantially changes, such as when the proportion of HPV-vaccinated cohorts increases in the screening population, recommendations may need to be modified to reflect the lower population risk.
4. When new discoveries are made with relevance to cervical screening and management that have not been considered previously, new clinical recommendations may need to be developed or existing recommendations modified.

Topics for consideration through the Enduring Guidelines process can be proposed by all members of the Enduring Guidelines committee, including the representatives of the stakeholder organizations. The general public may approach member organizations to propose topics for consideration.

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^1178uv3Q]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee (ref 17/NW/0655). Data for this study are routinely collected as part of the audit of invasive cervical cancer, anonymized and quality assured by the PHE Population Screening Programmes. Access was facilitated by the PHE Office for Data Release (ODR1718_424).

### Screening for cervical cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111yRaLB]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The number of deaths from cervical cancer in the United States has decreased substantially since the implementation of widespread cervical cancer screening, declining from 2.8 to 2.3 deaths per 100,000 women from 2000 to 2015.

The objective of this update is to revise the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for cervical cancer.

The USPSTF reviewed evidence from clinical trials and cohort studies focusing on the effectiveness of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone or in combination with cervical cytology (cotesting). This was compared to cervical cytology alone. Additionally, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis model to evaluate the appropriate age to begin and end screening, optimal screening intervals, and the benefits and harms of different screening strategies.

Findings indicate that screening with cervical cytology alone, primary hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Screening women aged 21 to 65 years significantly reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The harms of screening in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. Additionally, it recommends screening every 3 years with cytology alone or every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone.

### Cervical cancer screening among women ≥ 70 years of age in the United States-a referral problem or patient choice [^114D9kVo]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical guidelines indicate that women with a history of adequate screening and who are not otherwise at high risk may discontinue cervical cancer screening after 65 years of age. However, screening remains common among US women over 65 years old. This study was conducted to examine whether overutilization was attributable to the provider's recommendation or patient choice.

This cross-sectional study used data from 1,752 female participants (70+ years) from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We quantitatively assessed the proportions of provider-recommended and patient self-initiated Pap smears.

Among female respondents, 40.8% had a Pap smear within the past 3 years, 19.4% had a Pap smear in the last year, and 39.7% reported receiving a recommendation for a Pap smear from their provider in the past year. Among women who received a recommendation to obtain a Pap smear, 39.8% did so within the past 12 months compared to 5.9% of women who did not receive a recommendation. The adjusted odds ratio was 10.5, with a 95% confidence interval of 7.39–15.0. About 70% of women who visited an obstetrician/gynecologist and reported receiving a recommendation to have a Pap smear did so in the past year, while 32.3% of women who visited an obstetrician/gynecologist but did not receive a recommendation obtained one.

Pap smears were common among women ≥ 70 years of age. Health care providers may need additional education on guidelines regarding indications for Pap smears in this age group to help reduce screening of patients who may not benefit.

### Three large scale surveys highlight the complexity of cervical cancer under-screening among women 45–65 years of age in the United States [^115asfVQ]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Professional guideline changes in cervical cancer screening techniques and intervals may have also contributed to the lack of understanding of timely screening. Similarly, the electronic medical record ordering systems for cervical cancer screening have provided multiple techniques and intervals from which to choose, leading to order confusion. These changes started in 2003 with the approval of HPV testing in combination with cytology (co-testing) to screen women 30 and older, in addition to the option of cytology alone. In 2004, the guidelines changed from annually to every two years with liquid-based Pap tests, starting no later than 21 years or three years after the woman begins having vaginal intercourse. At 30 years, if the woman has had three normal consecutive tests, screening may extend to every 2–3 years using liquid Pap tests or every 3 years with HPV-cytology co-testing. By 2012, guidelines evolved to every 3 years with cytology for 21–29-year-olds and a preferred recommendation of every 5-year co-testing for women 30–65 years. By 2018, co-testing was no longer favored, and now the USPSTF recommends primary HPV testing every five years. The many changes in techniques and intervals could have led to misunderstandings on what screening was recommended and what screening was implemented.

- **Study limitations and strengths**: As we have discussed above, the limitations and consequences therefrom include different years of survey implementation, responses that are self-reported, different sampling frames, different survey sample sizes, and changing professional guidelines.

### Who should adjust its global strategy for cervical cancer prevention [^115f762T]. BMJ Global Health (2023). Low credibility.

Because of quality management challenges inherent to visual screening, and due to uncertainties regarding the affordability and desirability of HPV screening and HPV vaccination in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), Pap smear screening in LMICs is the strategy most likely to achieve the goal of saving as many lives as quickly as possible. Iatrogenic delays to Pap screening in LMICs contribute to preventable cervical cancer deaths. From 1997 to 2015, the US National Cancer Institute funded a study in Mumbai that resulted in the delay of Pap screening throughout India, contributing to at least 500,000 preventable cervical cancer deaths.

In 1999, with an initial gift of US $50 million, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) established the Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention on the central assumption that novel technologies, rather than Pap screening, are the most likely solution to the problem of cervical cancer in LMICs. In 2000, the head of cancer screening at WHO/IARC, an Alliance member organization, stated he would be "loath" to recommend the establishment of Pap screening services in high-risk communities with no cervical screening programs in place. WHO guidelines endorse Pap screening only for communities with existing Pap screening programs.

Who should adjust its Global Strategy for cervical cancer prevention. It should accept the WHO/IARC determination that "good-quality Pap smear screening can be implemented even in a rural setting of a developing country with reasonable investment" and advocate for rapid, immediate expansions of good-quality Pap smear screening in LMICs.

### Human papillomavirus testing in the last cervical screening round at age 60–64 years [^116eJSNY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is replacing cytology in primary cervical cancer screening in several countries. This test is considered a superior alternative to cytology because women with a negative HPV test result are less likely to develop progressive high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer than women with negative cytology.

European cervical screening programs first started preparing for national rollouts of HPV testing in the early 2010s. For example, the Dutch Health Council issued that advice in 2011, and a national rollout for women targeted by the program, aged 30–60 years, started in early 2017. The first Italian HPV pilots, predominantly involving women aged 35–64, commenced in 2012, and the Ministry of Health recommended a wider rollout in 2013. In England, a large pilot was initiated in 2013, and the national rollout for women aged 25–64 years was completed in December 2019. The Danish Health Authority recommended a switch from cytology to HPV-based screening in 2012, although the advice at that time applied only to women aged 60–64 years.

With approximately 30 cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 women (world age-standardized rate), Denmark used to have one of the highest incidence rates in Europe. This incidence rate decreased to approximately 10 per 100,000 after population-based screening was introduced in the 1960s. The prevalence of HPV infections, however, remains high. This high prevalence was a significant point in the discussions underpinning the 2012 screening recommendations.

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^115cQMYt]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The NHS Cervical Screening Programme in England invites women aged 25–49 years for screening by cytology every three years and women aged 50–64 years every five years. Cervical cytology over age 65 is rare, representing 0.8% of all tests taken in England. Cytology-based, organized cervical screening was introduced in England in 1988. HPV triage of low-grade cytological abnormalities was introduced in 2012. Between 2013 and 2019, a pilot for HPV primary testing was conducted in which about 5% of women nationally were screened by primary HPV testing with cytology triage or HPV genotyping. HPV primary testing was implemented nationally at the end of December 2019.

Since April 2007, there has been a national cervical screening audit in England. Data on screening histories were abstracted from routinely recorded cervical cytology records held on the Cervical Screening Call/Recall System. This system includes all NHS and many private provider smears taken in England since 1988. The following information was available for each test: date, results, and action taken in response to the test result (i.e. routine recall, early recall, or referral). It does not include information on potential confounders such as smoking or ethnicity. The data used here were taken from the November 2019 anonymised dataset released for research purposes by Public Health England's Office for Data Release.

In this study, cases were women diagnosed with a primary invasive cervical cancer in England between April 2007 and March 2018 at ages 60–84 years who were registered with an NHS general practitioner.

### The risk of developing cervical cancer in the elderly: who benefits from screening after the age of 60 [^113KnqPm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Regular screening participation has been shown to reduce cervical cancer incidence by 82%, and mortality caused by cervical cancer by 92% for people who participate in screening. The American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening cessation at 65 years old with 10 prior years of normal screening. The NHS cervical screening program in the United Kingdom screens people up to 64 years. The Dutch screening program only screens people up to 60 years old. It can be debated if this age should be adjusted to 65 or even up to 70 years of age, or whether identification and screening of specific risk groups above a certain age is more sensible.

Comparing different studies from different countries and time periods is challenging because of the global differences and time-related changes in cervical cancer screening. A recent Danish study has shown that of all people with cervical cancer, 18.2% had been sufficiently screened and were eligible to stop screening according to the IARC recommendations, and about 40% of people with a cervix in the United Kingdom developing cervical cancer at age 65 or over had been screened regularly and were discharged from the program with normal cytology results. Different European studies have reported that 25%–40% of people with cervical cancer have never been screened before their diagnosis. Castanon et al. showed that the risk of developing cervical cancer at older age is related to the previous screening participation and screening results, with the highest.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American Cancer Society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^117W3N9d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) released updated cervical cancer screening guidelines in 2020 that endorse a shift in practice to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in people with a cervix, beginning at ages 25–65 years. When access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not available, the ACS offers cotesting or cytology as acceptable alternative strategies but suggests that these testing modalities may be excluded from future iterations of the guidelines.

The ASCCP recognizes the benefits and risks of primary HPV cervical cancer screening while acknowledging the barriers to widespread adoption, including implementation issues, the impact of limited HPV vaccination in the United States, and inclusion of populations who may not be well represented in primary HPV screening trials, such as underrepresented minorities.

The ASCCP endorses the 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement and supports the ACS cervical cancer screening guidelines. Most importantly, the ASCCP endorses any cervical cancer screening for secondary prevention of cervical cancer and recommends interventions that improve screening for those who are underscreened or unscreened.

### Impact of screening between the ages of 60 and 64 on cumulative rates of cervical cancer to age 84y by screening history at ages 50 to 59: A population-based case-control study [^111vj25e]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of cervical cancer was greatest in individuals with a previous abnormal screen between ages 50 and 59, and no tests conducted between ages 60 and 64; 10.01 in every 1000 developed cervical cancer over 25 years. Among those with an abnormal screen aged 50–59, the difference in risk over 25 years between women screened aged 60–64 and women not screened at that age was 4.34 per 1000 women, equivalent to one fewer cancer for every 230 women screened.

- **Absolute 25-year risk**: 8.40 in 1000 (95% CI: 7.78–9.07) women without a screening test between ages 50 and 64 developed cervical cancer over this period. Women with no tests at ages 50–59, but with a single test between ages 60 and 64, had a risk of 3.46 per 1000 (95% CI: 2.7–4.36). The absolute difference in risk is equivalent to one fewer cancer for every 202 women screened.

- **Among well-screened women**: Those with a test at ages 60–64 (i.e. those with a negative screening test both at ages 50–54 and 55–59 and no abnormal screen aged 50–59) had an incidence rate of 1.59 per 1000 (95% CI: 1.42–1.78) developing cervical cancer over the next 25 years. An additional test at ages 60–64 in well-screened women aged 50–59 was associated with one fewer cancer over the next 25 years per 1587 women.

Analysis restricted to case-control pairs matched on general practice as well as age yielded similar results. Results by age group at diagnosis showed the convergence of absolute risks.

### Practice bulletin no. 168 summary: Cervical cancer screening and prevention [^115toAWn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of cervical cancer in the United States has decreased more than 50% in the past 30 years due to widespread screening. In 1975, the rate was 14.8 per 100,000 women; by 2011, it decreased to 6.7 per 100,000 women. Mortality from the disease similarly decreased from 5.55 per 100,000 women in 1975 to 2.3 per 100,000 women in 2011.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimated that there would be 12,900 new cases of cervical cancer in the United States in 2015, with 4,100 deaths from the disease. Cervical cancer is much more common worldwide, particularly in countries without screening programs, with an estimated 527,624 new cases of the disease and 265,672 resultant deaths each year.

When cervical cancer screening programs have been introduced to communities, marked reductions in cervical cancer incidence have followed. New technologies for cervical cancer screening continue to evolve, as do recommendations for managing results. There are different risk-benefit considerations for women at different ages, as reflected in age-specific screening recommendations.

In 2011, the ACS, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) updated their joint guidelines for cervical cancer screening, as did the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Subsequently, in 2015, ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) issued interim guidance for the use of a human papillomavirus (HPV) test for primary screening for cervical cancer.

### Cervical cancer screening among women without a cervix [^112a6ayj]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Most US women who have undergone hysterectomy are not at risk of cervical cancer because they underwent the procedure for benign disease and no longer have a cervix. In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that routine Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening is unnecessary for these women.

- **Objective**: To determine whether Pap smear screening among women who have undergone hysterectomy has decreased following the recommendation.

- **Design**: We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1992–2002), an annual, population-based telephone survey of US adults conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data about timing, type, and indication for hysterectomies were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and other sources.

- **Study participants**: In each year of the survey, a representative sample of US women 18 years and older who had undergone hysterectomy (combined n = 188,390) was studied.

- **Main outcome measure**: The main outcome was the proportion of women with a history of hysterectomy who reported a Pap smear within 3 years. Overall proportions are age adjusted to the 2002 US female population.

- **Results**: Twenty-two million US women 18 years and older have undergone hysterectomy, representing 21% of the population. The proportion of these women who reported a Pap smear did not change during the 10-year study period. In 1992, before the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, 68.5% of women who had undergone hysterectomy reported having had a Pap smear in the past 3 years.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: Introduction to the scope and process [^11722Pcd]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dissemination and implementation of new recommendations**: The dissemination and implementation efforts of the Enduring Guidelines process revolve around making recommendations and supporting evidence widely available and facilitating the integration of new recommendations into clinical decision tools, recognizing the increasing complexity of cervical screening and management guidelines. Once recommendations have been finalized and approved by the Enduring Guidelines stakeholder group, a manuscript will be drafted, usually by members of the respective working group, edited, approved by the Enduring Guidelines group, and submitted for publication. After completion of the peer-review process and acceptance of the manuscript, and as soon as the accepted publication is publicly accessible, either as an online advance publication or in a print issue, the recommendations are considered official, which is particularly important for the integration of new recommendations into clinical decision tools that require a published recommendation and data source.

	- To ensure that clinical recommendations for new technologies and approaches are disseminated and reach target audiences, particularly practitioners, successfully, the Enduring Guidelines group will make several important efforts:
	1. Guidelines manuscripts will be made available as open-access publications to ensure widespread and immediate access to recommendations and supporting evidence.

	2. New recommendations and supporting risk data will be published on the Enduring Guidelines web pages, allowing easy access to risk data and recommendations.

### Human papillomavirus testing in the last cervical screening round at age 60–64 years [^114WG6ab]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Among 1,770 women undergoing a colposcopy following a positive test result during the HPV testing period, CIN 2 or worse was diagnosed in 267 (15.1%). Among 1,331 women undergoing a colposcopy after abnormal cytology, 373 (28.0%) had a CIN 2 or worse diagnosis. The detection of CIN 2 or worse, measured as the proportion of all screened women, increased from 0.3% with cytology to 0.5% with HPV testing (relative frequency 1.54, 95% CI 1.31–1.80). For CIN 3 or worse, the detection increased from 0.2% to 0.4% (relative frequency 1.52, 95% CI 1.27–1.82). An increase in the detection of CIN 2 or worse could be observed in each region (data not shown). An additional 73 women had a diagnosis of CIN not otherwise specified during the HPV screening period and 70 during the cytology period (not tabulated). In the main analysis presented in Table 2, diagnoses of CIN not otherwise specified were combined with less than CIN 2. Even if all of these diagnoses represented high-grade CIN (CIN 2 or worse), the relative frequency for detection with HPV testing compared with cytology would remain similarly elevated, 1.65 (95% CI 1.43–1.90).

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American Cancer Society [^114z1TnQ]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cervical cancer, the ACS 2020 guidelines recommend discontinuing cervical cancer screening for patients with a cervix aged over 65 years. This recommendation applies to those with no history of CIN grade 2 or a more severe diagnosis within the past 25 years and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the 10-year period before turning 65 years old.
