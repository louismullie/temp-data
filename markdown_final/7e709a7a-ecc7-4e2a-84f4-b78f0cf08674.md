## Question

A 9-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis (CF) presents to the clinic with fever, increased sputum production, and cough. The vital signs include: temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 103/min, and respiratory rate 22/min. His physical examination is significant for short stature, thin body frame, decreased breath sounds bilateral, and a 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard best on the upper right sternal border. His pulmonary function tests are at his baseline, and his sputum cultures reveal Pseudomonas aeruginosa. What is the best treatment option for this patient?
A. Inhaled tobramycin for 28 days
B. Dornase alfa 2.5 mg as a single-use
C. Oral cephalexin for 14 days
D. Minocycline for 28 days

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment option for a 9-year-old with cystic fibrosis who has a new isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and symptoms consistent with a pulmonary exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this represents a new or chronic Pseudomonas infection and whether eradication therapy is indicated. Then, I should verify the guideline-recommended first-line eradication regimen and duration. Next, I will examine the evidence supporting inhaled tobramycin versus alternatives like oral ciprofloxacin plus inhaled colistin. After that, I need to consider how concurrent exacerbation symptoms modify management, including whether to add IV therapy. Finally, I will review why the other answer choices are inappropriate and outline follow-up and monitoring plans, including culture surveillance and what to do if eradication fails.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification of infection. The vignette states the sputum culture reveals Pseudomonas aeruginosa without prior history, which in cystic fibrosis is treated as initial or newly acquired infection rather than chronic infection, and this is precisely the scenario in which eradication therapy is strongly recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to prevent establishment of chronic infection and mitigate lung function decline [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV] [^113QaVuL].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-endorsed first-line regimen and duration. The CFF strongly recommends inhaled antibiotic therapy for initial or new growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with the favored regimen being inhaled tobramycin 300 mg twice daily for 28 days, and this is supported by multiple trials and systematic reviews showing high rates of microbiologic clearance and sustained freedom from infection in many patients [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV] [^114MQyaS].

> I should confirm the comparative evidence for inhaled tobramycin versus other eradication strategies. Randomized trials and Cochrane reviews indicate that inhaled tobramycin is superior to placebo for early eradication, and that several active regimens, including tobramycin alone or colistin plus ciprofloxacin, achieve broadly similar eradication success without clear superiority of one over another, supporting tobramycin monotherapy as an acceptable and guideline-preferred first choice in many centers [^114MQyaS] [^111iRMUR] [^1148PFF4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding oral ciprofloxacin up front. I initially thought that because the child has fever and increased sputum, adding oral ciprofloxacin to inhaled tobramycin might be warranted for a more aggressive eradication approach; however, I should double-check the evidence. The ELITE trial showed no additional benefit of extending inhaled tobramycin from 28 to 56 days, and comparative trials have not demonstrated superiority of adding oral ciprofloxacin to inhaled tobramycin for eradication, so routine addition of ciprofloxacin is not necessary for initial eradication in this scenario unless there are special circumstances or treatment failure [^1126nihQ] [^114MQyaS] [^111iRMUR].

> Next, I should review how concurrent exacerbation symptoms influence management. The presence of fever, increased cough, and sputum production indicates a pulmonary exacerbation superimposed on new Pseudomonas acquisition; standard practice is to continue or intensify airway clearance, ensure adequate nutrition and hydration, and treat the exacerbation while simultaneously pursuing eradication of the new Pseudomonas isolate, with escalation to IV antipseudomonal therapy if the child fails to improve or deteriorates clinically [^111fLFHF] [^113Gt9Si].

> I need to ensure the other answer choices are appropriately excluded. Dornase alfa is a chronic mucolytic therapy and is not an antibiotic for eradication of Pseudomonas, so Option B is incorrect for this acute indication. Oral cephalexin lacks antipseudomonal activity and would not eradicate Pseudomonas, making Option C inappropriate. Minocycline is not a recommended agent for Pseudomonas eradication in cystic fibrosis and lacks supportive guideline endorsement for this indication, so Option D should not be selected [^notfound].

> Let me consider follow-up and monitoring. After completing 28 days of inhaled tobramycin, I should obtain repeat airway cultures to document microbiologic clearance, and if cultures remain positive or symptoms persist, I should reassess for adherence, airway obstruction, or biofilm-related issues and consider a second eradication attempt using an alternative regimen such as inhaled colistin plus oral ciprofloxacin, with bronchoscopy reserved for atypical courses or diagnostic uncertainty rather than routine use [^116Mt37j] [^112pZ8VS] [^116Fe7xz].

> I should confirm that the final recommendation aligns with high-grade guidance. The best treatment option for this 9-year-old with cystic fibrosis and a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is inhaled tobramycin 300 mg twice daily for 28 days, with supportive care for the exacerbation and close follow-up to verify eradication and adjust therapy if needed, which matches a Grade A recommendation from the CFF and is supported by randomized trials and systematic reviews [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV] [^114MQyaS].

---

The best treatment for a 9-year-old with CF and new Pseudomonas aeruginosa is **inhaled tobramycin for 28 days** [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV] because it is the **first-line eradication therapy** [^117CTbgb] with high success and favorable safety [^114MQyaS]. Oral cephalexin is inactive against Pseudomonas [^notfound], minocycline is inferior and not recommended [^notfound], and dornase alfa is for chronic maintenance, not acute infection [^notfound]. If symptoms persist or recur, consider adding oral ciprofloxacin or repeating inhaled tobramycin [^116Mt37j].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting inhaled tobramycin

- **First-line therapy**: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) strongly recommends inhaled tobramycin 300 mg twice daily for 28 days as first-line eradication therapy for new Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in CF [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV].

- **High eradication rates**: Clinical trials show 75–100% microbiological eradication with inhaled tobramycin, significantly higher than placebo or no treatment [^111cuqfL] [^116J7RcL].

- **Long-term benefits**: Eradication delays chronic infection, preserves lung function, and reduces exacerbations and hospitalizations [^116QPcxN] [^113QaVuL].

- **Safety profile**: Inhaled tobramycin is well tolerated; the main adverse effect is transient cough or wheeze, and ototoxicity is rare with inhaled use.

## Comparison with alternative treatments

| **Treatment option** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Inhaled tobramycin | High eradication (75–100%) | Well tolerated | First-line [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV] |
| Oral cephalexin | Inactive against Pseudomonas | Not applicable | Not recommended [^notfound] |
| Minocycline | Inferior efficacy | Potential adverse effects | Not recommended [^notfound] |
| Dornase alfa | Not for acute infection | Not applicable | Not recommended [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

The CFF and European CF Society recommend **inhaled tobramycin for 28 days** as standard eradication therapy for new Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in CF [^117DL99W] [^112ehR6Y]. If eradication fails or infection recurs, consider **additional inhaled or oral antibiotics**, such as ciprofloxacin or colistin [^112Bk5aa] [^116Mt37j].

---

## Clinical considerations for pediatric patients

Pediatric-specific factors include **weight-based dosing** and attention to adherence and tolerability; inhaled tobramycin is effective and safe in children, with dosing adjusted to weight and nebulizer efficiency. Adherence is critical — regular use and proper technique are essential for success [^115Aq2B8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Inhaled tobramycin for 28 days is the **best treatment** for a 9-year-old with CF and new Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, with high eradication rates, favorable safety, and strong guideline support [^117DL99W] [^111d2mTV].

### Recent advances in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis [^112CFZP6]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is caused by biofilm-growing mucoid strains. Biofilms can be prevented by early aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis or therapy, and they can be treated by chronic suppressive therapy. New results from one small trial suggest that addition of oral ciprofloxacin to inhaled tobramycin may reduce lung inflammation. Clinical trials with new formulations of old antibiotics for inhalation therapy (aztreonam lysine) against chronic P. aeruginosa infection improved patient-reported outcome, lung function, time to acute exacerbations and sputum density of P. aeruginosa. Other drugs such as quinolones are currently under investigation for inhalation therapy. A trial of the use of anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics for long-term prophylaxis showed no effect in patients who were not already infected. Use of azithromycin to treat CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection did not improve lung function. Here I review the recent advances in the treatment of P. aeruginosa lung infections with a focus on inhalation treatments targeted at prophylaxis and chronic suppressive therapy.

### Standard versus biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis [^115B2egr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The antibiotics used to treat pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis are typically chosen based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on bacteria traditionally grown in a planktonic mode (grown in a liquid). However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Pseudomonas aeruginosa actually grows in a biofilm (or slime layer) in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis with chronic pulmonary infections. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on biofilm rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To compare biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing-driven therapy to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing-driven therapy in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Most recent search: 19 June 2017. We also searched two ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Most recent searches: 24 August 2017 and 05 September 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of antibiotic therapy based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data from eligible trials. Additionally, the review authors contacted the trial investigators to obtain further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The searches identified two multicentre, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials eligible for inclusion in the review with a total of 78 participants (adults and children); one trial was done in people who were clinically stable, the other in people experiencing pulmonary exacerbations. These trials prospectively assessed whether the use of biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing improved microbiological and clinical outcomes in participants with cystic fibrosis who were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary outcome was the change in sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa density from the beginning to the end of antibiotic therapy. Although the intervention was shown to be safe, the data from these two trials did not provide evidence that biofilm susceptibility testing was superior to conventional susceptibility testing either in terms of microbiological or lung function outcomes. One of the trials also measured risk and time to subsequent exacerbation as well as quality of life measures and did not demonstrate any difference between groups in these outcomes. Both trials had an overall low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria was deemed to be moderate to high for the outcomes selected.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence is insufficient to recommend choosing antibiotics based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be more appropriate in the development of newer, more effective formulations of drugs which can then be tested in clinical trials.

### Pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis [^115L98JJ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The chronic infection and inflammation of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease causes a progressive decline of lung function resulting in daily symptoms such as cough and sputum production. There are intermittent episodes of acute worsening of symptoms, more commonly referred to as pulmonary exacerbations. Despite this being a common event, there is still no standardized definition of an exacerbation. A recent set of guidelines from the CF Foundation Pulmonary Therapies Committee on the treatment of exacerbations noted the paucity of data supporting commonly used therapies. This review describes our current understanding of pulmonary exacerbations and the therapies used to treat them.

Recent Findings

The treatment of an exacerbation is intended to resolve the worsened symptoms and to restore the lung function that is commonly lost in the acute presentation. A most striking finding is the observation that for many patients there is no restoration of lung function, suggesting we either need better therapies to prevent exacerbations or better treatment of exacerbations.

Summary

We have established recommendations on specific treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation and have outlined the areas where we need better information on appropriate therapies. Once we have a standardized definition of an exacerbation, we can proceed with clinical trials of therapies specific for its treatment.

### Treatments for preventing recurrence of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^113EP2dK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is a source of much morbidity and mortality. Eradication of early PA infection is possible, but can recur in many individuals. We sought to examine strategies to delay the time to PA recurrence in people with CF.

Objectives

To establish whether secondary prevention strategies, using antibiotics or other therapies, increase the chances of people with CF remaining free from PA infection following successful eradication therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 August 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (and quasi-randomised trials where the risk of bias was low) comparing any treatment modality aimed at preventing recurrence of PA infection with placebo, standard therapy or any other treatment modality in people with CF who have undergone successful eradication of PA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Conflicts were resolved by discussion and the opinion of a third review author was sought where necessary. Only a subset of participants in the included trial were eligible, therefore individual participant data were requested and obtained from the trial investigators.

Main Results

We included one trial (n = 306) in the review; however, only 253 participants had undergone successful eradication of PA, so fulfilling the inclusion criteria for our review. Information presented relates only to the included subset of participants. The trial recruited children aged one to 12 years (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 5.8 (3.5) years), 129 participants (51.0%) were female and the median follow-up was 494 days. We compared cycled therapy with tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS), in which participants underwent 28 days of TIS every three months, with culture-based therapy, in which participants were only prescribed medication when a quarterly sputum sample was positive for PA. Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included applicability (only included children), incomplete outcome data and a small number of participants. The time to next isolation of PA was probably shorter with cycled TIS therapy than with culture-based therapy, hazard ratio (HR) 2.04 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.26) (moderate-quality evidence). This is in contrast to the main publication of the only included trial, which examined rate of PA positivity rather than time to PA infection and included participants not eligible for inclusion in this review. At the end of the trial, there was no difference between the cycled and culture-based groups in the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) L, mean difference (MD) 0.0 L (95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) or in FEV 1% predicted, MD 0.70% (95% CI -4.33 to 5.73) (both very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the change from baseline for FVC between the groups. There was also no difference in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations between groups, MD -0.18 (95% CI -0.51 to 0.14) (moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the risk of participants developing novel resistant bacteria, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.5) (moderate-quality evidence). There were more severe adverse events in the cycled group, but the type of treatment probably makes little or no difference to the results, RR 0.65 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.11) (moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the change in weight or height from baseline or in rates of adherence to tobramycin or all trial medicines. The included trial did not assess changes in quality of life, the time to chronic infection with PA or the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Cycled TIS therapy may be beneficial in prolonging the time to recurrence of PA after successful eradication, but further trials are required, specifically addressing this question and in both adults and children.

### Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy for cystic fibrosis [^113D6tMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections are the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. When sputum samples are unavailable, treatment relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns regarding the sensitivity of these to identify lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures (including bronchoalveolar lavage) though invasive, allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non-sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may help in a more accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and guide the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the use of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of latest search: 30 August 2018. We also searched three registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 10 April 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled studies including people of any age with cystic fibrosis, comparing outcomes following therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (and related procedures) with outcomes following therapies guided by the results of any other type of sampling (including cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The search identified 11 studies, but we only included one study enrolling infants with cystic fibrosis under six months of age and diagnosed through newborn screening (170 enrolled); participants were followed until they were five years old (data from 157 children). The study compared outcomes following therapy directed by bronchoalveolar lavage for pulmonary exacerbations with standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. We considered this study to have a low risk of bias; however, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was limited due to the prevalence (of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples at five years age) being much lower in both the groups compared to that which was expected and which was used for the power calculation. The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in high-resolution computed tomography scoring. The quality of evidence for the key parameters was graded as low except high-resolution computed tomography scoring and cost of care analysis, which were graded as moderate quality. At five years of age, there was no clear benefit of bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy on lung function z scores or nutritional parameters. Evaluation of total and component high-resolution computed tomography scores showed no significant difference in evidence of structural lung disease in the two groups. In addition, this study did not show any difference between the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per child per year diagnosed in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group compared to the standard therapy group. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment was comparable in the two groups, as were the number of pulmonary exacerbations. However, the number of hospitalizations was significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group, but the mean duration of hospitalizations was significantly less compared to the standard therapy group. Mild adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants, but these were generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4.8% of procedures.

Authors' Conclusions

This review, limited to a single, well-designed randomized controlled study, shows no clear evidence to support the routine use of bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in pre-school children with cystic fibrosis compared to the standard practice of providing treatment based on results of oropharyngeal culture and clinical symptoms. No evidence was available for adult and adolescent populations.

### Comparison of two treatment regimens for eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in children with cystic fibrosis [^1148PFF4]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), treatment of new Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection postpones the occurrence of chronic infection, but the best eradication regimen is unknown.

Aim Of The Study

Compare 2 Pa eradication regimens in children with new Pa infection.

Methods

Children with CF (0–18 years) and a new isolation of Pa from sputum, cough swab or BAL were randomized to treatment with tobramycin inhalation solution for 28 days (TIS) or inhaled sodiumcolistimethate (2×2millU/day) plus oral ciprofloxacin (30 mg/kg/day) for 3 months (CC). Airway cultures were taken for 6 consecutive months, then every 3 months. The primary outcome was Pa eradication at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome parameters were: time to Pa relapse from end of treatment, total and Pa specific IgG, FEV(1), BMI and Pa status at 2year follow-up.

Results

58 patients with new Pa isolation were randomized. Their median age was 9 years (IQR 4.7–13.1) and their median FEV(1) 98% predicted (IQR 87–107). Eighteen treatments concerned the first Pa isolation 'ever' (TIS: 8; CC: 10). For the remaining, median time since previous Pa was 19 months (IQR 9–41). Eradication at end of treatment was similar for both treatments: 26/29 CC and 23/29 in TOBI treated patients (p = 0.47). Median time to recurrence of Pa was 9 months (95% CI 0.0–19.0) for CC and 5 months (95% CI 1.7–8.3) for TIS (p = 0.608). After 1 year, the 2 groups did not differ in change in total and Pa specific IgG, FEV(1) and BMI. After 2 years, 10% of patients had chronic Pa infection.

Conclusion

In children with CF and new Pa infection, inhalation of TIS (28 days) or CC (3 months) resulted in similar eradication success at the end of treatment (80 and 90% respectively) and similar clinical evolution during the first 2 years of follow-up.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^115Aq2B8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis chronic medications — future research questions focus on timing of initiation, CFTR-modulating agents, self-management burden, and inhaled antibiotic schedules. It would seem logical that medications with potential to alter the course of the disease should be initiated at diagnosis or shortly thereafter, yet evaluating medications in young children or those with mild lung disease is challenging due to difficulty in objective measurement of lung disease progression. For CFTR modulation, a new responsibility for CF health care professionals will be to manage expectations of efficacy; even if CFTR function can be returned to near-normal levels, residual damage will likely necessitate continuation of many current therapies, and individuals participating in studies of ivacaftor continued routine therapies with the exception of hypertonic saline. The burden of additional therapies may yield diminishing returns by decreasing an individual's ability to successfully manage any particular therapy, and decreased adherence is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and diminished lung function. For P. aeruginosa infection, individuals typically administer inhaled antibiotics via 28-day, every-other-month cycles; however, it is unknown if this is the best approach, and as more antibiotics become available it will be possible to provide continuous therapy by cycling multiple inhaled antibiotics, so studies are needed to determine optimal initiation and continuation to enhance lung function and minimize bacterial resistance.

### Safety and tolerability of bronchoscopic and nebulised administration of bacteriophage [^116QSH8H]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an organism well known for causing significant morbidity and mortality in people living with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis. We describe the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of bronchoscopic and nebulised bacteriophage administration, offering insights into a potential breakthrough for the treatment of chronic infections particularly in children and adolescents.

Method

A 12-year-old female (F12) and a 17-year-old male (M17), both diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection, underwent bacteriophage treatment (BT). The administration involved bronchoscopic instillation and subsequent nebulisation. This was performed concurrently with intravenous antibiotics and regular physiotherapy delivered in an in-patient setting for 14 days. Microbiological, clinical, and lung function assessments were conducted to assess this treatment modality.

Results

No adverse events (fever, localised reaction, wheeze or bronchospasm) occurred during BT. F12 demonstrated a 4% increase, while M17 showed a 5% improvement in FEV1% from their best FEV1% over the past three years following BT. A 12% (F12) and an 8% (M17) improvement from baseline FEV1% was observed. For F12 P. aeruginosa was not isolated from her sputum despite 12 previous hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics.

Conclusion

Bronchoscopic and nebulised routes of bacteriophage administration were well-tolerated in these two adolescents. This early report underscores the potential of this treatment modality and encourages clinicians and researchers to actively explore this innovative approach.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^113Gt9Si]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical considerations for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: Individuals infected with P. aeruginosa who have significant symptoms or those who are experiencing an exacerbation may require additional therapies beyond inhaled tobramycin, and although bronchoscopy is not recommended for obtaining routine cultures, it can be a valuable tool in individuals who fail to respond as expected to therapy and in other clinical settings.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^112MLFgF]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline — prophylactic antibiotics to prevent acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: In a randomized controlled trial, 65 children without P. aeruginosa for at least 2 years received inhaled colistin (1 million IU twice daily) and oral ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg/d) versus placebo for 3 weeks every 3 months for 3 years; treatment with colistin and ciprofloxacin did not reduce the risk of initial or chronic infection, with infection in Thirty-two percent (10/31) of placebo and 26% (9/34) of treated children, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.736 (95% CI, 0.299–1.822; P = 0.510). Antibiotic prophylaxis increased recovery of additional nonfermenting, gram-negative pathogens (P = 0.0094). Considering cycled therapy as prophylaxis, the EPIC trial did not demonstrate a benefit to routinely treating children with inhaled tobramycin, with or without oral ciprofloxacin, compared with treating only when P. aeruginosa was cultured. The committee did not find any benefit of routine use of antibiotics in preventing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa and cautioned that the prolonged use of antipseudomonal antibiotics may increase the risk of acquiring other potential pathogens.

### Pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis: young children with characteristic signs and symptoms [^114VCqum]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A standard definition of pulmonary exacerbation based on signs and symptoms would be useful for categorizing cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and as an outcome measure of therapy. The frequently used definition of treatment with intravenous antibiotics varies with practice patterns. One approach to this problem is to use large data sets which include a patient's signs and symptoms along with their clinician's decision to treat with antibiotics for the diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation. Previous analysis of such a data set, the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF), found that new crackles, increased cough, increased sputum, and weight decline were the four clinical characteristics most strongly influencing providers to treat young CF patients for a pulmonary exacerbation. The objectives of this study were to confirm that these four characteristics influence the decision to treat with antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation in young CF patients; to evaluate their implications for future nutritional status and lung function; and to assess the effect of antibiotic treatment on these characteristic signs and symptoms.

Methods

This was an observational, longitudinal cohort study of clinical care in children < 6 years old cared for at sites participating in ESCF.

Results

Using data from children not included in the previous ESCF study, we confirmed that these four characteristics were significantly associated with the likelihood of physicians prescribing antibiotics to treat a pulmonary exacerbation. The number of these characteristics present at a single clinic visit before age 6 predicted hospitalization rate over the next year, the weight-for-age z-score, and the forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) percent predicted at age 7. Treatment with antibiotics was associated with a greater decrease in the proportion of children with crackles, cough, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a follow-up visit within 6 months.

Conclusions

New crackles, increased cough, increased sputum, and decline in weight percentile at a single clinic visit increase the risk of future malnutrition, hospitalization, and airflow obstruction in young children with CF. Treatment with antibiotics mitigates some of these signs and symptoms by the first follow-up visit. The presence of these four characteristic signs and symptoms is useful to define pulmonary exacerbations in young children with CF that respond to antibiotic treatment in the short-term and influence long-term prognosis.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines. chronic medications for maintenance of lung health [^1133P57M]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for cystic fibrosis, more specifically with respect to inhaled tobramycin, CFF 2013 guidelines recommend to offer the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin to improve lung function and QoL, and reduce exacerbations for patients with CF, ≥ 6 years of age, with moderate-to-severe lung disease and P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways.

Regarding medical management for cystic fibrosis, more specifically with respect to prophylactic azithromycin, CFF 2013 guidelines recommend to implement chronic azithromycin therapy to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations for patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways.

Proesmans et al. — in children with first-time or recent Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth, 28 days of inhaled tobramycin (300 mg twice daily) versus 3 months of inhaled colistin (2 million IU twice daily) plus oral ciprofloxacin (30 mg/kg/d) yielded similar end-of-treatment eradication (79.3% vs. 89.6%; P = 0.47) and similar time to recurrence (5 months [95% CI, 1.7–8.3 mo] vs 9 months [95% CI, 0.0–19.0 mo]; log rank P = 0.61), with similar clinical outcomes and infection status at 2 years.

### Prospective evaluation of respiratory exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis from newborn screening to 5 years of age [^114RDfDw]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, 170 children were enrolled (86 to standard group, 84 receiving allocated intervention, and 84 to the BAL group) at a mean age of 3.6 (SD 1.6) months with 157 (77 standard group and 80 BAL group, 92% of the total) completing the study.

There were 2080 respiratory exacerbations in 166 children (range 0–29 per child), an incidence rate of 3.66 episodes per person-year. Of these, 1667 (80.1%) in 164 children were community managed (93.4% had antibiotics) and 413 (19.9%) in 133 children required hospitalisation. The median duration was 22 days (IQR 14–38) for community-managed exacerbations and 50 days (IQR 26–85) for hospital-admission episodes (p < 0.001). Longer duration was also seen in those with a history of P aeruginosa 'ever' (median 28 days, IQR 15–50) versus those from whom it had never been isolated (median 22 days, IQR 14–42, p = 0.002).

On average, the exacerbation rate increased by 9% (95% CI 4% to 14%; p < 0.001) per year of age and there was an association between site and both total and 'doctor reported' exacerbations (table 1). Similarly, children who received early antibiotic prophylaxis had lower exacerbation rates over the whole study period than those without prophylaxis. This practice was determined by site, so the apparent effect of prophylaxis cannot be separated from other factors that might have differed between sites. No evidence for differences in total exacerbation rates was observed by randomised treatment group (BAL vs standard), gender or home environment (maternal smoking or parental education levels). There was a trend towards a higher rate among those ever positive for P aeruginosa, and a history of a positive P aeruginosa culture was the only factor clearly associated with increased risk of hospital admission for a respiratory exacerbation (table 1). The latter is not surprising as a positive culture triggered hospitalisation for eradication treatment.

### Optimizing outcomes of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis [^113zbA3Q]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary exacerbations are described as worsening of the daily symptoms of cystic fibrosis airways disease, typically with increased cough and sputum production. There are often associated signs such as weight loss and reduced lung function. These events occur frequently and are associated with considerable cost and morbidity. Although approved maintenance therapies are shown to reduce exacerbations, they still occur and are associated with poor outcomes despite treatment. Guidelines to define best practices found a paucity of evidence upon which to base recommendations.

Recent Findings

There are ongoing studies that are trying to build the evidence upon which to improve our practice. Antibiotics remain a core aspect of treatment, but there is high variance in practice patterns including selection of antibiotics and duration of therapy. In addition, there is a discordance between antibiotic susceptibility test results and clinical outcomes, suggesting we need better approaches to guide antibiotic selection.

Summary

Treatment durations are highly variable but recent evidence has demonstrated worse outcomes with shorter durations; longer durations may be associated with complications of treatment, suggesting an optimal duration could be identified. New studies aim to define best practices to improve outcomes with treatment of pulmonary exacerbations.

### Cystic fibrosis: a diagnosis in an adolescent [^111kKoYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop multisystemic clinical manifestations, the minority having mild or atypical symptoms. We describe an adolescent with chronic cough and purulent rhinorrhoea since the first year of life, with diagnoses of asthma, allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Under therapy with long-acting bronchodilators, antihistamines, inhaled corticosteroids, antileukotrienes and several courses of empirical oral antibiotic therapy, there was no clinical improvement. There was no reference to gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to clinical worsening, extended investigations were initiated, which revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture, sweat test with a positive result and heterozygosity for F508del and R334W mutations in genetic study which allowed to confirm the diagnosis of CF. In this case, heterozygosity with a class IV mutation can explain the atypical clinical presentation. It is very important to consider this diagnosis when chronic symptoms persist, despite optimised therapy for other respiratory pathologies and in case of isolation of atypical bacterial agents.

### First time identification of pandoraea sputorum from a patient with cystic fibrosis in Argentina: a case report [^117J2LEY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 9-year-old boy who was diagnosed with CF at 29 months (heterozygous genotype F508del; sweat test positive: Na 74 mEq/l and Cl de 63 mEq/l.), was transferred to our CF unit with a 5 years history of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When the first microbiological cultures (always sputum samples) were performed in our laboratory in July 2014, P. sputorum was detected together with S. aureus, but was initially reported as S. maltophilia (Fig. 1). Previously, his pulmonary function test revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 83%, and the preceding respiratory exacerbations were treated empirically with ceftazidime, amikacin and with aerosolized tobramycin. From the time of the first isolation of P. sputorum and during the next 2 months, his clinical condition worsened and exacerbations with increased cough and secretions were observed. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4/20 mg/kg/day) plus ciprofloxacin (15 mg/kg/day) and with aerosolized colistin (2 million units twice daily), however, his lung function declined (FEV 1 45%). In June 2015, the patient showed exacerbations with a dramatic deterioration of his pulmonary function (FEV 1 27%). A combined therapy for three-weeks of imipenem (80 mg/kg/day), amikacin (40 mg/kg/day), and inhaled colistin was initiated. Consequently, his clinical condition improved with a significant reduction in sputum volume and cough (FEV 1 40%). Five months later, his clinical condition was stable. In April 2016, a new respiratory sample was positive for P. sputorum, confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, together with with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^116Mt37j]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — management when initial eradication of newly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa fails: Although inhaled tobramycin therapy is very effective, it is not always successful, so most clinicians would advocate additional therapy to attempt eradication before committing individuals to chronic suppressive antibiotics; additional or other inhaled, oral, or intravenous antibiotics could be a reasonable next step, deciding when to move from episodic eradication to chronic inhaled antibiotics is also important, and there are no studies directly addressing optimal subsequent therapy, though a European expert panel has proposed a potential framework for additional therapy when an initial eradication attempt fails.

### Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^111iRMUR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occur in most people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Established chronic P aeruginosa infection is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an updated review.

Objectives

Does giving antibiotics for P aeruginosa infection in people with CF at the time of new isolation improve clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, quality of life and morbidity), eradicate P aeruginosa infection, and delay the onset of chronic infection, but without adverse effects, compared to usual treatment or an alternative antibiotic regimen? We also assessed cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Latest search: 24 March 2022. We searched ongoing trials registries. Latest search: 6 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with CF, in whom P aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other antibiotic combinations. We excluded non-randomised trials and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral - ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled - tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV - ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for P aeruginosa at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; low-certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants). We are uncertain whether the odds of a positive culture decrease at 12 months (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67; 1 trial, 12 participants). TNS (28 days) versus TNS (56 days) One trial (88 participants) comparing 28 days to 56 days TNS treatment found duration of treatment may make little or no difference in time to next isolation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76; low-certainty evidence). Cycled TNS versus culture-based TNS One trial (304 children, one to 12 years old) compared cycled TNS to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. We found moderate-certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported age-adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy. There is probably no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo in eradicating P aeruginosa (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.44; moderate-certainty evidence). Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus TNS We are uncertain whether there is any difference between groups in eradication of P aeruginosa at up to six months (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.23; 1 trial, 58 participants) or up to 24 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.42; 1 trial, 47 participants); there was a low rate of short-term eradication in both groups. Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; low-certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating P aeruginosa after a three-month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI -24.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of P aeruginosa at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; high-certainty evidence). The results do not support using IV antibiotics over oral therapy to eradicate P aeruginosa, based on both eradication rate and financial cost.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with P aeruginosa. Eradication may be sustained in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these antibiotic strategies decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of P aeruginosa. One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used. There is still insufficient evidence to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early P aeruginosa infection in CF, but there is now evidence that intravenous therapy is not superior to oral antibiotics.

### A three-year longitudinal assessment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibiotic susceptibility in children with cystic fibrosis in the era of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy [^114scujh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease characterized by chronic lung infection, often with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, requiring repeated antibiotic treatment for pulmonary exacerbations. In the era of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy, we assessed susceptibility to antipseudomonal antibiotics in modulator-eligible and modulator-ineligible children over 3 years and found that P. aeruginosa isolates largely remained susceptible to standard parenteral but not oral antimicrobial agents.

### State of progress in treating cystic fibrosis respiratory disease [^116nFWuc]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aerosolized antibiotics

As stated earlier, there are several situations in which antibiotics are used to treat CF airways disease. Chronic prophylaxis primarily targets acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus in infants by use of oral flucloxacillin, but is used only regionally (primarily in the UK and Europe) based upon local experience and tradition, the differential weighting of apparently conflicting study results and drug availability. Newly detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa from throat cultures has been treated with inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics with or without concomitant oral ciprofloxacin and intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics. Although these interventions are routinely capable of converting > 80% of patients to P. aeruginosa culture negativity, the ultimate clinical benefit of delaying chronic P. aeruginosa infection with this approach has not been robustly demonstrated.

Ironically, the potentially most heretical use of antibiotics in CF, the chronic suppression of bacterial opportunists in the airway without their eradication, is the one with the greatest empirical evidence for clinical benefit. Chronic or chronic intermittent administration of the inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics colistimethate, tobramycin and aztreonam has been associated with improved quality of life, decreased risk of exacerbation, improved pulmonary function, and decreased mortality. This practice, which has expanded substantially in recent decades, was predated by scheduled, periodic treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics.

Patient survival

All 37 surviving children presented with the symptom of mild cough that was most evident in autumn and winter and during early morning and/or night. During treatment, attacks of respiratory tract infections were reduced from (4.49 ± 2.13)/year per patient to (1.97 ± 1.87)/year per patient (P < 0.05), as were severities of coughing and sputum production. However, these patients still experienced 1.62 ± 1.71 episodes of exacerbation per year that required oral, inhaled or intravenous antibiotics over the study follow-up period, although the severities of attacks in most children were lower than in non-survivors. Notably, 3 cases remained basically stable without additional treatment. Of the 28 children over 6 years of age, 17 (60.71%) completed lung function tests during follow-up, with normal results obtained for 9 children, while obstructions were found in the others, including 3 children with mild, three with moderate and 2 with severe obstructions. Nevertheless, after comparing follow-up results with results at diagnosis, no significant differences were observed in lung function (FEV 1: 82.45% ± 16.56% vs 75.26% ± 22.34%, FVC: 87.18% ± 13.64% vs 86.99% ± 19.95%, FEF 75%: 46.51% ± 28.78% vs 36.63% ± 24.30%, P = 0.27, 0.97, 0.20 respectively). Meanwhile, of 27 (72.97%) patients who provided sputum samples, 17 were infected with Pa and 6 harbored Staphylococcus aureus in airways during acute attacks. After treatment, Pa infection persisted in 14 cases, with new emergence detected in 3 cases and elimination of Pa in 5 cases. Patient mean body mass index was 16.87 ± 3.54 (ranging from 12.74 to 26.12), while pancreatic malfunction persisted in 15 children. Lung CT scans of 22 survivors revealed increased bronchiectasis in 6 cases after treatment for 2 months to 5 years, decreased bronchiectasis in 3 cases after treatment for 2 months to 8 years and no change in bronchiectasis in 13 cases after treatment for 5 months to 5 years. Ultimately, all 37 surviving children were able to tolerate mild physical exertion, with 33 of them even able to attend school. However, as compared to the 24 patients with good compliance, 4 patients with poor compliance did not experience worse clinical manifestations in our study. Assessments of all 37 children at follow-up after they received long-term treatment are shown in Table 3.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guideline for the management of CRMS / CFSPID [^116nKf8P]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

CRMS/CFSPID — respiratory cultures and CF-associated organisms: Airway infection with CF-associated microorganisms, specifically Pa, is considered a phenotypic feature supporting a CF diagnosis, and compared with the general population, people with CRMS/CFSPID exhibit a higher prevalence of Pa (10.7% to 78.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.9% to 10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (40% to 85%) in respiratory cultures. Among those who reclassify to CF, positive Pa culture results have been reported more often than among those who do not (33% vs 10%), yet a positive culture result alone does not warrant reclassification. Respiratory culture data from people with CRMS/CFSPID > 8 years of age are currently lacking; if persistent respiratory symptoms are present, obtaining respiratory cultures may be warranted, and cultures obtained via throat swab or sputum should be selectively offered after SDM with the family.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^112ehR6Y]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline — initial eradication regimens and duration for newly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa: An expert panel of the European CF Society has recommended the use of 28 days of inhaled tobramycin for the treatment of newly acquired P. aeruginosa, and the page states there is no clear evidence that a longer course of therapy or the addition of oral ciprofloxacin provides additional benefit, while it is unknown if other formulations of tobramycin, such as dry powder, are equally effective. The CF Trust in the United Kingdom recommends the use of inhaled colistin and oral ciprofloxacin for the treatment of newly acquired P. aeruginosa, and the committee believes that there is sufficient evidence to recommend this approach for adults as well. A recent retrospective cohort study supports the use of eradication therapy in adults.

### Standard versus biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis [^117YAXux]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians typically select the antibiotics used to treat pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on bacteria traditionally grown in a planktonic mode (grown in a liquid). However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Pseudomonas aeruginosa actually grows in a biofilm (or slime layer) in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis with chronic pulmonary infections. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on biofilm rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To compare biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing-driven therapy to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing-driven therapy in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. Most recent search: 07 April 2020. We also searched two ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Most recent searches: 07 April 2020 and 05 September 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotic therapy based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected RCTs, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data from eligible trials. Additionally, the review authors contacted the trial investigators to obtain further information. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The searches identified two multicentre, double-blind RCTs eligible for inclusion in the review with a total of 78 participants (adults and children); one RCT was undertaken in people who were clinically stable, the second was in people experiencing pulmonary exacerbations. Both RCTs prospectively assessed whether the use of biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing improved microbiological and clinical outcomes in participants with cystic fibrosis who were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The primary outcome was the change in sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa density from the beginning to the end of antibiotic therapy. Although the intervention was shown to be safe, the data from these two RCTs did not provide evidence that biofilm susceptibility testing was superior to conventional susceptibility testing either in terms of microbiological or lung function outcomes. One of the trials also measured risk and time to subsequent exacerbation as well as quality of life measures and did not demonstrate any difference between groups in these outcomes. Both RCTs had an overall low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria was deemed to be moderate to high for the outcomes selected.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence is insufficient to recommend choosing antibiotics based on biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing rather than conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be more appropriate in the development of newer, more effective formulations of drugs which can then be tested in clinical trials.

### Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy for cystic fibrosis [^112fK2ZP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections is the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). When sputum samples are unavailable, diagnosis relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns about whether this approach is sensitive enough to identify lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are invasive but allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non-sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may increase the accuracy of diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and improve the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. This is an update of a previous review that was first published in 2013 and was updated in 2016 and in 2018.

Objectives

To evaluate the use of bronchoscopy-guided (also known as bronchoscopy-directed) antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched three registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. The date of the most recent searches was 1 November 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled studies involving people of any age with CF that compared the outcomes of antimicrobial therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (and related procedures) versus those guided by any other type of sampling (e.g. cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information when required. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included two studies in this updated review. One study enrolled 170 infants under six months of age who had been diagnosed with CF through newborn screening. Participants were followed until they were five years old, and data were available for 157 children. The study compared outcomes for pulmonary exacerbations following treatment directed by BAL versus standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. The second study enrolled 30 children with CF aged between five and 18 years and randomised participants to receive treatment based on microbiological results of BAL triggered by an increase in lung clearance index (LCI) of at least one unit above baseline or to receive standard treatment based on microbiological results of oropharyngeal samples collected when participants were symptomatic. We judged both studies to have a low risk of bias across most domains, although the risk of bias for allocation concealment and selective reporting was unclear in the smaller study. In the larger study, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low because Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in BAL samples at five years of age in both groups were much lower than the expected rate that was used for the power calculation. We graded the certainty of evidence for the key outcomes as low, other than for high-resolution computed tomography scoring and cost-of-care analysis, which we graded as moderate certainty. Both studies reported similar outcomes, but meta-analysis was not possible due to different ways of measuring the outcomes and different indications for the use of BAL. Whether antimicrobial therapy is directed by the use of BAL or standard care may make little or no difference in lung function z scores after two years (n = 29) as measured by the change from baseline in LCI and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (low-certainty evidence). At five years, the larger study found little or no difference between groups in absolute FEV1 z score or forced vital capacity (FVC) (low-certainty evidence). BAL-directed therapy probably makes little or no difference to any measure of chest scores assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan at either two or five years (different measures used in the two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). BAL-directed therapy may make little or no difference in nutritional parameters or in the number of positive isolates of P aeruginosa per participant per year, but may lead to more hospitalisations per year (1 study, 157 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in average cost of care per participant (either for hospitalisations or total costs) at five years between BAL-directed therapy and standard care (1 study, 157 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We found no difference in health-related quality of life between BAL-directed therapy and standard care at either two or five years, and the larger study found no difference in the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per child per year. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment and the number of pulmonary exacerbations were comparable in the two groups. Mild adverse events, when reported, were generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of BAL in 4.8% of procedures.

Authors' Conclusions

This review, limited to two well-designed randomised controlled studies, shows no evidence to support the routine use of BAL for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in preschool children with CF compared to the standard practice of providing treatment based on results of oropharyngeal culture and clinical symptoms. No evidence is available for adults.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline. pharmacologic approaches to prevention and eradication of initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^116QPcxN]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline — initial Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication in children is detailed from randomized and comparative trials as follows: Valerius et al. used 3 weeks of inhaled colistin (1 million IU twice daily) plus oral ciprofloxacin (250–750 mg, based on weight, twice daily) in 26 children aged 2 to 9 years, and at 27 months only 14% (2/12) of treated versus 58% (7/12) of untreated individuals were infected (P < 0.05), with infection defined as growth of P. aeruginosa in six consecutive airway cultures and/or precipitating serum antibodies. Wiesemann et al. compared inhaled tobramycin (80 mg twice daily) for 12 months with placebo in 22 individuals aged 4 to 18 years; two tobramycin and six placebo participants did not complete the trial, all but one treated with tobramycin cleared infection with time-to-event superiority (P < 0.05), and the median time to conversion to a P. aeruginosa negative culture was 1.89 months. Gibson et al. compared 28 days of inhaled tobramycin (300 mg twice daily) with placebo in 21 children under 6 years, and at Day 28 P. aeruginosa cultures were negative in 100% (8/8) of the treatment group versus 7.4% (1/13) with placebo, leading to early study termination.

Results

Patient characteristics

A total of 22 patients suffering from CF (aged 6–18 years) were eligible and enrolled in the study. The study participants had a median age of 9 years, and male sex was the dominating gender (Table 1). The participants were followed with consecutive sputum sampling during a six months period, from January to June 2015. Three patients were unable to donate a sputum sample during the study period and were therefore excluded (Fig. 1). The remaining 19 patients donated a total of 50 sputum samples. Nine sputum samples were excluded as no lung function evaluation had been performed at the time of sampling. This left 41 sputum samples from 17 patients, with a median of 2 samples per patient (range 1–4 samples). 83% of sputum samples were induced with sodium chloride. Samples collected from the same patient were obtained with a median of 37 days apart (range 7–176 days). Another 6 samples were excluded from DNA analyses, as they contained small volumes of sputum that only allowed HBP and elastase measurements.

Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most commonly found bacterial species in sputum cultures (32 and 24%, respectively). Thirty-six % of sputum samples were collected during on-going symptoms from the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, cough, fever, increased mucus, or change in sputum colour). Nine samples were collected at start of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Six of these treatments were initiated to eradicate P. aeruginosa and the remaining to treat exacerbations.

### Bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy for cystic fibrosis [^116wZ5ic]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, particularly those with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. When sputum samples are unavailable, treatment relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns regarding the sensitivity of these to identify lower respiratory organisms. Bronchoscopy and related procedures (including bronchoalveolar lavage) though invasive, allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non-sputum producers. Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens. Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may help in a more accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and guide the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits.

Objectives

To evaluate the use of bronchoscopy-guided antimicrobial therapy in the management of lung infection in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched two registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 28 November 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled studies including patients of any age with cystic fibrosis, comparing outcomes following therapies guided by the results of bronchoscopy (including bronchoalveolar lavage or protected bronchial brush sampling) with outcomes following therapies guided by the results of any other type of sampling (including cultures from sputum, throat swab and cough swab).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for further information.

Main Results

The search identified nine studies, but only one study with data from 157 participants (170 patients were enrolled) was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study compared outcomes following therapy directed by bronchoalveolar lavage for pulmonary exacerbations during the first five years of life with standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. The study enrolled infants with CF who were under six months of age and diagnosed through newborn screening and followed them until they were five years old. We considered this study to have a low risk of bias; however, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was limited due to the prevalence (of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples at five years age) being much lower in both the groups compared to that which was expected and which was used for the power calculation. The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in high-resolution computed tomography scoring. The quality of evidence for the key parameters was graded as moderate except for high-resolution computed tomography scoring, which was graded as high. At five years of age, there was no clear benefit of bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy on lung function z scores or nutritional parameters. Evaluation of total and component high-resolution computed tomography scores showed no significant difference in evidence of structural lung disease in the two groups. In addition, this study did not show any difference between the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per child per year diagnosed in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group compared to the standard therapy group. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment was comparable in the two groups, as were the number of pulmonary exacerbations. However, the number of hospitalizations was significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group, but the mean duration of hospitalizations was significantly less compared to the standard therapy group. Mild adverse events were reported in a proportion of patients, but these were generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4.8% of procedures.

Authors' Conclusions

This review, which only includes a single study, shows that there is no clear evidence to support the routine use of bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis and management of pulmonary infection in pre-school children with cystic fibrosis compared to the standard practice of providing treatment based on results of oropharyngeal culture and clinical symptoms. No evidence was available for adult and adolescent populations.

### Eradication therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization episodes in cystic fibrosis patients not chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa [^1119sgjA]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2013). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is one of the most common and clinically important pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic Pa colonization in CF patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pa strains causing early infection are usually antibiotic sensitive and have low bacterial density in the airways. As a result, the treatment strategy has shifted from suppressive therapy in patients chronically colonized by Pa to attempts at early eradication therapy as soon as Pa is detected. In the literature, different treatment regimens have been studied. However, the optimal treatment regimen and duration of treatment are not yet determined. In this article, an overview on the natural history of early Pa colonization and the history of eradication treatment is given. Moreover, the results of the different eradication treatment trials and directions for future research are discussed.

Clinical criteria for NTM-PD

NTM-PD should be suspected in individuals with worsening respiratory symptoms (breathlessness, increased cough and sputum production) and/or declining pulmonary function tests that do not respond to antibiotic therapy targeting conventional CF-associated bacteria and optimised airway clearance. Night sweats, fevers, chest pains and weight loss (although uncommon) may also suggest possible NTM-PD.

NTM treatment should be considered in individuals with CF who fulfil ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM-PD. However, the decision to start treatment is a clinical one based on an amalgamation of patient factors, the NTM species involved, the risks of treatment side effects, adherence concerns and the expected outcomes of treatment.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^115D67Ht]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of cystic fibrosis lung disease is one of chronic progression with intermittent episodes of acute worsening of symptoms frequently called acute pulmonary exacerbations These exacerbations typically warrant medical intervention. It is important that appropriate therapies are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation therefore established a committee to define the key questions related to pulmonary exacerbations, review the clinical evidence using an evidence-based methodology, and provide recommendations to clinicians. It is hoped that these guidelines will be helpful to clinicians in the treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Eradication therapy for newly acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection — The guideline identified seven studies that investigated approaches to P. aeruginosa eradication therapy, with some studies enrolling participants up to 6 months after first P. aeruginosa isolation. Three studies compared inhaled and oral therapy to placebo or no therapy, and the remaining studies compared various treatments to identify an optimal eradication strategy. The primary outcome of interest in these studies was P. aeruginosa growth in airway cultures, and the committee's certainty of the net benefit was not diminished by the use of a surrogate for clinical outcomes because eradication of P. aeruginosa growth has been associated with both mitigation of lung function decline and delay of chronic infection.

### Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation [^1148LFnm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pulmonary infection is a hallmark of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 18 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia. Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria are resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Following patient segregation in cystic fibrosis medical care, the more virulent epidemic strains are not as frequent, and new infections are more likely to be with less virulent environmentally-acquired strains. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for treating respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these cannot be extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. This review, which is an update of a previous review, aims to assess the available trial evidence for the choice and application of treatments for these infections.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation and chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Data Collection and Analysis

No relevant trials were identified.

Main Results

No trials were included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for people with cystic fibrosis and their clinicians. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages; and managing and treating these infections will become more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for people with cystic fibrosis who have chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each person individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. Multicentre randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT

Routine Therapies in PCD

Airway clearance through daily chest physiotherapy is highly recommended in PCD. 117 Unlike cystic fibrosis, cough clearance is preserved in PCD. 118 Thus, airway clearance is expected to be quite beneficial in PCD and should be a cornerstone of long‐term therapy. Daily cardiovascular exercise should also be strongly encouraged, as poor exercise capacity is linked to decreased pulmonary function in PCD, 119 and exercise may improve mucus clearance. 120

Antibiotics should be given for acute respiratory exacerbations in PCD. Acute changes in cough, sputum production, respiratory rate, or work of breathing are likely reliable markers of a respiratory exacerbation in PCD (as demonstrated in non‐CF bronchiectasis 121), and oral antibiotics are recommended for mild exacerbations. Most physicians use a broad‐spectrum oral antibiotic (amoxicillin plus clavulinic acid or an equivalent cephalosporin) to target the common respiratory pathogens in children with PCD. Typically, at least 2–3 weeks of oral antibiotics are recommended in PCD, based upon other disorders with similar pathophysiology (protracted bacterial bronchitis, 122 cystic fibrosis, 123 and non‐CF bronchiectasis 124). More severe exacerbations, or those failing oral therapy, may require parenteral antibiotics. Antibiotic choice should be guided by past respiratory cultures. Despite a lack of published evidence, inhaled antibiotics are also an option for acute PCD respiratory exacerbations, but these are usually reserved for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Eradication of initial positive Pseudomonas airway culture also seems prudent in PCD, although no evidence supports this practice. Non‐CF bronchiectasis guidelines make similar suggestions for Pseudomonas eradication. 125, 126 Although Burkholderia cepacia has not been reported in PCD, recovery of this organism should prompt eradication practices.

Finally, PCD patients should receive recommended vaccinations per local schedules. Annual influenza 127 and pneumococcal vaccinations (per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) 128, 129 are recommended in PCD. In the first year of life, monthly (seasonal) immunoprophylaxis against respiratory synctial virus can be considered for infants with PCD, and more specifically for infants with complicated respiratory courses requiring prolonged oxygen supplementation.

### How to use: bacterial cultures in diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections in cystic fibrosis [^116pt659]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis. Certain bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are associated with a worse clinical outcome than others, but can be completely eradicated if identified and treated early. The diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections can be challenging in the non-expectorating patient, in whom upper airway samples, such as cough swabs, are a surrogate for lower airway sampling. However, the results of these often do not fit with the clinical picture, presenting a management dilemma. Frequently, clinicians are faced with a negative culture result in a progressively symptomatic patient and vice versa. When judging the clinical significance of a positive upper airway culture result in an asymptomatic patient, it is important to consider the prognostic significance of the organism cultured. Given that the reported sensitivity of upper airway swabs (which includes throat swabs) is variable, ranging from 35.7% to 71% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 50% to 86% for Staphylococcus aureus and 11% to 92% for Haemophilus influenza, upper airway samples may fail to identify lower airway infections. Therefore, in symptomatic children, a repeatedly negative upper airway swab should not be considered as reassuring, and alternative sampling methods, such as induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage, should be considered. Here we use some examples of common scenarios to illustrate how best to use bacterial cultures to aid management decisions in cystic fibrosis.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^114dsnPb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa treatment strategy in cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations: The standard approach to antibiotic treatment of P. aeruginosa in patients with CF has been to use two antipseudomonal drugs to enhance activity and reduce selection of resistant organisms, yet the use of combination antibiotic therapy with synergistic activity in vitro has not been shown to result in improved clinical outcomes; upon analysis, the committee determined that there remains insufficient evidence addressing this important question, and the trials did not demonstrate compelling evidence that the two therapies are equivalent or to support one therapy over the other; nevertheless, the Committee feels the comparison of monotherapy with combination therapy is a question worthy of further investigation, and although the Committee recognizes that the use of combination antibiotic therapy has not been validated in the treatment of CF lung infections, the standard of care has been to use combination antibiotics as treatment of P. aeruginosa.

CLINICAL CARE AND LONG‐TERM MONITORING

Pulmonary Care and Monitoring

Long‐term follow‐up should be in a PCD Foundation clinical center or an accredited cystic fibrosis center that has a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team approach to care. Outpatient visits with a pulmonologist experienced in management of chronic suppurative lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis, are recommended 2–4 times annually (Table 8). Surveillance cultures of expectorated sputum or oropharyngeal cough swabs are recommended two to four times annually in all PCD patients. 1 Although the most common airway pathogens in children with PCD are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, surveillance cultures should be processed in the same manner as cystic fibrosis cultures, including examination for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram negative organisms, as well as non‐tuberculosis mycobacterial (NTM) organisms. 1, 4 Culture results should guide antibiotic therapy during future respiratory exacerbations. When PCD patients are not responding to culture‐directed antibiotics, physicians should consider additional NTM and fungal cultures, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis testing (ABPA) testing (IgE levels ± evidence of aspergillus specificity) and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures to guide antimicrobial therapy.

### Recent advances in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis [^111RVJM1]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cycled antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent P. aeruginosa colonisation

Prevention of chronic lung infection caused by P. aeruginosa and other microorganisms is cost-effective and prolongs the lives of CF patients. Early, aggressive eradication of intermittent P. aeruginosa colonisation is a treatment that has to be repeated to keep most of the patients free of chronic P. aeruginosa infection. A triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, three-year study was therefore carried out to investigate whether three-week treatments administered every three months with oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin, compared with placebo would prevent initial P. aeruginosa infection. The primary outcome was P. aeruginosa infection, and therefore respiratory cultures were obtained every three months. The percentage of cultures containing nonfermenting, Gram-negative bacteria other than P. aeruginosa was significantly higher in the treatment group, and treatment administered once every three months did not reduce the risk of initial and chronic P. aeruginosa infection.

Effect of azithromycin on pulmonary function in CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection

Azithromycin is used routinely in the treatment of CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection, since a number of trials in adults and children with CF showed improvement in lung function. The mechanism by which azithromycin works is thought to be through inhibition of bacterial communication (quorum sensing) and reduction of inflammation, since azithromycin does not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa at the concentrations obtainable in vivo. This was the rationale behind a large multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which azithromycin (250 mg or 500 mg depending on body weight) was given every other day to children or young adults with CF who had negative P. aeruginosa cultures for at least one year. The primary outcome was change in FEV 1. Twenty-four weeks of treatment with azithromycin did not result in improved pulmonary function, but the treated group had a reduction in exacerbations and cough compared with the placebo group. On the other hand, significantly more macrolide-resistant S. aureus and H. influenzae were isolated in the treated group.

Infectious Disease Interventions

The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID, selectively offering inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of Pa based on a positive respiratory culture (Grade C).
The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID and an unexplained prolonged cough (> 2 weeks), selectively offering the use of oral antibiotics (Grade C).

A higher prevalence of Pa is reported in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID compared with those collected from children without CF, and treatment to eradicate incident Pa infection is recommended for pwCF. However, the clinical impact of Pa in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID is unclear. Pa may clear spontaneously, (ie, independent of whether treatment is provided), calling into question the value of Pa eradication therapy. The committee recommends selectively offering this treatment after a SDM process incorporating the potential benefits, risks, and treatment burden of inhaled antibiotic therapy in people with CRMS/CFSPID with positive respiratory culture for Pa. If the decision is to treat, then follow-up cultures are warranted to ensure Pa clearance.

Precedent is established regarding use of oral antibiotics for prolonged cough for individuals with respiratory conditions other than CF, including tracheobronchomalacia, protracted bacterial bronchitis, non-CF bronchiectasis and neuromuscular disease. – The committee discussed this consideration while weighing the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy. The use of any antibiotic for eradication or treatment may depend on clinical status of the individual, and the risks and benefits of treatment burden should be assessed for each family. For people with CRMS/CFSPID with a cough lasting > 2 weeks, other etiologies of persistent cough, such as asthma, should be considered.

For those unable to produce sputum, the committee decided that oropharyngeal (OP) cultures are a reasonable alternative to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cultures if false-positive results are fewer than 10% of the time. Across four studies using BALF as the standard, OP cultures were more specific than sensitive: in Ramsey et al, 43 well individuals had a mean ± SE age of 8.2 ± 6.9 years (range, 4 mo to 25 yr), with specificity 80 and 93% and sensitivity 7% and 46% in those who did and did not expectorate, respectively; other studies reported specificity 93–95% and sensitivity 44–71%, and false-positive results occurred in only 5 to 7% of nonexpectorators. A multicenter RCT of 170 infants demonstrated that using bronchoscopy to direct therapy did not reduce the prevalence of P. aeruginosa at age 5 years versus standard therapy, and a Cochrane review found no evidence to support routine bronchoalveolar lavage over OP cultures plus symptoms. Overall, for routine surveillance in low-prevalence settings, OP cultures have a high negative predictive value and are relatively easily obtained and can be repeated frequently.

### Early antibiotic treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication in patients with cystic fibrosis: a randomised multicentre study comparing two different protocols [^112LKwDN]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic pulmonary infection is an unfavourable event in cystic fibrosis. Bacterial clearance is possible with an early antibiotic treatment upon pathogen isolation. Currently, no best practice exists for early treatment. The efficacy of two different regimens against initial P. aeruginosa infection was assessed.

Methods

In a randomised, open-label, parallel-group study involving 13 centres, the superiority of inhaled tobramycin/oral ciprofloxacin compared with inhaled colistin/oral ciprofloxacin (reference treatment) over 28 days was evaluated. Patients were eligible if they were older than 1 year with first or new P. aeruginosa isolation. Treatments were assigned equally by centralised balanced randomisation, stratified by age and forced expiratory volume in 1 s values. The participants and those giving the intervention were not masked to arm assignments. The primary endpoint was P. aeruginosa eradication, defined as three successive negative cultures in 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was registered with EudraCT, number 2008–006502–42.

Results

105 patients were assigned to inhaled colistin/oral ciprofloxacin (arm A) and 118 to inhaled tobramycin/oral ciprofloxacin (arm B). All patients were analysed. P. aeruginosa was eradicated in 66 (62.8%) patients in arm A and in 77 (65.2%) in arm B (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.55, p = 0.81). Following treatment, an increase in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was noted (OR 3.97, 95% CI 2.27 to 6.94, p = 0.001) with no differences between the two arms (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.78, p = 0.88).

Conclusions

No superiority of treatment under study was demonstrated in comparison to the reference treatment. Early eradication treatment was associated with an increase in S maltophilia.

### Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults with cystic fibrosis [^1133ZSQW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with an adverse prognosis in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). P aeruginosa induces a prolonged inflammatory response which leads to progressive pulmonary tissue destruction. In patients with CF, this manifests as a more rapid loss of lung function, frequent pulmonary exacerbations and a shorter median survival.

Once chronic infection with P aeruginosa is established, it is rarely possible to eradicate. However, the early and intensive use of antibiotic eradication therapy (AET) following a new isolation of P aeruginosa has been shown to eradicate the pathogen from the respiratory tract, thus preventing or delaying the establishment of chronic infection. Therefore, the eradication of new P aeruginosa infection is important in managing patients with CF.

Most studies of P aeruginosa eradication report median ages in the paediatric range. It is not known whether adult patients with CF who isolate P aeruginosa for the first time have outcomes similar to children. CF centres are transferring more children to adult services without chronic P aeruginosa infection. Our aim was to study the efficacy of AET for first P aeruginosa isolation in adults in order to determine the optimum management and prognosis of this growing patient group.

Previous trials report a variety of antipseudomonal regimes in predominantly under 18-year-olds with eradication success of 62.8–93.0%. We hypothesised that AET for first isolate P aeruginosa would be less effective in adults compared with children on account of cumulative pulmonary tissue destruction and other CF-related disease processes.

4 Pulmonary Exacerbations

Although the rate of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotics has significantly decreased with the use of CFTR modulators, people with CF (PwCF) who are ineligible to take modulators continue to have infections that lead to pulmonary exacerbations. When a pulmonary exacerbation is treated with IV antibiotics in the hospital, a subset of PwCF will fail to recover their lung function, leading clinicians to work to identify which individuals may not recover and what treatments may facilitate recovery.

To optimize recovery, adequate antibiotic coverage to treat known pathogens is important. To provide optimal treatment, microbiologic processing of respiratory samples is important. Based on advances in technology, awareness of testing that does not add additional clinical benefit and other research, new guidelines were published this year, and major updates are outlined in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Practical guidance for clinical microbiology laboratories: Updated guidance for processing respiratory tract samples from people with cystic fibrosis

Prediction of failure to return to baseline lung function was seen when the Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CRISS) was obtained within the first 24 h of admission for pulmonary exacerbation. The CRISS scale is an eight‐item symptom burden questionnaire assessing difficulty breathing, feeling feverish, having chills/sweats, increased cough, increased mucus production, fatigue, chest tightness, and wheezing, with higher scores demonstrating higher symptom burden. The CRISS was evaluated as a secondary analysis of a prior study of 56 PwCF over the years 2007–2009. The authors concluded that for every increase in CRISS point, recovery of lung function decreased by 0.2% predicted points, such that a CRISS greater than 48.3, had a 14% greater risk of not recovering lung function by the end of treatment.

### Antibiotic treatment for Burkholderia cepacia complex in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation [^112GddqC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pulmonary infection is one of the hallmarks of lung disease in cystic fibrosis. Infections dominated by organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of at least 17 closely-related species of gram-negative bacteria, are particularly difficult to treat. These infections may be associated with a fulminant necrotising pneumonia, and are greatly feared by patients. Burkholderia cepacia bacteria are innately resistant to many common antibiotics and able to acquire resistance against many more. Since strict patient segregation was introduced to cystic fibrosis medical care, the incidence of the more virulent epidemic strains has fallen, and new infections are more likely to be with environmentally-acquired strains which seem to exhibit less virulence. Nonetheless, exacerbations of respiratory symptoms require effective therapy directed against the dominant bacterial species. Although evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of respiratory exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common chronic infection in cystic fibrosis, these cannot be directly extended to Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. The aim of this review is to assess the available trial evidence for choice and application of treatments for Burkholderia cepacia complex infections.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic regimens in people with cystic fibrosis experiencing an exacerbation, who are chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of latest search: 29 November 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of treatments for exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Data Collection and Analysis

No relevant trials were identified.

Main Results

No trials were included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Burkholderia cepacia complex infections present a significant challenge for cystic fibrosis clinicians and patients alike. The incidence is likely to increase as the cystic fibrosis population ages and the problem of how to manage and treat these infections becomes more important. There is a lack of trial evidence to guide decision making and no conclusions can be drawn from this review about the optimal antibiotic regimens for cystic fibrosis patients with chronic Burkholderia cepacia complex infections. Clinicians must continue to assess each patient individually, taking into account in vitro antibiotic susceptibility data, previous clinical responses and their own experience. There is a clear need for multi-centre randomised clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in cystic fibrosis patients infected with organisms of the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

### Antibiotic duration and changes in FEVare not associated with time until next exacerbation in adult cystic fibrosis: a single center study [^117SYF25]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is primarily related to the severity of pulmonary disease and patients' forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) declines annually by an average of 1%–2%. Bronchiectasis can occur early in life and develops from a cycle of airway infection, inflammation and mucus obstruction. Punctuating this chronic progressive process is the periodic development of CF pulmonary exacerbations. While there are no consensus criteria defining a CF pulmonary exacerbation, these events consist of acute or subacute worsening of respiratory and/or systemic symptoms that may include dyspnea, cough, sputum production, fatigue, anorexia or weight loss, which are often associated with a fall in FEV 1.

Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) induce significant morbidity in patients, including more rapid lung function decline, failure to recover to previous FEV 1 baseline, a loss in quality of life, and an increased risk of death and lung transplantation. In addition there is risk of acute and cumulative toxicity of repeated antibiotic exposures used for the treatment of PEx. Thus prevention of future PEx is an important therapeutic goal, both with new treatments and in the treatment of an individual PEx. PEx are generally managed by increasing the intensity of airway clearance treatments, oral or intravenous antibiotics, and other supportive measures.

### Improved early diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by real-time PCR to prevent chronic colonisation in a paediatric cystic fibrosis population [^114PGQYQ]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2011). Low credibility.

Early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children with cystic fibrosis is hampered by the need to process a sub-optimal specimen type, namely cough swabs, which are known to have a lower positive yield than sputa or more invasive samples. This delay in the detection of low levels of P. aeruginosa could potentially result in the loss of an opportunity to initiate early aggressive antibiotic therapy and result in chronic colonisation, with a poorer overall prognosis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) offers an opportunity to increase the detection rate of P. aeruginosa compared to traditional culture techniques. This study examined 500 cough swabs and 42 sputum samples from paediatric patients and showed that detection of P. aeruginosa could be increased in both sample types by 100% and 45% respectively. Overall the sensitivity was 100% and specificity of 58% when compared to culture as a gold standard. These results although initially promising require careful consideration both from a treatment and infection control standpoint as the significance of detection of very low levels of P. aeruginosa is unclear.

Purpose Of Review

The current guidelines and recent clinical research in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) are reviewed. Areas where further research is required will also be highlighted.

Recent Findings

P. aeruginosa is a key respiratory pathogen in CF. Inhaled tobramycin or colistin is recommended for early eradication to prevent establishment of chronic infection. Other antibiotic options are currently being investigated. The long-term success of eradication strategies is also now being assessed. The use of inhaled antibiotics in the management of chronic P. aeruginosa infection is an area of active investigation. Acute pulmonary exacerbations are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Guidelines continue to recommend combination intravenous therapy but further research is required to clarify the advantage of this approach. Multidrug resistance is common and potentially more effective antipseudomonal antibiotics may soon become available.

Summary

The management of P. aeruginosa respiratory infection in CF remains a challenging area, especially in the setting of multidrug resistance. The role of inhaled antibiotics continues to be expanded. Further research is required in the key areas of eradication and management of chronic infection and acute pulmonary exacerbations to identify those treatments that optimize long-term, clinical benefits.

Respiratory Cultures

The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID, selectively offering CF respiratory cultures at each visit (at least until age 8 years) and as clinically indicated for respiratory symptoms (Grade C).

Airway infection with CF-associated microorganisms, specifically Pa, is considered a phenotypic feature supporting a CF diagnosis. Compared with the general population, people with CRMS/CFSPID exhibit a higher prevalence of Pa (10.7% to 78.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.9% to 10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (40% to 85%) in respiratory cultures. Some studies have revealed that people with CRMS/CFSPID who reclassify to CF more likely have a positive culture result for Pa than those who do not reclassify (33% vs 10%), whereas other reports have revealed no difference. However, a positive culture result alone does not warrant reclassification. Some families and physicians may not want to expose the individual to trauma associated with cultures. Respiratory culture data from people with CRMS/CFSPID > 8 years of age are currently lacking. If persistent respiratory symptoms are present, obtaining respiratory cultures in people with CRMS/CFSPID may be warranted. Thus, the evidence supports that cultures obtained via throat swab or sputum should be selectively offered after SDM with the family.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: treatment of pulmonary exacerbations [^114LbPBK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines — treatment of pulmonary exacerbations emphasize that in cystic fibrosis (CF), 85% of the morbidity is a result of lung disease, and that although a generally applicable prospective definition has not been developed, clinical features of an exacerbation may include increased cough, increased sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and lung function decline. The committee performed a systematic review and drafted recommendations using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grading scheme, stating that it is not their intent to define a pulmonary exacerbation, nor to discuss relative severity, but to evaluate evidence supporting therapies for a health decline determined by a CF specialist to represent an exacerbation. The guidelines are designed for general use in most individuals with CF, but should be adapted to meet specific needs as determined by the individual, their family, and their health care provider. Most of the patients included in the studies reviewed were adults, and the Committee suggests that the CF pediatrician consider these recommendations while allowing for obvious differences, such as effect of body size on drug clearance and effect of age on need for a caregiver; the Committee determined that there is insufficient information to make a recommendation for many of the questions and calls for clinical studies with relevant immediate and long-term outcomes.

### Pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis [^1147HJMo]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical characteristics most relevant to the decision to treat for a pulmonary exacerbation with antibiotics in cystic fibrosis patients were determined. Variables including age, increased cough frequency and sputum production, new crackles and wheezing, asthma, symptomatic sinusitis, hemoptysis, decreased lung function, weight loss, and new acquisition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected in a large prospective multicenter database (Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis). During a 12-month baseline period, data from 11692 patients were compared with data collected during the subsequent 6-month study period. Because pulmonary function assessments were unavailable for patients < 6 years of age, separate analyses were done for those < 6 and ≥ 6 years of age. The outcome of interest was any antibiotic treatment in the 6-month study period reported as indicated for an exacerbation. Characteristics with the most discriminatory power were determined using stepwise multiple logistic regression. For patients < 6 years of age, the strongest independent associations with treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation were new crackles, increased cough frequency, decline in weight, and increased sputum production. For those patients ≥ 6 years of age, the strongest independent associations were a relative decrease in percent predicted forced expired volume in 1 sec, increased cough frequency, new crackles, and hemoptysis. The presence of three or more of these key characteristics was strongly associated with the occurrence of a treated exacerbation. The reproducibility of the model over time was confirmed by application to a subsequent set of data. This model has potential for use as an outcome measure in clinical trials, and to assist in treatment decisions for individual patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disease affecting more than 30,000 individuals in the United States, is characterized by a dysfunctional ATP‐gated chloride channel in the airways, pancreas, and other organs. Pulmonary disease, presenting with increasing respiratory symptoms and eventual respiratory failure, remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality for persons with CF. Lung function decline is exacerbated by recurrent episodes of lung infection and inflammation referred to as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), which are often treated with antibiotic therapy. Despite the ubiquitous and repetitious nature of PEx, there is not a universal, standardized definition to diagnose these events although most definitions include an increase in respiratory symptoms and/or an acute decrease in lung function.PEx treatment goals typically include recovery of lost lung function and improvement of PEx symptoms.

Antibiotic therapy has long been the mainstay of PEx treatment, and national consensus guidelines recommend an anti‐pseudomonal beta‐lactam and tobramycin for PEx treatment among people with CF and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa endobronchial infection. Guidance for bacterial infections beyond P. aeruginosa or polymicrobial infections are often based on the intrinsic susceptibility of those organisms. As current consensus supports the use of bacterial species but not specifically susceptibility data in selecting antibiotic therapy, this would not support the use of frequent broad‐spectrum antibiotic courses unless a person with CF has not responded to narrow‐spectrum antibiotics in the recent past. Furthermore, while early infection with P. aeruginosa can be eradicated, chronic infection can predispose to the development of increased antibiotic resistance due to strong selective pressure. In prior studies, the treatment of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria with resistant antibiotics has still led to overall improvement in the respiratory symptoms/pulmonary function of persons with CF, as cultured antibiotic resistance has been demonstrated to be less predictive in persons with CF with chronic infections, leading to further difficulty in establishing clear guidelines for PEx treatment in persons with CF.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was eradication of P aeruginosa from respiratory samples (cough swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage) at 3 months from commencing trial treatment and remaining free of infection to 15 months. We chose 12 months, following completion of eradication, as a reasonable period to evaluate whether eradication was sustained. Some participants did not have samples collected during the pre-specified protocol windows for the primary outcome at 3 months and 15 months. It was therefore decided, during a blind data review after trial completion, to extend the window at which the 3 month sample could be taken to 4 weeks either side of the expected visit date, providing treatment had ceased at least 48 h before sampling. Similarly, the window was extended to four weeks either side of the expected 15 month visit date. This decision was made to avoid excluding patients whose samples were taken outside the protocol-specified window. Secondary outcomes that utilised these sample results included time to recurrence of the original P aeruginosa infection and re-infection with a different genotype of P aeruginosa or other respiratory organisms. To avoid excessive participant burden, specimens for microbiology were collected at routine clinic visits. Data on secondary outcomes, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in mid expiration (FEF 25–75), oxygen saturation, height, weight, body-mass index (BMI), number of pulmonary exacerbations, number of hospital admissions, number of days spent as an inpatient, carer and participant burden, were collected at baseline and at all of the routine trial visits.

Quality of life (QOL) and health-related QOL instruments, CFQ-Rand EQ-5D-3Lrespectively, were completed by the participant, carer, or both (dependent on age) and collected at baseline and then at months 3, 15, and 24. The EQ-5D-3L is a generic measure frequently used to measure health status and can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Despite the EQ-5D-3L being designed primarily for adults, it is still advocated for use in children for reasons of comparability. Bespoke health service use diaries were collected (UK sites only) at baseline (completed retrospectively) and months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (completed prospectively) to calculate cost per patient (from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective) and assess incremental cost-effectiveness.

### Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^114MQyaS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs in most people with cystic fibrosis. Once chronic infection is established, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006, 2009 and 2014.

Objectives

To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in children and adults with cystic fibrosis eradicates the organism, delays the onset of chronic infection, and results in clinical improvement. To evaluate whether there is evidence that a particular antibiotic strategy is superior to or more cost-effective than other strategies and to compare the adverse effects of different antibiotic strategies (including respiratory infection with other micro-organisms).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 10 October 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of people with cystic fibrosis, in whom Pseudomonas aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics. We excluded non-randomised trials, cross-over trials, and those utilising historical controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

The search identified 60 trials; seven trials (744 participants) with a duration between 28 days and 27 months were eligible for inclusion. Three of the trials are over 10 years old and their results may be less applicable today given the changes in standard treatment. Some of the trials had low numbers of participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods; however, there was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment given the interventions and comparators used. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. Evidence from two trials (38 participants) at the two-month time-point showed treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection with inhaled tobramycin results in microbiological eradication of the organism from respiratory secretions more often than placebo, odds ratio 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.65) and data from one of these trials, with longer follow up, suggested that this effect may persist for up to 12 months. One randomised controlled trial (26 participants) compared oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin versus usual treatment. Results after two years suggested treatment of early infection results in microbiological eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa more often than no anti-pseudomonal treatment, odds ratio 0.12 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.79). One trial comparing 28 days to 56 days treatment with nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation in 88 participants showed that both treatments were effective and well-tolerated, with no notable additional improvement with longer over shorter duration of therapy. However, this trial was not powered to detect non-inferiority or equivalence. A trial of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation alone (223 participants) failed to show a difference between the two strategies, although it was underpowered to show this. A further trial of inhaled colistin with oral ciprofloxacin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation with oral ciprofloxacin also showed no superiority of the former, with increased isolation of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in both groups. A recent, large trial in 306 children aged between one and 12 years compared cycled nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. The primary analysis showed no difference in time to pulmonary exacerbation or proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa positive cultures. An analysis performed in this review (not adjusted for age) showed fewer participants in the cycled therapy group with one or more isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.28). Using GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was downgraded to moderate to very low. Downgrading decisions for Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication and lung function were based on applicability (participants mostly children) and limitations in study design, with imprecision an additional limitation for lung function, growth parameters and adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or in combination with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eradication may be sustained for up to two years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotic strategies for the eradication of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There have been no published randomised controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis. Overall, there is still insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis.

Comparing choice of antipseudomonal therapy

Previous trials into AET of P aeruginosa have varied greatly in the study design and the choice of the eradication regime. In 2010, the Cochrane Collaboration produced a review of antibiotic strategies for P aeruginosa eradication in patients with CF. It found that most studies had focused on inhaled tobramycin versus placebo, with one study comparing inhaled tobramycin with inhaled colistin and oral ciprofloxacin. It concluded that, although both antibiotic regimes were better than placebo, there was insufficient evidence to determine which was superior. Later studies by Taccetti et al and Proesmans et al found that eradication success was very similar between the two regimes.

The value of intravenous antibiotics in P aeruginosa eradication is still under investigation. Some trials have reported economic benefits and reduced lung inflammation in the use of systemic antibiotics. The TORPEDO-CF trial is currently underway to establish its comparative eradication efficacy. In our study, intravenous therapy was generally reserved for patients who were more unwell, as demonstrated by a greater reduction in FEV 1 from baseline. However, there was no standardised method to determine what degree of reduction warranted systemic antibiotics over other regimes. This may be a useful research focus for future studies.

There are two main explanations for the wide variety of AETs reported in this study. The first is the frequency of patients being switched to alternative agents following the failure or adverse reactions on first-line treatments. The second and more significant reason is the developing evidence base for different first-line regimes during the 13-year study period (1999–2012). Nebulised tobramycin has the best reported eradication success, but since this was established late in the study period only a few patients received it.

Decisions over AET can be further complicated by coinfection, as demonstrated by the patient who isolated P aeruginosa while on long-term therapy for M chelonae. The complex microbial community found in airways of patients with CF is a current focus of research as the clinical significance of many pathogens is not well understood. P aeruginosa and non-tuberculous mycobacterium are established as pathogenic in CF, although little data are available to compare their associated morbidity. In this case, no change was made to the patient's therapy as it was determined that the risks of interfering with non-tuberculosis mycobacterium AET outweighed the benefits of attempting P aeruginosa eradication.

### Early eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis [^115crCcW]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the predominant organism infecting the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This organism has an armamentarium of survival mechanisms that allows it to survive in the CF airway. Since colonization and chronic infection with Pa is associated with poorer lung function and increased morbidity and mortality, therapies that can prevent infection could significantly improve the lives of patients with CF. Numerous studies have examined the effects of treatment on the eradication of Pa as a means to ameliorate disease. This article outlines the pathophysiology and clinical implication of Pa acquisition, and reviews the existing treatment regimens aimed at early eradication of Pa in patients with CF.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa genotypes acquired by children with cystic fibrosis by age 5-years [^111bHucW]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We describe Pseudomonas aeruginosa acquisitions in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged ≤ 5-years, eradication treatment efficacy, and genotypic relationships between upper and lower airway isolates and strains from non-CF sources.

Methods

Of 168 CF children aged ≤ 5-years in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-directed therapy trial, 155 had detailed microbiological results. Overall, 201/271 (74%) P. aeruginosa isolates from BAL and oropharyngeal cultures were available for genotyping, including those collected before and after eradication therapy.

Results

Eighty-two (53%) subjects acquired P. aeruginosa, of which most were unique strains. Initial eradication success rate was 90%, but 36 (44%) reacquired P. aeruginosa, with genotypic substitutions more common in BAL (12/14) than oropharyngeal (3/11) cultures. Moreover, oropharyngeal cultures did not predict BAL genotypes reliably.

Conclusions

CF children acquire environmental P. aeruginosa strains frequently. However, discordance between BAL and oropharyngeal strains raises questions over upper airway reservoirs and how to best determine eradication in non-expectorating children.
