## Question

what labs for IIH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core CSF studies required for diagnosis and how opening pressure should be handled. Then, I should verify which blood tests are universally recommended versus those reserved for atypical cases. Next, I will consider metabolic assessments that inform holistic care, and I need to ensure I include clinical measurements like blood pressure that can mimic IIH. Finally, I should summarize the flow and highlight common diagnostic pitfalls without over-testing typical cases or under-testing atypical ones [^1129tU6W] [^112owcZi].

> Let me first confirm the core diagnostic CSF analysis: in any patient with papilledema and normal neuroimaging, a diagnostic lumbar puncture is recommended to measure opening pressure and to ensure CSF composition is normal, specifically obtaining at minimum protein, glucose, and cell count — these must be normal to support "idiopathic" disease, and the LP should follow normal imaging to exclude mass lesions and venous sinus thrombosis [^114Jy57p] [^1129tU6W].

> I should double-check opening pressure thresholds and their interpretation: the adult diagnostic cut-off used in the guidelines is an opening pressure greater than 25 cm CSF, but wait, let me verify pediatric considerations — children often use a higher threshold around 28 cm CSF; importantly, OP is a single, variable measurement and must not be interpreted in isolation, and if the OP does not fit the clinical picture, repeating LP or considering ICP monitoring can be appropriate [^114Axqaw] [^1166gubd] [^112JVin2] [^111jc8V5].

> Next, I should review universal blood screening: I need to ensure a complete blood count is obtained in all patients to exclude anemia, as anemia is a recognized association and potential secondary driver of raised intracranial pressure — this is explicitly recommended as a routine lab in the consensus guidance [^116L1UFf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — beyond CBC, additional blood tests should be tailored to atypical features rather than ordered routinely; in patients who are atypical by sex (male), age (< 12 or > 50), BMI (normal), or clinical course, I should consider targeted labs to exclude secondary causes, such as iron studies if anemia is suspected beyond CBC, thyroid function tests if clinically indicated, vitamin A levels if hypervitaminosis A is plausible, and infection screening (for example, syphilis serology) when risk factors or red flags are present, all guided by careful history and medication review for agents like tetracyclines or retinoids [^112owcZi] [^114Bvchx] [^1166gubd] [^114iox9c] [^116NULca].

> But wait, what if I conflate diagnostic labs with broader care — hmm, wait a minute, metabolic assessments such as fasting glucose or HbA1c and a lipid profile are not part of the diagnostic criteria per se; rather, they inform comprehensive management given IIH's strong links with obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic risk, and they should be considered to support weight management counseling and long-term risk modification rather than to diagnose IIH [^1119MgUf] [^1135oKZH].

> I will now examine clinical measurements that can mimic IIH: I need to ensure blood pressure is measured to exclude malignant hypertension, as hypertensive optic disc edema can mimic papilledema; urgent recognition of systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 120 mmHg is essential in the initial evaluation of suspected IIH [^1144sa5t].

> Let me consider downstream safety labs related to therapy, even though they are not diagnostic tests for IIH itself: when initiating or escalating medications such as acetazolamide or topiramate, I should confirm plans for monitoring potential adverse effects in a multidisciplinary framework, for example by checking electrolytes and renal function with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acknowledging that this pertains to treatment safety rather than the diagnostic work-up [^115ZXsym].

> Hold on, I should verify the balance between under- and over-investigation: overdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures occur when ophthalmoscopy or context is misjudged, yet secondary causes can be missed if atypical patients are not appropriately screened; the safest path is targeted testing anchored to phenotype, reserving broader panels for atypical or red-flag presentations while maintaining vigilance for alternative diagnoses [^115WTpJQ] [^112owcZi] [^114v4iE2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the flow is disciplined: for all suspected IIH with papilledema and normal imaging, obtain LP with opening pressure and confirm normal CSF composition, add a universal CBC to screen for anemia, avoid routine broad blood panels in typical patients, expand testing selectively in atypical cases to exclude secondary causes, consider metabolic labs for holistic care rather than diagnosis, and always measure blood pressure to rule out malignant hypertension — this targeted approach reduces both missed secondary etiologies and unnecessary testing while adhering to consensus guidance [^1129tU6W] [^116L1UFf] [^112owcZi] [^1119MgUf] [^1144sa5t].

For IIH, order a **CBC to exclude anemia** [^116L1UFf] [^114iox9c] and a **basic metabolic panel** to assess electrolytes and renal function. After normal imaging [^114CvQ22], perform a **lumbar puncture** to measure opening pressure [^114Jy57p] and confirm normal CSF; analyze CSF protein, glucose, and cell count [^1129tU6W]. In atypical cases [^112owcZi], add thyroid function tests, endocrine panels, and infectious serologies [^116NULca] to exclude secondary causes [^114iox9c]. No **specific biomarkers** exist for IIH [^115bJLUf]; laboratory testing is used to exclude other causes [^1119MgUf] and confirm normal CSF composition [^1129tU6W].

---

## Essential laboratory tests for IIH

### Complete blood count (CBC)

The purpose is to **exclude anemia** [^116L1UFf] [^114iox9c], a potential secondary cause of elevated intracranial pressure. The clinical relevance is that **anemia can mimic or exacerbate IIH symptoms** [^1166gubd]; identifying and treating it is essential.

---

### Basic metabolic panel (BMP)

The purpose is to assess **electrolytes, renal function, and glucose** [^112owcZi]. The clinical relevance is that **electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction** can contribute to secondary intracranial hypertension [^114iox9c]; normal results support an idiopathic diagnosis.

---

### Lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

- **Purpose**: Measure opening pressure and analyze CSF composition [^114Jy57p].

- **Clinical relevance**: Elevated opening pressure (> 25 cm H2O in adults) with normal CSF composition is a hallmark of IIH [^114Axqaw] [^112JVin2].

- **CSF analysis**: Protein, glucose, and cell count must be normal to confirm IIH [^1129tU6W].

---

## Additional laboratory tests for atypical or secondary cases

In atypical presentations or when secondary causes are suspected, **additional laboratory testing** is recommended [^112owcZi]:

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) | Assess thyroid dysfunction | Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^114iox9c] |
| Endocrine panel (cortisol, prolactin, androgens) | Evaluate hormonal imbalances | Hormonal disorders (e.g. Cushing's, PCOS) can mimic IIH [^1166gubd] |
| Infectious serologies (syphilis, Lyme disease, HIV) | Exclude infectious causes | Infections can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^116NULca] |
| Autoimmune panel (ANA, ANCA) | Screen for autoimmune diseases | Autoimmune conditions can cause secondary intracranial hypertension [^114iox9c] |

---

## Laboratory tests not routinely recommended

Certain laboratory tests are **not routinely recommended** unless specific clinical indications are present:

- **Coagulation profile**: Only if venous sinus thrombosis is suspected [^112owcZi].

- **Vitamin A levels**: Only if hypervitaminosis A is suspected [^1166gubd].

- **Heavy metal screening**: Only if exposure is suspected [^112owcZi].

---

## Laboratory tests for monitoring disease progression

Laboratory tests are **not typically used** to monitor IIH progression [^113W6zX5] [^114CA3g9]. Instead, monitoring focuses on:

- **Visual acuity and visual fields**: Regular ophthalmologic assessments [^115rRA5o].

- **Headache frequency and severity**: Clinical evaluation and patient-reported outcomes [^113b3iwT].

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: Regular monitoring and weight management counseling [^1135oKZH].

---

## Emerging biomarkers and novel laboratory tests

Currently, **no specific biomarkers** or novel laboratory tests have been validated for routine clinical use in IIH [^1119MgUf]. Research is ongoing to identify potential biomarkers, but none are recommended for clinical practice [^115bJLUf].

---

## Summary of recommended laboratory tests for IIH

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | Exclude anemia | Essential for all patients |
| BMP | Assess electrolytes, renal function, glucose | Essential for all patients |
| LP and CSF analysis | Measure opening pressure and analyze CSF composition | Essential for all patients |
| Thyroid function tests | Assess thyroid dysfunction | Recommended for atypical cases |
| Endocrine panel | Evaluate hormonal imbalances | Recommended for atypical cases |
| Infectious serologies | Exclude infectious causes | Recommended for atypical cases |
| Autoimmune panel | Screen for autoimmune diseases | Recommended for atypical cases |

---

Laboratory tests for IIH are primarily used to exclude secondary causes [^112owcZi] and confirm normal CSF composition [^1129tU6W]. Essential tests include **CBC, BMP, and LP with CSF analysis**. Additional tests may be required for atypical cases [^114iox9c], but no specific biomarkers are available for routine clinical use [^115bJLUf].

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^1166gubd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are shifting from symptom-based standards to more quantifiable measures. The most recent proposal by Friedman et al. includes lumbar puncture opening pressures (OP) of 25 cm CSF or greater in normal-weighted adults and 28 cm CSF or greater in children. They also incorporate MRI scan findings consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Additionally, it is recognized that IIH may occur in the absence of symptoms of elevated ICP and, rarely, without papilloedema, known as IIH without papilloedema (IIHWOP).

There are several identifiable causes that can lead to secondary intracranial hypertension, such as anemia, obstruction to venous drainage, and exposure to various pharmacological agents, including tetracyclines, hypervitaminosis A, and retinoids. Neuroimaging, through either MRI or CT, must be used to exclude hydrocephalus, structural lesions, abnormal meningeal enhancement, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

Comorbidities such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are relevant in the context of IIH. PCOS is a chronic endocrine condition characterized by menstrual irregularities, ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and hirsutism. The prevalence of PCOS in women with IIH is reported to be as high as 39–57%, which contrasts with a 7–18% prevalence in the general population. Similar to IIH, PCOS is a disorder occurring in women of childbearing age, associated with obesity, high serum leptin levels, and low-grade inflammation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, particularly concerning history and physical examination, the ABN/BASH/RCOphth/SBNS 2018 guidelines recommend performing an ophthalmological examination to confirm papilledema and assess the imminent risk of visual function. Obtain and record the following in the presence of papilledema:

- **Visual acuity**: Record the visual clarity to evaluate potential deficits.

- **Pupil examination**: Assess the pupils for size, shape, and reaction to light to detect abnormalities.

- **Intraocular pressure**: Measure to exclude hypotony, a rare cause for disc swelling.

- **Formal visual field test**: Conduct to map any areas of vision loss.

- **Dilated fundal examination**: Grade the severity of papilledema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113acFqn]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Papilledema is encountered in almost all patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and is therefore a key feature in assessing patients suspected of having this condition. A large retrospective study of 353 patients with IIH identified only 20 patients who presented without papilledema (5.7%). It is important for clinicians to be aware that while papilledema is mostly bilateral, it may be asymmetrical. Indeed, the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) found that 7% of patients had a difference of 2 Frisen grades or more in the papilledema grading between the two eyes.

When assessing an optic nerve for the likelihood of papilledema, the presence of spontaneous venous pulsations (SVP) has traditionally been considered to exclude the possibility of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). However, a study by Wong et al. reports that SVP were visible in 12 of 20 IIH patients with mild papilledema, five of whom had an opening pressure on lumbar puncture of > 30 cmH₂O. Although this represents a subgroup analysis and is limited by the small sample size, this study serves as a reminder that the presence of SVP does not invariably rule out raised ICP. If untreated, papilledema can result in optic atrophy in patients with IIH, although the associated visual deficits mean the diagnosis is often easy to make at this late stage.

### Incidence, prevalence, and health care outcomes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A population study [^1157MrYQ]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology that is strongly associated with obesity. It predominantly affects women of childbearing age and causes chronic disabling headaches, visual disturbances, and, in a minority of patients, permanent visual loss. Although the definitive management is weight loss, a minority of patients require surgery to preserve vision. People with IIH potentially have high rates of health care utilization due to their comorbidities, multiple specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, CSF diversion procedures, and complications related to CSF diversion surgery.

Given the increasing global burden of obesity and the strong association of IIH with obesity, it seems plausible to assume that the incidence of IIH, as well as associated health care utilization, is increasing. Although there is some evidence to support this, overall, there is a paucity of data regarding the epidemiology, health care utilization, and outcomes of people with IIH. To our knowledge, there have not been any large population-level studies of IIH in Wales.

In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the temporal trends of IIH incidence and prevalence in Wales and health care utilization associated with IIH. We also investigated the effects of socioeconomic deprivation and obesity on IIH epidemiology.

### A review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^114JVpEV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH, as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children, are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.

### The role of bedside ultrasound in pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic lumbar puncture in patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112BgbbZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014).

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is often a debilitating condition characterized by headaches, blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. Lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential component of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach; however, the procedure itself can cause post-lumbar puncture headache. In addition to the clinical presentation, the use of bedside ultrasound to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter may aid in differentiating the two conditions. We hereby report a case of a 33-year-old woman with known IIH who presented with recurrent headache after the initial therapeutic LP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^11485aSu]. Cephalalgia (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is caused by an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). The condition mainly affects obese young women of childbearing age. Its prevalence ranges between 0.5 and 2 per 100,000 of the general population and is expected to increase further given the worldwide increase in obesity. The underlying cause of the disease, as well as the gender preference and its pathophysiological relation to obesity, remain largely unknown. Several mechanisms have been proposed as the underlying cause of IIH, such as an overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), outflow obstruction, elevated pressure in the venous sinuses, and more recently a dysfunction in the glymphatic pathway as well as hormonal alterations. Given that none of these theories can explain the entire clinical picture, therapeutic approaches rely mainly on weight reduction and the decrease of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. As increasing evidence suggests that a CSF overproduction is unlikely to be the driving factor behind IIH, treatment with acetazolamide is likely to target a consequence, rather than the cause of this disorder.

The two most prominent symptoms of IIH are progressive visual deterioration resulting from papilledema and chronic headache, although additional symptoms including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, tinnitus, and olfactory dysfunction are frequently also part of the clinical presentation. While the visual dysfunction is known to largely result from a pressure-induced papilledema, the origin of the IIH-related headache is less clear.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension - the importance of excluding secondary causes: A systematic review [^114iox9c]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without any pathological findings on neuroimaging, except for signs of high intracranial pressure. Before diagnosing idiopathic intracranial hypertension, secondary causes of increased intracranial pressure should be excluded.

- **Objective**: To characterize the phenotype of patients with secondary intracranial hypertension and to identify possible risk factors for secondary intracranial hypertension.

- **Methods**: We have systematically searched the PubMed database. The publications were analyzed according to the patient phenotype, age, gender, comorbidities, body mass index/weight status, and additional medication. The results are summarized in four categories: medication, infection, hormonal-induced intracranial hypertension, and miscellaneous groups of diseases related to secondary intracranial hypertension (sIH).

- **Results**: We identified 105 eligible papers which included 272 cases. There were 49.6% pediatric cases. Among the adult group, 70.9% were women. A total of 40.4% of all cases were obese or overweight, 27% among adults and 13.4% among pediatric cases. Increased BMI and recent weight gain, anemia, renal diseases, and hypertension were the most frequent comorbidities related to sIH.

- **Conclusion**: Among sIH patients, 40.4% were obese or overweight; two-thirds were women. We recommend that even patients with a typical IIH phenotype should be screened for secondary causes.

### Overdiagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115WTpJQ]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to delineate the factors contributing to overdiagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) among patients seen in one neuro-ophthalmology service at a tertiary center.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed new patients referred with a working diagnosis of IIH over 8 months. The Diagnosis Error Evaluation and Research taxonomy tool was applied to cases referred with a diagnosis of IIH and a discrepant final diagnosis.

Results: Of 1,249 patients, 165 (13.2%) were referred either with a preexisting diagnosis of IIH or to rule out IIH. Of the 86/165 patients (52.1%) with a preexisting diagnosis of IIH, 34/86 (39.5%) did not have IIH. The most common diagnostic error was inaccurate ophthalmoscopic examination in headache patients. Of 34 patients misdiagnosed as having IIH, 27 (79.4%) had at least one lumbar puncture, 29 (85.3%) had a brain MRI, and 8 (23.5%) had a magnetic resonance/CT venogram. Twenty-six had received medical treatment, 1 had a lumbar drain, and 4 were referred for surgery. In 8 patients (23.5%), an alternative diagnosis requiring further evaluation was identified.

Conclusions: Diagnostic errors resulted in overdiagnosis of IIH in 39.5% of patients referred for presumed IIH and prompted unnecessary tests, invasive procedures, and missed diagnoses. The most common errors were inaccurate ophthalmoscopic examination in headache patients and thinking biases, reinforcing the need for rapid access to specialists with experience in diagnosing optic nerve disorders.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in childhood: pitfalls in diagnosis [^113w5qTF]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is prone to misdiagnosis. Our aim was to identify the reasons for this in children in our region referred for suspected IIH.

- **Method**: We reviewed the records of all children referred with symptoms and/or signs consistent with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to our tertiary neurology unit over 4 years. IIH was confirmed after expert ophthalmology including ultrasound/tomography and advanced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure studies.

- **Results**: Of 15 children (six males, nine females; median age 12 years, range 3–15 years), six (five females, one male) were confirmed to have IIH. All weighed above the 91st percentile and were over 10 years old. Four of the six had raised ICP secondary to other causes. Four had been misdiagnosed locally with papilloedema, three had drusen, and one had 'crowded discs'. Two had raised CSF pressures on standard lumbar puncture, but 20-minute steady state and infusion studies were normal, with symptoms settling after therapy was withdrawn.

- **Interpretation**: Misdiagnosis of IIH was frequent, but could be reduced by (1) expert ophthalmological fundoscopy, orbital ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography; (2) expert neuroradiology; and (3) assessment of steady state CSF pressure rather than standard opening pressure in centimetres of water.

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension treatment trial: Clinical profile at baseline [^114CA3g9]. JAMA Neurology (2014). High credibility.

To our knowledge, there are no large prospective cohorts of untreated patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) to characterize the disease.

We report the baseline clinical and laboratory features of patients enrolled in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial. Data were collected at baseline from questionnaires, examinations, automated perimetry, and fundus photography grading. Patients (n = 165) were enrolled from March 17, 2010, to November 27, 2012, at 38 academic and private practice sites in North America. All participants met the modified Dandy criteria for IIH and had a perimetric mean deviation between -2 dB and -7 dB. All but four participants were women.

- **Baseline and laboratory characteristics**: The mean (SD) age of our patients was 29.0 (7.4) years, and 4 (2.4%) were men. The average (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 39.9 (8.3). Headache was the most common symptom (84%). Transient visual obscurations occurred in 68% of patients, back pain in 53%, and pulse synchronous tinnitus in 52%. Only 32% reported visual loss.

The average (SD) perimetric mean deviation in the worst eye was -3.5 (1.1) dB, (range, -2.0 to -6.4 dB), and in the best eye was -2.3 (1.1) dB (range, -5.2 to 0.8 dB). A partial arcuate visual field defect with an enlarged blind spot was the most common perimetric finding. Visual acuity was 85 letters or better (20/20) in 71% of the worst eyes and 77% of the best eyes.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1131B3Y1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) presents with several clinical features. Few clinical studies have characterized IIH headache. Previously, IIH headaches were considered "high pressure" and, therefore, aggravated by the Valsalva manoeuvre, worsened when supine, and often present on waking or causing the patient to wake from sleep. However, more recent studies indicate that the majority of headaches in IIH meet the International Headache Society criteria for either episodic migraine, chronic migraine, or tension-type headache. In the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), 84% of participants had a headache at baseline. Headache is a chronic disabler in IIH and significantly reduces quality of life.

The relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and headache in IIH remains complicated. Although a reduction in ICP was found to alleviate headaches in weight loss studies, the severity, frequency, and disability of headache did not correlate with lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline in the IIHTT.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111xW6fL]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterized by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown, and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure, and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

- **Findings**: IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Medical management remains centered around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), suggesting an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials looking at new treatments.

- **Conclusions**: Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A step change in understanding the disease mechanisms [^1119MgUf]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has evolved over the past few years. Previously, IIH was considered a disease exclusively affecting the neuro-ophthalmic axis, characterized by raised intracranial pressure, headache, and papilloedema, and resulting in the risk of severe and permanent visual loss and life-changing disabling headaches. Recent advances have begun to redefine IIH as a probable metabolic disease involving a range of systemic manifestations. More than 95% of individuals affected by the disease are women of reproductive age with obesity. The incidence is rapidly rising and parallels escalating worldwide obesity rates.

Contemporary insights identify associations with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular disease in excess of that driven by obesity alone. Adipose distribution in people with IIH, like that in other metabolic diseases, is preferentially centripetal and is associated with changes in intracranial pressure. Evidence now demonstrates adipose tissue dysfunction in people with IIH, involving transcriptional and metabolic priming for lipogenesis and weight gain. Hormonal perturbations are also observed, including a unique phenotype of androgen excess that promotes cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Knowledge of these additional disease features is driving research into novel therapeutic targets and altering the approach to multidisciplinary care.

### Atypical idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Normal BMI and older patients [^111NekKk]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) typically affects young, obese women. We examined two groups of atypical patients with IIH: those with a normal body mass index (BMI) and those at least 50 years old.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of 407 consecutive adult patients with IIH and known BMI from three centers was undertaken. Demographics, associated factors, visual acuity, and visual fields were collected at presentation and follow-up.

- **Results**: We identified 18 IIH patients (4%) with normal BMI and 19 (5%) aged 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis who were compared with the remainder of the cohort. Medication-induced IIH was more frequent in patients with normal BMI (28% vs. 7%, p = 0.008). No patient with a normal BMI had severe visual loss in either eye (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.09). Older patients with IIH had lower BMI but were still generally obese (33 vs. 38, p = 0.04). They were less likely to report headache as an initial symptom (37% vs. 76%, p < 0.001) and more likely to complain of visual changes (42% vs. 21%, p = 0.03). Treatment of any type was less likely in older patients (significant for medications: 74% vs. 91%, p = 0.004), and they were more likely to have persistent disc edema at last follow-up (median Frisén grade: 1 vs. 0, p = 0.002), but had similar, if not better, visual outcomes compared with younger patients. A case-control study did not identify any new medication or risk factor associations.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with a normal body mass index and those 50 years or older make up a small proportion of patients with IIH.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^111Pb5UR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of headache: Headache is the most common presenting feature in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and leads to significant morbidity. Many patients do not have the classical headache phenotype attributed to raised intracranial pressure (ICP), and the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD 3), which does not specify a particular headache phenotype, has poor specificity (53%) in IIH. Many patients with IIH have daily headaches (86%) that often resemble migraine or tension-type headaches. Other features from the history can be useful but are not pathognomonic and can occur in both IIH and headache control subjects: exacerbation with bending (50% and 44%, respectively), morning headache (20% and 29%, respectively), and exacerbation with cough or Valsalva (70% and 35%, respectively). IIH headache improves post-lumbar puncture (LP) in 72%, but an improvement also occurs in 25% of those with headaches without IIH or a pressure syndrome.

Most headache improvement occurs during the first month following diagnosis and treatment, with constant headaches in 64% at diagnosis improving to 13% by one month. Yet, 63% continue to have headaches at 12 months, and headaches can remain even after ICP has normalized in 67%. Headache outcomes are poor even in those with no prior history of headache, with 57% having headaches at 12 months.

There is little evidence to guide the management of headache attributed to IIH. Accurate headache phenotyping is key, and mixed headache types frequently coexist (high pressure, migraine, tension-type, low pressure in those with a shunt). Medication overuse headaches often occur and are underdiagnosed.

### Clinical characteristics of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in patients over 50 years of age: A multicenter clinical cohort study [^115JWnsr]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

To characterize the clinical features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in patients over 50 years of age, this study compares them to the typical IIH population and existing data for this older cohort.

- **Design**: Retrospective, clinical cohort study.
- **Methods**: Medical records of 65 patients over 50 years of age at first diagnosis of IIH were reviewed based on the Modified Dandy Criteria from four academic centers. Each center provided randomly selected controls from among IIH patients younger than 50 years.
- **Results**: Patients over 50 years of age were less often female, had lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, experienced fewer headaches, and had a higher chance of incidentally identified papilledema. Their body mass index was similar to that of younger IIH patients. Notably, older onset of IIH was not associated with worse visual outcomes.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in atypical demographics [^1129Bz9Z]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition that most often occurs in women of reproductive age with elevated body mass index (BMI), referred to as typical patients. However, individuals outside of this demographic group, known as atypical patients, may have a different pathophysiology underlying raised intracranial pressure (ICP), leading to unique clinical presentations and prognosis.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart reviews were conducted for patients with IIH in typical and atypical demographic groups, including men, individuals diagnosed at age 40 or older, and those with a BMI less than 26.0 kg/m².

- **Results**: The study included 193 typical and 50 atypical patients with IIH. The age at diagnosis was higher in men and patients with normal BMI (37.2 ± 11.8 and 32.3 ± 9.8 years versus 27.3 ± 5.6 years). Older patients presented with headaches less often than typical patients (42.9% versus 77.2%). There were no significant differences between groups in opening pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) and degree of optic disc edema, although men had worse mean deviation (MD) on visual fields (VFs) (10.16 ± 10.40 dB versus 4.52 ± 5.53 dB in the typical group). Visual outcomes, such as the number of patients requiring surgical treatment, the development of optic atrophy, and the presence of persistent papilledema, did not significantly differ between the typical and atypical groups, although a trend toward worse VF MD was observed in men. In a pooled analysis of all patients, MD on VF at presentation was the only significant predictor of final visual outcome.

- **Conclusion**: Men and patients with normal BMI are diagnosed with IIH later in life.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^111jc8V5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

There are uncertainties regarding the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), particularly concerning the lumbar puncture (LP) opening pressure (OP). Clinicians debate the absolute LP opening value of 25 cm CSF as diagnostic of IIH, a point recognized by Friedman and colleagues. Below this cut-off, the likelihood of diagnosing IIH remains contentious. As highlighted in figure 1E, the SIG clinicians' opinions suggest an increasing likelihood in the significance of LP OP measurement as it rises. It is important to note that the LP OP is a single measurement, subject to diurnal and wide variation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure.

- **Interpretation of LP OP**: When the LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, caution should be exercised in its interpretation. A repeat LP or intracranial intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring may be considered. However, there is no definitive evidence on the recommended amount of CSF to drain or what the closing pressure should be.

- **Exclusion of secondary causes of raised ICP**: A comprehensive history should be taken to exclude potential secondary causes previously linked to raised intracranial hypertension. Although the causal link between IIH and certain diseases and medications is not clear, all patients should undergo a full blood count to exclude anemia. For patients deemed atypical (see table 1), additional blood tests and neuroimaging might be considered. This may include more proximal imaging of the neck vasculature to rule out internal jugular obstruction.

In individuals with IIH, the lack of clear evidence on contraindications continues to be an area of uncertainty.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^1176TxFh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs predominantly in women, and although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity. The accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH include raised intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, and the absence of an underlying etiology. The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing, reported to be 2.4 per 100,000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH experience symptoms such as progressively severe and frequent headaches, as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3). The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Additional symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and typically horizontal diplopia, none of which are pathognomonic for IIH. Investigation and management depend on symptoms and signs, requiring an interdisciplinary team approach.

### Disease course and long-term outcomes in pregnant women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: The IIH prospective maternal health study [^1132BsdL]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) most typically occurs in women of childbearing age, with increased weight as a key risk factor for the development or exacerbation of the disease. Pregnancy is common in this group of patients, and the longer-term effect of pregnancy on IIH has not been established; this was the aim of this study.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study (IIH Life) recruited consecutive patients with IIH between 2012 and 2021. It evaluated outcomes including vision (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity, Humphrey visual field perimetric mean deviation, and optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging) and headache. Four cohorts were evaluated: those with IIH diagnosed for the first time while pregnant, those with established IIH who became pregnant, those with a pregnancy prior to their diagnosis of IIH, and those with IIH who never became pregnant.

- **Results**: Three hundred seventy-seven people with IIH agreed to participate in the IIH Life maternal health study. The mean follow-up was 17.5 months (SD 20.5). IIH diagnosed in pregnancy was rare. Patients diagnosed with IIH while pregnant had greater papilledema (mean OCT total retinal thickness +11.59 µm/mo [95% CI 1.25–21.93]), although they had comparable visual field and acuity measures compared with those with established IIH who became pregnant during their disease course (-1.2 µm/mo [95% CI -2.6 to 0.21]). In those with established IIH, pregnancy did not adversely affect visual or headache outcomes over time, and the trajectory was akin to those with IIH who never had.

### High-pressure headaches: idiopathic intracranial hypertension and its mimics [^1112cgfr]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder that typically affects obese women of childbearing age but can also occur in pediatric populations. Patients usually present with diffuse, daily headaches and visual disturbances, but either symptom can occur in isolation. Patients with IIH often have papilledema; however, IIH without papilledema is fairly common in patients with chronic daily headaches. The pathogenesis of IIH is unknown; the high incidence of comorbid bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) in patients with IIH suggests that the two conditions are linked, although no direct causal relationship has been established.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring or lumbar puncture — which provides immediate symptomatic relief — are important in making a diagnosis of IIH. Treatments for IIH include weight reduction, medical treatment, CSF diversion surgery, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and potentially, endovascular stenting in patients with BTSS. Prevention of visual loss, which can be substantial, is the main goal of treatment. Residual headache and IIH recurrence are not uncommon after treatment, so regular follow-up is warranted even in patients who achieve remission. This review provides an update on the knowledge of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112wXduu]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is considered a rare condition. Previously, the incidence within the general population was believed to be between 0.5 and 2 per 100,000. Recent evaluations in the UK, including the largest cohort study at the time of writing, reported a 108% increase from 2.26 to 4.69 per 100,000 between 2002 and 2016. Another large case-controlled cohort study found the incidence of IIH in females had tripled from 2.5 to 9.3 per 100,000 between 2005 and 2017. Secondary to the rising incidence of IIH is the health care cost of the disorder: annual hospital costs in England rose from £9.2 million to £49.9 million between 2002 and 2014 and were predicted to rise to £462.7 million by 2030. In 2007, in the US, IIH patients had exceptionally high admission rates of 38% of all those coded with IIH for that year, with costs exceeding $444 million. This estimate also included lost work income. Repeat hospital admissions may reflect that IIH is a disease of social deprivation but also highlight the ineffectiveness of IIH treatment for decades.

Obesity (> 90%), female sex, and reproductive age are significant risk factors associated with IIH. An epidemiology study in the US found that women have an eight times greater likelihood of the disorder compared to men, which is significantly increased when overweight and of reproductive age (20–44 years) with an incidence of 12–20 per 100,000. Pediatric studies of IIH are not well established; however, one UK study found an incidence of 0.71 per 100,000, which was found to increase with age. For children aged 12–15 years, there is also an association with obesity.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in men [^111rnm2F]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the characteristics of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in men versus women in a multicenter study, medical records of all consecutive patients with definitive IIH seen at three university hospitals were reviewed. Demographics, associated factors, and visual function at presentation and follow-up were collected, with patients divided into two groups based on sex for statistical comparisons.

We included 721 consecutive patients, consisting of 66 men (9%) and 655 women (91%). Men were more likely to have sleep apnea (24% vs. 4%, p < 0.001) and were older (37 years vs. 28 years, p = 0.02). As their first symptom of IIH, men were less likely to report headaches (55% vs. 75%, p < 0.001) but more likely to report visual disturbances (35% vs. 20%, p = 0.005). Men continued to experience fewer headaches (79% vs. 89%, p = 0.01) at initial neuro-ophthalmologic assessment. Visual acuity and visual fields at presentation and last follow-up were significantly worse among men. The relative risk of severe visual loss for men compared with women was 2.1 (95% CI 1.4–3.3, p = 0.002) for at least one eye and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1–3.7, p = 0.03) for both eyes. Logistic regression supported sex as an independent risk factor for severe visual loss.

In conclusion, men with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are twice as likely as women to develop severe visual loss. Men and women have different symptom profiles, representing differences in symptom expression or thresholds between the sexes. Men with IIH likely need closer follow-up concerning visual health.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^115VnyX6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The underlying pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is uncertain. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a uniform characteristic, but the mechanism by which ICP is elevated in IIH is not clear. It is also questionable whether a single unifying mechanism elevates ICP in these individuals. Secondary causative factors that lead to the elevation of ICP may be mechanistically distinct from truly idiopathic causes.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced mainly by the choroid plexus epithelial cells, with a small amount being secreted by ependymal cells that line the ventricular system. Classically, CSF was thought to drain predominantly through the subarachnoid space via arachnoid granulations into the superior sagittal sinus. Evidence also suggests CSF drains through the cribriform plate along cranial nerves into the nasal lymphatics. The most recent hypothesis proposes the bulk flow of fluid along perivascular routes (the glymphatic pathway), which is cleared from the brain into the subarachnoid CSF, bloodstream, or cervical lymphatics. Supporting this concept is the recent discovery of lymphatic vessels in the dura that drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes.

- **Role of altered CSF dynamics**: Changes in the volume of blood, CSF, and brain tissue influence ICP. IIH likely represents a disorder of CSF regulation, potentially through CSF hypersecretion or reduced drainage.

### The idiopathic intracranial hypertension prospective cohort study: Evaluation of prognostic factors and outcomes [^115n8rX5]. Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**: This analysis includes 490 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), with a mean disease duration of 17 months (range 0–312). Of these, 161 patients had a single visit, while 329 had multiple visits, with a mean of four visits (range 2–17 encounters). Those who attended more than once had a mean follow-up duration of 23.5 months (range 0–87).

Baseline characteristics noted that there were very few men within this cohort (n = 9), with the ratio of women to men being 53:1. In the medically managed cohort (n = 426), at their first visit, 281 had active IIH and 145 were noted to have IIH in ocular remission. In the surgery cohort, all 38 at the first visit had active IIH, and 26 were in ocular remission, having undergone surgery either prior to enrollment or subsequently due to relapse.

- **Assessment and investigations**: When papilloedema is identified, it is critical to measure the blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. All mandatory tests of visual function should be recorded, including visual acuity, color vision, pupil examination, and a dilated eye examination to document the optic nerve head and macular findings, excluding an ocular cause for bilateral disc swelling. Eye movements should also be tested, as an esotropia at distance may be the only sign of a partial sixth nerve palsy. With papilloedema, the visual acuity may be normal or near-normal, so this measure alone is not predictive of the severity of the disease. Formal visual fields using manual or automated perimetry are required. Papilloedema demonstrates a variety of visual field defects, including enlargement of the blind spot, inferonasal defects, as well as central, paracentral, arcuate, and altitudinal scotomas.

### Clinical features of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116EmUUz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) seen at a tertiary care children's hospital, Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha, NE, USA. The protocol was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB# 640–15-EP), and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Due to its retrospective nature, the requirement for consent has been waived.

The study aimed to gain insight into pediatric IIH, therefore, only patients under the age of 18 were included. During the review, attention was paid to demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, clinical presentation including symptoms like headaches and papilledema, as well as imaging and lumbar puncture results. Lumbar punctures were performed following hospital protocol in the lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia.

Cases of IIH were further evaluated to ensure they met the diagnostic criteria based on the Modified Dandy Criteria and Revised Diagnostic Criteria set forth by Friedman et al. The diagnostic criteria included the presence of papilledema, a normal neurological exam, normal neuroimaging, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition, and an opening pressure greater than 28 mmHg. A definite IIH diagnosis required these criteria, whereas the absence of papilledema resulted in a probable IIH designation. Patients were classified as obese or non-obese according to the 2000 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) body mass index for age percentile growth charts. Cases were divided into pre-pubertal (under 12 years old) and other categories.

- **Neurovascular stenting for IIH with headache alone**: The literature on stenting generally does not differentiate between IIH patients with visual loss, those with headaches alone, and those with both. It also fails to distinguish between acute, chronic, and ocular remission cases of IIH. Major limitations include the use of non-randomized case series, lack of details on stenosis morphology, small sample sizes with selection bias, and insufficient long-term follow-up. Neurovascular stenting is not currently recommended for treating headaches in IIH.

- **Uncertainty**: Patients with IIH often experience migrainous headaches in addition to those caused by elevated intracranial pressure. While CSF diversion procedures have not proven effective for headache management, this may result from inadequate treatment of the migrainous component. Conversely, failure to optimize ICP via CSF diversion procedures may complicate the treatment of migrainous headaches. It is recommended that CSF diversion procedures for headache management be executed in a multidisciplinary environment, following intracranial pressure monitoring.

- **Management of headaches in shunted IIH patients**: Shunted IIH patients may suffer from significant headache-related morbidity, with shunt failures and overdrainage being potential factors. Understanding these underlying causes can guide management decisions. Shunt revision should not be routinely performed unless absolutely necessary.

### Understanding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH): A review of recent developments [^113NEVsG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of significant morbidity and rising prevalence. It typically affects young people living with obesity, mostly women of reproductive age, and can present with headaches, visual abnormalities, tinnitus, and cognitive dysfunction. Raised intracranial pressure without a secondary identified cause remains a key diagnostic feature of this condition. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that drive this increase are poorly understood.

Previous theories have focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion or impaired reabsorption. The recent characterization of the glymphatic system in many other neurological conditions necessitates a re-evaluation of these hypotheses. Further, the impact of metabolic dysfunction and hormonal dysregulation in this population must also be considered. Given the emerging evidence, it is likely that IIH is triggered by the interaction of multiple aetiological factors that ultimately results in the disruption of CSF dynamics. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the theories regarding the pathogenesis of IIH.

### Clinical features of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116LnZLH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is often linked to obesity; however, the causes of IIH in children are not well understood. This project identifies potential risk factors and features of pediatric IIH.

- **Methods**: This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of patients aged 5–17 years who were seen at a tertiary care children's hospital and diagnosed with IIH. Diagnostic criteria included the presence of papilledema, a normal neurological exam, normal neuroimaging, normal cerebrospinal fluid composition, and an opening pressure of a lumbar puncture > 28 mmHg.

- **Results**: Of the 26 cases of IIH, 19 met all diagnostic criteria for this study, while seven patients were probable IIH, as they lacked papilledema. Intracranial pressure ranged from 28 to 66 mmHg, with a mean of 40.23 mmHg (± 10.74). Overall, 50.0% (95% CI: 29.9–70.1%) of IIH patients were obese, with patients 12 years of age and younger exhibiting an overall obesity rate of 30.7%, and patients 13 years of age and older having an obesity rate of 69.2%. The overall allergy rate in this IIH patient population was 46.2% (95% CI: 26.6–66.6%).

Obesity appears to have no association with IIH in younger cases, but it is a more common feature in older children. An autoimmune component may play a role in pediatric IIH, given the high rate of atopy observed in this pediatric IIH patient cohort. Because a diagnosis of IIH can have an absence of optic nerve edema, taking a detailed history and performing a thorough examination are keys to diagnosing IIH in the pediatric population.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^114Rijdk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Over time, the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria used to describe idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) have evolved. The first case of IIH, then termed serous meningitis, was probably reported in the 1890s by Henrich Quincke, a German physician, when lumbar puncture (LP) was first introduced. Nonne described a series of cases, similar to Dandy, of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) without tumor, termed pseudotumor cerebri. Both series contained cases that we now recognize as raised ICP secondary to a known etiology.

The maturing nomenclature and diagnostic criteria have reflected the advances in investigating patients, particularly in neuroimaging and understanding normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure measurements, and our increasing appreciation of the clinical course of the disease. Some patients have a mild and self-limiting course, while others experience substantial morbidity from visual loss and persistent headache.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^113nD3eS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnostic principles for idiopathic intracranial hypertension emphasize the need for clear communication between clinicians to ensure seamless collaboration among various specialties. The primary objectives of investigating patients with papilloedema are to identify any underlying treatable cause promptly, protect the patient's vision, and ensure timely re-examination if vision is at risk. It is also essential to facilitate onward care with input from the most appropriate experienced clinician.

- **Investigating papilloedema**: Blood pressure must be measured to exclude malignant hypertension, defined as a diastolic blood pressure of 120 mmHg or more, or a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or more. An ophthalmology examination is crucial; all patients should have papilloedema confirmed and an assessment of the imminent risk to their visual function. The examination should include recording visual acuity, pupil examination, intraocular pressure to exclude hypotony, formal visual field test (perimetry), and a dilated fundal examination to grade the severity of papilloedema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

- **Documentation**: Where possible, the fundus picture should be documented with drawings, and key findings on the optic nerve head such as hyperaemia, haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and obscuration of the vessels should be recorded. Photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are useful tools. When visual function is threatened, regular ophthalmic examination is necessary, as it will influence further management.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^117R9TwQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause, when all other causes of raised ICP have been excluded. IIH causes significant morbidity, including permanent visual loss in up to 25% of cases, with reports of 1–2% of new cases being registered blind per year, and disabling headache in the majority. With peak presentation being between ages 20 and 40 years, an overwhelming female predominance, and a strong association with obesity, IIH is well known as a disorder that affects overweight women of reproductive age.

There are a number of indicators that the incidence and prevalence of IIH are rising, likely related to the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. The WHO indicates a twofold increase in the UK between 1997 and 2002 and a threefold increase in the United States between 1990 and 2006. A recent epidemiology study reported an incidence of IIH occurring in 28/100,000/year, which is the highest reported rate in the literature so far. In the United States, there was a 320% increase in new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt procedures for IIH between 1998 and 2002. IIH is an expensive condition for society and the individual; in the United States, total economic costs are estimated at greater than US$444 million per annum, and 57% of patients report significant lost earnings with 31% changing occupation.

The etiology and pathology are not fully established, and the disorder has become the subject of increasing scientific scrutiny over the last decade. With no single cause implicated, uncertainties surround the best therapeutics…

### Syphilis mimicking idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116NULca]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of yet unknown aetiology, predominantly affecting obese females of childbearing age. IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion because raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure may occur secondary to numerous other medical conditions. An atypical phenotype or an atypical disease course should alert the physician to reevaluate a presumed IIH diagnosis.

The authors report a case of a 32-year-old non-obese male with intracranial hypertension secondary to a syphilitic central nervous system infection, initially misdiagnosed as being idiopathic. Upon relevant antibiotic treatment, signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure resolved completely. Syphilis is a rare but very important differential diagnosis that, in this case, was clinically indistinguishable from IIH.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^116TCJd4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardizing recruitment criteria for clinical trials.

The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterized; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation, as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management, but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Consensus guidelines on management [^115UJZJv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

This consensus document aims to provide practical information for best practice in uniform investigation and treatment strategies based on literature and opinions from a specialist interest group (SIG) for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The objective is to increase awareness of IIH among clinicians and improve patient outcomes.

The target audience includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, emergency medicine specialists, physicians, ear, nose, and throat specialists, and other clinicians involved in the investigation and management of IIH. It also contains information relevant to primary care providers and other healthcare professionals.

The economic burden of IIH has been increasingly highlighted by various groups. Clear guidance through this document will aid in educating attending doctors to appropriately manage these patients, thereby reducing repeat unsolicited emergency hospital visits and decreasing IIH-related disability. As ongoing clinical trials continue and evidence for medical and surgical management of IIH evolves, this document will require timely updates to incorporate new findings.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115bJLUf]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Basic science research has begun to uncover the metabolic etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). There is a clear unmet need for biomarkers of disease activity and better-tolerated treatments. Translating this knowledge will better serve our patients and the health community, where IIH still carries a significant stigma and bias due to its association with obesity.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^1134dB8D]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilloedema (IIHWOP), no risk of vision loss has been identified, and it does not seem to develop over the disease course. Visual phenomena such as photopsia, diplopia (from sixth nerve palsy), and functional visual field loss are common. Headache is the principal morbidity in these patients. Once a definite diagnosis of IIHWOP is made, all patients should be managed as in typical idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and counseled about weight management. The management of headaches should be the same as in typical IIH. Surgical management to control elevated intracranial pressure in IIHWOP should not be routinely considered unless advised by experienced clinicians within a multidisciplinary team setting.

- **Follow-up and monitoring of IIH**:
	- Any patient with papilloedema should have the following documented: visual acuity, pupil examination, formal visual field assessment, and dilated fundal examination to grade the papilloedema. A BMI calculation and formal documentation of the optic nerve head appearance, such as serial photographs or OCT imaging, are useful. There are increasing reports of the utility of transorbital ultrasound to measure optic nerve sheath diameter; however, there are considerable differences across studies on the cut-off values used, as well as the efficacy of ultrasound to predict intracranial pressure (ICP). All patients, regardless of the presence of papilloedema, should have an assessment.

- **Acute exacerbation investigation**: For all shunted patients with IIH presenting with an acute exacerbation of headaches, funduscopy is mandatory to establish if papilloedema exists. Where visual function, including formal visual fields, is documented to be worsening, surgical intervention may be required. For those with atrophic optic nerves, further care should be taken to determine whether the headache is secondary to raised intracranial pressure.

- **Suspicion of infection**: In scenarios where there is suspicion of infection that may be worsening the headache, CSF should be obtained for microbiological evaluation, and any underlying resultant infection should be appropriately treated.

A diagnostic lumbar puncture should not be routinely performed in the absence of papilloedema unless there is suspicion of infection. In those with papilloedema, some may choose to perform a diagnostic lumbar puncture. This may be helpful to establish ICP levels and may have implications for management choices.

CT imaging and shunt X-ray series should not routinely be considered for those without evidence of papilloedema, as these investigations do not alter the management. In some cases, ICP monitoring may be useful.

- **Note on figure 4**: Flow chart of acute exacerbation of headache in IIH with known CSF shunt in situ. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

- **Acute exacerbation treatment**: For patients without papilloedema or imminent risk to vision, shunt revision is not recommended.

### Therapeutic lumbar puncture for headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Minimal gain, is it worth the pain [^116PmTw6]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Participants with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) were prospectively recruited from the out-patient department at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, a tertiary referral hospital in the United Kingdom. Patients were asked to consent to lumbar puncture (LP) for research purposes. Eligibility criteria included fulfillment of the updated modified Dandy criteria: no evidence of intracranial pathology or venous sinus thrombosis verified by magnetic resonance or computerized tomography imaging and venography at diagnosis, and LP opening pressure ≥ 25 cm CSF. Consequently, all patients had undergone a previous diagnostic LP. Only those with active IIH, defined by papilledema with a Frisén grade ≥ 1 and LP opening pressure ≥ 25 cm CSF at the time of study recruitment, were included. To avoid recruitment bias, all those prospectively screened who met the eligibility criteria were informed of the study and offered recruitment.

- **Patient consents**: Patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval was obtained through Research Ethics Committees (13/YH/0366 and 14/WM/0011).

- **Patient assessment**: Eligibility was confirmed following assessment by a neuro-ophthalmological examination, which included fundus photography with subsequent grading of the papilledema (Frisén grade 0–5, with 5 being the most severe) performed by three masked reviewers. Patient demographics were recorded. A standardized LP was conducted using a Quincke type point, 20GA 3.50 IN, 0.9 mm × 90 mm (Becton Dickinson™, Spain) spinal needle. An ultrasound scan was used to m

### Disease activity in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A 3-month follow-up study [^114JkLHm]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder characterized by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of identifiable pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical presentation and monitor a 3-month course using frequent optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluations, visual field testing, and lumbar opening pressure measurements. A longitudinal study of 17 patients with newly diagnosed IIH and 20 healthy overweight controls was included.

Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and retinal thickness (RT) measurements (Stratus OCT-3, fast RNFL 3.4 protocol) and Humphrey visual field testing were evaluated at regular intervals. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed at the final visit (n = 13). The diagnostic delay was 3 months, with initial symptoms including headache (94%), visual blurring (82%), and pulsatile tinnitus (65%).

Complete clinical remission was achieved in 65% of patients, partial remission in 29%, and unchanged symptoms in 6%. Total average RNFLT and RT decreased significantly during the follow-up period (p < 0.05). In patients who lost more than 3.5% of their BMI, ICP decreased significantly (p = 0.0003). However, in patients with weight loss less than 3.5% of BMI, changes in ICP were insignificant (p = 0.6). OCT combined with visual field testing may be a valuable objective tool to monitor IIH patients, and the short-term outcome for IIH is positive.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Pathophysiology and management [^115zcDhL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) depend on the geographical location of the population studied. Andrews et al. highlighted the diversity in the worldwide epidemiology for IIH and cautioned against comparing the rates because of inconsistent definitions of obesity used in various studies. Evidence from the literature suggests an incidence between 1 and 3 per 100,000 per year in the general population. When stratified for reproductive age, female gender, and weight, the incidence rises to 12–28 per 100,000 per year.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115cM4wL]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterized by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown, and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure, and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

- **Findings**: IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Medical management remains centered around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that suggest an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials looking at new treatments.

- **Conclusions**: Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^114v4iE2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

In collaboration with many different experienced clinicians, professions, and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH. We recognize that we were limited by the lack of high-quality evidence for the majority of the statements made and that a consensus-based approach could give authority to singular opinions. To mitigate this, we have sought international expert review (GTL, RHJ, and KD) and review by professional bodies (ABN, BASH, RCOphth, and SBNS). Following review, a few points were upheld by the SIG, such as the definition of typical IIH being diagnosed as obese and not just overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²), which differs from published diagnostic criteria. As this document is aimed at a wide audience, including non-IIH specialists, we wished to create criteria whereby the majority of patients with IIH would be correctly diagnosed. Hence, we needed to emphasize those patients in whom uncertainty could exist and referral to an experienced clinician may be required. It was also highlighted that compared with our European and North American colleagues, there are few centers in the UK that perform ONSF for IIH.

These statements are not mandatory recommendations but are intended to be used as a guide for doctors who investigate and treat IIH. Despite the limitations of consensus-based methods, these statements reflect an up-to-date consensus to guide the clinician and serve our patients. Quality prospective research is required for all areas of uncertainties highlighted in this guidance.

### Paediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113TnSaj]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in the pediatric population, with clinical characteristics that may differ from adult presentation. The authors present a case of an 11-year-old boy experiencing severe holocranial headaches for the past four weeks. Best-corrected visual acuities (BCVA) were 20/200 bilaterally, and the fundus examination showed marked bilateral optic disc and macular edema. A CT scan with contrast and MRI showed no space-occupying lesions, normal permeability of the dural venous sinuses, and a partially empty sella. Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 540 mm Hg with clear cerebrospinal fluid and normal biochemistry and cytology. The patient was treated medically and subsequently underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunting procedure. Three months after surgery, the symptoms were completely resolved, and his BCVA was 20/20 bilaterally.

### Clinical characterization of idiopathic intracranial hypertension at the Detroit Medical Center [^1147xHqX]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or radiologic evidence of an intracranial space-occupying lesion, meningeal inflammation, or venous outflow obstruction. Previous population-based studies have evaluated the presenting clinical features of IIH in regions such as North-Eastern Libya, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Northern Ireland, Israel, and Western Turkey. However, here we report the demographic patterns in a metropolitan North American city.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of all patients with an initial IIH diagnosis and follow-up at the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Michigan, from 1985 to 2002. Medical records of 174 patients were reviewed, with 77 patients meeting the diagnostic criteria.

- **Results**: Seventy-seven patients were identified, comprising 71 females (92.2%) and 6 males (7.8%). The age range was from 10 to 50 years, with a mean age of 34 years. Among these patients, 50 (65%) were African-American, and 24 (31%) were Caucasian. The most common presentation was an isolated headache (28.6%). Nineteen patients (24.7%) were asymptomatic. Obesity was noted in 65 of 74 patients (87.8%) evaluated for body dimensions.

- **Conclusions**: We report an increased number of asymptomatic patients identified after routine ophthalmic examinations. Obese females in metropolitan Detroit may benefit from routine eye evaluations to avoid potential visual loss related to papilledema.
