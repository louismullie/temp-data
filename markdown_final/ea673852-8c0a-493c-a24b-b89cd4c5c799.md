## Question

screening for thyroid cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether population screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults should be recommended, and if not, what the rationale and exceptions are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core recommendation and its grade. Then, I should verify the evidence base for benefits and harms. Next, I will examine overdiagnosis and overtreatment data. After that, I need to check the accuracy and performance of screening tests. I will then consider epidemiology and mortality trends. I should also review what major guidelines say beyond USPSTF. Finally, I will identify any high-risk exceptions and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation so I don't jump to conclusions: the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults, assigning a Grade D rating, which means there is moderate certainty that harms outweigh benefits or there is no net benefit, and clinicians should discourage this service [^111rLuZa] [^11147wQy] [^1172dn14].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on benefits before I weigh harms. The USPSTF found no direct evidence that screening asymptomatic adults with neck palpation or ultrasound improves morbidity or mortality, and no randomized trials show that earlier or immediate treatment of screen-detected differentiated thyroid cancer improves outcomes compared with observation; observational comparisons are confounded and cannot establish causality, so the magnitude of benefit is bounded as no greater than small [^116x9mkn] [^113KzjRa] [^1174MGaY].

> I need to check the magnitude of harms next. The USPSTF determined that the overall harms of screening and downstream treatment are at least moderate, including surgical complications such as permanent hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and risks from radioactive iodine including second primary malignancies and salivary gland injury; importantly, overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely substantial with population screening, which can convert people into patients without improving survival [^114yDPY4] [^1174MGaY] [^111rLuZa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overdiagnosis without anchoring to epidemiology. Incidence of thyroid cancer has risen sharply in many countries while mortality remains stable, the classic disjunction that signals overdiagnosis; South Korea's experience shows a roughly 6-fold increase in incidence driven almost entirely by detection of sub-20 mm tumors after widespread ultrasound use, with no corresponding mortality decline, and autopsy series reveal a large reservoir of occult papillary thyroid carcinoma, supporting the existence of indolent disease that screening would uncover unnecessarily [^115gopLj] [^112qz5by] [^113FrLVS].

> I should double-check the test performance characteristics because poor accuracy would further undermine screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the accuracy of neck palpation or ultrasound as screening tests in asymptomatic persons; where ultrasound features have been studied, sensitivity can appear high but specificity is limited, and studies without complete follow-up of negatives can overestimate sensitivity, so positive screens will yield many false positives and low predictive value in low-prevalence settings [^115KLjjP] [^114kBCjt].

> Let me consider the epidemiology and prognosis to ensure the balance of benefit and harm is coherent. Most thyroid cancers are differentiated and have excellent 5-year survival, around 98% overall, with 99% for localized disease versus about 55% for distant disease; incidence has increased while mortality has remained flat, reinforcing that much of the rise reflects detection of small, indolent tumors rather than a true increase in clinically important disease [^111DUqCR] [^115DKtMY].

> Next, I should review concordance across guidelines so I'm not over-relying on a single body. The American Cancer Society does not recommend screening for thyroid cancer, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against screening by palpation or ultrasound in asymptomatic persons, and the American Thyroid Association and allied endocrine societies do not recommend screening asymptomatic individuals; specialty guidance emphasizes risk-stratified diagnostic evaluation of nodules rather than population screening [^115x4avt] [^112aFnq4] [^111QghER].

> But wait, what if there are high-risk groups where screening might help despite the general recommendation? I need to ensure I identify exceptions correctly. The USPSTF D recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults; it does not apply to people with symptoms or those at increased risk such as those with a history of childhood head and neck radiation, inherited syndromes like FAP or MEN2, or a first-degree family history of thyroid cancer; even in these groups, evidence that screening improves outcomes is limited, so decisions should be individualized and cautious, with some specialty guidelines suggesting consideration of ultrasound in select familial contexts while acknowledging very low certainty [^111RUpvi] [^114AKJtA] [^116WLrMt].

> I should confirm practical counseling points so clinicians can translate this into practice. For asymptomatic adults, avoid thyroid ultrasound screening. If a nodule is incidentally found on imaging, apply size- and risk-based thresholds before pursuing ultrasound, and if ultrasound is pursued, use validated risk stratification systems to guide whether biopsy is warranted. For cytologically benign nodules, surveillance rather than intervention is appropriate, and for low-risk differentiated cancers, active surveillance can be a reasonable alternative to immediate surgery in selected patients [^112KELhd] [^114VyUze] [^115qZK6m].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance to ensure internal consistency. No proven mortality benefit, substantial risks from surgery and radioactive iodine, and a high likelihood of overdiagnosis with resultant overtreatment together establish a negative net benefit for population screening. Therefore, the appropriate recommendation is to discourage screening asymptomatic adults for thyroid cancer while maintaining vigilance for symptomatic presentations and carefully managing incidentally discovered nodules within evidence-based diagnostic frameworks [^111rLuZa] [^1174MGaY] [^114Fch8i].

---

Routine screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults is **not recommended** by the USPSTF (Grade D) [^111rLuZa] because it does not reduce mortality and can cause harm through overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^1174MGaY]. Screening is only considered for **high-risk groups** [^114AKJtA] with a history of childhood head/neck radiation, familial syndromes (e.g. FAP, MEN2), or a strong family history of thyroid cancer [^114hx93j]. For the general population, avoid ultrasound or palpation screening; manage incidental nodules using risk-stratified ultrasound and FNA [^114VyUze] to limit unnecessary surgery and complications [^112KELhd].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

Thyroid cancer incidence has risen sharply in recent decades, largely due to increased detection of small, indolent papillary microcarcinomas [^114AFhSV] [^115gopLj], while **mortality remains low and stable**, indicating substantial overdiagnosis [^111DUqCR] [^112qz5by]. Most thyroid cancers are differentiated and have excellent 5-year survival (≈98%) [^111DUqCR], especially when localized [^115DKtMY].

---

## Evidence regarding screening effectiveness

### Benefits

There is **no evidence** that screening asymptomatic adults reduces thyroid cancer mortality [^111rLuZa] [^116x9mkn]. Observational data show stable mortality despite rising incidence, arguing against a mortality benefit from screening [^111DUqCR] [^112qz5by].

---

### Harms

- **Overdiagnosis**: Detection of indolent cancers that would never cause symptoms or death, leading to unnecessary treatment [^111rLuZa] [^11542bWr].

- **Overtreatment**: Unnecessary surgery (thyroidectomy) with risks of permanent hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury [^1174MGaY].

- **Psychological burden**: Anxiety and distress from false positives and unnecessary procedures [^112qfuT6] [^111Fw2Mw].

---

## Professional organization recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** | **Grade/level** |
|-|-|-|
| USPSTF | Against screening asymptomatic adults | Grade D [^111rLuZa] |
| ATA | No recommendation for or against screening asymptomatic adults | Insufficient evidence [^notfound] |
| AACE | Do not screen general population or low-risk patients | Grade C [^116UppHQ] |
| AAES | Consider screening only in high-risk families (≥ 3 affected relatives) | Conditional [^notfound] |

---

## High-risk populations

Screening may be considered for **high-risk groups**, including individuals with a history of childhood head/neck radiation, familial syndromes (FAP, MEN2), or a strong family history (≥ 3 affected relatives) [^114AKJtA] [^116WLrMt]. Even in these groups, evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^116WLrMt].

---

## Diagnostic tools and their limitations

- **Neck palpation**: Low sensitivity; many nodules are non-palpable [^1174MGaY] [^116Pj6C3].

- **Ultrasound**: High sensitivity but low specificity; detects many small, clinically insignificant nodules [^114kBCjt] [^116wXYqC].

- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Accurate for suspicious nodules but not recommended for very small (< 1 cm) or low-risk nodules [^114VyUze] [^111QghER].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines emphasize **risk-stratified evaluation** of thyroid nodules using ultrasound patterns and clinical context to guide FNA and management [^114VyUze] [^114Fch8i]. They also discourage routine ultrasound screening in asymptomatic adults [^116UppHQ] and recommend surveillance for low-risk nodules to avoid overtreatment [^114oR7ix].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults is **not recommended** due to lack of mortality benefit and potential harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^111rLuZa]. Screening may be considered for high-risk individuals, but evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized. Use risk-stratified approaches for incidental nodules to minimize unnecessary surgery and complications [^112KELhd].

American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer — scope, methods, and key recommendation areas are outlined, stating that the aim is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on evidence for diagnosis and management. The clinical questions were based on prior guideline versions and stakeholder and task force input, with eligibility limited to published English-language adult articles, and evidence appraisal and recommendation grading for therapeutic interventions used the American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System; competing interests were regularly updated, managed, and communicated. Recommendation areas for thyroid nodules include initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign nodules, while initial thyroid cancer management recommendations include screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine.

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: a review [^112KELhd]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Observations

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with 1 or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended for nodules at least 1.5 cm in patients 35 years or older and for nodules at least 1.0 cm in patients younger than 35 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only a few select incidental thyroid nodules require further evaluation with ultrasonography based on recommendations that aim to diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers while reducing unnecessary workup and provide guidance for clinical practice.

American College of Physicians' guideline grading system (for therapeutic interventions) — interpretation and implications: Strong recommendation — Benefits clearly outweigh harms and burdens, or vice versa; Patients: Most would want course of action; a person should request discussion if an intervention is not offered; Clinicians: Most patients should receive the recommended course of action; Policymakers: The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most circumstances. Weak recommendation — Benefits closely balanced with harms and burdens; Patients: Many would want course of action, but some may not; the decision may depend on individual circumstances; Clinicians: Different choices will be appropriate for different patients; the management decision should be consistent with patients' preferences and circumstances; Policymakers: Policymaking will require careful consideration and stakeholder input. No recommendation — Balance of benefits and risks cannot be determined; Decisions based on evidence cannot be made.

### Evaluating the rising incidence of thyroid cancer and thyroid nodule detection modes: a multinational, multi-institutional analysis [^1161HN1T]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

There is epidemiologic evidence that the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is associated with subclinical disease detection. Evidence for a true increase in thyroid cancer incidence has also been identified. However, a true increase in disease would likely be heralded by an increased incidence of thyroid-referable symptoms in patients presenting with disease.

Objectives

To evaluate whether modes of detection (MODs) used to identify thyroid nodules for surgical removal have changed compared with historic data and to determine if MODs vary by geographic location.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a retrospective analysis of pathology and medical records of 1328 patients who underwent thyroid-directed surgery in 16 centers in 4 countries: 4 centers in Canada, 1 in Denmark, 1 in South Africa, and 12 in the US. The participants were the first 100 patients (or the largest number available) at each center who had thyroid surgery in 2019. The MOD of the thyroid finding that required surgery was classified using an updated version of a previously validated tool as endocrine condition, symptomatic thyroid, surveillance, or without thyroid-referable symptoms (asymptomatic). If asymptomatic, the MOD was further classified as clinician screening examination, patient-requested screening, radiologic serendipity, or diagnostic cascade.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The MOD of thyroid nodules that were surgically removed, by geographic variation; and the proportion and size of thyroid cancers discovered in patients without thyroid-referable symptoms compared with symptomatic detection. Data analyses were performed from April 2021 to February 2022.

Results

Of the 1328 patients (mean [SD] age, 52 [15] years; 993 [75%] women; race/ethnicity data were not collected) who underwent thyroid surgery that met inclusion criteria, 34% (448) of the surgeries were for patients with thyroid-related symptoms, 41% (542) for thyroid findings discovered without thyroid-referable symptoms, 14% (184) for endocrine conditions, and 12% (154) for nodules with original MOD unknown (under surveillance). Cancer was detected in 613 (46%) patients; of these, 30% (183 patients) were symptomatic and 51% (310 patients) had no thyroid-referable symptoms. The mean (SD) size of the cancers identified in the symptomatic group was 3.2 (2.1) cm (median [range] cm, 2.6 [0.2–10.5]; 95% CI, 2.91–3.52) and in the asymptomatic group, 2.1 (1.4) cm (median [range] cm, 1.7 [0.05–8.8]; 95% CI, 1.92–2.23). The MOD patterns were significantly different among all participating countries.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective analysis found that most thyroid cancers were discovered in patients who had no thyroid-referable symptoms; on average, these cancers were smaller than symptomatic thyroid cancers. Still, some asymptomatic cancers were large, consistent with historic data. The substantial difference in MOD patterns among the 4 countries suggests extensive variations in practice.

### Management of thyroid incidentalomas [^115v6mUa]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The discovery of a thyroid incidentaloma warrants a systematic approach for those nodules most likely to be cancerous. An optimal management strategy for thyroid incidentalomas should be guided by four questions: (1) Does the incidentally detected thyroid nodule put the patient at risk for an adverse outcome; (2) Can those individuals with malignant thyroid nodules be identified; (3) Is the treatment of thyroid malignancy more effective in presymptomatic patients; and (4) Do the beneficial effects of presymptomatic detection and treatment in these patients justify the costs incurred Physicians caring for patients with thyroid disease should participate in data acquisition in national databases and properly randomized studies, to address the optimal management strategy in the treatment of incidentally-detected thyroid nodules.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — "The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to determine whether screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons using neck palpation or ultrasound improves health outcomes". It further states, "The USPSTF determined that the magnitude of benefit can be bounded as no greater than small, based on the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between patients who are treated vs only monitored (ie, for the most common tumor types), and the observational evidence demonstrating no change in mortality over time after introduction of a population-based screening program".

### Screening for thyroid cancer: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1174MGaY]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The incidence of detected thyroid cancer cases has been increasing in the United States since 1975. The majority of thyroid cancers are differentiated cancers with excellent prognosis and long-term survival.

Objective

To systematically review the benefits and harms associated with thyroid cancer screening and treatment of early thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published from January 1966 through January 2016, with active surveillance through December 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies conducted in asymptomatic adult populations.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool surgical harms.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Thyroid cancer morbidity and mortality, test accuracy to detect thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer, and harms resulting from screening (including overdiagnosis) or treatment of thyroid cancer.

Results

Of 10 424 abstracts, 707 full-text articles were reviewed, and 67 studies were included for this review. No fair- to good-quality studies directly examined the benefit of thyroid cancer screening. In 2 studies (n = 354), neck palpation was not sensitive to detect thyroid nodules. In 2 methodologically limited studies (n = 243), a combination of selected high-risk sonographic features was specific for thyroid malignancy. Three studies (n = 5894) directly addressed the harms of thyroid cancer screening, none of which suggested any serious harms from screening or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. No screening studies directly examined the risk of overdiagnosis. Two observational studies (n = 39 211) included cohorts of persons treated for well-differentiated thyroid cancer and persons with no surgery or surveillance; however, these studies did not adjust for confounders and therefore were not designed to determine if earlier or immediate treatment vs delayed or no surgical treatment improves patient outcomes. Based on 36 studies (n = 43 295), the 95% CI for the rate of surgical harm was 2.12 to 5.93 cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism per 100 thyroidectomies and 0.99 to 2.13 cases of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy per 100 operations. Based on 16 studies (n = 291 796), treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer with radioactive iodine is associated with a small increase in risk of second primary malignancies and with increased risk of permanent adverse effects on the salivary gland, such as dry mouth.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although ultrasonography of the neck using high-risk sonographic characteristics plus follow-up cytology from fine-needle aspiration can identify thyroid cancers, it is unclear if population-based or targeted screening can decrease mortality rates or improve important patient health outcomes. Screening that results in the identification of indolent thyroid cancers, and treatment of these overdiagnosed cancers, may increase the risk of patient harms.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1163ikxK]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy and second malignancy risk: Although patients should be counseled on the risks of second primary malignancy with RAI treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer, the absolute increase in risk attributable to RAI is very small and does not warrant specific screening beyond the age-appropriate general population (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Cumulative 131I activities above 500–600 mCi are associated with a significant increase in risk, the risk is clearly increased when the cumulative activity is higher than 600 mCi, and there is no direct evidence of increased risk after a single administration of 30–100 mCi. A meta-analysis reported a higher risk of second malignancies with RR 1.19 (95% CI 1.04–1.36, p < 0.010) and an increased risk of leukemia with RAI (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.13–5.53, p < 0.024), with greater excess leukemia risk in patients aged < 45 years (standardized incidence rate 5.32 [95% CI 2.75–9.30]) versus older individuals (2.26 [95% CI 1.43–3.99]). The risk of secondary malignancies is dose related, with an excess absolute risk of 14.4 solid cancers and 0.8 leukemias per gigabecquerel (1 GBq = 27 mCi) of 131I at 10,000 person-years of follow-up; the use of laxatives may decrease radiation exposure of the bowel, and vigorous oral hydration will reduce exposure of the bladder and gonads.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^113W31rr]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

Incidental thyroid nodules detected by CT — The ACR white paper recommends no further investigation for nodules detected incidentally by CT scan that are < 1.5 cm, in patients > 35 years of age, and that have no suspicious CT features (no invasion of local tissues by the thyroid nodule or abnormal lymph nodes [ie, calcifications, cystic components, increased enhancement]). Nodules > 1.5 cm or with suspicious features should undergo ultrasound, which is much better at identifying features suspicious for malignancy. Suspicious nodules by ultrasound should undergo fine needle aspiration; others can be followed by serial ultrasound. This approach can markedly decrease the number of patients needing further investigation, with indirect evidence that there is no clinically relevant effect on long-term outcomes. Of note, the thyroid guidelines do not recommend screening for thyroid nodules, even in patients with familial high risk.

### The natural history of benign thyroid nodules [^11281n7i]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Detection of asymptomatic thyroid nodules has increased. Consensus is lacking regarding the optimal follow-up of cytologically proven benign lesions and sonographically nonsuspicious nodules. Current guidelines recommend serial ultrasound examinations and reassessment of cytology if significant growth is observed.

Objective

To determine the frequency, magnitude, and factors associated with changes in thyroid nodule size.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, multicenter, observational study involving 992 consecutive patients with 1 to 4 asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules. Patients were recruited from 8 hospital-based thyroid-disease referral centers in Italy between 2006 and 2008. Data collected during the first 5 years of follow-up, through January 2013, were analyzed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Baseline nodule growth (primary end point) was assessed with yearly thyroid ultrasound examinations. Size changes were considered significant for growth if an increase of 20% or more was recorded in at least 2 nodule diameters, with a minimum increase of 2 mm. Baseline factors associated with growth were identified. Secondary end points were the sonographic detection of new nodules and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer during follow-up.

Results

Nodule growth occurred in 153 patients (15.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-16.5%]). One hundred seventy-four of the 1567 original nodules (11.1% [95% CI, 10.3%-11.9%]) increased in size, with a mean 5-year largest diameter increase of 4.9 mm (95% CI, 4.2–5.5 mm), from 13.2 mm (95% CI, 12.1–14.2 mm) to 18.1 mm (95% CI, 16.7–19.4 mm). Nodule growth was associated with presence of multiple nodules (OR, 2.2 [95% CI 1.4–3.4] for 2 nodules; OR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.8–5.6 for 3 nodules; and OR, 8.9 [95% CI, 4.4–18.0] for 4 nodules), main nodule volumes larger than 0.2 mL (OR, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.7–4.9] for volumes > 0.2 to < 1 mL and OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.8–5.1] for volumes ≥ 1 mL), and male sex (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1–2.6]), whereas an age of 60 years or older was associated with a lower risk of growth than age younger than 45 years (OR, 0.5 [95% CI 0.3–0.9]). In 184 individuals (18.5% [95% CI, 16.4%-20.9%]), nodules shrank spontaneously. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 5 original nodules (0.3% [95% CI, 0.0%-0.6%]). Only 2 had grown. An incidental cancer was found at thyroidectomy in a nonvisualized nodule. New nodules developed in 93 patients (9.3% [95% CI, 7.5%-11.1%]), with detection of one cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules, the majority of nodules exhibited no significant size increase during 5 years of follow-up and thyroid cancer was rare. These findings support consideration of revision of current guideline recommendations for follow-up of asymptomatic thyroid nodules.

Familial follicular cell–derived differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) screening — evidence and recommendation: "the panel cannot recommend for or against US screening since there is no evidence that this would lead to reduced morbidity or mortality" and this is labeled "No recommendation, Insufficient evidence". Epidemiologically, "5%–10% of DTCs have a familial occurrence", yet "when only two first-degree family members are affected, the probability that the disease is sporadic is 62%", and "no intervention screening programs have ever been reported in at-risk family members". As an exception, "Syndromes associated with DTC (e.g. PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome [Cowden's disease], familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP], Carney complex, multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] 2, Werner syndrome/progeria) in a first-degree relative, warrant screening based on various components of that syndrome (41)".

Recommendation grading and Good Practice Statements (GPS) specify that "Each recommendation was graded as strong or conditional (Table 1)". "Strong recommendations are applicable to all or nearly all persons or situations and are indicated when benefits clearly outweigh harms with at least moderate certainty", and supporting factors include "high feasibility and acceptability, low or efficient costs of use of resources, and anticipated positive impacts on equity", with Table 1 noting that "Strong recommendations are only indicated when certainty is low or very low in limited circumstances". "Conditional recommendations are appropriate to most people or situations" and "are indicated when the balance of benefits to harms is relatively close, when there is lower certainty about benefits and/or harms, when decisions are preference-sensitive, or when there are important concerns about feasibility, acceptability, resource use, or equity impact". A "Good Practice Statement (GPS) served as an alternative to a graded recommendation in selected situations"; "A GPS is not GRADE-d but is like a strong recommendation, in that it is applicable to all or nearly all persons or situations; not following a GPS would be considered outside of usual practice", requires that "the benefits of the recommended intervention must be obvious and actually and certainly outweigh harms", and "A unanimous consensus was required for all GPS included in these guidelines".

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^1145XabL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Primum non nocere

Clinicians encountering patients with thyroid nodules today are faced with the task of avoiding the overdiagnosis of low-risk cancers without jeopardizing the chances of identifying those rare advanced or higher risk tumors that will require prompt treatment. Overdiagnosis implies the discovery of conditions that will never cause morbidity or death. As such, their identification can trigger a cascade of deleterious events: people are transformed into patients, with inevitable emotional consequences and potential exposure to risks related to overmedicalization and overtreatment. At the public health level, overdiagnosis overstretches the capacities of health systems, increases spending, and subtracts resources from patients with the greatest health care needs. It is little wonder that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force now recommends against thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults, because its harmful effects outweigh its potential benefits. The recommendation against screening does not apply to patients with known risk factors for thyroid cancer (e.g. childhood radiation exposure in the form of radioactive fallout or radiotherapy, including low-dose forms for benign conditions; inherited syndromes associated with thyroid cancer; a family history of thyroid cancer), but even in these cases, the benefits of early detection have yet to be demonstrated. So, the implementation of sonographic screening programs for thyroid nodules is discouraged.

American Thyroid Association diagnostic test grading — Strong recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result clearly outweighs risks and burden of testing or vice versa". For patients, "In the case of an accurate test for which benefits outweigh risks/burden, most would want the diagnostic to be offered (with appropriate counseling)" and, when risks/burden outweigh benefits, "most patients should not expect the test to be offered". For clinicians, "most patients should be offered the diagnostic test (and provided relevant counseling)" and if harms outweigh benefits "the rationale against the test should, for the particular clinical situation, be explained". For policymakers, "availability of the diagnostic test should be adopted in health policy" and if harms predominate "some restrictions on circumstances for test use may need to be considered". Weak recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result is closely balanced with risks and burden of testing"; patient decisions vary by circumstances, clinicians note "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients" and counseling "should include a discussion of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to testing (as applicable), as well as the implications of the test result", and "The decision to perform the test should include consideration of the patients' values, preferences, feasibility, and the specific circumstances", while policymakers state "Policymaking decisions on the availability of the test will require discussion and stakeholder involvement". No recommendation applies when "Balance of knowledge of the diagnostic test result cannot be determined", and then "Decisions on the use of the test based on evidence from scientific studies cannot be made".

### Imaging and screening of thyroid cancer [^116wXYqC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the first-line diagnostic tool for diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The low aggressiveness of many thyroid cancers coupled with high sensitivity of sonography can lead to cancer diagnosis and treatment with no effect on outcomes. Ultrasound is recognized as the most important driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis. Ultrasound should not be used as a general screening tool and should be reserved for patients at high risk of thyroid cancer and in the diagnostic management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules. With prescreening risk stratification and application of consensus criteria for nodule biopsy, the value of the diagnostic ultrasound can be maximized.

Thyroid cancer epidemiology and survival — In the United States, an estimated 637 115 persons were living with thyroid cancer in 2013, and in 2017 there were an estimated 56 870 new cases (3.4% of all new cancer cases) with 2010 thyroid cancer–related deaths (0.3% of all cancer deaths), with the highest percentage of deaths among adults aged 75 to 84 years (27.5%). The incidence of thyroid cancer detection increased by 4.5% per year over the last 10 years, while the mortality rate remained at 0.5 deaths per 100 000 persons in 2013. Overall 5-year relative survival is 98%, ranging from 99% for localized disease (68% of cancer cases at diagnosis) to 55% for distant disease (4% of cancer cases at diagnosis).

### Global patterns and trends in incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents: a population-based study [^116KNgCz]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

There has been a considerable increase in thyroid cancer incidence among adults in several countries in the past three decades, attributed primarily to overdiagnosis. We aimed to assess global patterns and trends in incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents, in view of the increased incidence among adults.

Methods

We did a population-based study of the observed incidence (in 49 countries and territories) and mortality (in 27 countries) of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents aged 0–19 years using data from the International Incidence of Childhood Cancer Volume 3 study database, the WHO mortality database, and the cancer incidence in five continents database (CI5plus; for adult data [age 20–74 years]). We analysed temporal trends in incidence rates, including absolute changes in rates, and the strength of the correlation between incidence rates in children and adolescents and in adults. We calculated the average annual number of thyroid cancer deaths and the age-standardised mortality rates for children and adolescents.

Findings

Age-standardised incidence rates of thyroid cancer among children and adolescents aged 0–19 years ranged from 0·4 (in Uganda and Kenya) to 13·4 (in Belarus) cancers per 1 million person-years in 2008–12. The variability in the incidence rates was mostly accounted for by the papillary tumour subtype. Incidence rates were almost always higher in girls than in boys and increased with age in both sexes. Rapid increases in incidence between 1998–2002 and 2008–12 were observed in almost all countries. Country-specific incidence rates in children and adolescents were strongly correlated (r > 0·8) with rates in adults, as were the temporal changes in the respective incidence rates (r > 0·6). Thyroid cancer deaths in those aged younger than 20 years were less than 0·1 per 10 million person-years in each country.

Interpretation

The pattern of thyroid cancer incidence in children and adolescents mirrors the pattern seen in adults, suggesting a major role for overdiagnosis, which, in turn, can lead to overtreatment, lifelong medical care, and side effects that can negatively affect quality of life. We suggest that the existing recommendation against screening for thyroid cancer in the asymptomatic adult population who are free from specific risk factors should be extended to explicitly recommend against screening for thyroid cancer in similar populations of children and adolescents.

American Thyroid Association differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) guidelines — 2025 edition for adult patients outline background and methodology. DTC is described as the most prevalent cancer of thyroid and among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. The ATA adult DTC practice guidelines were published initially in 1996 with subsequent revisions, and the goal of this update is to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, and those involved in health policy with rigorous, comprehensive, contemporary guidelines to assist in management of adult patients with DTC. Methods state that questions were based in part on prior versions with input from a large, more diverse complement of stakeholders; the panel included members from multiple specialties involved in thyroid cancer care, including a patient advocate and an expert in systematic reviews/meta-analyses/guidelines. Evidence gathering involved systematic literature searches and two additional systematic reviews; published English-language articles were eligible, with a final search date of July 1, 2024. A modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used.

This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making, with a major goal to minimize potential harm from overtreatment in a majority of patients at low risk while appropriately treating and monitoring those at higher risk. The guidelines should not be interpreted as a replacement for clinical judgment and may not necessarily constitute a legal standard of care in all jurisdictions; interested physicians or groups may consider adapting the guidelines using established methods, and the authors decided a priori not to focus on economic resource implications.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### Association between screening and the thyroid cancer "epidemic" in south Korea: evidence from a nationwide study [^115gopLj]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate whether screening for thyroid cancer led to the current "epidemic" in South Korea.

Design Review of the medical records of nationally representative samples of patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in 1999, 2005, and 2008.

Setting Sample cases were randomly selected from South Korea's nationwide cancer registry, using a systematic sampling method after stratification by region.

Participants 5796 patients with thyroid cancer were included (891 in 1999, 2355 in 2005, and 2550 in 2008).

Main outcome measures The primary outcome was age standardised incidence of thyroid cancer and the changes in incidence between 1999 and 2008 according to the methods used to detect tumours (screen detection versus clinical detection versus unspecified).

Results Between 1999 and 2008, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased 6.4-fold (95% confidence interval 4.9-fold to 8.4-fold), from 6.4 (95% confidence interval 6.2 to 6.6) per 100 000 population to 40.7 (40.2 to 41.2) per 100 000 population. Of the increase, 94.4% (34.4 per 100 000 population) were for tumours less than 20 mm, which were detected mainly by screening. 97.1% of the total increase was localised and regional tumours according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage. Where cases were clinically detected, 99.9% of the increased incidences (6.4 per 100 000 population) over the same period were tumours less than 20 mm.

Conclusion The current "epidemic" of thyroid cancer in South Korea is due to an increase in the detection of small tumours, most likely as a result of overdetection. Concerted efforts are needed at a national level to reduce unnecessary thyroid ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic general population.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114yxYFR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is high — up to 60% as documented by high-resolution ultrasonography — but very few of these lesions ultimately prove to be malignant (about 5%). Although epidemiological studies suggest a small but real increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, likely stemming from exposure to environmental risk factors, the growing number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is largely attributable to the increasingly widespread use of diagnostic imaging technology and medical surveillance, together with improved access to health care in general, all of which favor the discovery of small, subclinical thyroid nodules and small papillary thyroid cancers. These considerations have raised concern over the costs and potential morbidity associated with the short- and long-term management of patients with thyroid nodules, which includes periodic outpatient visits and cervical ultrasound examinations, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), genomic testing, and, in some indeterminate cases, diagnostic thyroid lobectomy. On the whole, there is a clearly perceived need for a more refined, tailored, and careful approach to the management of these highly prevalent lesions. Similar considerations can be extended to that amount of nodules that are proven to be malignant, but have a low-risk phenotype, and can be safely managed through more conservative surgery or even active surveillance programs. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently recommended practices for the initial workup and subsequent management of patients with thyroid nodules.

### Time to de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices: a narrative review [^111Fw2Mw]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

The continued use of low-value cancer screening practices not only represents healthcare waste but also a potential cascade of invasive diagnostic procedures and patient anxiety and distress. While prior research has shown it takes an average of 15 years to implement evidence-based practices in cancer control, little is known about how long it takes to de-implement low-value cancer screening practices. We reviewed evidence on six United States Preventive Services Task Force 'Grade D' cancer screening practices: (1) cervical cancer screening in women < 21 years and > 65 years, (2) prostate cancer screening in men ≥ 70 years and (3) ovarian, (4) thyroid, (5) testicular and (6) pancreatic cancer screening in asymptomatic adults. We measured the time from a landmark publication supporting the guideline publication and subsequent de-implementation, defined as a 50% reduction in the use of the practice in routine care. The pace of de-implementation was assessed using nationally representative surveillance systems and peer-reviewed literature from the USA. We found the time to de-implementation of cervical cancer screening was 4 years for women < 21and 16 years for women > 65. Prostate screening in men ≥ 70 has not reached a 50% reduction in use since the 2012 guideline release. We did not identify sufficient evidence to measure the time to de-implementation for ovarian, thyroid, testicular and pancreatic cancer screening in asymptomatic adults. Surveillance of low-value cancer screening is sparse, posing a clear barrier to tracking the de-implementation of these screening practices. Improving the systematic measurement of low-value cancer control practices is imperative for assessing the impact of de-implementation on patient outcomes, healthcare delivery and healthcare costs.

Thyroid cancer screening test accuracy — In population-based ultrasound screening studies from South Korea, the prospective study (n = 2079 screened; 113 referred for biopsy with fine-needle aspiration) found that sensitivity and specificity for having 1 or more malignant features on screening ultrasound were 94.3% (95% CI, 84.3%-98.8%) and 55.0% (95% CI, 41.6%-67.9%), respectively. A retrospective analysis of 130 asymptomatic adults selected from 1009 patients reported sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 86.6%, but this study did not follow up patients with negative ultrasound findings and therefore may have overestimated the sensitivity of this screening method.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

### Quantifying and monitoring overdiagnosis in cancer screening: a systematic review of methods [^115WpywR]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Key questions

We have the following key questions:

1: What research methods have been used to measure overdiagnosis resulting from cancer screening tests?
2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method for: Providing a valid and reliable estimate of the frequency of overdiagnosis? Monitoring overdiagnosis over time?

Eligibility criteria

We included studies that have quantified the frequency of overdiagnosis resulting from cancer screening in an asymptomatic adult population. We limited the scope of the review to studies of overdiagnosis in the nine types of solid tumors with the highest incidence in the United States in 2012 — prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma, bladder, renal, thyroid, and uterine cancers. Studies in English from any setting and time frame were included. All study designs were included except non-systematic reviews, case reports, and case series. Systematic reviews were excluded if they simply summarized studies that had each quantified overdiagnosis (for example, by combining data from several estimates of overdiagnosis). We included systematic reviews that used data from identified studies to independently compute a new estimate of overdiagnosis.

We accepted any of three definitions of overdiagnosis, each with excess incidence attributable to screening in the numerator: (1) cancers diagnosed by screening; (2) all cancers diagnosed by any method during the screening period; and (3) all cancers diagnosed by any method over the patient's lifetime (or long term follow-up).

Study identification and selection

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Embase on 28 February 2014 with no limits placed on dates or study design (see appendices for search strategy). To further find relevant studies, we also hand searched reference lists of systematic and narrative reviews identified during the initial search. Abstracts and full texts were reviewed independently by two reviewers for inclusion. Any disagreements about inclusion or exclusion of these studies were resolved by consensus, and a third senior reviewer was consulted to resolve any remaining disagreements.

Data extraction

One reviewer extracted relevant data into a standardized form. These data were verified by a second reviewer, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

AUS/FLUS cytology — Recommendation 15 states that for nodules with atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) cytology, investigations such as repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or molecular testing may be used to supplement malignancy risk assessment in lieu of proceeding directly with surveillance or diagnostic surgery, and informed patient preference and feasibility should be considered in clinical decision-making (Weak recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If repeat FNA cytology, molecular testing, or both are not performed or inconclusive, either surveillance or diagnostic surgical excision may be performed for an AUS/FLUS thyroid nodule, depending on clinical risk factors, sonographic pattern, and patient preference (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Harms and treatment — The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to assess the harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons and found adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment as at least moderate, based on adequate evidence of serious harms of treatment of thyroid cancer and evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely consequences of screening. Surgery (ie, total or partial thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy) is the main treatment for thyroid cancer; additional treatment, including radioactive iodine therapy, may be indicated depending on postoperative disease status, tumor stage, and type of thyroid cancer, and external-beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not generally used to treat early-stage, differentiated thyroid cancer.

Nodules with low to intermediate suspicion US pattern: repeat US at 12–24 months; if growth is seen — defined as a 20% increase in at least two nodule dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm or more than a 50% change in volume — or if new suspicious features develop, FNA could be repeated or observation continued with repeat US, with repeat FNA if growth continues (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nodules with very low suspicion US pattern (including spongiform): surveillance utility is limited; if US is repeated, it should be done at ≥ 24 months (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^116Pj6C3]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) epidemiology — prevalence, ultrasound detection, cancer risk, and incidence trends — are described: the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is approximately 5% in women and 1% in men in iodine-sufficient regions, while high-resolution ultrasound (US) can detect thyroid nodules in 19%–68% of randomly selected individuals. Thyroid cancer occurs in 7%–15% of thyroid nodules, and DTC comprises the vast majority (> 90%) of all thyroid cancers. In the United States, approximately 63,000 new thyroid cancer cases were predicted for 2014 compared with 37,200 in 2009, and the incidence has nearly tripled from 4.9 per 100,000 in 1975 to 14.3 per 100,000 in 2009. Tumor size distribution shifted, with 25% of new thyroid cancers ≤ 1 cm in 1988–1989 compared with 39% in 2008–2009, and one study predicts papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) will become the third most common cancer in women by 2019 at a cost of $19–21 billion in the United States.

### Screening for thyroid cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112JNe4q]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults recommends against screening in asymptomatic adults (D recommendation) because the overall benefits of screening and treatment can be bounded as no greater than small while the harms can be bounded as at least moderate, with overdiagnosis and overtreatment likely to be substantial with population-based screening, leading to a determination that the net benefit of screening is negative. The evidence review addressed the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults, the diagnostic accuracy of screening (including neck palpation and ultrasound), and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected thyroid cancer. Contextually, the incidence of thyroid cancer detection has increased by 4.5% per year over the last 10 years, with a 2013 incidence rate of 15.3 cases per 100 000 persons, and most cases have a good prognosis with a 5-year survival rate for thyroid cancer overall of 98.1%.

### Temporal trends in thyroid nodule size on ultrasonography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rDNnA]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

In recent years, concern has grown around the overdetection of thyroid cancer. Changes to thyroid nodule risk stratification systems and guidelines were made to improve diagnostic yield. It is not known how these advancements have affected the size of thyroid nodules reported on ultrasonography over time.

Objective

To evaluate change in reported nodule size since 1990, particularly between studies of thyroid ultrasonography obtained for diagnostic vs screening purposes.

Study Selection

The systematic review included original research studies that reported thyroid nodule size in adults undergoing their first thyroid ultrasonography. Excluded studies were those that included patients with known thyroid disease, prior thyroid ultrasonography, nodules identified through other imaging modalities, and/or that had constraints on nodule size and/or characteristics.

Data Sources

PubMed, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, and CINAHL were reviewed from January 1990 to March 2021. Study characteristics, patient demographic characteristics, nodule size, and ultrasonography techniques were independently extracted by multiple observers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The size of thyroid nodules reported via ultrasonography over time. Mixed-effects meta-regression models were used to evaluate mean nodule size (1) overall, (2) in studies that used ultrasonography diagnostically, and (3) in studies that used ultrasonography for screening.

Results

A total of 11 963 patients were included; the mean (SD) age was 47.6 (5.2) years. A total of 1097 studies were identified; of these, 395 full-text articles were assessed, and 18 studies met inclusion criteria. All were done at academic institutions. Altogether, these studies had 11 963 patients who underwent a first thyroid ultrasonography. Reported mean nodule size increased 0.52 mm each year from 1990 to 2021 (95% CI, 0.2–0.81). Diagnostic subgroup mean nodule size increased 0.57 mm each year from 1990 to 2021 (95% CI, 0.21–0.93). Screening subgroup mean nodule size decreased by 0.23 mm each year up to 2012 (95% CI, -0.40 to -0.07).

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that thyroid nodule size reported on diagnostic ultrasonography has increased over time in conjunction with changes in risk stratification systems, nodule guidelines, and radiology practice patterns. Conversely, a decrease in size reported in asymptomatic, ultrasonography-screened populations was observed. Findings from screening studies show that subcentimeter nodules are prevalent and easily identified with ultrasonography, but clinical relevance is questionable. Altogether, these results may provide insight into how ultrasonography guidelines and practice patterns have changed thyroid nodule reporting over time and can inform future guidelines and policies associated with thyroid nodule management.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnostic evaluation based on thyroid cancer risk assessment [^114Fch8i]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common and can be detected by sensitive imaging in more than 60% of the general population. They are often identified in patients without symptoms who are undergoing evaluation for other medical complaints. Indiscriminate evaluation of thyroid nodules with thyroid biopsy could cause a harmful epidemic of diagnoses of thyroid cancer, but inadequate selection of thyroid nodules for biopsy can lead to missed diagnoses of clinically relevant thyroid cancer. Recent clinical guidelines advocate a more conservative approach in the evaluation of thyroid nodules based on risk assessment for thyroid cancer, as determined by clinical and ultrasound features to guide the need for biopsy. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that for patients with indeterminate thyroid biopsy results, a combined assessment including the initial ultrasound risk stratification or other ancillary testing (molecular markers, second opinion on thyroid cytology) can further clarify the risk of thyroid cancer and the management strategies. This review summarizes the clinical importance of adequate evaluation of thyroid nodules, focuses on the clinical evidence for diagnostic tests that can clarify the risk of thyroid cancer, and highlights the importance of considering the patient's values and preferences when deciding on management strategies in the setting of uncertainty about the risk of thyroid cancer.

### Screening for thyroid cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114hx93j]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — risk assessment and screening tests for thyroid cancer note that factors that substantially increase the risk for thyroid cancer include a history of radiation exposure to the head and neck as a child, exposure to radioactive fallout, family history of thyroid cancer in a first-degree relative, and certain genetic conditions, such as familial medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (type 2A or 2B). Evidence is inadequate to estimate the accuracy of neck palpation or ultrasound of the thyroid as screening tests for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons, and although screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation and ultrasound of the thyroid has been studied, the USPSTF recommends against screening in the general asymptomatic adult population.

### Evidence categories in systematic assessment of cancer overdiagnosis [^114bwBzW]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic utilisation studies

The surge in thyroid cancer incidence, often linked to opportunistic ultrasonography screening, exemplifies how diagnostic volume changes can lead to overdiagnosis, as seen in South Korea and globally. Years before overdiagnosis became a recognised issue, a French study emphasised the need to account for shifts in diagnostic, medical, surgical and pathological practices when assessing thyroid cancer incidence, validating earlier concerns. Indeed, the thyroid cancer 'diagnostic epidemic' had been anticipated, with the potential reservoir of tumours noted already in 1985. Despite this, many individuals and healthcare systems have faced unnecessary diagnoses.

Concerning diagnostic utilisation, some cancers have been included in or considered for population-based screening programmes, which are organised to detect cancer in asymptomatic populations. Examples of such cancers include breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Several countries were considering screening programmes for different cancer types, for example, thyroid cancer, melanoma and stomach cancer. Regardless of whether a country has an official national programme, the rapid advancement of technologies and lack of evidence-based decision-making have led to the widespread use of diagnostic tests that have never been tested in randomised trials as screening methods.

Cancer screening registries can provide individual-level data on diagnostic tests for cancers included in or considered for population-based screening programmes. Such data are, however, available in only a few regions, and these registers typically do not capture information on opportunistic testing. These registries are crucial for identifying the participation rates and evaluating test characteristics, such as positivity and positive predictive value. Even in countries with established screening programmes and similar disease incidence rates, these characteristics vary and, sometimes, point to potential overdiagnosis.

For opportunistic screening programmes and modalities such as ultrasound, MRI, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other tests, it is much more challenging to differentiate between screening and diagnostic use in symptomatic patients or follow-up contexts. Some studies report changes in biopsy utilisation that could be used as a proxy for primary diagnostic activities.

Unfortunately, individual-level studies that capture diagnostic procedures and outcomes (lesions detected) are rare outside screening trials and programmes. Studies based on individual data from multiple sources could bridge this gap, allowing large-scale characterisation that includes diagnostic tests, outcomes and reasons for referral.

The best ecological evidence on the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer comes from South Korea, which has had an organized cancer screening program since 1999, and although screening was not officially included, clinics frequently offered thyroid ultrasonography for a small additional cost while the thyroid cancer–specific mortality rate remained stable.

As our follow-up tests become more sensitive for detection of recurrent disease, we are finding many asymptomatic patients who have low-level persistent disease many years after initial therapy that may or may not benefit from additional testing and therapy. These difficult issues have been addressed by at least five different sets of guidelines published recently by various thyroid specialty organizations around the world. In this article, the authors compare and contrast the recommendations from the various guidelines in an attempt to define areas of consensus and explore possible reasons for differing recommendations.

Limitation of MCD screening benefit by overdiagnosis

Screening asymptomatic individuals may result in overdiagnosis — the detection of slow-growing cancers that would not lead to morbidity or death yet expose patients to ineffective or harmful treatments. Overdiagnosis can artificially lengthen population-level cancer survival statistics by inflating the length of time patients live with known disease, creating lead-time bias. The implementation of ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer in South Korea, for example, led to a 1500% increase in incidence, driven by the slower growing subtype — papillary thyroid cancer — without a corresponding drop in mortality from thyroid cancer, yet many were exposed to harms from invasive surgery.

Assay developers have suggested that the detection of ctDNA identifies more aggressive tumors that may benefit from treatment, whereas undetected tumors are more indolent. Alternatively, those may be the aggressive tumors destined to be lethal regardless of stage at diagnosis and receipt of treatment. Prospective outcome data on mortality are required to draw firm conclusions about the curability of cancers detected through MCD tests.

MCD screening and health care disparities

If shown to be effective in clinical trials, MCD assays for cancer screening have the potential to reduce health care disparities because standard-of-care cancer screening tests have disproportionately lower uptake among medically underserved populations. However, although blood tests are easy to implement, lack of access to diagnostic testing after a positive screening test has the potential to worsen cancer disparities. For example, women with lower socioeconomic status have a lower rate of completing the recommended workup when breast abnormalities are seen on mammograms.

To improve population health, an MCD screening program will need to be administered in a way that all population groups — including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations — have equal access to both MCD testing and to appropriate diagnostic evaluation and treatment of detected cancers. Achieving health equity is a major challenge for even well established medical interventions and requires overcoming cultural, social, economic, and structural barriers to health care delivery. Within the US health care system, lower cancer screening rates are associated with factors such as lack of health insurance, lower income, greater travel distance to sites of cancer screening, and lower educational attainment. If MCD tests are made widely available without addressing these barriers, MCD testing may worsen — rather than improve — existing health disparities.

### Management of childhood cancer survivors at risk for thyroid function abnormalities: a Delphi study [^116Brzxm]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid function abnormalities can occur after treatment for childhood cancer. Evidence for the management of thyroid dysfunction among asymptomatic childhood cancer survivors (CCS) is lacking. We used a Delphi consensus methodology to expand guidelines for screening asymptomatic CCS at risk for thyroid dysfunction and explore recommendations for the clinical management of abnormal results.

Procedure

A Delphi panel of 40 expert physicians representing oncology, endocrinology, and primary care participated in three rounds of anonymous, iterative questionnaires formatted as clinical scenarios. Consensus is defined as ≥ 90% of panelists agree with recommendation and disagreement as < 70% agree.

Results

Panelists reached consensus that CCS treated with radiation including neck, total body, whole brain, brain including the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), and therapeutic meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) should have annual, lifelong screening using serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 starting within one year off-treatment (98%). Panelists disagreed on continuing to screen CCS for thyroid dysfunction after immunotherapy associated with acute thyroid injury (31%-50%). There was also disagreement on indications for brain (17%-43%) or thyroid (50%-65%) imaging, laboratory tests to assess the HPA (29%-75%), and TSH threshold to initiate treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism. Lack of evidence was the most frequent rationale panelists offered for not recommending additional testing or medications. Panelists' recommendations did not vary by geography, specialty, or survivorship clinical experience.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on most recommendations for screening and management of cancer treatment-related thyroid dysfunction. Screening after completion of thyroid-toxic immunotherapy, indications for imaging, and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are areas of disagreement for further investigation.

### Diagnosis of thyroid nodules [^114VyUze]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, usually asymptomatic, and often pose minimal risk to the affected patient. However, 10–15% prove malignant and serve as the rationale for diagnostic assessment. Safely identifying and treating a relevant thyroid cancer through a cost-effective process is the primary goal of the treating practitioner. Ultrasound is the principal means of initial nodule assessment and should be performed when any thyroid nodule is suspected. Fine-needle aspiration provides further cytological determination of benign or malignant disease and is generally applied to nodules larger than 1–2 cm in diameter, on the basis of holistic risk assessment. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides standardised terminology, which enhances communication among health-care providers and patients. Benign cytology is highly accurate, whereas indeterminate cytology could benefit from further application of molecular testing. The ultimate goal of diagnostic assessment of thyroid nodules is to accurately identify malignancy while avoiding overtreatment. Low-risk thyroid nodules can be safely monitored in many patients with minimal diagnostic intervention.

### Incidence of microcarcinoma and non-microcarcinoma in ultrasound-found thyroid nodules [^114i2m8p]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence rate of thyroid nodules has an annual increasing trend worldwide. The overall prevalence rate was 49%-68% in general population of China, Europe and America by using ultrasound. As thyroid nodules are usually the first sign of cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to distinguish between malignant and benign lesions.

In practice, more and more physicians took thyroid ultrasound as the preferred examination because of its noninvasive and inexpensive. However, recent researches reported that screening for thyroid cancer has led to a significant increase in the global diagnosis rate of the disease, but no change in mortality. Therefore, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) does not recommend ultrasound as a screening test for the general population or patients with a normal thyroid on palpation and a low clinical risk of thyroid disease. Similarly, The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults. Nevertheless, the AACE prescription standard for ultrasound screening is only at a level 4 evidence and GRADE C recommendation, which means it is based on expert experience with no conclusive risks or benefits. We believe that it is necessary to evaluate the nodules that can only be detected by ultrasound. Therefore we can decide whether it is appropriate to carry out ultrasound examination for patients who do not have nodules detected by palpation.

Up to now, no studies have directly compared the risk of ultrasound-found and palpation-found nodules. More researches evidence is needed to carry out for accumulating evidence to help us balance the over diagnosis and missed diagnosis of malignant lesions.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of malignant lesions in ultrasound-found nodules.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^115eugpj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Differentiated thyroid carcinoma — clinical presentation and diagnosis: Differentiated (ie, papillary, follicular, oncocytic) thyroid carcinoma is usually asymptomatic for long periods and commonly presents as a solitary thyroid nodule; both benign and malignant thyroid nodules are usually asymptomatic, with About 50% of the malignant nodules discovered during routine examination, incidentally on imaging, or during surgery for benign disease, and The other 50% often first noticed by the patient as an asymptomatic nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guidance is the procedure of choice for evaluating suspicious thyroid nodules. Data show that higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with an increased risk for differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients with thyroid nodules, although TSH and thyroglobulin (Tg) do not appear to be useful for screening for thyroid cancer. Although > 50% of all malignant nodules are asymptomatic, the pretest probability of malignancy increases considerably when signs or symptoms are present; the likelihood that a nodule is malignant increases about 7-fold with features such as very firm consistency, fixation to adjacent structures, rapid growth, enlarged regional lymph nodes, vocal cord paralysis, or symptoms of invasion into neck structures. Family history of thyroid cancer is also indicative of malignancy, and If two or more of these features are present, the likelihood of thyroid cancer is virtually assured; however, this is a rare situation; a patient's age and gender also affect the probability of malignancy.

Importance

The incidence of thyroid cancer detection has increased by 4.5% per year over the last 10 years, faster than for any other cancer, but without a corresponding change in the mortality rate. In 2013, the incidence rate of thyroid cancer in the United States was 15.3 cases per 100 000 persons. Most cases of thyroid cancer have a good prognosis; the 5-year survival rate for thyroid cancer overall is 98.1%.

Objective

To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for thyroid cancer.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults, the diagnostic accuracy of screening (including neck palpation and ultrasound), and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected thyroid cancer.

Findings

The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits of screening but determined that the magnitude of the overall benefits of screening and treatment can be bounded as no greater than small, given the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between patients who are treated vs monitored (for the most common tumor types), and observational evidence showing no change in mortality over time after introduction of a mass screening program. The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening but determined that the overall magnitude of the harms of screening and treatment can be bounded as at least moderate, given adequate evidence of harms of treatment and indirect evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely to be substantial with population-based screening. The USPSTF therefore determined that the net benefit of screening for thyroid cancer is negative.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults. (D recommendation).

### Time to de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices: a narrative review [^115LZ6Gy]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Methods

We reviewed the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) clinical practice guidelines to identify clinic-based low-value cancer screening practices. The USPSTF assigns each guideline a grade on an 'A' to 'D' scale, with practices with insufficient evidence to assess being graded as an 'I'. A Grade D guideline indicates a recommendation against delivering a practice based on moderate or high certainty the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. The guidelines are accompanied by published systematic evidence reviews that present the evidence base and rationale for each recommendation. As of 2023, the USPSTF Grade D services included six clinic-based cancer screening practices: (1) cervical cancer screening in women < 21 years and > 65 years, (2) prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening in men ≥ 70 years and screening of asymptomatic adults for (3) ovarian, (4) thyroid, (5) testicular and (6) pancreatic cancer. Table 1 presents the history of the current USPSTF Grade D practices and their associated screening tests and procedures as described in USPSTF guidelines.

Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) screening — Recommendation 4: Individuals with a family history of FNMTC should have a relevant history and directed neck examination as part of regular health maintenance, and ultrasound screening may be considered in first-degree family members when there are three or more (first or second degree) related individuals with a diagnosis of non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC); ultrasound screening may also be considered in families with only two affected members if one pair comprises first-degree relatives (especially in relatively young ages of diagnosis) or with limited family size. The age for initiation of such screening requires further study and should be carefully weighed against the risk of overdiagnosis, with a Conditional recommendation, Very low certainty evidence; additionally, the USPSTF discourages screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults, and screening programs in FNMTC should be initiated with caution given the lack of data on outcome impact and inconsistent ultrasound frequency.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit — high certainty is described as, "The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations… This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is defined as, "The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; lack of coherence in the chain of evidence", and, "As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty is defined as, "The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes", due to reasons such as "the limited number or size of studies", "important flaws in study design or methods", "gaps in the chain of evidence", and "findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice".

### Association between screening and the thyroid cancer "epidemic" in south Korea: evidence from a nationwide study [^112mLfGx]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion and policy implications

Our study shows that the increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in South Korea mainly resulted from overdetection, most likely as a result of widespread use of sensitive imaging tools (eg, ultrasound examination). Considering the increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the financial burden of using ultrasound to detect small tumours (and the often unnecessary subsequent surgery) is expected to rise rapidly. Concerted efforts are needed at national level to reduce unnecessary ultrasound examination of the thyroid in the asymptomatic general population, unless clinically indicated.

Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer screening — epidemiology and prospective screening data: Family members may be at risk based on evidence showing that 5–10% of NMTC have a familial occurrence, and when only two first-degree family members are affected the probability that the disease is sporadic is 62%, decreasing to 56% when the number of affected family members is three or more. In a prospective interventional screening study of yearly screening in 109 individuals from 25 kindreds (12 with two members affected and 13 with ≥ 3 members affected), screening started as early as 7 years and included neck ultrasound and FNA of thyroid nodule(s) > 0.5 cm; thyroid cancer was detected in 4.6% (2/43) of at-risk individuals from families with two members affected and in 22.7% (15/66) from families with ≥ 3 patients affected (p = 0.01), with the youngest age of thyroid nodule detection 7 years and of thyroid cancer diagnosis 18 years; based on these data, consideration was suggested for yearly ultrasound in kindreds with ≥ 3 affected family members starting from age 20 years, or 10 years before the earliest diagnosis in the family.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^114AFhSV]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid cancer epidemiology — incidence trends and risk factors include the following: After rising for three decades, thyroid cancer incidence peaked in 2015 at 14.9 per 100,000, and between 2015 and 2017 a decline was observed for the first time in 30 years. Overdiagnosis is defined as the diagnosis of cancers that would not, if left in place, result in symptoms or death. Notably, the increase in thyroid cancer incidence observed from 1974 to 2013 occurred for all stages of disease, and the mortality rate from the same time period increased annually by 1.1% in advanced disease. Accepted risk factors include a history of childhood head and neck radiation, total body radiation for bone marrow transplantation, and exposure to ionizing radiation from fallout in childhood or adolescence, whereas adult occupational radiation exposure in the low-to-moderate dose range (< 0.5 Gy) has not been associated with a significantly increased risk of thyroid cancer. In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults.

Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic women

The 1996 ovarian cancer screening Grade D guideline cited studies published in 1990, 1991 and 1993 showing no benefit of pelvic screening, serum tumour testing and transvaginal ultrasound screening methods. Subsequent USPSTF guidelines cited two large RCTs published in 2011 and 2016 to support the continuation of the Grade D rating. Two national surveys measured physician-reported ovarian cancer screening practices after the guideline publication. A 2012 survey of women's primary care physicians (n = 1088, response rate 61.7%) found that 28% of respondents reported performing inappropriate screening. Similarly, a 2016 survey of gynaecologists (n = 401, response rate 67.1%) found that 58% of respondents reported regularly recommending inappropriate screening. Given the lack of evidence on pre-guideline practice trends, our characterisation of the time to de-implementation is limited to the 3 years between the publication of evidence demonstrating the lack of benefit of screening (1993) and the release of the USPSTF guidelines (1996).

Thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults

The Grade D recommendation for thyroid cancer screening was issued in 1996 and cited studies published as late as 1992. The recommendation statement described a lack of evidence for screening benefits and poor accuracy of available screening methods. The 2017 guideline evidence review also found insufficient evidence to support screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults or children. A meta-analysis of seven single-centre observational studies published between 1998 and 2019 found the pooled frequency of inappropriate thyroid ultrasound screening was 46% (95% CI 15% to 82%). Because the measurement of real-world practice is limited to single-centre studies, we can only identify the 3-year gap between the most recent publication cited in the original guidelines (1993) and the corresponding guideline release (1996).

Testicular cancer screening in asymptomatic adolescent and adult men

The USPSTF issued a 2004 Grade D recommendation for testicular cancer screening in 2004 due to the low incidence and high cure rate of testicular cancer, potential for false positives leading to invasive diagnostic procedures and a lack of evidence on the accuracy of screening tests and screening outcomes. The recommendation was updated from the 1996 Grade C rating due to changes in the USPSTF methodology and rating system rather than new evidence. The 1996 USTPF statement cited evidence published up to 1995. To our knowledge, no studies have produced representative estimates of testicular cancer screening practices over time. Therefore, we are only able to measure the 9-year span between the publication of evidence (1995) and Grade D recommendation (2004).

### Association of screening by thyroid ultrasonography with mortality in thyroid cancer: a case-control study using data from two national surveys [^115md7Yq]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide due to an increased detection of small well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinomas. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of screening with ultrasonography on deaths from thyroid cancer. Materials and Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study using data from two sources representative of the adult Korean population. Cases were selected from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Thyroid Cancer database, and controls were selected from the Korean National Cancer Screening Survey database. Controls were individually matched to case patients with respect to age, sex, and area with a ratio of 10:1. The primary outcome was death from thyroid cancer. Controls were required to have been alive on the date of thyroid cancer diagnosis in the corresponding case. Results: The analysis included 120 patients who died from thyroid cancer and 1184 controls. Compared with those who had never been screened, the odds ratios for death from thyroid cancer among those who had been screened were 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–3.05) if cases with missing information on screening were excluded and 1.13 [CI 0.49–2.63] if all cases were included, and missing information was imputed. Stratification by sex, year of diagnosis, and histological type did not show any statistically significant relationships between screening with ultrasonography and death from thyroid cancer, regardless of the statistical model used. Conclusions: Screening for thyroid cancer with ultrasonography does not prevent death from thyroid cancer; therefore, screening asymptomatic adults for thyroid cancer is unwarranted.

### Screening for differentiated thyroid cancer in selected populations [^114AKJtA]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

The main purpose of cancer screening programmes should not be to detect all cancers, but to discover potentially fatal or clinically relevant cancers. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in the general, asymptomatic adult population, as such screening would result in harms that outweigh any potential benefits. This recommendation does not apply to patients with symptoms or to individuals at increased risk of thyroid cancer because of a history of exposure to ionising radiation (in childhood, as radioactive fallout, or in medical treatment as low-dose radiotherapy for benign conditions or high-dose radiation for malignancy), inherited genetic syndromes associated with thyroid cancer (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis), or one or more first-degree relatives with a history of thyroid cancer. We discuss the evidence for and against screening individuals who are at high risk, and consider the different screening tools available.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111NADq6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for thyroid disease.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for subclinical and "overt" thyroid dysfunction without clinically obvious symptoms, as well as the effects of treatment on intermediate and final health outcomes.

Population

This recommendation applies to nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults. (I statement).
