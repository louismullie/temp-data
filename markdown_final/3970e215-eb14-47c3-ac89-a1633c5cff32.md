## Question

How should moderate urinary calcium oxalate be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat moderate urinary calcium oxalate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical context and distinguishing primary from secondary or enteric hyperoxaluria. Then, I should confirm the recommended baseline evaluation, especially 24-hour urine testing and stone analysis. Next, I will outline universal dietary measures, followed by oxalate-specific interventions and management of concurrent metabolic abnormalities. After that, I need to consider special handling for enteric hyperoxaluria, and finally set up monitoring and follow-up with practical adherence strategies, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and trial data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't misclassify the problem: primary hyperoxaluria is a rare genetic disorder with severe oxalate overproduction and requires specialized therapies such as pyridoxine responsiveness testing and disease-modifying agents, whereas secondary or idiopathic hyperoxaluria is more common and often diet or gut driven, and enteric hyperoxaluria is linked to fat malabsorption states that enhance colonic oxalate absorption, which is highly relevant to calcium oxalate stone risk [^117C3ee1] [^notfound] [^112J77fm].

> Wait, let me verify the recommended baseline evaluation before prescribing anything: metabolic testing with one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet is standard for recurrent stone formers or selected high-risk first-time patients, and analytes should at minimum include volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, and creatinine; because within-patient variability is substantial, at least two collections increase confidence, and confirmation of hyperoxaluria should ideally be based on repeat abnormal measurements using age-appropriate reference ranges or oxalate-to-creatinine ratios when spot testing is necessary [^notfound] [^1135BXvG] [^113qXcmn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on therapy before fluids are addressed: high fluid intake to achieve a urine volume above approximately 2.5 liters per day is a cornerstone, with guideline support and randomized evidence showing that increased water reduces stone recurrence risk by about half, so I should prescribe a concrete urine output goal and confirm it on repeat 24-hour collection rather than offering vague advice [^116pVWdB] [^1114fG34].

> I need to check sodium next because it strongly modulates urinary calcium excretion: sodium restriction to a practical target around 1.5 g/day and not exceeding 2.3 g/day lowers urinary calcium and can modestly reduce oxalate, with randomized trial data showing a substantial reduction in urinary sodium and a corresponding decrease in urinary calcium in hypercalciuric calcium stone formers, thereby reducing calcium oxalate supersaturation [^116HQpkH] [^111itbWT].

> Hmm, wait a minute — should I lower dietary calcium to reduce substrate for stones? No, I should correct myself here: restricting dietary calcium paradoxically increases intestinal oxalate absorption and urinary oxalate; normal dietary calcium intake of about 1,000–1,200 mg/day with meals binds oxalate in the gut and should be maintained in calcium oxalate stone formers, particularly when hyperoxaluria is present [^117FyUZE] [^112syMyV].

> Next, I should review dietary acid load and animal protein because they affect urinary calcium, citrate, and uric acid: moderating animal protein and purine-rich foods can reduce acid load and uric acid excretion, while a diet higher in fruits and vegetables supports urinary citrate and a more favorable pH profile, contributing a small protective effect against recurrence and complementing sodium control and normal calcium intake [^111UPTGq] [^112uJXzK] [^115xSRiq].

> Let me think about oxalate-specific strategies now that universal measures are in place: for confirmed moderate hyperoxaluria, targeted reduction of high-oxalate foods is advised, with guideline support for oxalate restriction and randomized data suggesting that a structured low-oxalate diet can lower urinary oxalate more than supplementation alone; I should tailor food lists to the patient's culture and reinforce that this augments, not replaces, normal dietary calcium with meals [^112J77fm] [^111bh6VX] [^112GrWBf].

> I should confirm when to add calcium with meals as a binder: in patients who cannot meet dietary calcium targets or who have enteric hyperoxaluria, elemental calcium or calcium citrate taken with meals binds gut oxalate and reduces absorption, but I need to be cautious in patients with hypercalciuria and consider pairing with a thiazide if necessary; additionally, labeling reminds me to use calcium carbonate prudently in stone formers and to individualize dosing with periodic urine monitoring [^113Z3YzH] [^1175R6tU] [^116LCLjk].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of pyridoxine outside primary hyperoxaluria: pyridoxine is guideline-endorsed for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, and although off-label use in idiopathic hyperoxaluria shows signal in a randomized study with modest oxalate reductions at low doses, I should frame it as an adjunct for selected patients after diet optimization and monitor for neuropathy at higher cumulative doses [^117C3ee1] [^112GrWBf].

> I will now examine concurrent metabolic abnormalities because hyperoxaluria seldom exists in isolation: if hypercalciuria is present, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and recurrence, if hypocitraturia is detected, potassium citrate is recommended to raise urine citrate and optimize pH, and in hyperuricosuria with normal urine calcium, allopurinol lowers recurrence risk; these are supported by AUA guidance and systematic reviews showing benefit on top of high fluid intake, so I should match the drug to the abnormality and reassess with follow-up 24-hour urine testing [^114hUDwr] [^114bcW1T] [^112toZph] [^115x1LvW].

> But wait, what if the patient has enteric hyperoxaluria with fat malabsorption? In that case, I need to emphasize a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, ensure calcium citrate with meals for binding, and add alkali citrate to correct metabolic acidosis and raise urinary citrate, as these combined strategies directly target the malabsorption-driven oxalate load and its urinary consequences in line with guideline recommendations [^1175R6tU] [^112J77fm] [^113Z3YzH].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up to ensure the plan is working: I will repeat a 24-hour urine about three months after interventions to verify improvements in urine volume, oxalate, calcium, citrate, sodium, and pH, and then continue periodic reassessment to adapt therapy as the metabolic profile evolves; integrating behavioral tools such as smart water bottles and app-based prompts can help sustain urine volume targets beyond the initial counseling period [^notfound] [^111bF2gs] [^113JYmxR].

> I need to ensure patient education and adherence are embedded in the plan: referral to a dietitian for practical oxalate, sodium, and calcium counseling, reinforcement of a produce-forward diet, and clear targets for urine output are crucial, and building a shared, guideline-concordant prevention strategy tends to outperform generic advice in maintaining long-term engagement and reducing recurrence risk [^112uJXzK] [^116pVWdB] [^112UBVsk].

> Let me summarize and double-check the algorithm for moderate hyperoxaluria in calcium oxalate stone formers: start with guideline-based metabolic evaluation and confirm hyperoxaluria on repeat testing, implement universal measures with high urine volume, sodium restriction, normal dietary calcium, moderated animal protein, and higher fruit and vegetable intake, add oxalate restriction and consider calcium with meals as a binder when needed, treat coexisting hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, or hyperuricosuria with thiazide, potassium citrate, or allopurinol respectively, use enteric-specific strategies when malabsorption is present, and monitor with repeat 24-hour urines to titrate therapy and reinforce adherence over time [^116ezhUo] [^117C3ee1] [^116HQpkH] [^117FyUZE] [^112J77fm] [^114hUDwr] [^114bcW1T] [^112toZph].

In moderate calcium oxalate crystalluria, the primary goals are to reduce urinary supersaturation [^112UBVsk] and prevent stone recurrence [^115x1LvW] using individualized, evidence-based measures [^117FyUZE] [^114RUawA].

- **Hydration**: Achieve ≥ 2.5 L/day urine output [^116pVWdB] with generous fluid intake, preferably water [^114RUawA] [^1114fG34].

- **Diet**: Maintain normal calcium intake (1–1.2 g/day) with meals [^117FyUZE], limit sodium to 1.5–2.3 g/day [^116HQpkH] [^111itbWT], moderate animal protein [^111UPTGq] [^115xSRiq], and avoid high-oxalate foods [^111bh6VX] [^112syMyV].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Use thiazide diuretics for hypercalciuria [^114hUDwr] [^117C3ee1], potassium citrate for hypocitraturia [^114bcW1T] [^115x1LvW], and allopurinol for hyperuricosuria [^115sC7sz] [^112toZph].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess with 24-hour urine [^116ezhUo] and adjust therapy to maintain urine calcium < 200 mg/day, oxalate < 40 mg/day, citrate > 320 mg/day, and pH 6.0–6.5.

These measures align with current guidelines and should be **tailored to the patient's metabolic profile and risk factors** [^116pVWdB] [^112UBVsk].

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^111WNLks]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is the most common form of nephrolithiasis and may affect two to 15 percent of the general population, with an incidence rate ranging from 114 to 720 new cases reported every year per 100,000 individuals. Without specific pharmacological therapy, 27 to 50 percent of patients may experience stone recurrence over five years. Of note, in 15 percent of cases, recurrence of stones is associated with clinical symptoms, and many symptomatic patients require surgical intervention annually.

Kidney stone formation requires crystals to form, grow, aggregate, and interact with a non-crystalline organic matrix. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes increased excretion of urinary lithogenic solutes, including calcium, oxalate, phosphate, uric acid, and sodium, along with reduced urinary excretion of inhibitors of crystallization such as citrate and magnesium. Moreover, a reduction or an increase in urinary pH may favor the precipitation of uric acid or calcium phosphate salts, respectively.

In addition to genetic and metabolic factors, environmental factors, including diet, play an important role in the development of nephrolithiasis. A diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake, may reduce the risk of stone formation. However, the efficacy in preventing stone recurrences is limited, particularly in chronic stone formers. Potassium citrate is effective in preventing stone recurrence in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, but approximately one third of treated patients.

### Effects of a low-salt diet on idiopathic hypercalciuria in calcium-oxalate stone formers: a 3-mo randomized controlled trial [^111itbWT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). High credibility.

A direct relation exists between sodium and calcium excretion, but randomized studies evaluating the sustained effect of a low-salt diet on idiopathic hypercalciuria, one of the main risk factors for calcium-oxalate stone formation, are still lacking.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to evaluate the effect of a low-salt diet on urinary calcium excretion in patients affected by idiopathic calcium nephrolithiasis.

- **Design**: Patients affected by idiopathic calcium stone disease and hypercalciuria (> 300 mg Ca/d in men and > 250 mg Ca/d in women) were randomly assigned to receive either water therapy alone (control diet) or water therapy and a low-salt diet (low-sodium diet) for 3 months. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were obtained twice from all patients: one sample at baseline on a free diet and one sample after 3 months of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 210 patients were randomly assigned to receive a control diet (n = 102) or a low-sodium diet (n = 108); 13 patients (2 on the control diet, 11 on the low-sodium diet) withdrew from the trial. At the follow-up visit, patients on the low-sodium diet had lower urinary sodium (mean ± SD: 68 ± 43 mmol/d at 3 months compared with 228 ± 57 mmol/d at baseline; P < 0.001). Concomitant with this change, they showed lower urinary calcium (271 ± 86 mg/d at 3 months compared with 361 ± 129 mg/d on the control diet, P < 0.001) and lower oxalate excretion (28 ± 8 mg/d at 3 months compared with 32 ± 10 mg/d on the control diet, P = 0.001). Urinary calcium was within the normal range in 61.9% of the patients on the low-salt diet and in 34.0% of the patients on the control diet.

### Diet to reduce mild hyperoxaluria in patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formation: a pilot study [^112zxw6a]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet is effective in reducing hyperoxaluria in idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis compared with a traditional low-oxalate diet, routinely recommended by clinicians.

- **Methods**: We treated 56 patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formation who presented with mild hyperoxaluria (> 40 mg/d) while consuming a free diet with a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet for a 3-month period. We compared the results obtained with this diet with those of a historical control group of 20 hyperoxaluric patients treated in the traditional way with a low-oxalate diet.

- **Results**: After 3 months of therapy, the mean oxaluria level had decreased from 50.2 to 35.5 mg/d with the normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet and from 45.9 to 40.2 mg/d with the traditional diet (adjusted difference between post-treatment mean value -7.3 mg/d, 95% confidence interval -12.3 to -2.2, P = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that a normal-calcium, low-animal protein, low-salt diet can reduce oxalate excretion in hyperoxaluric patients. This should encourage the undertaking of a randomized-control study to confer more solid evidence in support of our findings.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^114cFcmA]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion tended to decrease in treated patients and increase in controls. These trends significantly differed between treatment groups six months after randomisation. However, as for the primary outcome, the between-group difference was lost on longer follow-up, in parallel with decreasing patient adherence to lemon juice supplementation. The finding that between-group differences in sodium excretion were consistent with differences in event rates aligns with evidence suggesting that changes in urinary sodium excretion may play a role in the risk of stone recurrence in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. These data could suggest that the protective effect (if any) of lemon juice supplementation against stone recurrence could be explained by a citrate-induced reduction in urinary sodium excretion.

Consistently with previous reports, lemon juice supplementation did not translate into increased 24-hour urinary citrate excretion. This finding could be explained by evidence that up to 90 percent of citrate filtered by the renal glomeruli is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Citrate is mainly reabsorbed as the divalent anion in the proximal tubule by a sodium-coupled mechanism. However, as the luminal pH increases, citrate can be predominantly reabsorbed as a trivalent anion. Thus, enhanced delivery of citrate to renal tubules could translate into enhanced tubular reabsorption of citrate-coupled sodium.

We speculate that this could explain why in our study, lemon juice supplementation was not associated with enhanced citrate excretion, but rather…

### Impact of urine sodium on urine risk factors for calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis [^111eiYd9]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Increased sodium intake is thought to promote nephrolithiasis through dietary sodium's hypercalciuric effects. However, equivocal data exist on whether increased urine sodium actually increases the nephrolithiasis risk. We examined the relationship between urine sodium and urine risk factors for nephrolithiasis.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 880 patients evaluated at a metabolic stone clinic to determine the relationship between urine sodium and urine calcium, volume, and calcium oxalate supersaturation. Patients were separated into sodium excretion quintiles. Tests of linear trend were performed by examining the linear contrast in coefficients and using Cuzick's nonparametric linear trend test. Multivariate linear regression with urine sodium as a continuous variable was done to assess the relationship between urine sodium and other urine variables.

Tests of linear trend showed that urine calcium and volume increased with increasing urine sodium (each p < 0.01), but urine calcium oxalate supersaturation decreased with increasing urine sodium (p < 0.01). Multivariate linear regression was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and urine constituents. Urine sodium was positively associated with urine calcium (beta = 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41, p < 0.001) but negatively associated with urine calcium oxalate supersaturation (beta = -0.013, 95% CI -0.016 to -0.011, p < 0.001). There was a trend toward a positive association of urine sodium and volume (beta = 0.001, 95% CI -0.00019 to 0.002, p = 0.10).

### Prospective randomized evaluation of idiopathic hyperoxaluria treatments [^112GrWBf]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to analyze how dietary interventions or supplementation can modulate urinary oxalate excretion, which impacts calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formation. Individuals with elevated urinary oxalate frequently receive recommendations for a low-oxalate diet or oral supplements, such as vitamin B6 and magnesium, to mitigate urinary oxalate excretion.

- **Materials and methods**: We enrolled patients with a documented history of CaOx stones and newly diagnosed idiopathic hyperoxaluria. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups:
	- Low oxalate diet (D)
	- Supplementation with 25 mg vitamin B6 and 400 mg magnesium oxide (S)
	- Both low oxalate diet and B6/magnesium supplementation (DS)

	- Baseline and 3-month post-intervention 24-hour urine tests were conducted. The primary endpoint was the change in 24-hour urinary oxalate (Ox24) after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in other 24-hour urine parameters, compliance rates, and adverse effect rates.

- **Results**: A total of 164 patients were recruited; 62, 47, and 55 were assigned to the D, S, and DS groups, respectively. Of these, 99 patients completed the study (56.5% of the D, 72.3% of the S, and 54.6% of the DS groups, respectively). Significant differences were observed in the median percent reduction of Ox24 values: -31.1% (D group) vs -16.0% (S group) vs -23.9% (DS group), with a p-value of 0.007. Additionally, the percentage of patients showing a decrease in Ox24 was significantly different across groups: D = 91.4% vs S = 67.6% vs DS = 86.7%, with a p-value of 0.027.

### Alkaline water: Help or hype for uric acid and cystine urolithiasis [^114QzeCm]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The consumption of alkaline water, with an average pH of 8 to 10, has been steadily increasing globally, as proponents claim it to be a healthier alternative to regular water. Urinary alkalinization therapy is frequently prescribed in patients with uric acid and cystine urolithiasis. As such, we analyzed commercially available alkaline waters to assess their potential to increase urinary pH.

Five commercially available alkaline water brands (Essentia, Smart Water Alkaline, Great Value Hydrate Alkaline Water, Body Armor SportWater, and Perfect Hydration) underwent anion chromatography and direct chemical measurements to determine the mineral contents of each product. The alkaline content of each bottle of water was then compared to that of potassium citrate (the gold standard for urinary alkalinization) as well as to other beverages and supplements used to augment urinary citrate and/or the urine pH.

The pH levels of the bottled alkaline water ranged from 9.69 to 10.15. Electrolyte content was minimal, and the physiologic alkali content was below 1 mEq/L for all brands of alkaline water. The alkali content of alkaline water is minimal when compared to common stone treatment alternatives such as potassium citrate. In addition, several organic beverages, synthetic beverages, and other supplements contain more alkali content than alkaline water and can achieve the AUA and European Association of Urology alkali recommendation of 30 to 60 mEq per day with ≤ 3 servings/d.

Commercially available alkaline water has negligible potential to increase urinary pH and alkali content, making it a less effective alternative to other forms of urinary alkalinization.

### Purslane-induced oxalate nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^116VkLYs]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Regarding treatment interventions, withdrawal of oxalate-rich foods or precursors after the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), along with adequate fluid intake and calcium supplementation, are necessary. When calcium intake is low, urinary oxalate excretion increases. It is recommended to maintain a low dietary oxalate intake of less than 100 mg per day and an adequate dietary calcium intake of 1000–1200 mg per day. Additionally, renal replacement therapy can be administered based on the patient's actual condition. However, some cases require only conservative treatment. We also prescribed steroids for the patient in Case 1 to suppress tubular inflammation. However, steroids appear redundant, and to our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature indicating their necessity. Furthermore, the prognosis of oxalate nephropathy is variable and may be favorable in cases of acute intake of excessive dietary oxalate. Our patients required temporary hemodialysis and had almost complete renal recovery.

The possibility of oxalate nephropathy should be considered in the presence of calcium oxalate stones, calcium oxalate crystals in urine sediment, unexplained renal damage associated with multicentric systemic oxalosis, and calcium oxalate crystallization by renal biopsy. The physician should correlate these features with the patient's clinical details, including history of gastrointestinal surgery, dietary status, medication history, and genetic history. A renal biopsy should also be actively performed if there are no contraindications, even when genetic testing is performed to exclude primary hyperoxaluria, particularly in children.

Renal stones have afflicted humans for millennia, yet there is still no definitive solution to this problem. This review discusses the laboratory and metabolic aspects of the clinical management of patients with renal stones, whether these stones are of primary or secondary origin.

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Increased fluid intake, decreased protein consumption, and dietary changes in sodium, calcium, oxalate, potassium, purine, vitamins, and essential fatty acids are considered.

- **Specific pharmacological treatment**: These treatments aim to modify urine calcium, oxalate, urate, citrate, and acidity.

Finally, more unusual types of stones are examined.

### Breaking the cycle of recurrent calcium stone disease [^1166jPgQ]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Low credibility.

Calcium stones are common in nature, yet few therapeutic tools are available for secondary prevention. Personalized approaches for stone prevention have been informed by 24-hour urine testing to guide dietary and medical interventions. However, evidence is conflicting about whether an approach guided by 24-hour urine testing is more effective than a generic one. The available medications for stone prevention, namely thiazide diuretics, alkali, and allopurinol, are not always prescribed consistently, dosed correctly, or tolerated well by patients.

New treatments on the horizon hold the promise of preventing calcium oxalate stones by degrading oxalate in the gut, reprogramming the gut microbiome to reduce oxalate absorption, or knocking down expression of enzymes involved in hepatic oxalate production. New treatments are also needed to target Randall's plaque, the root cause of calcium stone formation.

### Medical management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: A systematic review for an American College of Physicians Clinical Guideline [^115x1LvW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Optimum management to prevent recurrent kidney stones is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurring kidney stones.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other databases through September 2012, as well as reference lists of systematic reviews and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Study selection**: 28 English-language RCTs that studied treatments to prevent recurrent kidney stones and reported stone outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and two independently rated quality and graded strength of evidence.

- **Data synthesis**: In patients with one past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved the composite stone risk compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84]). Low-strength evidence showed that reducing soft-drink consumption decreased symptomatic stone risk (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.98]). In patients with multiple past calcium stones, most of whom were receiving increased fluid intake, moderate-strength evidence showed that thiazides (RR, 0.52 [CI, 0.39 to 0.69]), citrates (RR, 0.25 [CI, 0.14 to 0.44]), and allopurinol (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.42 to 0.84]) each further reduced composite stone recurrence risk compared with placebo or control, although the benefit from allopurinol seemed limited to patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Other baseline biochemistry measures did not allow prediction of treatment efficacy. Low-strength evidence showed that neither citrate nor allopurinol combination therapies were effective.

### Alkalinizing agents: A review of prescription, over-the-counter, and medical food supplements [^1124ErUL]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney stones affect 1 in every 11 people in the United States each year. There is a significant high recurrence rate without a stone prevention protocol. Alkali citrate is beneficial in decreasing stone recurrence, but due to the cost and gastrointestinal side effects, there is a low adherence rate. This study aims to serve as a review of some of the most commonly used alkalizing over-the-counter supplements that are advertised to prevent and treat kidney stones.

- **Methods**: Data were gathered through a comprehensive online literature search and company inquiries for kidney stone prevention supplements. An informal poll of the authors selected supplements that are most commonly taken by their patients. A total of eight supplements were evaluated for cost, alkali equivalent provided, dosing, and regulatory information.

- **Results**: Eight of the most commonly used supplements were reviewed with a focus on alkalizing agents. Information reviewed revealed dosing recommendations resulting in decreased citrate alkali equivalents per day compared with prescription-strength potassium citrate. Cost, peer-reviewed study results, and regulatory data were reviewed, tabulated, and analyzed. The cost per alkali equivalent was substantially decreased for each supplement compared with the prescribed drug. All supplements were found to be readily available online.

Over-the-counter alkalizing agents are available to patients and may be an appropriate alternative to cost-prohibitive potassium citrate when treating urolithiasis patients. Additional testing will be necessary.

### The efficacy of dietary intervention on urinary risk factors for stone formation in recurrent calcium oxalate stone patients [^114iwrkT]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Nutrition is suggested to be the major environmental risk factor in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease. The study was designed to evaluate the effect of dietary intervention on urinary risk factors for recurrence in calcium oxalate stone formers.

A total of 76 men and 31 women with idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease collected 24-hour urine on their habitual, self-selected diets and after 7 days on a balanced standardized diet according to the recommendations for calcium oxalate stone formers. On the usual diet, a urine volume of less than 2.0 L per 24 hours was present in 57.9%, hypercalciuria in 25.2%, hypomagnesuria in 18.7%, hyperoxaluria in 14.0%, hyperuricosuria in 41.3%, and hypocitraturia in 57.0% of patients. The frequency of metabolic abnormalities and the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation decreased significantly on the ingestion of the balanced diet, due to the significant increase in urinary volume, pH, and citrate excretion and the significant decrease in urinary calcium and uric acid excretion. No change occurred in urinary oxalate and magnesium excretion.

The evaluation of urinary risk profiles of the patients on their usual dietary habits revealed a high risk for calcium oxalate stone formation. A low fluid intake and an increased intake of protein and alcohol were identified as the most important dietary risk factors. The shift to a nutritionally balanced diet according to the recommendations for calcium oxalate stone formers significantly reduced the stone-forming potential.

### Prevention of urinary stones with hydration (PUSH): Design and rationale of a clinical trial [^113JYmxR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The rationale and objective of this study highlight that although maintaining high fluid intake is an effective low-risk intervention for the secondary prevention of urinary stone disease, many patients with stones do not increase their fluid intake.

- **Study design**: We describe the rationale and design of the Prevention of Urinary Stones With Hydration (PUSH) Study, a randomized trial of a multicomponent behavioral intervention program to increase and maintain high fluid intake. Participants are randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to the intervention or control arm, with a target sample size of 1,642 participants.

- **Setting and participants**: Adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a symptomatic stone history and low urine volume are eligible. Exclusion criteria include infectious or monogenic causes of urinary stone disease and comorbid conditions precluding increased fluid intake.

- **Interventions**: All participants receive usual care and a smart water bottle with a smartphone application. Participants in the intervention arm receive a fluid intake prescription and an adaptive program of behavioral interventions, including financial incentives, structured problem solving, and other automated adherence interventions. Control arm participants receive guideline-based fluid instructions.

- **Outcomes**: The primary endpoint is recurrence of a symptomatic stone during 24 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include changes in radiographic stone burden, 24-hour urine output, and urinary symptoms.

- **Limitations**: Periodic 24-hour urine volumes may not fully reflect daily behavior.

In conclusion, the study introduces a highly novel approach to urinary stone prevention through a structured intervention program.

### Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium containing kidney stones in adults [^114LZj7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Kidney stones affect people worldwide and have a high rate of recurrence even with treatment. Recurrences are particularly prevalent in people with low urinary citrate levels, which are associated with a higher incidence of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stones. Oral citrate therapy increases urinary citrate levels, binding with calcium and inhibiting crystallization, thus reducing stone formation. Despite the widespread use of oral citrate therapy for the prevention and treatment of calcium oxalate stones, the evidence supporting its clinical efficacy remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium-containing kidney stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 29 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium-containing kidney stones in adults treated for a minimum of six months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed studies for inclusion in this review. Data were extracted according to predetermined criteria. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences for continuous outcomes.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1168Jo1a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the comparative effectiveness and safety of preventive dietary and pharmacologic management of nephrolithiasis in adults.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on published literature identified using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through March 2014), Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science. Searches were limited to English-language publications. The clinical outcomes evaluated for this guideline include symptomatic stone recurrence, pain, urinary tract obstruction with acute renal impairment, infection, procedure-related illness, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, and end-stage renal disease. This guideline grades the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using ACP's clinical practice guidelines grading system. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all adults with nephrolithiasis (≥ 1 prior kidney stone episode).

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent nephrolithiasis. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends pharmacologic monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol to prevent nephrolithiasis in patients with active disease for whom increased fluid intake fails to reduce symptom recurrence.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^113mM2HC]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Fresh lemon juice has been suggested as a possible alternative to potassium citrate for the treatment of patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, particularly those with hypocitraturia. However, the results of the few studies designed to evaluate the effects of lemon juice supplementation in patients with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis are flawed. These studies suffer from a retrospective, observational design and a sample size too small to test treatment effects with adequate statistical power.

Thus, we designed a pragmatic Prospective, Randomised, Open, Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) trial to evaluate the effects of fresh lemon juice supplementation, as compared to no supplementation, on the long-term risk of stone recurrence in patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. All participants were prescribed a standard diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake.

### Short-term tolvaptan increases water intake and effectively decreases urinary calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid supersaturations [^113wh4Y4]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Some patients cannot effectively increase water intake and urine volume to prevent urinary stones. Tolvaptan, a V2 receptor antagonist, blocks water reabsorption in the collecting duct and should decrease urinary supersaturation of stone-forming solutes, although this action has never been proven.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 21 calcium urinary stone formers. These were stratified into majority calcium oxalate (10 patients) and calcium phosphate (11 patients) groups. Patients received 45 mg tolvaptan per day or placebo for 1 week, followed by a washout week and crossover to tolvaptan or placebo for week 3. A 24-hour urine sample was collected at the end of weeks 1 and 3.

- **Results**: Tolvaptan vs. placebo decreased urinary osmolality (mean ± SD 204 ± 96 vs. 529 ± 213 mOsm/kg, p 0.05 for all interactions).

- **Conclusions**: Tolvaptan increases urine volume and decreases urinary supersaturation.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116ezhUo]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically concerning urine tests, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining metabolic testing. This includes one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet. These collections should be analyzed at a minimum for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium, and creatinine in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis, or in high-risk or interested patients with a first episode of nephrolithiasis.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^114DCHc2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The primary outcome variable of the study was the time to stone recurrence. Based on previous reports and regardless of baseline stratification, it was conservatively expected that 40% of patients in the control arm, on diet alone (with or without potassium citrate supplementation), would have at least one new stone formation over a two-year follow-up period. Over the same observation period, new stone formation was expected to be observed in 20% of patients on active treatment with fresh lemon juice. We considered that a reduction in the event rate to 20% with fresh lemon juice supplementation would represent a clinically relevant effect.

To provide the trial with an 80% power to detect, as statistically significant (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed test), the expected difference in event rates (40% vs. 20%) between the two treatment groups, 91 patients per group had to be available for statistical evaluation. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, 101 patients per group had to be included. Thus, a total of 202 patients had to be randomized.

All outcomes were assessed by intention-to-treat analyses. For survival data, the Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot the probability of achieving the endpoints of interest. Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed, with results expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The primary analysis, i.e. time to stone recurrence, was assessed using the unadjusted Cox model. In a post-hoc analysis, an adjusted model that took into account age, sex, and baseline stratification (i.e. normocitraturia or hypocitraturia) was applied.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^111Tf3Vk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

We propose to invest energy and time in patient education, such as dietary and physical behavior changes, as a first-line intervention for patients with recalcitrant calcium kidney stones in consideration of these recent findings. If this does not suffice, pharmacological measures should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

Citrate salts are a valid option, although high-quality trial evidence is limited. Additionally, calcium phosphate stone (CaP) formation may be triggered by alkali administration, necessitating careful monitoring of treatment and urine pH. In patients with calcium kidney stones that are intolerant or not responsive to citrate supplementation as monotherapy, long-acting thiazides such as chlorthalidone or indapamide may be tried. Importantly, there are currently only theoretical considerations, and no robust trial data demonstrates an advantage of these thiazide-like compounds over hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone recurrence prevention.

Close monitoring of the patient should be implemented, and if there is no relevant change in stone activity after 2–3 years of treatment, discontinuation should be explored. The combination of thiazides and alkali therapy may be promising but has not been tested rigorously so far. Benefits and potential risks associated with the long-term use of thiazides should be discussed carefully with each patient.

### Effect of high and low calcium diets on stone forming risk during liberal oxalate intake [^117Tcyps]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that a high calcium diet protects against calcium oxalate stone formation. We compared the effect of high and low calcium diets on urinary saturation of calcium oxalate during liberal oxalate intake.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 10 healthy subjects (5 male, 5 female) participated in a 2-phase, randomized, crossover study comparing high (1,000 mg daily) and low (400 mg daily) calcium intake on a liberal oxalate diet (200 mg daily). During each phase, subjects adhered to an instructed diet for 3 days followed by a controlled, metabolic diet for 4 days. Blood and 24-hour urine specimens collected on the last 2 days of each phase were analyzed for serum biochemistry studies and stone risk factors, respectively.

- **Results**: Urinary calcium was higher (mean ± SD 171 ± 64 vs. 124 ± 49 mg daily, p = 0.002) and oxalate was lower (25 ± 4.8 vs. 27 ± 4 mg daily, p = 0.02) on the high vs. low calcium diet. Overall, the urinary relative saturation ratio of calcium oxalate was higher on the high compared with the low calcium diet (3.3 vs. 2.5, p < 0.0001), even after adjusting for confounding variables.

- **Conclusions**: In normal subjects, urinary saturation of calcium oxalate was higher on a high calcium diet than a low calcium diet during liberal oxalate intake because the decrease in urinary oxalate did not overcome the effect of increased calcium. A high calcium diet during liberal oxalate intake may pose an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

### Stones: A matter of doubt — how best to evaluate stone formers [^1135BXvG]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Once again, the question of one versus two 24-hour urine collections for diagnosis in kidney stone prevention has been raised. As in all previous studies, no difference is seen in the mean levels of analytes between first and second collections. However, variation within patients is so marked that at least two collections are needed for confidence.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111r56we]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

- **Methods**: The webpages of the 61 members of the Société Internationale d'Urologie were analyzed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While 7 national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

- **Conclusions**: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis.

### Medical management of common urinary calculi [^111ka4UE]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common condition affecting nearly 5 percent of U.S. men and women during their lifetimes. Calculi can be prevented in most patients by utilizing a simplified evaluation, reasonable dietary and fluid recommendations, and directed pharmacologic intervention. Serum studies and 24-hour urine collections are the mainstays of metabolic investigation and are usually warranted in patients with calculi. Although some stones are the result of inherited conditions, most result from a complex interaction between diet, fluid habits, and genetic predisposition.

- **Calcium-sparing diuretics**: Thiazides are often used to treat hypercalciuria.
- **Citrate medications**: These increase levels of this naturally occurring stone inhibitor.
- **Allopurinol**: This can be helpful in patients with hyperuricosuria.
- **Urease inhibitors**: These can help break the cycle of infectious calculi.

Aggressive fluid intake and moderated intake of salt, calcium, and meat are recommended for most patients.

### Twenty-four-hour urine chemistries and the risk of kidney stones among women and men [^114Y6Uuf]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

The results of a 24-hour urine collection are integral to selecting the most appropriate intervention to prevent kidney stone recurrence. However, the currently accepted definitions of normal urine values are not firmly supported by the literature. Additionally, little information is available about the relationship between the risk of stone formation and the levels of urinary factors. Unfortunately, the majority of previous studies of 24-hour urine chemistries were limited by the inclusion of kidney stone formers and poorly defined controls.

- **Methods**: We obtained 24-hour urine collections from 807 men and women with a history of kidney stone disease and 239 without a history, who were participants in three large ongoing cohort studies: the Nurses' Health Study I (NHS I; mean age of 61 years), the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II; mean age of 42 years), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; mean age of 59 years).

- **Results**: Mean 24-hour urine calcium excretion was higher and urine volume was lower in cases than controls in NHS I (P ≤ 0.01), NHS II (P ≤ 0.13), and HPFS (P ≤ 0.01), but urine oxalate and citrate did not differ. Among women, urine uric acid was similar in cases and controls, but was lower in cases in men (P = 0.06). The frequency of hypercalciuria was higher among the cases in NHS I (P = 0.26), NHS II (P = 0.03), and HPFS (P = 0.02), but 27, 17, and 14% of the controls, respectively, also met the definition of hypercalciuria. The frequency of hyperoxaluria did not differ between cases and controls.

### Challenges in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nephrolithiasis [^111bF2gs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The incidence of renal stones is rising, along with the costs and morbidity associated with this condition. With careful evaluation and management, the great majority of recurrent stones are preventable. The cornerstone of this evaluation remains the 24-hour urine collection. This review outlines the physiological rationale for commonly requested urine studies and explains how these results should guide therapy, with special emphasis on recent advances in the understanding of risk factors for stone disease. Challenges associated with the management of complicated patients will also be addressed.

Recent findings indicate that long-term follow-up and repeated evaluations are effective at preventing recurrent stones and increasing patient satisfaction. There is a growing appreciation of the complexity of dietary risks for stone disease, and traditional risk factors such as dietary oxalate must be reevaluated.

The key to stone prevention is the individualization of therapy to address specific patient risk factors. It is vital to recognize that these factors can change over time, necessitating alterations in preventive therapies.

### Diet-induced oxalate nephropathy [^117P2RE1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Because of the rarity of diet-induced oxalate nephropathy, specific treatment guidelines do not exist. However, the management of enteric hyperoxaluria has been described. The recommended management includes a low oxalate diet, high fluid intake, calcium carbonate (to bind oxalate), and potassium citrate (to correct metabolic acidosis). We prescribed a low oxalate diet, high fluid intake, and calcium acetate (to achieve both binding of oxalate and control of phosphate).

- **Patient's perspective**: I am writing on behalf of my father. First, let me say that we are eternally grateful to our doctor for her determination and expertise in investigating and diagnosing the reasons for my dad's sudden kidney failure, and more so, for her careful follow-up of his care from the point of diagnosis. She enabled him to regain kidney function, avoid dialysis, and resume much of his daily routine pre-kidney failure. We joke that she was a real-life 'Columbo'.

To put his case in perspective, prior to falling ill, my dad was the picture of health. Just several weeks prior to his kidney failure, he was clearing heavy brush from his property and cleaning up a small landslide of mud that had run into his neighbour's property. He was not what most think of for an 81-year-old man. Up to the point of his kidney failure, although closely managing type 2 diabetes for approximately 30 years, he had never been hospitalized, never had an intravenous insertion, and never been subjected to tests such as CT scans and biopsies.

### Medical management of stone disease [^112JRGx4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Dietary manipulation remains one of the most important strategies for therapy. A growing body of evidence suggests that severe calcium restriction is inappropriate in patients with renal nephrolithiasis. This text discusses dietary recommendations based on recent evidence and the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis.

- **Recent findings**: New evidence strongly supports the role of oxalate, salt, and animal protein dietary restrictions in the prevention of calcium stone recurrence. Moderate calcium restriction is only effective in absorptive hypercalciuria. Calcium restriction is not effective in other etiologies of calcium stones and its implementation can lead to bone demineralization. New evidence implicates the lack of intestinal bacteria in the degradation of dietary oxalate, with its higher absorption resulting in an increased risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. The role of Oxalobacter formigenes is discussed herein.

- **Summary**: Metabolic abnormalities responsible for stone recurrence are currently identified in 97% of evaluated patients, and remission rates of medical prophylaxis in calcium stone formers are approaching 80%. Urinary calcium excretion in most renal stone formers is more dependent on the dietary acid load than on dietary calcium intake itself. Reducing the acid-ash content of the diet impacts decreasing stone recurrence while preventing bone loss. New evidence associates the decolonization of oxalate-degrading intestinal flora with a higher risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^1124wcML]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

All patients satisfying the selection criteria were asked to submit a 24-hour urine collection for the measurement of 24-hour urine output, urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, citrate, urea, uric acid, sodium, sulphate, creatinine, and evaluation of urinary pH after one and four months. The averages of the two measures were taken as baseline. During the second urine submission, patients underwent a complete physical evaluation including blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference measurements, and a blood sample collection for routine hematochemistry. Baseline evaluation also included a visit with a dietician who provided the diet and a questionnaire to assess patient compliance.

Patients allocated to lemon juice supplementation were recommended to drink 60 mL of fresh lemon juice twice daily, an amount expected to provide six grams or 92 mEq of citric acid per day. All patients, regardless of treatment randomisation, were maintained on their standardised diet and were recommended not to reduce daily fluid intake.

Baseline evaluations, including measurement of 24-hour urine output, urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, citrate, urea, uric acid, sodium, sulphate, creatinine, dietician evaluation, and renal ultrasound, were repeated at six months and then at one and two years after randomisation. X-ray evaluations were not standardised and were performed as deemed clinically appropriate.

### Kidney stones: Pathophysiology and medical management [^114YWGjd]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. It is imperative that clinicians look for the underlying causes of nephrolithiasis to direct management. There have been many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, a brief general background is provided, focusing mainly on the pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones.

Although significant advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single-gene defects, the understanding of polygenic causes of kidney stones remains largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on the urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and requires further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on the combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand its pathophysiology.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^113gPLN1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Participants expressed difficulties in attaining individualized care. They felt that the management strategies for preventing stone recurrence were generic and did not consider their unique contexts and underlying diagnoses. It was suggested that stone analysis and metabolic evaluation should be conducted to allow clinicians to tailor management strategies according to specific types of kidney stones. Participants observed that evaluating the metabolic cause and stone type was not common practice and often only provided after stone removal.

An example shared by a participant highlighted their experience: "It's the process of going through and analyzing why the stones came about. In my case, it is only after they did the surgery and took it out they could identify them as calcium oxalate stones".

- **Struggling to find the right people**: Participants struggled to find the 'right' people to tailor treatment to prevent kidney stones. They emphasized that referral pathways across medical specialties and dietetics were crucial for ensuring individualized nutrition and pharmacological therapy to prevent recurrence. Some noted poor communication between public and private providers and across healthcare disciplines. For instance, a participant mentioned that urologists never passed on information after stone removal procedures to other medical specialists, particularly back to primary care, which limited the ability to modify diet and lifestyle to self-manage and prevent recurring kidney stones.

### Fresh lemon juice supplementation for the prevention of recurrent stones in calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis: A pragmatic, prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint trial [^114q8D1v]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

- **Stratification, randomisation, and masking**: According to urinary citrate excretion at baseline evaluation, patients satisfying the selection criteria were stratified into two strata: hypocitraturia if urinary citrate excretion was ≤ 320 mg/24 h or normocitraturia if urinary citrate excretion was > 320 mg/24 h.

	- All patients were recommended to drink 2 to 2.5 litres of water per day and were prescribed the same standard diet based on restricted intake of animal proteins and salt, combined with a normal calcium intake. Then, within each stratum, patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis to two-year treatment with standard recommended diet with fresh lemon juice supplementation or to standard diet without lemon juice supplementation. All patients in the hypocitraturia stratum were also prescribed 2 g of potassium citrate twice daily.

	- Randomisation was centralised at the Laboratory of Biostatistics of the CRC under the responsibility of an independent investigator (G. A.G.) according to a web-based, computer-generated randomisation list created using SAS (version 9.2). Blocking was used to ensure balance in the number of patients in each group at any time during the trial. A block size of eight was used. According to the PROBE design, neither patients nor care providers were masked to group assignment, whereas investigators involved in data handling and analyses were blinded to patient treatment allocation. A blinded-to-treatment adjudicating group reviewed the data to determine which patients had reached study endpoints and to evaluate safety.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111xPPpV]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

- **Methods**: The webpages of the 61 members of the Société Internationale d'Urologie were analyzed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While seven national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and eleven to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

- **Conclusions**: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis.

### Dietary therapy for patients with hypocitraturic nephrolithiasis [^111mSj14]. Nature Reviews Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Citrate is an inhibitor of urinary stone formation. Clinical and in vitro data suggest that increasing urine citrate levels will decrease the precipitation of calcium stones. Historically, low urinary citrate has been treated with oral potassium citrate or sodium citrate supplementation, but recent studies have shown the potential of dietary interventions to raise urine citrate levels. Dietary therapy with commercial or homemade beverages is attractive to patients who would prefer nonpharmacological intervention. At the time of writing, several drinks have shown promise, but no single beverage has been found to consistently raise urine citrate levels in a reproducible fashion. Further research is necessary to develop the ideal dietary therapy for hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis.

### A new era in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones [^112rtijF]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most prevalent type of kidney stone. The amount of oxalate excreted in the urine is a major risk factor for CaOx stone formation. The study by Siener et al. makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of how *Oxalobacter formigenes* affects oxalate metabolism and excretion in humans and hence influences the risk of developing CaOx kidney stones.

### Can 24-hour urine stone risk profiles predict urinary stone composition [^111dhZXx]. Journal of Endourology (2014). Low credibility.

Distinguishing calcium oxalate from uric acid stones is critical to identifying patients who may benefit from dissolution therapy and can also help direct preventive measures for stone growth. We aim to study whether a 24-hour urine analysis may predict urinary stone composition.

Patients and methods: We retrospectively identified patients with calcium oxalate and uric acid stone compositions who also had a 24-hour urine collection within 3 months of stone analysis. Patients with calcium phosphate, cystine, and other stone compositions were excluded. Subjects were divided based on their stone type (calcium oxalate vs. uric acid stones) and were compared according to demographic data and 24-hour urine analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between stone composition and covariates. A nomogram was then constructed to predict uric acid stones over calcium oxalate stones.

Results: Of the 1163 patients identified, 1054 (90.6%) had calcium oxalate stones and 109 (9.4%) had uric acid stones. On logistic regression, body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio [OR] 1.351, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.133–1.609; P < 0.001), urinary sodium (OR 1.021, 95% CI 1.004–1.037; P = 0.013), calcium (OR 0.987, 95% CI 0.979–0.996; P = 0.003), oxalate (OR 0.890, 95% CI 0.804–0.985; P = 0.024), and uric acid (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.982–0.997; P = 0.005) were significant predictors for urinary stone composition. The nomogram with the highest concordance index (c-index = 0.855) was obtained using age, BMI, urinary sodium, calcium, oxalate, and uric acid.

### Contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion [^112syMyV]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

The amount of oxalate excreted in urine significantly impacts calcium oxalate supersaturation and stone formation. Dietary oxalate is believed to contribute only a minor portion (10 to 20%) to the amount of oxalate excreted in urine, but the validity of the experimental observations supporting this conclusion can be questioned. Understanding the actual contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion is important, as it is potentially modifiable.

- **Methods**: We varied the amount of dietary oxalate consumed by a group of adult individuals using formula diets and controlled, solid-food diets with a known oxalate content, determined by a recently developed analytical procedure. Controlled solid-food diets were consumed containing 10, 50, and 250 mg of oxalate/2500 kcal, as well as formula diets containing 0 and 180 mg oxalate/2500 kcal. Changes in the content of oxalate and other ions were assessed in 24-hour urine collections.

- **Results**: Urinary oxalate excretion increased as dietary oxalate intake increased. With oxalate-containing diets, the mean contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion ranged from 24.4 ± 15.5% on the 10 mg/2500 kcal/day diet to 41.5 ± 9.1% on the 250 mg/2500 kcal/day diet, much higher than previously estimated. When the calcium content of a diet containing 250 mg of oxalate was reduced from 1002 mg to 391 mg, urinary oxalate excretion increased by a mean of 28.2 ± 4.8%, and the mean dietary contribution increased to 52.6 ± 8.6%.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that dietary oxalate makes a much more significant contribution to urinary oxalate excretion than previously thought.

### Effectiveness of treatment modalities on kidney stone recurrence [^1119afhY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is highly prevalent across all demographic groups in the Western world and beyond, and its incidence rates are rising. In addition to the morbidity of the acute event, stone disease often becomes a lifelong problem that requires preventative therapy to diminish ongoing morbidity. Across the majority of stone types, increased fluid intake and targeted dietary modifications are mainstays of therapy. Specific dietary interventions associated with reduced calcium stone risk include adequate dietary calcium intake and restriction of sodium, protein, and oxalate intake, among others.

Pharmaceutical therapy may be required if lifestyle changes are insufficient to minimize the risk of stone recurrence and must be targeted to the specific metabolic abnormalities portending risk for a given patient. Therapeutic options for idiopathic calcium stone disease include thiazides, citrate salts, and uric acid-lowering agents. Alkali salts are also the treatment of choice for uric acid stone disease. Management of struvite stone disease is largely surgical, but acetohydroxamic acid is a proven second-line therapy. Cystinuria requires lifestyle modifications and may call for thiol-binding agents.

Significant heterogeneity of the clinical population with stone disease has previously limited opportunities for large randomized controlled trials. However, as clinical phenotypes and genotypes are increasingly clarified, there are mounting opportunities for targeted randomized controlled trials in stone prevention. In the meantime, the currently available evidence for both lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions continues to evolve.

### Medical management of renal stones [^112UBVsk]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing in industrialized nations, resulting in a corresponding rise in economic burden. Nephrolithiasis is now recognized as both a chronic and systemic condition, which further underscores the impact of the disease. Diet and environment play an important role in stone disease, presumably by modulating urine composition. Dietary modification as a preventive treatment to decrease lithogenic risk factors and prevent stone recurrence has gained interest because of its potential to be safer and more economical than drug treatment. However, not all abnormalities are likely to be amenable to dietary therapy, and in some cases, drugs are necessary to reduce the risk of stone formation. Unfortunately, no new drugs have been developed for stone prevention since the 1980s when potassium citrate was introduced, perhaps because the long observation period needed to demonstrate efficacy discourages investigators from embarking on clinical trials. Nonetheless, effective established treatment regimens are currently available for stone prevention.

### Prevention of nephrolithiasis [^111QDiXD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The high incidence of recurrence after an initial stone event underscores the need for an effective medical prophylactic program. Dietary modification and drug therapies have long been advocated to reduce the likelihood of stone recurrence. While the efficacy of a high fluid intake has been validated in a randomized trial, the benefit of other dietary measures is based on modulation of urinary stone risk factors and outcomes derived from observational studies. Several drug therapies have been evaluated in a limited number of prospective, randomized trials, and efficacy has been demonstrated for thiazides, allopurinol, and alkali citrate in some populations of recurrent stone formers. The role of selective versus nonselective therapy for stone prevention awaits further study.

### Oxalate and urinary stones [^113PV3fX]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Calcium oxalate is a major component of renal stones, and its urinary concentration plays an important role in stone formation. Even a small increase in urinary oxalate has a significant impact on calcium oxalate saturation. Although primary hyperoxaluria is relatively uncommon, patients with calcium oxalate stones have some degree of hyperoxaluria. To understand the underlying causes of such hyperoxaluria, the processes of oxalate synthesis and excretion must be clarified. This article focuses on the determination of oxalate, calculation of its saturation, and the hyperoxaluric syndromes, with special reference to metabolic precursors of oxalate, including ascorbic acid, glyoxylate, and glycolate.

### Water for preventing urinary stones [^1114fG34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Urinary stones are a common condition characterized by a high incidence and high recurrence rate. For a long time, increased water intake has been the main preventive measure for the disease and its recurrence. This is an update of a review originally published in 2004.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of increased water intake for the primary and secondary prevention of urinary stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Chinese Biomedical Disk using a search strategy developed in conjunction with the Cochrane Renal Group's Trials Search Coordinator. No language restriction was applied. Date of last search: April 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of increased water intake for the prevention of urinary stones and its recurrence were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: No studies of increased water intake for the primary prevention of urinary stones met the inclusion criteria. One study with 199 patients provided results of increased water intake for the recurrence of urinary stones. The stone recurrence was lower in the increased water intake group than in the no intervention group (12% versus 27%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84).

### Clinical effectiveness of calcium oxalate stone treatments [^113osJRF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Lowering kidney stone risk and urine calcium oxalate supersaturation is a primary clinical focus for kidney stone prevention and can be achieved with multiple strategies. Common strategies include advice to increase fluid intake, restrict dietary sodium, or prescribing a thiazide-type diuretic. We investigated how physicians make these decisions in real-world practice and evaluate their efficacy based on 24-hour urine collections.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical charts for 203 kidney stone formers with idiopathic calcium stones from the University of Chicago Kidney Stone Clinic between 2005 and 2020. Patients had three 24-hour urines before an initial pre-treatment clinic visit and one follow-up 24-hour urine. We analyzed changes in urine composition based on treatment advice using t-tests and ANOVA.

- **Results**: Patients who received advice to increase fluid intake had lower urine volume at baseline (1.5 vs. 2.5 L/day, p < 0.001) and a larger increase in urine volume at follow-up (0.6 vs. 0.1 L/day, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive the advice. Patients who were advised to restrict dietary sodium had a higher urine sodium at baseline (208 vs. 139 mEq/day, p < 0.001), a larger reduction in urine sodium (-28 vs. 13 mEq/day, p = 0.002), and a larger reduction in urine calcium (-74 vs. -28 mg/day, p = 0.005) compared with those not advised to restrict dietary sodium. Patients started on a thiazide had a higher baseline urine calcium (281 vs. 213 mg/day) and a larger reduction in urine calcium (-83 vs. -9 mg/day, p < 0.001) compared with patients not started on a thiazide.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^116JHNf2]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, particularly in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence largely depends on the type of stone, such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and uric acid stones. Even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide valuable information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention.

Medications like protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics increase the risk of certain types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks associated with these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk, but weight loss could undermine prevention if associated with high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration.

For the prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. Conversely, for the prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH.

Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.
