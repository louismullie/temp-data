## Question

What are the treatment options for labyrinthitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for labyrinthitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining labyrinthitis and distinguishing it from mimics like vestibular neuritis and Ménière's disease. Then, I should verify the acute-phase management priorities, including steroids, vestibular suppressants, and when to use antibiotics. Next, I will examine the role and timing of vestibular rehabilitation. After that, I need to consider hearing rehabilitation options if sensorineural hearing loss persists. Finally, I should review special scenarios such as bacterial labyrinthitis, COVID-19–associated cases, and pediatric considerations, and close with a concise, staged algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and differential so I don't conflate entities. Labyrinthitis is an acute peripheral vestibulopathy with severe vertigo and concurrent sensorineural hearing loss, typically lasting more than 24 hours and not episodic or fluctuating, which helps distinguish it from vestibular neuritis (vertigo without hearing loss) and Ménière's disease (episodic vertigo with fluctuating hearing and tinnitus) [^c85216bc] [^67a4a9be].

> Now, for acute-phase management, I should confirm the role of corticosteroids. Wait, let me verify the timing and strength of evidence. For vestibular neuritis, guidelines suggest shared decision-making for a short course of steroids when patients present within 3 days, and while labyrinthitis evidence is less robust, the pathophysiologic overlap and case-based experience support considering steroids early, particularly for sensorineural hearing loss, with a COVID-19 adolescent case showing improvement after steroids and vestibular rehabilitation, though this is low-certainty evidence and should be individualized [^486a73fa] [^adb8d089] [^42a270af].

> Next, I should review vestibular suppressants. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term use. Short-term agents like meclizine or benzodiazepines can be used for symptom control in the first few days to a week, but prolonged use delays central compensation and may worsen outcomes; in older adults, benzodiazepines increase fall risk, so I need to ensure we limit duration and taper promptly as symptoms improve [^a86f6ad2] [^63da9cb0].

> I need to check the role of antibiotics. Initially, I thought antibiotics are never indicated for labyrinthitis, but wait, that overgeneralizes. If bacterial labyrinthitis is suspected — often in the setting of acute otitis media, mastoiditis, or meningitis — then targeted intravenous antibiotics are indicated, with case reports documenting recovery of vertigo but persistent hearing loss despite therapy, underscoring the need for early recognition and aggressive treatment when infection is present [^131c0b74].

> Let me consider vestibular rehabilitation next. I should confirm timing. Early vestibular rehabilitation is beneficial after the acute phase to promote central compensation and reduce chronic dizziness; however, during active vertigo attacks, VR can exacerbate symptoms, so I should defer VR until the acute vertigo settles and then initiate a structured program, ideally with a vestibular therapist, to optimize functional recovery [^3cc490a6] [^c224996c].

> For persistent sensorineural hearing loss, I should verify hearing rehabilitation options. If the hearing loss remains and impacts communication, standard audiologic rehabilitation includes amplification with hearing aids, and in selected cases of profound loss, cochlear implantation may be considered, with small case series suggesting variable benefit in labyrinthitis ossificans; this remains low-certainty evidence and requires multidisciplinary evaluation and shared decision-making [^43580bf1].

> But wait, what if the labyrinthitis is COVID-19–associated or in a child. I should double-check that nuance. COVID-19–related labyrinthitis has been reported, including pediatric cases, and management parallels non-COVID cases with steroids and vestibular rehabilitation, though long-term sequelae remain uncertain and warrant follow-up; in children, the approach is similar with supportive care, steroids when indicated, and early rehabilitation as tolerated [^42a270af] [^a7082821].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and sanity-check each step. In the acute phase, confirm the diagnosis and exclude central causes, consider a short course of corticosteroids if within 3 days and hearing loss is present, provide vestibular suppressants for 3–5 days only, and treat suspected bacterial labyrinthitis with IV antibiotics. In the subacute phase, taper suppressants and initiate vestibular rehabilitation. In the chronic phase, address persistent hearing loss with audiology and consider cochlear implantation if criteria are met, with ongoing follow-up for compensation and fall risk assessment [^486a73fa] [^3cc490a6] [^131c0b74].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this aligns with the evidence: most patients improve with conservative management, but early, time-sensitive interventions — particularly corticosteroids for hearing recovery and structured vestibular rehabilitation for compensation — are critical; avoid prolonged vestibular suppressants, and escalate to hearing rehabilitation when indicated, recognizing that bacterial etiologies require antibiotics and that persistent imbalance warrants targeted therapy [^86eeb016] [^3cc490a6] [^131c0b74].

---

Labyrinthitis treatment centers on **vestibular suppressants** (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, benzodiazepines) for acute vertigo and nausea, used short-term to avoid delaying compensation [^a86f6ad2]. Corticosteroids are considered early, especially with hearing loss, but **evidence is limited** and decisions should be individualized [^42a270af] [^2f6ed987]. Vestibular rehabilitation should start once acute symptoms abate to promote compensation and reduce chronic dizziness [^c224996c]. Treat the underlying cause when identified (e.g. antibiotics for bacterial infection) [^131c0b74], and manage persistent hearing loss with hearing aids or cochlear implantation if indicated [^43580bf1]. Most patients recover over weeks to months, but recovery can be incomplete, particularly for hearing [^notfound].

---

## Acute phase management

### Symptomatic treatment

- **Vestibular suppressants**: Meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, or benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) reduce vertigo and nausea; limit use to 3–5 days to avoid delaying central compensation [^a86f6ad2].

- **Antiemetics**: Prochlorperazine or ondansetron control nausea and vomiting.

- **Corticosteroids**: Consider a short course (e.g. prednisone) if hearing loss is present, though evidence is limited; use shared decision-making [^42a270af] [^2f6ed987].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care emphasizes **hydration and rest** during the acute phase, with gradual resumption of activity as tolerated. Patient education should explain the natural course, expected recovery, and the importance of avoiding prolonged vestibular suppressant use [^f741d8c3].

---

## Subacute and chronic phase management

### Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)

VRT is **strongly recommended** once acute vertigo subsides to promote central compensation, reduce chronic dizziness, and improve balance and quality of life [^3cc490a6] [^c224996c]. Typical exercises include gaze stabilization, balance training, and habituation exercises.

---

### Management of persistent symptoms

Persistent vertigo may respond to **continued vestibular rehabilitation** and selective use of vestibular suppressants during exacerbations. Persistent hearing loss warrants audiological evaluation and rehabilitation with hearing aids or cochlear implantation if indicated [^43580bf1].

---

## Treatment of underlying causes

When labyrinthitis is due to a bacterial infection (e.g. otitis media, meningitis), **targeted intravenous antibiotics** are indicated [^131c0b74]. Viral labyrinthitis is managed supportively, as specific antivirals are not routinely recommended.

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Most patients recover over weeks to months, but recovery can be incomplete — particularly for hearing. Chronic dizziness and balance deficits may persist in some cases, necessitating ongoing vestibular rehabilitation and symptom management [^ec06dce0].

---

## Summary of treatment approach

| **Phase** | **Treatment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | - Vestibular suppressants <br/> - Antiemetics <br/> - Corticosteroids (if hearing loss) | Control vertigo, nausea, and inflammation |
| Subacute | Vestibular rehabilitation therapy | Promote compensation, reduce chronic symptoms |
| Chronic | - Continued VRT <br/> - Hearing rehabilitation | Manage persistent dizziness and hearing loss |

---

Labyrinthitis treatment is **multimodal**, emphasizing acute symptom control, early rehabilitation, and targeted management of underlying causes and persistent deficits.

### Clinical outcome after cochlear implantation in patients with unilateral hearing loss due to labyrinthitis ossificans [^43580bf1]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Cochlear implantation (CI) is the treatment of choice in bilateral labyrinthitis ossificans (LO). The aim of this clinical case study was to evaluate audiologic and subjective outcomes after CI treatment for unilateral hearing loss (UHL) because of LO and to identify optimal timing for treatment.

Patients

Three subjects (age 40, 54, and 68 yr) with UHL because of LO were enrolled. Duration of deafness was 1.5, 12, and 120 months.

Intervention

After extensive consultation, testing with conventional contralateral routing of signal hearing aid and bone-anchored hearing instrument, CI candidacy was confirmed and CI surgery performed.

Main Outcome Measures

Test of open-set speech recognition in background noise and sound localization were performed preoperatively, in unaided and aided conditions, and in the CI-aided condition, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Subjective assessment via the Speech, Spatial and Qualities scale (SSQ) and the Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale was performed at preimplant and 12 months postimplant.

Conclusion

The data show moderate-to-high hearing benefit after CI in 2 cases and no benefit for the third. SSQ and tinnitus scales show benefit from CI use in both cases. CI treatment should be performed as early as possible, ideally before signs of obliteration are evident. Counseling on all rehabilitation options is important.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^f741d8c3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Ménière's disease — implementation of patient education states that clinicians should inform patients about MD, symptoms of the condition, and ways to manage those symptoms. Education should include lifestyle modifications, dietary restrictions, anticipated diagnostic testing, and treatment options, and long-term effects of the disease, which include hearing loss, vestibular/balance problems, and tinnitus, should also be discussed. Treatment options should be explained to the patient, with risks and benefits of each option, and before considering highly invasive and ablative surgical procedures such as a labyrinthectomy, patients should be informed that MD does affect the contralateral ear in some patients, which could leave the patient without meaningful hearing or vestibular function. Education should be provided both verbally and in handouts, when available, written at a level that the patient can readily comprehend, and sufficient time should be allowed for patient questions and answers, to promote shared decision making. Ways to implement this process involve providing clear, appropriate, and understandable information regarding MD, discussing treatment options that include diet and lifestyle modifications, medications, IT injections, or potential surgical treatment options, reaching a patient-clinician consensus on an individualized treatment plan, and building a patient-clinician partnership with open communication including encouraging patients to keep journals and stressing continued follow-up.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^092a2a85]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. First-line treatments often involve dietary or lifestyle changes, medication or local (intratympanic) treatments. However, surgery may also be considered for people with persistent or severe symptoms. The efficacy of different surgical interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of surgical interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing ventilation tubes, endolymphatic sac surgery, semi-circular canal plugging/obliteration, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy with either placebo (sham surgery) or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies with a total of 178 participants. One evaluated ventilation tubes compared to no treatment, the other evaluated endolymphatic sac decompression compared to sham surgery. Ventilation tubes We included a single RCT of 148 participants with definite Ménière's disease. It was conducted in a single centre in Japan from 2010 to 2013. Participants either received ventilation tubes with standard medical treatment, or standard medical treatment alone, and were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved, and the effect of the intervention on hearing. Our other primary and secondary outcomes were not reported in this study. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Endolymphatic sac decompression We also included one RCT of 30 participants that compared endolymphatic sac decompression with sham surgery. This was a single-centre study conducted in Denmark during the 1980s. Follow-up was predominantly conducted at one year, but additional follow-up continued for up to nine years in some participants. Some data were reported on hearing and vertigo (both improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo), but our other outcomes of interest were not reported. Again, this is a single, very small study and we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. We are therefore unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are unable to draw clear conclusions about the efficacy of these surgical interventions for Ménière's disease. We identified evidence for only two of our five proposed comparisons, and we assessed all the evidence as low- or very low-certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Many of the outcomes that we planned to assess were not reported by the studies, such as the impact on quality of life, and adverse effects of the interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

Physical Examination Physicians should pay particular attention to physical findings of the neurologic, head and neck, and cardiovascular systems. HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION The tympanic membranes should be examined for vesicles or cholesteatoma. Hennebert's sign indicates the presence of a perilymphatic fistula. 12 Pneumatic otoscopy may cause similar findings. 3 The Valsalva maneuver may cause vertigo in patients with perilymphatic fistulae 12 or anterior semicircular canal dehiscence 12, 23; its clinical diagnostic value, however, is limited.
22.

26Magnetic resonance or conventional angiography of the posterior fossa vasculature may be useful in diagnosing vascular causes of vertigo such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency, thrombosis of the labyrinthine artery, anterior or posterior inferior cerebellar artery insufficiency, and subclavian steal syndrome. 26 Neuroimaging studies can be used to rule out extensive bacterial infections, neoplasms, or developmental abnormalities if other symptoms suggest one of those diagnoses. 26, 27 However, they are not indicated in patients who have BPPV, 26 usually are not necessary to diagnose acute vestibular neuronitis or Ménière's disease, and are poor routine screening tests for cerebellopontine angle tumors causing vertigo. 27 Conventional radiographs or cross-sectional imaging procedures may aid in the diagnosis of cervical vertigo in patients with a history suggestive of this diagnosis.

26; however, the existence of this disorder remains controversial, and most patients in whom this diagnosis is considered should have other, more well-established conditions investigated. 4 Referral Not all patients with vertigo need to be referred to a subspecialist. Family physicians should consider referral to the appropriate subspecialist if the diagnosis of vertigo is unclear or if the patient has a medical problem requiring further subspecialty care.

### Treatment of vertigo [^86eeb016]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vertigo is the illusion of motion, usually rotational motion. As patients age, vertigo becomes an increasingly common presenting complaint. The most common causes of this condition are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders. Less common causes include vertebrobasilar ischemia and retrocochlear tumors. The distinction between peripheral and central vertigo usually can be made clinically and guides management decisions. Most patients with vertigo do not require extensive diagnostic testing and can be treated in the primary care setting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo usually improves with a canalith repositioning procedure. Acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis improves with initial stabilizing measures and a vestibular suppressant medication, followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Meniere's disease often responds to the combination of a low-salt diet and diuretics. Vertiginous migraine headaches generally improve with dietary changes, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Vertigo associated with anxiety usually responds to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

### Current demography and treatment strategy of vestibular migraine in neurotologic perspective [^002ef73a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to describe the demographic features of vestibular migraine (VM) compared to other common peripheral vestibulopathies, and to assess the efficacy of trigger management as primary VM treatment.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Tertiary referral medical center.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of patients presenting with dizziness in a tertiary neurotology clinic. Among the newly diagnosed dizzy patients, those with a diagnosis of either VM, Ménière's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis were selected for comparisons of the disease demographics. VM patients with multiple clinic visits in the study period were included for the treatment strategy analysis.

Results

A total of 1285 patients met the study inclusion criteria. In the newly diagnosed dizzy group comprising 814 patients, VM patients accounted for the largest (25%) and youngest (mean age 47 years) cohort, showing an obvious female preponderance of approximately 3.3:1. Furthermore, prevalence of VM declined significantly with advancing age, from 69%, to 34%, to 11%, in age groups of ≤ 30, 31 to 60, and > 60 years, respectively. Trigger management, when employed as the primary VM first-year treatment, was effective for both sexes. Notably, it was more effective for women aged over than under 45 years.

Conclusion

In our tertiary referral neurotologic center, VM was the most common diagnosis in newly diagnosed dizzy patients aged under 60 years, especially in women. For primary VM treatment, trigger management is an effective option deserving consideration.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^e34cc9fc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) after labyrinthectomy — compensation needs and evidence of benefit are described. Surgical labyrinthectomy converts the system into a unilateral static and permanent vestibular hypofunction leading to acute postural instability, visual blurring with head movement, and subjective dizziness/imbalance, and subsequent central vestibular compensation is required to avoid persistent dizziness/chronic imbalance. Despite definitive surgery, residual imbalance can notably affect QOL and function, and a 2015 Cochrane Database systematic review found a statistically significant difference in favor of VR compared with placebo over time.

### A unified hypothesis for vestibular dysfunction? [^7dfe1072]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

It is our hypothesis that three distinct syndromes of vertigo (ie, labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, and BPPV), which arise from a malfunction of the vestibular labyrinth, are in fact a spectrum of disorders all resulting from the presence of free-floating particles within the vestibular fluid chambers.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^bc84656a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Intratympanic steroid therapy (IT) for active Ménière's disease not responsive to noninvasive treatment — Clinicians may offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, IT steroids; this is an Option based on a systematic review and a randomized controlled trial with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, based on 1 Cochrane review and 1 small RCT looking at dexamethasone and gentamicin with 90% symptom reduction, and the level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefits include improved vertigo control, no risk of hearing loss, less risk of systemic side effects, improved quality of life (QOL; dizziness handicap), and no loss of vestibular function, while risks/costs include cost, perforation, possible need for multiple injections, infection, discomfort of the procedure, and time for treatment; the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note that while this is less definitive than gentamicin therapy, the favorable risk-benefit profile makes this a good option for patients, and intentional vagueness clarifies that noninvasive refers to medical therapy and lifestyle modification; the role of patient preferences is Medium, and differences of opinion included debate over grade B versus grade C with some panel members feeling this should be a recommendation rather than an option. Supporting text notes IT steroid therapy was first described in 1991 and that there have been RCTs and a Cochrane review performed.

### Ménière's disease [^a60f04a6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ménière's disease is characterized by spontaneous attacks of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, aural fullness, and tinnitus. The pathologic process involves distortion of the membranous labyrinth with the formation of endolymphatic hydrops. This review describes the pathogenesis and etiology as well as the diagnosis and treatment of Ménière's disease.

Recent Findings

Initial management of Ménière's disease can involve a low-salt diet and a diuretic. Treatment with intratympanic injection of gentamicin can be beneficial when vertigo persists despite optimal medical management. Recent studies have shown that gentamicin reduces vestibular function in the treated ear, although complete ablation of this vestibular function is not typically required in order to achieve control of vertigo.

Summary

Vertigo is often the most debilitating symptom associated with Ménière's disease. Many treatment options exist for the management of vertigo. Intratympanic injection of gentamicin (low dose) can be used in patients for whom vertigo has not been controlled by medical measures. Ongoing research is providing a greater understanding of the effects of gentamicin on vestibular function and of the mechanisms through which gentamicin leads to control of vertigo.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^d96b6499]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included the following interventions:

Ventilation tubes
Endolymphatic sac decompression and/or shunt or blockage/obliteration
Semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration
Vestibular nerve section
Labyrinthectomy

The main comparisons were as follows:

Ventilation tubes versus placebo/no treatment
Endolymphatic sac decompression and/or shunt or blockage/obliteration versus placebo/no treatment
Semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration versus placebo/no treatment
Vestibular nerve section versus placebo/no treatment
Labyrinthectomy versus placebo/no treatment

Concurrent treatments

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, but this was not necessary.

Types of outcome measures

We assessed outcomes at the following time points:

3 to < 6 months;
6 to ≤ 12 months;
> 12 months.

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow‐up.

We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to Ménière's disease and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify the outcomes that should be prioritised. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review.

We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^40bbdb4c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on 'Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease' (Webster 2021a) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal. We did not find any evidence from randomised controlled trials for three of our planned comparison pairs (semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy versus no treatment or placebo).
We were unable to carry out any meta‐analyses, as a single study contributed to each of our comparisons. Therefore, we were unable to pool data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. In other reviews in this suite, we noted that study authors often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which also prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined, or hearing was assessed using a continuous scale or as an improvement above a certain threshold.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Many studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also often poorly reported or simply not assessed. Many surgical interventions have well‐recognised potential risks, such as infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak or facial nerve injury. However, there was no description of these adverse effects in the included studies. We would expect to see a clear description of adverse events, even if this is simply a statement to acknowledge that no events occurred.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^c85216bc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — differential diagnosis features highlight that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo presents as positional vertigo lasting less than a minute (ie, seconds) and is not associated with hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness, whereas vestibular migraine can have attacks lasting minutes or > 24 hours with hearing loss less likely and migraine history common. Labyrinthitis produces sudden severe vertigo with profound hearing loss and prolonged vertigo (ie, > 24 hours) that is not episodic or fluctuating. Vestibular neuritis reflects a viral infection leading to acute prolonged vertigo with prolonged nausea and vomiting without hearing loss, with table notes that severe rotational vertigo lasts 12 to 36 hours with decreasing disequilibrium for the next 4 to 5 days. Stroke/ischemia may cause vertigo lasting minutes with nausea, vomiting, severe imbalance and drop attacks, with deficits often permanent and nonfluctuating.

### The genetics of ataxia: through the labyrinth of the minotaur, looking for ariadne's thread [^00d9ff3b]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

How to treat ataxia

Apart from the availability of specific treatment options for some of the diseases discussed above, treatment of degenerative CA remains very difficult. To date, no medication has been proven effective. Aminopyridines and acetazolamide, which are beneficial in patients with episodic ataxia type 2, are the only exception. Aminopyridines are also effective in a subset of patients presenting with downbeat nystagmus. Acetyl — leucine could improve ataxic symptoms in some patients, but controlled trials are still needed. The mainstays of treatment for degenerative CA are currently physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, but evidence-based guidelines for the physiotherapy of degenerative CA need to be developed.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^b93248fa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Management of Ménière's disease — treatment goals and selection emphasize that the goals of MD treatment are to prevent or at least reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo attacks and to relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness and improve overall quality of life; notably, some vertigo control (up to 60%) has been documented in the placebo groups of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Some of the traditional treatment approaches for MD include dietary/lifestyle and/or trigger management approaches, medical, surgical, complementary/alternative, allergy, immunomodulatory, vestibular, and aural therapy, and oral or intratympanic (IT) medications — all with variable results. For those MD patients with persistent and disabling attacks after several months of conservative therapy, other more invasive or involved treatments can be considered, and treatment choice is guided by hearing status: in those patients with usable hearing, nonablative procedures have been advocated, whereas in those patients with no meaningful/useful hearing, surgical or chemical inner ear ablative treatments are implemented.

### Meniere's disease: medical management, rationale for vestibular preservation and suggested protocol in medical failure [^eb962f64]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Meniere's disease is a peripheral audiovestibular disorder characterized by vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Management of these symptoms includes medical and surgical treatment. Many patients with Meniere's disease can be managed using nonablative therapy, such as intratympanic steroids and endolymphatic shunt surgery, prior to ablative techniques such as intratympanic gentamicin. Recognition of concurrent migraine symptoms may aid in medical therapy and also underscore the importance of preserving vestibular function where possible. The goal of this review is to explain the importance of nonablative therapy options and discuss treatment protocols after medical failure.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^a3079fbc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — labyrinthectomy procedure and vertigo control — labyrinthectomy, most commonly performed via a transmastoid approach, is a definitive surgical procedure that attempts to abolish abnormal vestibular input in a diseased ear, and the goal of labyrinthectomy is to completely remove the abnormal sensory neuroepithelial elements of the semicircular canals and otolith organs that are believed to cause vertigo episodes in MD patients. The success rate for relieving vertigo is estimated to be > 95%, and the success rate of > 95% is supported by 3 large case series. In one case series, Diaz et al evaluated vertigo control in 44 MD patients who underwent labyrinthectomy and classified vertigo control with class A representing no episodes of vertigo within a 6-month period that occurred 18 to 24 months following an intervention, and in this case series, 97% of patients (31 of 32) reported complete control of vertigo, with the remaining 12 patients less than 18 to 24 months following therapy. Another case series looked at 110 patients with nonusable hearing and persistent labyrinthine disability who underwent transmastoid labyrinthectomy, more than half of these patients (n = 64) had MD, nonusable hearing was defined as a PTA > 60 dB and a speech discrimination score ≤ 50%, and postoperative assessment of vertigo control occurred between 3 and 10 years following transmastoid labyrinthectomy.

### How to find the ariadne's thread in the labyrinth of salvage treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer? [^a7579e96]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Since a chance for cure was found out in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients undergoing a resection of liver and lung metastases, high tumor shrinkage by chemotherapy regimens and their combination with targeted agents have been addressed in potentially resectable mCRC. However, most mCRC patients cannot reach this opportunity because of tumor burden or metastatic sites. For these patients a salvage systemic therapy could be offered to prolong survival. To date, a huge number of clinical trials provided some evidences for the achievement of this goal. A lot of chemotherapeutic regimens in combination with biological therapies are now available. We tried to propose a simple way to choose the best options and to plan an optimal sequence of treatments. This tool could help the oncologists worldwide to better and easily manage mCRC patients who need salvage systemic therapy.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^a86f6ad2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

As there are instances when symptomatic treatment with vestibular suppressants is helpful, we likely observed a mix of appropriate and inappropriate prescribing in our cohort. In the first several days of an acute vestibular crisis, as results from vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, patients can experience debilitating spontaneous vertigo that improves as vestibular compensation occurs. Other disorders, such as Meneire's disease, result in hours‐long vertigo attacks. In such instances, or before a diagnosis is reached, it may be appropriate to provide a short course of medication for relief of intense symptoms. However, longer‐term use of vestibular suppressants delays or prevents vestibular compensation and may promote symptom chronicity. Recently, a meta‐analysis determined that, for relief of acute vertigo, single‐dose meclizine is more effective than benzodiazepines; further, benzodiazepines are not associated with an improvement in outcomes for acute vertigo over placebo. These findings argue for the de‐implementation of benzodiazepines for acute vertigo. Further, clinical practice guidelines specifically recommend against the use of vestibular suppressants for the most common form of peripheral vertigo, BPPV. Nevertheless, among individuals with a diagnosis of BPPV, 43% received a vestibular suppressant, emphasizing that use is not restricted to indicated diagnoses (Figure 1). Rather, patients should be offered canalith repositioning procedures by the evaluating clinician or by referral to Physical Therapy (PT) or another capable provider. Alternatively, patients may be able to receive information about these procedures through patient education materials at the time of discharge from the emergency department or primary care clinic even if specialty clinic or physical therapist is not available.

### Vestibular dysfunction in patients with sickle cell disease: a systematic review [^1f439151]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) often leads to sensorineural hearing loss due to vaso-occlusive events in the cochlear vasculature. Although the vestibule and cochlea share a blood supply, information on vestibulopathy in SCD is limited. This systematic review aims to consolidate current knowledge on vestibular dysfunction in SCD patients.

Methods

This study, registered on PROSPERO, involved a thorough electronic search using MEDLINE-Ovid, Embase, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases from inception to December 2023. Data extraction adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Authors independently assessed bias and evidence quality using NIH Study Quality Assessment tools. Inclusion criteria covered articles mentioning vestibular symptoms in SCD patients, whereas exclusion criteria comprised non-English articles and vestibular symptoms limited to treatment side effects.

Results

Out of 2,495 studies, only 12 met the criteria. Among SCD patients undergoing head imaging, 19% reported inner ear complaints, and 70% experienced dizziness/imbalance. In a group of SCD children, there was a significant relationship between endothelial dysfunction and vertigo duration. The recommended imaging sequence was T1-weighted thin-section temporal bone MRIs, which revealed abnormal findings even without clinical symptoms. Imaging showed labyrinthine hemorrhage and labyrinthitis ossificans, mostly unilateral. Vestibular symptoms emerged with older age, suggesting cortical compensation kept most subjects asymptomatic. In asymptomatic adult SCD patients, there was no significant difference compared with controls in tracking test batteries and positional tests; however, saccadic latency was longer in SCD patients.

Conclusion

The existing data on vestibulopathy in SCD were limited and often of poor quality. Although a connection between SCD and vestibular symptoms was noted, information on treatment approaches was scant. Further research in this area could contribute to the early diagnosis of vestibular dysfunction, potentially enhancing outcomes for SCD patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^fe9c9863]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Statement 16. Patient outcomes — Clinicians should document resolution, improvement, or worsening of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss and any change in quality of life in patients with Ménière's disease after treatment. Recommendation based on the controlled arms of RCTs, outcomes from RCTs, cohort studies, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity is that tracking outcomes of therapy provides an opportunity for modification of management to optimize outcomes. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence in evidence is Medium due to Grade C evidence. Benefits are opportunity to adjust for more effective therapy, possibility of more accurate diagnosis, opportunity for hearing rehabilitation, and patient engagement; risks, harms, and costs are cost and time of visits. Benefit-harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harms; policy level is Recommendation. Intentional vagueness is that the word symptoms can refer to vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or pressure depending on what is of most concern to the patient; the role of patient preferences is Medium, as some patients with subjectively adequate disease control may choose not to follow up.

### Sudden hearing loss [^7e779a62]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency in search of an appropriate treatment. Almost all aspects of this disease process are disputed in the literature. The natural course of the disease process has not been well defined, although spontaneous recovery in a percentage of patients appears well accepted. Little scientific data exist to develop an evidence-based treatment protocol. The more common elements of treatment in the United States include oral steroid therapy, transtympanic steroid therapy, and potentially oral antiviral therapy. Other therapies are used with great frequency, and their potential should not be discounted.

### Pharmacology of vertigo / nystagmus / oscillopsia [^641a317c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe recent developments in the pharmacological treatment of vertigo and nystagmus while focusing on vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, downbeat nystagmus, periodic alternating nystagmus, acquired pendular nystagmus, and superior oblique myokymia.

Recent Findings

In the last 2 years several studies have been published on possible pharmacological treatment options for nystagmus and oscillopsia. In the treatment of vestibular neuritis two studies showed that cortisone treatment was effective for restoring labyrinthine function. This benefit seems more likely if treatment is started within the first 2 days of onset. For recurrent vertigo attacks due to Meniere's disease, the titration technique with daily or weekly doses of intratympanic gentamicin until onset of vestibular symptoms, change in vertigo or hearing loss rated best for complete vertigo control. A new pharmacological treatment option for downbeat nystagmus is the administration of potassium channel blockers (e.g. 4-aminopyridine). They are thought to reinforce the inhibitory action of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Several case reports have proven the beneficial effect of baclofen on periodic alternating nystagmus, of gabapentin and memantine on acquired pendular nystagmus, and of carbamazepine and gabapentin on superior oblique myokymia.

Summary

There have been several new developments in the treatment of nystagmus and vertigo over the last 2 years. These include potassium channel blockers for the treatment of downbeat nystagmus, early cortisone treatment to improve recovery of the labyrinth function in vestibular neuritis, and intratympanic gentamicin treatment for Meniere's disease. Other pharmacological treatment options are baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus, gabapentin and memantine for acquired pendular nystagmus, and carbamazepine for superior oblique myokymia.

### Chemical and physical labyrinthectomy for meniere's disease [^44560a84]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The use of intratympanic gentamicin is currently a popular and easily performed office procedure for the conservative treatment of the Meniere's disease patient who has failed medical therapy or who is not a candidate for surgical therapy. The procedure provides excellent control for the symptom of vertigo. Despite this success, there remains a significant risk of hearing loss irrespective of administered dose. In the future, antioxidant [42,43] or salicylate therapy may prevent aminoglycoside toxicity [44]. These prophylaxis methods have shown promise in the laboratory. Current methods do not allow for accurate drug delivery to the inner ear. Middle ear mucosal status, round window thickness or adhesion, patency of eustachian tube, and the effect of endolymphatic hydrops on ototoxicity are factors simply out of the control of the operator's hands. Judging by the number of recent articles, intratympanic gentamicin instillation will continue to be an area of interest for the otologist. Users should be encouraged to be consistent and conservative in gentamicin dosing. It is clear that vestibular ablation is not necessary for adequate control of vestibular symptoms and that larger doses may increase the risk of hearing loss. American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines [45] should be used and adhered to for reporting on the treatment of Meniere's disease, so that the literature may be more comparable. In the same light, a prospective standardized trial would be helpful in determining ultimate efficacy and risk to the patient. Transmastoid labyrinthectomy remains the surgical standard for extirpating the offending labyrinth when hearing preservation is not an issue. In appropriate patients, the procedure is a safe and effective method for relieving patients of vertiginous attacks. Most patients tolerate the procedure very well and are able to compensate fairly well over the course of several weeks to months.

### Pharmacologic manipulation of the labyrinth with novel and traditional agents delivered to the inner ear [^5f248b74]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2003). Low credibility.

We describe the methodology and rationale behind the delivery of therapeutic medicines to the inner ear. The inner ear has long been impervious to pharmacologic manipulation. This is most likely the result of a protective mechanism called the blood-labyrinth barrier, whose function closely resembles that of the blood-brain barrier. This protective barrier impedes the clinician's ability to treat inner ear diseases with systemically administered medications. Since 1935, otolaryngologists have attempted to manipulate the inner ear with trans-tympanically injected medicines. Success has varied widely, but medicinal ablation of vestibular function can be achieved in this manner. Unfortunately, the auditory system is also at great risk from any medicine that is delivered to the inner ear via the middle ear. Over the past 10 years, significant improvements in drug delivery have allowed for more "titratable" treatment, which has reduced (but not eliminated) the risk of permanent hearing loss. In this article, we discuss both novel and time-tested methods of delivering medicines to the inner ear. We also review the classes of medications that alter inner ear function and the attendant risks of such treatments.

Pneumolabyrinth, the presence of air within the labyrinth, is a rare radiologic finding associated with a well-known perilymphatic fistula (PLF). As there are only 24 published case reports in medical literature, multiple treatment options for the pneumolabyrinth are available. We report a case of a 20-year-old man with a pneumolabyrinth secondary to tympanic membrane and ossicular trauma. Despite conservative treatment, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) had progressed rapidly, and his profound deafness had not recovered after surgical exploration with closure of the PLF. Functional prognostic factors of SNHL are revised and compared with this case.

### Medical management of Ménière's disease [^90a64987]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ménière's disease (MD) is poorly understood with respect to its etiology, pathophysiology, clinical course, and treatment. Furthermore, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, empiric treatments have been used with varying degrees of success. In this paper, the authors review the current medical management of MD.

Study Design

Literature review.

Results

Because of a dearth of well-controlled studies, the medical management of MD remains empirical and is largely restricted to lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, and office-based procedures. The development of transtympanic therapies represents a true therapeutic advance that has largely supplanted surgical intervention. A treatment algorithm for acute and chronic medical management is reviewed.

Conclusions

Despite absence of a complete understanding of MD, medical management or its natural history leads to control of vertigo in the majority of patients. Basic research is needed to understand its pathophysiology so that directed therapies can be developed and can be tested in well-controlled clinical trials.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^f8e4a1f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness).

Although Ménière's disease is a relatively uncommon condition, the significant impact it has on quality of life demonstrates the clear importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate the symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first‐line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options, to support people with Ménière's disease (and healthcare professionals) when making decisions about their care.

### Emergency department vestibular rehabilitation therapy for dizziness and vertigo: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^768cd0ba]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Intervention

Participants received either the ED-VeRT intervention or usual care at the discretion of the treating ED physician. Patients and physicians were therefore unblinded to treatment allocation. Usual care consisted of any testing or treatment not involving the ED physical therapist in accordance with the treating physicians' usual and customary practice. This could include physical examination, therapeutic maneuvers, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing, medication administration and/or prescribing, and patient education or reassurance.

The ED-VeRT intervention consisted of a formal evaluation by an ED physical therapist who administered a protocolized diagnostic classification and treatment algorithm for dizziness and vertigo (Figure 1). The Northwestern Memorial Hospital maintains a full-time ED physical therapist for the evaluation and treatment of patients with various clinical conditions. The ED-VeRT algorithm classifies patients into 1 of 4 possible diagnostic categories based on key history and examination findings: BPPV, triggered undifferentiated dizziness, spontaneous undifferentiated dizziness, and unilateral peripheral hypofunction (eg, neuritis, labyrinthitis). The algorithm was developed from the Newman-Toker algorithmbased on symptom timing, triggers, and targeted bedside eye examinations and initially branches based on a determination of triggered (episodic) vs spontaneous nystagmus, with subsequent positional testing for BPPV (eg, Dix-Hallpike, Roll Test) or HINTS+ examination (HINTS plus hearing) for the triggered and BPPV nystagmus types. Each diagnostic classification maps to a corresponding treatment (ie, Epley maneuver for BPPV, trial of glucocorticoids for unilateral peripheral hypofunction), and classifications that might benefit from additional vestibular rehabilitation are provided with a referral to outpatient vestibular therapy. For diagnostic classifications without specific treatment maneuvers (spontaneous undifferentiated dizziness, triggered undifferentiated dizziness), the ED physical therapist recommends referral to outpatient neurology services for further evaluation of diagnoses that require additional testing or longer symptom duration (eg, vestibular migraine). The ED-VeRT algorithm additionally accounts for atypical findings that would prompt the ED physical therapist to discuss additional testing (eg, orthostatic vitals, neuroimaging) with the treating ED physician. All patients receive balance screening, education on fall prevention and safety, guidance on expected symptom trajectory, and referral to outpatient vestibular therapy.

BPPV indicates benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; CRM, canal repositioning maneuvering; HINTS+, head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew plus hearing; PT, physical therapy.

### Acute labyrinthitis: a manifestation of COVID-19 in a teenager [^42a270af]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Audiovestibular symptoms following COVID-19 have been long acknowledged, especially in adults. However, acute labyrinthitis presenting as an early manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported in children. We report COVID-19-induced acute labyrinthitis in a teenager. We report on a boy in his early adolescence with a sudden onset of spinning sensation, imbalance and unilateral hearing loss with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Vestibular investigations point towards right labyrinthine hypofunction, and an audiometry test revealed right-sided severe hearing loss. Symptoms improved gradually with steroids and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. However, the long-term repercussions of post-COVID-19 acute labyrinthitis are unknown and must be followed up closely. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute labyrinthitis secondary to COVID-19 in paediatrics. Additionally, we conducted a literature search to elucidate the outcome of COVID-19-induced acute vestibular syndrome in children.

### Vestibulocochlear delineation for vestibular schwannoma treated with radiation therapy [^de8cca86]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radiation therapy is an option for the management of vestibular schwannoma (VS). Moreover, ablative treatments have become more common and can be performed in 1 to 5 fractions. Reports of sensorineural hearing loss vary between 50% and 70%, but data are controversial. Systematic analyses report better results of retained hearing with doses received by vestibulocochlear apparatus less than 12.5 Gy. The dose range can vary between 11 and 16 Gy when treated with ablative doses.

To ensure the preservation of the organs at risk (OAR), the precise contouring of them is mandatory. Because of its proximity to the VS, vestibulocochlear contouring requires discussion. There are few contouring guidelines published, and most of them are OAR guidelines for cancers of the head and neck.

The vestibulocochlear system consists of the vestibule, cochlea, semicircular canals, vestibular aqueduct, and cochlear aqueduct. The vestibule contains the utricle and therefore the saccule. There are 3 semicircular canals, the superior, lateral, and posterior. The space between the bony labyrinth and structure contains a fluid called perilymph. The same fluid (endolymph) fills the space within the body structure, (Fig. 1).

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^1bf48ce9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of definite or probable Ménière's disease, according to the agreed criteria of the American Academy Otolaryngology ‐ Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS), the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Bárány Society. These criteria are outlined in Appendix 1 and described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015.

If studies used different criteria to diagnose Ménière's disease, we included them if those criteria were clearly analogous to those described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015. For example, studies that used earlier definitions of Ménière's disease (from the AAO‐HNS guidelines of 1995) were also included. If there was uncertainty over the criteria used for the study, then we made a decision on whether to include the study. This decision was taken by authors who were masked to other features of the studies (such as study size, other aspects of methodology, results of the study) to avoid the introduction of bias in study selection. If a study was conducted in an ENT department and participants were diagnosed with Ménière's disease then we considered it was likely that other diagnoses had been excluded, and included the study. However, we reflected this uncertainty in diagnosis by considering the study at risk of indirectness when using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence (see 'Summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence').

We anticipated that most studies would include participants with active Ménière's disease. We did not exclude studies if the frequency of attacks at baseline was not reported or was unclear, but we planned to highlight if there were differences between studies that may impact on our ability to pool the data, or affect the applicability of our findings.

We excluded studies where participants had previously undergone destructive/ablative treatment for Ménière's disease in the affected ear (such as vestibular neurectomy, chemical or surgical labyrinthectomy), as we considered that they were unlikely to respond to interventions in the same way as those who had not undergone such treatment.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^e2f70642]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Various theories to explain ISSNHL have been proposed, for example viral infection, vascular occlusion, breakdown of labyrinthine membranes or barriers, immune‐mediated mechanisms (Vambutas 2021) and abnormal cellular stress responses within the cochlea. However, none of these hypotheses has been proven convincingly in humans (Merchant 2005; Merchant 2008).

Treatment modalities for ISSNHL are mostly based on the above etiopathogenetic hypotheses and include (gluco)corticosteroids, rheological drugs (e.g. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, pentoxifylline and naftidrofuryl), vasodilators, anaesthetics, osmotically active substances, antioxidants, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors, fibrinogen reduction through drugs or apheresis or rheopheresis (Suckfüll 2002), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, immunosuppressants, anti‐apoptotic substances (Suckfuell 2014), and other substances (see reviews in: Conlin 2007a; Labus 2010; Lawrence 2015; Plontke 2005). Cochrane Reviews have assessed treatment of ISSNHL with systemic corticosteroids (Wei 2006; Wei 2013), hyperbaric oxygen (Bennett 2007; Bennett 2012), and vasodilators (Agarwal 2009), without demonstrating clear efficacy.

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used for ISSNHL worldwide (Plontke 2005). A Cochrane Review on systemic corticosteroids for ISSNHL found that there was uncertainty about the value of corticosteroids in the treatment of ISSNHL, "since the evidence from randomised controlled trials is contradictory in outcome, in part because the studies are based upon too small a number of patients" (Wei 2006). These findings were supported by another meta‐analysis (Conlin 2007b). The updated version of the Cochrane Review also included a randomised, placebo‐controlled, multicentre trial published in 2012 comparing the effect of prednisolone and placebo (Nosrati‐Zarenoe 2012); again the review found that there was uncertainty about the value of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment ISSNHL (Wei 2013).

Endolymphatic sac surgery — efficacy and complications: Approximately 80% to 90% of patients have total or substantial vertigo control at 2 years, but outcomes decline over time, with approximately 60% having total or substantial control at 5 years and further decline at 10-year follow-up. Therapeutic results of surgical modifications are essentially equivalent. Regardless of the method, the procedure is of low risk with < 2% incidence of complete sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and rare complications include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, facial paralysis, vertigo, and wound infection.

### Pseudomonas labyrinthitis complicating acute otitis media: case report [^131c0b74]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Bacterial labyrinthitis has been rarely described. Pseudomonas incrimination is even exceptional. Herein, we present a case of pseudomonas labyrinthitis and discuss diagnosis, value of imaging, treatment and prognosis of this entity. Case Report: A 18-year-old female presented with left sudden hearing loss, rotatory vertigo, vomiting, and tinnitus evolving for 24 hours. Ten days earlier, she presented symptoms of acute media otitis. Otoendoscopic examination revealed a tympanic perforation with purulent otorrhea. Vestibular examination revealed a harmonious peripheric vestibular syndrome. A tonal audiogram showed a left perceptive deafness. A temporal computed tomography scan showed left opacity of the middle ear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excluded cholesteatomatous otitis, and constructive interference steady state (CISS) sequence revealed intense labyrinthine enhancement. Otorrhea sample culture isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She initially received probabilistic intravenous antibiotherapy associating cefotaxime to vancomycin for 17 days, then, we switched to adapt to the antibiogram. She had a total of 25 days of antibiotic therapy and 14 days of corticosteroid treatment. She also benefited of vestibular rehabilitation and hyperbaric oxygenotherapy. The dizziness subsided, but the deafness persisted. Conclusion: Labyrinthitis is increasingly rare in the era of antibiotic therapy. P. aeruginosa is an exceptional germ in this context. MRI is an indispensable tool for the positive and the differential diagnosis.

Table 9 — common causes of acute dizziness by timing and triggers categorizes conditions into acute vestibular syndrome, triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, and chronic vestibular syndrome. Definitions specify: acute vestibular syndrome is acute persistent continuous dizziness lasting days to weeks and usually associated with nausea, vomiting, and intolerance to head motion; triggered episodic vestibular syndrome is episodic dizziness triggered by specific and obligate actions, usually a change in head or body position, with episodes that generally last < 1 minute; spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome is episodic dizziness that is not triggered and that can last minutes to hours; chronic vestibular syndrome is dizziness lasting weeks to months or longer. Representative causes include: acute vestibular syndrome — vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, posterior circulation stroke, demyelinating diseases, posttraumatic vertigo; triggered episodic vestibular syndrome — benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, postural hypotension, perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, central paroxysmal positional vertigo; spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome — vestibular migraine, Ménière's disease, posterior circulation transient ischemic attack, medication side effects, anxiety or panic disorder; and chronic vestibular syndrome — anxiety or panic disorder, medication side effects, posttraumatic vertigo, posterior fossa mass lesions, cervicogenic vertigo (variable).

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^70eb1975]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that causes death, is life‐threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. We therefore extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^9dedcb29]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition (through the tympanic membrane). The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects (including tympanic membrane perforation). We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 10 studies with a total of 952 participants. All studies used the corticosteroid dexamethasone, with doses ranging from approximately 2 mg to 12 mg.

Improvement in vertigo

Intratympanic corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the number of people who report an improvement in their vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months follow‐up (intratympanic corticosteroids 96.8%, placebo 96.6%, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.10; 2 studies; 60 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or at more than 12 months follow‐up (intratympanic corticosteroids 100%, placebo 96.3%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; 2 studies; 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, we note the large improvement in the placebo group for these trials, which causes challenges in interpreting these results.

Change in vertigo

Assessed with a global score

One study (44 participants) assessed the change in vertigo at 3 to < 6 months using a global score, which considered the frequency, duration and severity of vertigo. This is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Assessed by frequency of vertigo

Three studies (304 participants) assessed the change in frequency of vertigo episodes at 3 to < 6 months. Intratympanic corticosteroids may slightly reduce the frequency of vertigo episodes. The proportion of days affected by vertigo was 0.05 lower (absolute difference ‐5%) in those receiving intratympanic corticosteroids (95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.02; 3 studies; 472 participants; low‐certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a difference of approximately 1.5 days fewer per month affected by vertigo in the corticosteroid group (with the control group having vertigo on approximately 2.5 to 3.5 days per month at the end of follow‐up, and those receiving corticosteroids having vertigo on approximately 1 to 2 days per month). However, this result should be interpreted with caution ‐ we are aware of unpublished data at this time point in which corticosteroids failed to show a benefit over placebo.

One study also assessed the change in frequency of vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months follow‐up. However, this is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Serious adverse events

Four studies reported this outcome. There may be little or no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events with intratympanic corticosteroids, but the evidence is very uncertain (intratympanic corticosteroids 3.0%, placebo 4.4%; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.85; 4 studies; 500 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for intratympanic corticosteroids in the treatment of Ménière's disease is uncertain. There are relatively few published RCTs, which all consider the same type of corticosteroid (dexamethasone). We also have concerns about publication bias in this area, with the identification of two large RCTs that remain unpublished. The evidence comparing intratympanic corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment is therefore all low‐ or very low‐certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area, and enable meta‐analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits. Finally, we would also highlight the responsibility that trialists have to ensure results are available, regardless of the outcome of their study.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease executive summary [^a6d4f8f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many, and approaches typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal.

### Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome [^d201923b]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) syndrome is an increasingly recognized cause of vestibular and/or auditory symptoms in both adults and children. These symptoms are believed to result from the presence of a pathological mobile "third window" into the labyrinth due to deficiency in the osseous shell, leading to inadvertent hydroacoustic transmissions through the cochlea and labyrinth. The most common bony defect of the superior canal is found over the arcuate eminence, with rare cases involving the posteromedial limb of the superior canal associated with the superior petrosal sinus. Operative intervention is indicated for intractable or debilitating symptoms that persist despite conservative management and vestibular sedation. Surgical repair can be accomplished by reconstruction or plugging of the bony defect or reinforcement of the round window through a variety of operative approaches. The authors review the etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, surgical options, and outcomes in the treatment of this entity, with a focus on potential pitfalls that may be encountered during clinical management.

### Current and emerging medical therapies for dizziness [^b90ba3fa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical therapies for dizziness are aimed at vertigo reduction, secondary symptom management, or the root cause of the pathologic process. Acute peripheral vertigo pharmacotherapies include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic pharmacotherapies vary between causes. For Meniere disease, betahistine and diuretics remain initial first-line oral options, whereas intratympanic steroids and intratympanic gentamicin are reserved for uncontrolled symptoms. For cerebellar dizziness and oculomotor disorders, 4-aminopyridine may provide benefit. For vestibular migraine, persistent postural perceptual dizziness and mal de débarquement, treatment options overlap and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and calcium channel blockers.

Systemic versus intratympanic (IT) steroids as initial therapy — comparative efficacy: A systematic review found no overall advantage of IT steroids over systemic steroids, and the largest multicenter RCT (n = 250) showed hearing at 2 months did not differ between prednisone 60 mg/d for 14 days and 4 doses of IT methylprednisolone 40 mg/mL over 14 days. Some analyses suggest potential benefit of combination therapy (mean difference 13 dB), and early IT use within 7 days was associated with 20-dB PTA and 30% speech discrimination improvement, although modeling indicates the apparent early-treatment effect is likely a "sham effect", and final hearing depended on severity rather than drug, dose, frequency, or duration.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^89bb9668]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease (Webster 2021b) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. Although we identified five studies for inclusion, there were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, or the time points for follow‐up. Therefore, we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Finally, study authors often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined, or hearing was assessed using a continuous scale or as an improvement above a certain threshold.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Many studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also often poorly reported or simply not assessed.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^4e3fba30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Aminoglycosides are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition. The aim of this treatment is to partially or completely destroy the balance function of the affected ear. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic aminoglycosides versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic aminoglycosides with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included five RCTs with a total of 137 participants. All studies compared the use of gentamicin to either placebo or no treatment. Due to the very small numbers of participants in these trials, and concerns over the conduct and reporting of some studies, we considered all the evidence in this review to be very low‐certainty.

Improvement in vertigo

This outcome was assessed by only two studies, and they used different time periods for reporting. Improvement in vertigo was reported by more participants who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (16/16 participants who received gentamicin, compared to 0/16 participants with no intervention; risk ratio (RR) 33.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 507; 1 study; 32 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and at > 12 months follow‐up (12/12 participants receiving gentamicin, compared to 6/10 participants receiving placebo; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.69; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). However, we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis for this outcome, the certainty of the evidence was very low and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the results.

Change in vertigo

Again, two studies assessed this outcome, but used different methods of measuring vertigo and assessed the outcome at different time points. We were therefore unable to carry out any meta‐analysis or draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Global scores of vertigo were lower for those who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐1 point, 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.32; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; four‐point scale; minimally clinically important difference presumed to be one point) and at > 12 months (MD ‐1.8 points, 95% CI ‐2.49 to ‐1.11; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Vertigo frequency was also lower at > 12 months for those who received gentamicin (0 attacks per year in participants receiving gentamicin compared to 11 attacks per year for those receiving placebo; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events

None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for the use of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of Ménière's disease is very uncertain. This is primarily due to the fact that there are few published RCTs in this area, and all the studies we identified enrolled a very small number of participants. As the studies assessed different outcomes, using different methods, and reported at different time points, we were not able to pool the results to obtain more reliable estimates of the efficacy of this treatment. More people may report an improvement in vertigo following gentamicin treatment, and scores of vertigo symptoms may also improve. However, the limitations of the evidence mean that we cannot be sure of these effects. Although there is the potential for intratympanic gentamicin to cause harm (for example, hearing loss) we did not find any information about the risks of treatment in this review.

Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Transtympanic management of tinnitus [^57e481c8]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Transtympanic therapy is becoming and important treatment modality for many inner ear disorders. The current therapies aimed at Meniere's disease, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss, and the tinnitus associated with these disorders and idiopathic tinnitus, however, represents simply an evolutionary step in this treatment modality and must be validated by further scientific study. A number of promising developments including newer more targeted neuroactive medicines, a better understanding of medicine delivery, and the knowledge of the site, origin, and pathophysiology of the symptoms complex will make this therapy more effective. In the future it is possible that many inner ear disorders will be amenable to inner ear medical therapy. Ideally in the future with knowledge of the disease and its etiology the physician will simply pick the established medicine, the established dose, and the established route of administration and achieve a relatively predictable result.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^a0b7d8bf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Aminoglycosides are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition. The aim of this treatment is to partially or completely destroy the balance function of the affected ear. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic aminoglycosides versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic aminoglycosides with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with a total of 137 participants. All studies compared the use of gentamicin to either placebo or no treatment. Due to the very small numbers of participants in these trials, and concerns over the conduct and reporting of some studies, we considered all the evidence in this review to be very low-certainty.

However, we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis for this outcome, the certainty of the evidence was very low and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Change in vertigo Again, two studies assessed this outcome, but used different methods of measuring vertigo and assessed the outcome at different time points. We were therefore unable to carry out any meta-analysis or draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Global scores of vertigo were lower for those who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (mean difference (MD) -1 point, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.32; 1 study; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence; four-point scale; minimally clinically important difference presumed to be one point) and at > 12 months (MD -1.8 points, 95% CI -2.49 to -1.11; 1 study; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Vertigo frequency was also lower at > 12 months for those who received gentamicin (0 attacks per year in participants receiving gentamicin compared to 11 attacks per year for those receiving placebo; 1 study; 22 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^5af65fc1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of participants

We included studies that recruited adult participants (aged 18 years or older) with a diagnosis of definite or probable Ménière's disease, according to the agreed criteria of the American Academy Otolaryngology ‐ Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS), the Japan Society for Equilibrium Research, the European Academy of Otology and Neurotology and the Bárány Society. These criteria are outlined in Appendix 1 and described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015.

If studies used different criteria to diagnose Ménière's disease, we included them if those criteria were clearly analogous to those described in Lopez‐Escamez 2015. For example, studies that used earlier definitions of Ménière's disease (from the AAO‐HNS guidelines of 1995) were also included. If there was uncertainty over the criteria used for the study, then a decision was made on whether to include the study. This decision was taken by authors who were masked to other features of the studies (such as study size, other aspects of methodology, results of the study) to avoid the introduction of bias in study selection. If a study was conducted in an ENT department and participants were diagnosed with Ménière's disease then we considered it was likely that other diagnoses had been excluded and included the study. However, we reflected this uncertainty in diagnosis by considering the study at risk of indirectness when using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence (see 'Summary of findings and assessment of certainty of the evidence').

We anticipated that most studies would include participants with active Ménière's disease. We did not exclude studies if the frequency of attacks at baseline was not reported or was unclear, but we planned to highlight if there were differences between studies that may impact on our ability to pool the data, or affect the applicability of our findings.

We excluded studies where participants had previously undergone destructive/ablative treatment for Ménière's disease in the affected ear (such as vestibular neurectomy, chemical or surgical labyrinthectomy), as we considered that they were unlikely to respond to interventions in the same way as those who had not undergone such treatment.

### Dizziness and COVID-19 [^a7082821]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Summary of Characteristics and Main Findings of COVID-19 Patients With Dizziness.

Dizziness, albeit a nonspecific COVID-19 symptom, requires thorough investigation notably to determine its leading cause including, acute labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, acute otitis media, or secondary to stroke following COVID-19.

We would like to emphasize that dizziness should not be taken lightly as it has been proven to be a notable clinical manifestation among COVID-19 patients. Parallel to that, association with other audiovestibular manifestations such as hearing loss and tinnitus ought to be determined. Persistent dizziness posttreatment from COVID-19 requires referral to the Otorhinolaryngology Department for thorough examination and investigation. Additionally, we recommend vestibular rehabilitation therapy, which has revealed promising results, to be carried out for stable COVID-19 patients with dizziness. Lastly, it is imperative that attending physicians remain vigilant, especially when managing nonspecific symptoms such as dizziness, as it can be easily overlooked.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^512e6988]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high certainty. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of these factors:

Study limitations (risk of bias) This was assessed using the rating from the Cochrane risk of bias tool for the study or studies included in the analysis. We rated down either one or two levels, depending on the number of domains that had been rated at high or unclear risk of bias.
Inconsistency This was assessed using the I 2 statistic and the P value for heterogeneity for all meta‐analyses, as well as by visual inspection of the forest plot. For results based on a single study we rated this domain as no serious inconsistency.
Indirectness of evidence We took into account whether there were concerns over the population included in these study or studies for each outcome, as well as whether additional treatments were offered that may impact on the efficacy of the intervention under consideration.
Imprecision We took into account the sample size and the width of the confidence interval for each outcome. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size (i.e. < 400 people for continuous outcomes or < 300 events for dichotomous outcomes), or the confidence interval crossed the small effect threshold we rated down one level. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size and the confidence interval included both potential harm and potential benefit we rated down twice. We also rated down twice for very tiny studies (e.g. 10 to 15 participants in each arm), regardless of the estimated confidence interval.
Publication bias We considered whether there were likely to be unpublished studies that may impact on our confidence in the results obtained.

### Imaging of cranial nerves: a pictorial overview [^67a4a9be]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis

Vestibular neuritis presents as unilateral acute vertigo without hearing loss. Nausea and vomiting are also associated. It affects young and mid-adults with no sexual preponderance. The etiology is various. Viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections have been reported, but also allergic and autoimmune causes are described. Inflammation of the vestibular nerve may be complicated by demyelination, with loss of function, not always reversible. MRI shows hyperintensity of the cisternal tract of the vestibular nerve on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences with enhancement on post-gadolinium images (Fig. 27). Acute labyrinthitis is similar to vestibular neuritis with associated hearing loss and tinnitus.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^cdaf0cba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We largely assessed the certainty of the evidence in this review as low or very low. There was moderate‐certainty evidence for a small number of outcomes, but we identified no high‐certainty evidence. The main reasons for the uncertainty were a serious risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the effect estimates ‐ either due to a small number of included participants or few events, or because the wide confidence intervals overlapped the threshold for clinical relevance.

Nearly all the included studies had a small number of participants. This increases the risk that randomisation does not achieve balance across groups for important prognostic characteristics (both known and unknown) that may confound outcome estimates. One such characteristic is the propensity towards spontaneous recovery. This can have a large impact on pooled estimates for hearing threshold, and imbalance across groups may not be detected by a comparison of baseline parameters such as pre‐treatment hearing loss and delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment. It is important, therefore, to make sure that trials have enough participants to achieve a balance across groups for the propensity towards spontaneous recovery, as well as other important prognostic factors. This is supported by meta‐analyses (Liebau 2017; Liebau 2018), which demonstrated (in primary and secondary treatment respectively) that variation in outcome estimates is reduced when there is a larger number of participants.

### Novel ways to modulate the vestibular system: magnetic vestibular stimulation, deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation / transcranial direct current stimulation [^73c8a43c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in neurotechnologies are revolutionizing our understanding of complex neural circuits and enabling new treatments for disorders of the human brain. In the vestibular system, electromagnetic stimuli can now modulate vestibular reflexes and sensations of self-motion by artificially stimulating the labyrinth, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and their connections.

Objective

In this narrative review, we describe evolving neuromodulatory techniques including magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) and discuss current and potential future application in the field of neuro-otology.

Results

MVS triggers both vestibular nystagmic (persistent) and perceptual (lasting ∼1 min) responses that may serve as a model to study central adaptational mechanisms and pathomechanisms of hemispatial neglect. By systematically mapping DBS electrodes, targeted stimulation of central vestibular pathways allowed modulating eye movements, vestibular heading perception, spatial attention and graviception, resulting in reduced anti-saccade error rates and hypometria, improved heading discrimination, shifts in verticality perception and transiently decreased spatial attention. For TMS/tDCS treatment trials have demonstrated amelioration of vestibular symptoms in various neuro-otological conditions, including chronic vestibular insufficiency, Mal-de-Debarquement and cerebellar ataxia.

Conclusion

Neuromodulation has a bright future as a potential treatment of vestibular dysfunction. MVS, DBS and TMS may provide new and sophisticated, customizable, and specific treatment options of vestibular symptoms in humans. While promising treatment responses have been reported for TMS/tDCS, treatment trials for vestibular disorders using MVS or DBS have yet to be defined and performed.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^63da9cb0]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Population Characteristics by Vestibular Suppressant

Of 190,348 individuals aged 65 years or older who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription within 30 days after their dizziness diagnosis. Of that 60,658, 27% (n = 16,159) obtained an anti‐emetic prescription, and the remainder (73%) obtained an anti‐anxiety medication such as a benzodiazepine. Table 1 presents the characteristics of those who did and did not obtain vestibular suppressants. The factors associated with the receipt of vestibular suppressants by adults with dizziness aged 65 and older included female sex (vs. males), race or ethnicity (individuals identified as Black or Hispanic vs. non‐Hispanic White), higher comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index Score of 2 and 1 vs. 0) and presentation to an emergency department (ED) for first place of dizziness diagnosis (Table 2). Provision of vestibular suppressants by diagnosis type ranged from 30% of those given a symptomatic diagnosis of dizziness and giddiness, not otherwise specified (780.x) to 43% with BPPV and 48% of those diagnosed with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. Further breakdown by diagnosis and by therapeutic class is found in Figure 1.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^1f5c25eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Imprecision

Many included studies were small and, as discussed above, we were unable to carry out meta‐analyses. Therefore, the total sample size for each of our outcomes of interest was small, and reduced the certainty of the evidence. For some outcomes the resulting confidence intervals for the effect size were also extremely wide ‐ meaning that there was uncertainty over whether the intervention was beneficial or harmful. This further impacted on the certainty of the evidence.

For each analysis result, the width of the confidence interval is compared to the threshold for an important difference (details of how we selected these thresholds are given in the Methods section). If the confidence interval crosses this threshold ‐ and includes both the potential for an important benefit and the potential for a trivial effect, then the certainty of the evidence would be reduced by one level. If the confidence interval includes the possibility of both an important benefit and an important harm then the certainty would be reduced further. Therefore, it is important to agree on thresholds for this rating, i.e. where is the threshold, or cut‐point, between a trivial difference and a small, but important benefit or harm for each outcome? This question is difficult to answer, and requires input from people with balance disorders. As part of this review process, one of the author team (KW) joined some discussion groups for people with balance disorders, to try and obtain their views on quantifying an important and meaningful difference in treatment outcomes. However, the main theme that emerged from these discussions was that people were unable to give a specific threshold for each outcome. Instead, individuals tended to weigh up a variety of different factors when determining this threshold. The invasiveness and burden of taking the treatment would be taken into account, as well as potential side effects and the severity of their symptoms at that time. The GRADE working group would likely refer to this as a "fully contextualised approach", accounting for all aspects of the specific intervention in order to set thresholds for benefit (Zeng 2021). For this review we adopted a "minimally contextualised approach" and rated imprecision for each outcome according to specific, defined thresholds (as described in Methods). However, if the thresholds used are inappropriate then this may affect the certainty of the evidence (by a maximum of one level).

Other considerations

For many outcomes that were reported at 3 to < 6 months, we rated down the certainty of the evidence by one level for publication bias, due to our knowledge of unpublished studies that should have reported in this time period.

### Corticosteroids for patients with vestibular neuritis: an evidence synthesis for guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department [^2f6ed987]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A short course of corticosteroids is among the management strategies considered by specialists for the treatment of vestibular neuritis (VN). We conducted an umbrella review (systematic review of systematic reviews) to summarize the evidence of corticosteroids use for the treatment of VN.

Methods

We included systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that evaluated the effects of corticosteroids compared to placebo or usual care in adult patients with acute VN. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened in duplicate. The quality of reviews was assessed with the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment was used to rate certainty of evidence. No meta-analysis was performed.

Results

From 149 titles, five systematic reviews were selected for quality assessment, and two reviews were of higher methodological quality and were included. These two reviews included 12 individual studies and 660 patients with VN. In a meta-analysis of two RCTs including a total of 50 patients, the use of corticosteroids (compared to placebo) was associated with higher complete caloric recovery (risk ratio 2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 6.00, low certainty). It is very uncertain whether this translates into clinical improvement as shown by the imprecise effect estimates for outcomes such as patient-reported vertigo or patient-reported dizziness disability. There was a wide CI for the outcome of dizziness handicap score (one study, 30 patients, 20.9 points in corticosteroids group vs. 15.8 points in placebo, mean difference+5.1, 95% CI -8.09 to +18.29, very low certainty). Higher rates of minor adverse effects for those receiving corticosteroids were reported, but the certainty in this evidence was very low.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of VN in the emergency department.

### The ariadne principles: how to handle multimorbidity in primary care consultations [^982ebfd8]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Ariadne principles of counseling for patients with multimorbidity

In Greek mythology, Ariadne helped Theseus to find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth by giving him a ball of thread – a picture that fits in well with multimorbidity research. Our Ariadne principles can be viewed as the thread that helps the physician to find his/her way within the labyrinth of multiple primary care consultations and (patient) contacts to other health care professionals. Often, it is not feasible (nor desirable) to work-up all elements of a consultation within one appointment. Our principles are not limited to one consultation, but are expected to be applied continuously while emphasizing certain aspects in each consultation.

Figure 2 represents the core elements of an ongoing counseling process for patients with multimorbidity in primary care. Central to the process is the sharing of realistic treatment goals by physician and patient. They result from a thorough interaction assessment of conditions and treatments – a necessary starting point for both presenting and continuing problems – and a prioritization of health problems that takes into account patient preferences. Individualized management realizes the best (available) options of care (diagnostics and treatment, but also in primary and secondary prevention) to achieve the goals. Goal attainment is followed-up in accordance with a re-assessment during planned visits. The occurrence of new or changed conditions, such as an increase in severity, or a changed context of the patient may provoke the (re-)start of the process. The main forces driving the care of patients with multimorbidity are interacting conditions (and treatments), as opposed to patients with a single disease (even if complicated). The process is not necessarily sequential, as patient's preferences may change over time, or the individualized management may have to be corrected, e.g. due to arising intolerable side effects.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^4509f3ce]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^4531c2b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

Two independent authors (AL, KW) used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence using GRADEpro GDT and the guidance in chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2021). Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct, and we have applied this in the interpretation of results. There are four possible ratings: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high certainty of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low certainty implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^ab4e8fc7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Once the extracted data were checked and any discrepancies resolved, a single author transferred the information to Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2020).

The primary effect of interest for this review is the effect of treatment assignment (which reflects the outcomes of treatment for people who were assigned to the intervention) rather than a per protocol analysis (the outcomes of treatment only for those who completed the full course of treatment as planned). For the outcomes of interest in this review, we extracted the findings from the studies on an available case basis, i.e. all available data from all participants at each time point, based on the treatment to which they were randomised. This was irrespective of compliance, or whether participants had received the intervention as planned.

In addition to extracting pre‐specified information about study characteristics and aspects of methodology relevant to risk of bias, we extracted the following summary statistics for each study and outcome:

For continuous data: the mean values, standard deviation and number of patients for each treatment group at the different time points for outcome measurement. Where change‐from‐baseline data were not available, we extracted the values for endpoint data instead. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. mean difference) from the studies.
For binary data: we extracted information on the number of participants experiencing an event, and the number of participants assessed at that time point. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. risk ratio) from the studies.
For ordinal scale data: if the data appeared to be normally distributed, or if the analysis performed by the investigators indicated that parametric tests are appropriate, then we treated the outcome measure as continuous data. Alternatively, if data were available, we converted these to binary data for analysis ‐ for example, for analysis of improvement in vertigo, when rated using the AAO‐HNS 1995 control of vertigo scale.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^e00822c7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Table 2 — aggregate grades of evidence by question type classifies evidence strength using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) levels, mapping grade A (OCEBM level 1) to systematic review of randomized trials; grade B (OCEBM level 2) to randomized trials or observational studies with dramatic effects or highly consistent evidence; grade C (OCEBM level 3–4) to nonrandomized or historically controlled studies, including case-control and observational studies; grade D (OCEBM level 5) to case reports, mechanism-based reasoning, or reasoning from first principles; and grade X (OCEBM N/A) to exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm, with the note that a systematic review may be downgraded to level B because of study limitations, heterogeneity, or imprecision.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^62a2f3dd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden hearing loss intratympanic (IT) steroids — placebo-controlled randomized trial shows early but not long-term advantage: In a study of 50 randomized patients, IT prednisolone led to higher early complete recovery than IT saline (76% vs 20%, P = 0.0002) at 7 days, but after both groups received oral prednisolone if needed, the placebo group eventually reached 72% complete recovery and the study could not prove long-term superiority over systemic steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^d84e4e6c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Drop attacks in Ménière's disease — frequency and consequences are noted. Drop attacks associated with MD are relatively rare, making prospective efficacy trials difficult, and when they occur they can result in significant complications including head and skeletal trauma.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^8d351698]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Natural history of MD — course is typically progressive and fluctuates unpredictably; early after onset the frequency of acute vertigo attacks increases during the first few years and may eventually decline to near complete cessation, yet severe attacks can occur even 20 years after diagnosis; a 20-year longitudinal study reported that 82% of MD patients had moderate to severe hearing loss with mean pure tone hearing loss > 50 dB.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease (Webster 2021a) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. There were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, therefore we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Study authors also often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Some studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also poorly reported or simply not assessed. The use of a positive pressure device requires the insertion of a ventilation tube. When used in people with chronic middle ear disease, this procedure has the potential to cause adverse effects (such as infection, ear discharge or persistent tympanic membrane perforation). It is unclear whether the same risks apply for people with Ménière's disease, but these should be assessed and reported.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Guidelines for the audiologic management of adult hearing impairment [^2db357c9]. AAA (2006). Medium credibility.

Guideline development process — The guideline was developed using an evidence-based approach that integrates clinical expertise with the best available clinical evidence derived from systematic research, and when evidence was ambiguous or lacking, clinical experience guided the development of consensus-based recommendations. Review of source guidelines identified four general process areas: (1) Assessment and Goal Settings; (2) Technical Aspects of Treatment; (3) Orientation, Counseling, and Follow-up; and (4) Assessing Outcomes. At least two task force members were assigned to each area to search for studies at the top of the hierarchy of study types; once definitive clinical studies that provided valid relevant information were identified, the search stopped, and the search was extended to studies/reports of lower quality (observational studies) only if there were no higher quality studies. Evidence was graded using the Quality of Evidence (QE) Levels: 1 Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) or other high-quality studies; 2 Well-designed RCT; 3 Non-randomized treatment studies; 4 Cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional surveys, and uncontrolled experiments; 5 Case report; and 6 Expert opinion. In addition, it was decided if the evidence was "Effective" (EV) or "Efficacious" (EF), where "EV" is evidence measured in the "real world" and "EF" is evidence measured under laboratory or ideal conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^03bd8730]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — acute vertigo and vestibular rehabilitation (VR): Clinicians should not recommend vestibular rehabilitation/physical therapy for management of acute vertigo attacks in patients with Ménière's disease, with a recommendation against based on RCTs that evaluated acute vertigo but were not specific to MD and a preponderance of benefit over harms. The action profile notes level of confidence in evidence as Medium; benefits include avoidance of noneffective therapy, preserving coverage for physical therapy at a later stage of disease, and avoidance of potential exacerbation of symptoms; risks include delay of treatment in patients with an underlying vestibular hypofunction. The benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harms and the policy level is recommendation against. Supporting context describes active MD attacks as vertigo attacks lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with fluctuating low- to midfrequency SNHL, aural fullness, and tinnitus, and states that for the fluctuating nature of vestibular dysfunction manifested in acute MD attacks, the role of VR is undefined.
