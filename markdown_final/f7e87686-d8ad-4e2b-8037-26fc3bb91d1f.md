## Question

What is the DDx for ECG transient J waves in V2 for a 20 year old female? They were present on one ECG and not another done a few months later.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of transient J waves in V2 in a 20-year-old woman, noting they were present on one ECG and not on another done a few months later. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely what constitutes a J wave and how to measure it. Then, I should verify the clinical context and the significance of the finding being transient. Next, I will consider benign physiologic variants versus pathologic entities, especially early repolarization and Brugada phenotypes. After that, I should review technical confounders like lead placement and artifacts. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-stratified workup and follow-up plan, making sure thresholds and guideline-based actions are correct [^115ysMoW] [^115GranB] [^115oZmxV] [^115STzUK].

> Let me first confirm the electrocardiographic definition and thresholds so I don't misclassify the pattern. A J wave (Osborn wave) is a positive deflection at the junction between the QRS and ST segment, typically reflecting a transmural repolarization gradient due to a prominent transient outward current (Ito) in epicardium versus endocardium, and in women the abnormal J-point elevation threshold in V2 is 0.15 mV (1.5 mm), with normal J-point elevation in V2 often showing a slowly upsloping ST segment rather than a horizontal or downsloping pattern [^117JJwcQ] [^116txq5n].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before jumping to conclusions. The patient is a 20-year-old woman with a transient J wave in V2 that appeared on one ECG and resolved on a later tracing; she is asymptomatic and presumably has no known structural heart disease, which already shifts pretest probabilities toward benign variants rather than malignant substrates, though I should not overstate that without corroboration [^115KYCpy] [^116Rsb8T].

> I will now examine benign physiologic explanations first. Early repolarization pattern (ERP) is common in young adults, especially athletes and women, and can be intermittent due to changes in vagal tone, heart rate, hormonal status, and fitness; importantly, transient ERP in asymptomatic individuals is generally considered low risk, whereas persistent or high-amplitude J waves, particularly in inferior leads, carry more concern for arrhythmic potential, so I need to check amplitude, distribution, and ST-segment morphology after the J point to refine risk [^114CeT9y] [^115KYCpy] [^115STzUK].

> Hold on, I should verify the possibility of a Brugada phenotype even though the morphology is in V2 rather than the classic right precordial saddleback/coved pattern. Brugada syndrome can show dynamic, intermittent type 1 patterns that may be unmasked by fever, sodium channel blockade, or autonomic shifts; in women, spontaneous type 1 is less common, but not impossible, so I should confirm the exact ST-T morphology in V1–V3, look for concomitant conduction delays, and consider high intercostal lead placement if suspicion persists [^115oZmxV] [^113nt32C] [^113yk7Rb].

> But wait, what if this is a technical artifact rather than a true cardiac signal. Lead misplacement, particularly V1/V2 positioned too high, can generate spurious r' or pseudo–right bundle branch block patterns and even unmask or mimic Brugada phenotypes; I should double-check the original ECG for P-wave and QRS morphology clues of high placement and, if needed, repeat the ECG with meticulous precordial positioning at the fourth intercostal space to exclude positional artifacts [^116R1XtR].

> Next, I should review acquired or systemic contributors that can transiently augment J waves. Hypothermia produces classic Osborn waves and bradycardia, though this is context-dependent and unlikely here unless there was exposure; hypercalcemia can accentuate J waves; and autonomic or hormonal fluctuations in young women can modulate repolarization gradients, so I need to ensure electrolytes and clinical context are reviewed before attributing to a primary electrical syndrome [^114PD8Hc] [^1122Ypyk] [^114CeT9y].

> Let me consider structural heart disease cautiously. Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy can present with right precordial T-wave inversion and repolarization abnormalities, but isolated transient J waves in V2 without T-wave inversion or other red flags make this less likely; still, if there are concerning features or family history, I should escalate to echocardiography and possibly cardiac MRI to exclude subtle right ventricular disease [^115cGHfk] [^114RqNqF].

> I should confirm the risk implications of J-wave features that modify prognosis. Higher J-wave amplitude (≥ 0.2 mV), horizontal or downsloping ST segments after the J point, and widespread involvement, especially in inferior leads, are associated with higher arrhythmic risk; conversely, a notched J point with upsloping ST segment and confinement to anterior leads in a young woman are more consistent with a benign ERP variant, so I need to document these morphologies carefully on repeat ECGs [^116mT3cc] [^1171D3KR].

> Now, I need to ensure the workup is proportionate to risk. For an asymptomatic 20-year-old woman with a single transient J wave in V2 and no concerning family history, the appropriate next steps are: repeat a high-quality ECG with standardized lead placement; obtain serum electrolytes including calcium and potassium; screen for personal/family history of syncope, nocturnal agonal respirations, or sudden cardiac death; and consider ambulatory ECG or event monitoring if there are palpitations or presyncope, reserving advanced imaging for abnormal findings or high-risk features [^115ykBm5] [^115oZmxV] [^115KYCpy].

> Hold on, I should verify when provocative testing is indicated. Sodium channel blocker challenge (e.g., ajmaline or flecainide) is reserved for patients with suspected Brugada syndrome based on clinical history, family history, or high intercostal ECG patterns; a positive test alone without clinical context is insufficient for diagnosis, so I should avoid overtesting in low-probability scenarios and only proceed if the pretest probability is meaningful [^113nt32C] [^113yk7Rb].

> Let me reconsider the differential one more time to avoid premature closure. The most likely diagnosis is a benign early repolarization variant given age, sex, and transience; alternative considerations include a dynamic Brugada phenotype, positional lead misplacement artifact, electrolyte or autonomic modulation, and, less likely, structural right ventricular disease; the key discriminators are careful ECG morphology analysis, repeat tracings, clinical history, and selective testing rather than blanket screening [^115KYCpy] [^116R1XtR] [^115STzUK].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling and follow-up. Reassurance with clear return precautions for syncope, palpitations, or chest pain is appropriate; if benign ERP is confirmed, no treatment is indicated; if any high-risk features emerge (e.g., large-amplitude inferior J waves, horizontal ST segments, family history of SCD), I should escalate to specialist evaluation and consider ambulatory monitoring or, selectively, provocative testing, documenting the shared decision-making process [^115ykBm5] [^115KYCpy] [^115oZmxV].

Transient J waves in V2 in a 20-year-old female are most often due to **benign early repolarization** [^114CeT9y] or **autonomic fluctuations** [^115KYCpy], especially in young women [^notfound]. Other considerations include **Brugada syndrome** (transient type 2/3 patterns) [^115oZmxV], electrolyte disturbances (hypothermia, hypercalcemia) [^1118p9qk], and lead misplacement [^116R1XtR]. The differential is summarized below:

| **Category** | **Differential diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benign variants | Early repolarization pattern (ERP) | - J-point elevation in V2 with notching/slurring <br/> - Often athletic or vagally toned <br/> - Transient and benign [^114CeT9y] | - Clinical correlation <br/> - No further testing if asymptomatic [^115ykBm5] |
| Autonomic fluctuations | - Vagal tone changes <br/> - Anxiety/stress | - Transient J waves with heart rate changes <br/> - Often no symptoms [^114PguPP] | - Clinical correlation <br/> - No further testing if asymptomatic [^notfound] |
| Inherited arrhythmias | Brugada syndrome (type 2/3) | - Transient coved/saddleback ST elevation in V1–V3 <br/> - Family history or syncope [^113nt32C] | - High intercostal leads <br/> - Sodium channel blocker challenge if suspected [^113nt32C] |
| Electrolyte/metabolic | - Hypothermia <br/> - Hypercalcemia | - Diffuse J waves (Osborn) with bradycardia or hypercalcemia signs [^1118p9qk] | - Temperature/calcium measurement <br/> - Correct underlying cause [^114PD8Hc] |
| Technical artifacts | Lead misplacement | - Unusual P/QRS morphology in V1/V2 <br/> - Resolves with proper placement [^116R1XtR] | - Repeat ECG with correct placement [^116R1XtR] |

Transient J waves in V2 in a young woman are usually **benign or autonomic**; pursue Brugada, electrolyte, or technical causes only if clinical suspicion arises [^115ykBm5].

Early repolarization (ER) abnormalities in the inferior-lateral leads are a matter of intense scientific debate because of their demonstrated association with Brugada syndrome (BS) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF). To add fuel to the fire, we present a case in which ER abnormalities are associated with BS but in which, more importantly, they were shown to be transient and strictly correlated with an episode of VF.

Presence of J-point elevation with rapidly ascending ST segment in the anterior leads of the 12-lead electrocardiogram has been generally considered a benign phenomenon. The concept of benign nature of J-waves has changed as data emerged on variants of J-waves that were associated with the increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Two specific inherited arrhythmia syndromes, such as Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome, have been recognized that carry an increased risk for ventricular fibrillation. The current review is aimed at discussing the clinical aspects of these syndromes and the implications of incidental recognition of the J-waves in a randomly recorded electrocardiogram of asymptomatic subjects.

Brugada syndrome — ECG diagnostic pattern, variability, and potential role for 12‑lead AECG are described. The ECG diagnosis depends on a pattern of J‑point elevation of 2 mm with coved ST‑segment elevation and inverted T wave in V1–V2, classified as type 1 morphology, which may occur spontaneously or after provocative testing. The pattern can fluctuate or normalize over time, and some have suggested 12‑lead AECG may reveal transient Brugada patterns. In a registry analysis using 12‑lead 24‑h AECG (n = 251), 30% had spontaneous and 70% drug‑induced type 1 patterns, and a "spontaneous" but intermittent type 1 pattern was detected in 2% of patients.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A 44-year-old woman presents pain free to our ED after experiencing 45min of tightening of the chest with radiation to her left arm, diaphoresis and nausea. Her vital signs are normal except for her high BP, which is 180/110. She reports recurrent episodes of chest pain in the past 1.5 weeks, unrelated to exercise. She visited a general practitioner who prescribed pain medication and treated her new-onset hypertension. Besides the recently found hypertension, heavy smoking is her only other traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

### Misplacing V1 and V2 can have clinical consequences [^116R1XtR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The precordial electrocardiogram (ECG) leads V1 and V2 are often misplaced. Such misplacement usually involves placing these leads too high on the chest. The resulting ECG may generate erroneous ECG patterns: e.g. incomplete right bundle branch block, anterior T wave inversion, septal Q waves, ST-segment elevation. These features may falsely suggest acute or old cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism, or a type-2 Brugada pattern. On rare occasion, conversely, high placement of V1 and V2 may reveal a true type-1 Brugada pattern. The emergency clinician needs to be aware of the possibility of lead misplacement, and should know how to suspect it based on unusual P wave morphology in V1 and V2.

### Association between temporal changes in early repolarization pattern with long-term cardiovascular outcome: a population-based cohort study [^114CeT9y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In previous cohort studies, ERP was considered to be a stable ECG finding rather than a transient phenomenon. However, in clinical practice, the phenotype of ERP can change over time, in accordance with the changes of vagal tone, heart rate, sport activities, reproductive hormones, and health conditions. Therefore, ERP could be a permanent phenomenon for some subjects but a transient ECG pattern for others. A large number of case reports noted that J‐wave amplitude was dramatically augmented only during peri‐event periods of VF, and the amplitude of J wave remote from the VF events did not differ from that seen in healthy controls, indicating that temporal elevation of the J wave might be an important risk factor for the prediction of malignant tachyarrhythmia.

Recent experimental evidence suggested that ERP might be caused by a transient ventricular transmural voltage gradient owing to a prominent I to ‐mediated action potential notch in the epicardium, potentially leading to phase 2 reentry and causing fatal arrhythmias. Yet results of the study raise the following question: why would new‐onset ERP be associated with an increased risk for SCD? One possible explanation is that transient ERP is associated with younger age, lower heart rate, better cardiovascular fitness, and higher vagal tone, which generally protect against malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Elevation of vagal tone could cause regional dispersion of repolarization, which is manifest as ERP on ECG. This type of ERP tends to disappear with the reduction of vagal activity and increase in sympathetic tone. In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, Walsh and colleaguesfound that lower heart rate and longer exercise duration were associated with the presence of ERP, but they were not predictors of ERP maintenance over time.

Consistent ERP might be a phenotypic manifestation of heart disease or genetic susceptibility. Defects in 1 of the repolarization currents may not suffice to produce phase 2 reentry in these conditions. However, when other factors affecting repolarization are present, the repolarization reserve may become exhausted, and subjects with ERP could be at an increased risk for malignant arrhythmias. The new‐onset ERP might be representative of acute conditions that could lead to dramatic repolarization changes, such as autonomic nervous system perturbances, acute ischemia, hypokalemia, drugs, and acquired ion channel deficiencies, and thus increase the vulnerability to life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias. These hypotheses were supported by the higher risks of both SCD and cardiovascular death among subjects with new‐onset J‐waves ≥ 0.2 mV than among those with J‐wave amplitudes of 0.1 to 0.19 mV.

### J wave syndromes: what's new? [^1138abxN]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Among the inherited ion channelopathies associated with potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia syndromes in nominally structurally normal hearts are the J wave syndromes, which include the Brugada (BrS) and early repolarization (ERS) syndromes. These ion channelopathies are responsible for sudden cardiac death (SCD), most often in young adults in the third and fourth decade of life. Our principal goal in this review is to briefly outline the clinical characteristics, as well as the molecular, ionic, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying these primary electrical diseases that have challenged the cardiology community over the past two decades. In addition, we discuss our recently developed whole-heart experimental model of BrS, providing compelling evidence in support of the repolarization hypothesis for the BrS phenotype as well as novel findings demonstrating that voltage-gated sodium and transient outward current channels can modulate each other's function via trafficking and gating mechanisms with implications for improved understanding of the genetics of both cardiac and neuronal syndromes.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^113bGkRF]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

A consistent observation at the time of malignant arrhythmias is amplification of inferolateral J waves, which then recedes after spontaneous or pharmacologic arrhythmia termination. A higher J-wave amplitude recorded soon after a syncope (compared with previous or subsequent ECGs) suggest that a malignant arrhythmia may have occurred. The variability of J waves after longer cycle lengths (post pause) is, in our opinion, an essential marker of electrical vulnerability. Unfortunately, there are no specific means to challenge the dynamicity of J-wave patterns in vulnerable patients (eg, like sodium blocker provocation in BrS). A Valsalva maneuver or Holter monitoring are useful to determine the J-wave dynamics on 12-lead ECG during cycle length variations. Finally, VF induction maneuvers during an electrophysiological study are of little utility. In a multicenter study of 81 patients followed up by implantable cardioverter–defibrillator interrogations, VF inducibility could not predict the incidence of subsequent arrhythmias.

In summary, based on different published reviews it seems that no clinically strong risk stratification can be performed to identify the small subset of patients at high risk and facilitate primary prevention. Genetic variant analysis or specific pharmacologic testing hopefully will become of prognostic importance in the future. Currently the decision for therapeutic prevention in high-risk patients (by implantable cardioverter–defibrillator or sometimes by quinidine) or loop recorder implantation in intermediate-risk patients is based on the severity of clinical variables and ECG patterns: T-wave negativity, J-wave amplitude, spatial extent of the J-wave pattern, and dynamic changes in the J wave. The presence of short-coupled premature beats is not a risk factor as it indicates imminent threat of VF. Figure 1B summarizes our hierarchical view of risk factors.

Evidence for repolarization and depolarization abnormalities as distinct mechanisms

There is ongoing controversy on whether the "J-wave syndromes" (Brugada and inferolateral J waves) are due to repolarization or depolarization abnormalities. The repolarization mechanism is founded on studies in right or left ventricular wedge preparations demonstrating that J waves can be a consequence of a transmural repolarization gradient due to a differential distribution and function of the transient outward current. The depolarization mechanism is founded on studies demonstrating that structural discontinuities can cause conduction disturbances by current-to-load mismatch and display the phenotype of J waves. In humans, however, the current data indicate heterogeneous mechanisms.

### Pseudo-ischaemic ECG in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis surviving for a decade [^1174opTh]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 58-year-old female with no history of heart disease was admitted to our hospital for abnormal ECG mimicking myocardial ischaemia. The ECG revealed persistent T-wave inversion in almost all leads, especially in precordial leads V2-V6. The patient had no complaints of chest pain, chest distress, short of breath or other atypical myocardial ischaemia symptoms. She had a history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with a disease course more than 20 years. Examinations help rule out other diseases causing persistent T-wave inversion. Importantly, cardiac catheterisation showed nearly normal coronary arteries that could rule out myocardial ischaemia. Accordingly, the authors presumed that the pseudo-ischaemic ECG was associated with ALS in this patient. The findings of the present case provide new evidence that autonomic nervous system may involve in the pathophysiological progress of ALS.

An 84-year-old woman, affected by Alzheimer's disease, presented to the emergency department with intense dyspnoea. Since ECG was showing T wave inversion in anterior leads and troponin-T was high, the patient was admitted to our unit with a diagnosis of anterior non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. However, the patient's medical history and a further review of the ECG led us to suspect a pulmonary embolism (PE) as a possible differential clinical diagnosis. We tested this alternative hypothesis: echocardiography as well as contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of PE. We describe these misleading ECG findings together with a brief discussion of electrocardiographical changes in pulmonary embolism.

### J wave syndromes [^112heWaj]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

The J wave, also referred to as an Osborn wave, is a deflection immediately following the QRS complex of the surface ECG. When partially buried in the R wave, the J wave appears as J-point elevation or ST-segment elevation. Several lines of evidence have suggested that arrhythmias associated with an early repolarization pattern in the inferior or mid to lateral precordial leads, Brugada syndrome, or arrhythmias associated with hypothermia and the acute phase of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are mechanistically linked to abnormalities in the manifestation of the transient outward current (I(to))-mediated J wave. Although Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J-wave manifestation, they can be considered to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression that we propose be termed J-wave syndromes. This review summarizes our current state of knowledge concerning J-wave syndromes, bridging basic and clinical aspects. We propose to divide early repolarization syndrome into three subtypes: type 1, which displays an early repolarization pattern predominantly in the lateral precordial leads, is prevalent among healthy male athletes and is rarely seen in ventricular fibrillation survivors; type 2, which displays an early repolarization pattern predominantly in the inferior or inferolateral leads, is associated with a higher level of risk; and type 3, which displays an early repolarization pattern globally in the inferior, lateral, and right precordial leads, is associated with the highest level of risk for development of malignant arrhythmias and is often associated with ventricular fibrillation storms.

### Increase in prominence of electrocardiographic J waves after a single dose of propofol in a patient with early ventricular repolarisation [^116vw4UG]. Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

J waves appear on an electrocardiogram as an elevation of the J point in the terminal portion of the QRS complex. J waves are often benign, but may be associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In some cases, such problems appear to have been precipitated by propofol infusions. We observed a sudden increase in J waves and profound hypotension following a single intravenous dose of propofol in an 84-year-old woman with early repolarisation in the inferior ventricular wall. When early repolarisation (as shown by electrocardiographic J waves) is observed in the inferior ventricular wall pre-operatively, patients should be carefully monitored. Myocardial ischaemia and the use of drugs that might worsen J waves should be avoided.

### A new ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction equivalent pattern? Prominent T wave and J-point depression in the precordial leads associated with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr [^1115JqhS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Certain acute coronary syndrome electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, which do not include ST-segment elevation, are indicative of acute coronary syndrome caused by significant arterial occlusion; these patterns are, of course, associated with significant risk to the patient and mandate a rapid response from the health care team. One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall.

AHA/ACCF/HRS ST-segment elevation — normal limits and abnormal thresholds in precordial leads: Elevation of the ST segment in leads V1, V2, and V3 should be referenced against normal values, with one reference reporting the upper 98th percentile normal limit as approximately 0.3 mV in white men less than 40 years of age (up to 0.33 mV in the 24- to 29-year age group) and approximately 0.25 mV in white men 40 years old and older, and white women approximately 0.15 mV; another reference lists V2 J-point limits of approximately 0.15 mV in white men and 0.20 mV in black men, with corresponding limits of approximately 0.10 mV for white women and 0.15 mV for black women, and STJ60 limits in V2 of approximately 0.3 mV in white men, approximately 0.35 mV in black men, approximately 0.2 mV in white women, and approximately 0.25 mV in black women; for clinical ischemia/infarction evaluation, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation in V2 and V3 recommended is 0.2 mV for men 40 years of age and older and 0.25 mV for men less than 40 years of age, the recommended threshold for adult women in V2 and V3 is 0.15 mV, and the threshold recommended for men and women in all other standard leads is 0.1 mV; additionally, the ST segment in normal J-point elevation in V2 and particularly V3 is generally sloping slowly upward and normal ST elevation at 60 ms past the J point is combined with an upsloping ST segment rather than with the more horizontal ST segment present in myocardial ischemia.

### Transient abnormal Q waves during exercise electrocardiography [^114PLm62]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Myocardial ischaemia during exercise electrocardiography is usually manifested by ST segment depression or elevation. Transient abnormal Q waves are rare, as Q waves indicate an old myocardial infarction. The case of a patient with exercise induced transient abnormal Q waves is reported. The potential mechanisms involved in the development of such an abnormality and its clinical implications are discussed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemia/infarction ECG — age-, sex-, and lead-specific thresholds for abnormal J-point changes — notes that threshold values are dependent on gender, age, and ECG lead. For men 40 years of age and older, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation should be 0.2 mV (2 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads; for men less than 40 years of age, the threshold values for abnormal J-point elevation in leads V2 and V3 should be 0.25 mV (2.5 mm); for women, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation should be 0.15 mV (1.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and greater than 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads. For men and women, the threshold for abnormal J-point elevation in V3R and V4R should be 0.05 mV (0.5 mm), except for males less than 30 years of age, for whom 0.1 mV (1 mm) is more appropriate; for men and women, the threshold value for abnormal J-point elevation in V7 through V9 should be 0.05 mV (0.5 mm); and for men and women of all ages, the threshold value for abnormal J-point depression should be −0.05 mV (−0.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and −0.1 mV (−1 mm) in all other leads.

Postischemic T-wave changes: After ischemia and infarction, T waves often become inverted in leads with prior ST-segment elevation and may remain inverted for periods ranging from days to permanently; a subgroup has deeply inverted T waves greater than 0.5 mV occurring in leads V2, V3, and V4, and occasionally V5.

Acute ischemia/infarction ECG — contiguous lead criteria — requires ST-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads with the elevation at the J point greater than 0.2 mV (2 mm with standard calibration) in leads V1, V2, and V3 and greater than 0.1 mV in all other leads. It is currently proposed that the diagnosis of acute ischemia/infarction be based on the presence of ST elevation, as measured at the J point, equaling or exceeding these thresholds in 2 or more anatomically contiguous leads.

### Risk of sudden death among young individuals with J waves and early repolarization: putting the evidence into perspective [^114uAzgz]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

The presence of J waves and ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), jointly termed "the early repolarization pattern", has traditionally been considered a marker of "good health". However, recent case control series and long-term population studies have established a statistically significant association between this ECG pattern and an increased risk for arrhythmic death. This finding has raised concern among physicians, who now are asked to estimate the "arrhythmic risk" following the incidental discovery of J waves on routine ECG. Therefore, we review the literature linking early repolarization with arrhythmic risk to place this "fear of J waves" in the right perspective. We found five case control studies (involving 331 patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation [VF] and 8,649 controls). All of these studies showed that J waves, particularly of large amplitude and recorded in multiple leads, are more prevalent among patients with idiopathic VF. We also found three large population studies (involving > 17,000 individuals) looking at the prognostic value of early repolarization. Two of these studies showed that the presence of J waves > 2 mm in amplitude in asymptomatic adults is associated with a threefold increased of arrhythmic death during very long-term follow-up. Individuals with J waves do have some degree of increased dispersion of repolarization that places them at increased risk for arrhythmic death, but only in the presence of additional proarrhythmic factors or triggers. A sensible approach for the asymptomatic patient with J waves is proposed.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1133hEK4]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — electrocardiographic thresholds for ischemia specify that new ST-elevation at the J-point in ≥ 2 contiguous leads has the cut-point ≥ 1 mm in all leads other than V2–V3, with higher cut-points of ≥ 2 mm in men ≥ 40 years, ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 years, or ≥ 1.5 mm in women regardless of age. New horizontal or downsloping ST-depression ≥ 0.5 mm in 2 contiguous leads and/or T inversion > 1 mm in 2 contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S ratio > 1 are also listed. QRS onset is recommended as the reference point for J-point determination.

### Clinical significance of variants of J-points and J-waves: early repolarization patterns and risk [^115cWGyf]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The variations in the electrocardiographic patterns of J-point elevations, and the complex of J-points and J-waves in early repolarization (ER), in conjunction with disparities in associated sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, have lead to a recognition of the need to carefully classify the spectrum of these observations. Many questions about the pathogenesis of J-wave patterns, and the associated magnitudes of risk, remain unanswered, especially in regard to the risk implications in certain high-prevalence subpopulations such as athletes, children, and adolescents. Interest in these electrocardiography (ECG) patterns has grown dramatically in recent years, in large part because of the frequency with which these patterns are observed on routine ECGs. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the prevalence of different J-point/J-wave patterns and estimates of the magnitude of mortality and SCD risk associated with J-point elevations and J-waves, in what has become known as ER patterns.

### Early repolarization and sudden cardiac arrest: theme or variation on a theme? [^113ofCsU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

The association between early repolarization patterns on electrocardiograms and risk of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation reported by Haïssaguerre et al. raises questions about the generally held concept that early repolarization is a benign electrocardiographic pattern. Although the association reported is strong enough to suggest validity, the data do not permit distinction between the following two possibilities: that early repolarization is a single pathophysiological entity with variable expression, or that early repolarization is a nonspecific electrocardiographic pattern that might be associated with specific high-risk or low-risk entities. Until prospective population data are available, physicians should continue to view this common electrocardiographic variant as generally benign. Careful attention should, however, be paid to patients with early repolarization and J-point elevations of more than 2 mm, especially those with otherwise unexplained arrhythmias or a family history of unexplained sudden death.

What action would you advise next?

D) Active slow rewarming

Key ECG features that assist in correct diagnosis are sinus bradycardia, attenuated P wave and classic J (Osborn) wave. Our image shows bradycardia with diffuse classic J (Osborn) waves prominent in leads II and V4–V6 (more prominent in panel B). It was proposed to be due to hypothermia-induced prolongation of action potential and abnormal repolarisation creating a transmural voltage gradient between the ventricular epicardium and endocardium resulting in J point elevation. Hypothermia has variable ECG manifestations that range from bradycardia, decreased P wave amplitude, wide QRS complex, Osborn waves, prolonged PR interval, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Early identification is important in the context of the clinical setting to avoid unnecessary interventions before appropriately rewarming the patient. Cardiac pacemaker is also ineffective in treating bradycardia (choice A) until fully rewarming the patient. There is no indication for PCI (choice B) and haemodialysis (choice E) at this point. Rapid rewarming (choice C) triggers a cascade of destructive inflammatory processes.

Patient outcome

Temperature obtained via bladder probe was 87.4 ○ F. The patient was rewarmed slowly with warming blankets, a Bair Hugger and warm IVF. The patient's BP and mental status improved. Her bradycardia and Osborne waves resolved, except for a prolonged QT interval.

T-wave abnormalities — normal polarity by age and quantitative amplitude thresholds are detailed: in children older than 1 month, the T wave is often inverted in V1, V2, and V3; in adolescents 12 years old and older and in young adults less than 20 years of age, the T wave may be slightly inverted in aVF and inverted in V2; in adults 20 years old and older, the normal T wave is inverted in aVR, upright or inverted in aVL, III, and V1, and upright in I, II, and V3 through V6. In lateral chest leads V5 and V6, the T wave is slightly negative (less than 0.1 mV) in 2% of white men and women 60 years of age and older and in 2% of black men and women 40 years of age and older, and it is negative by 0.1 mV or more in 5% of black men and women 60 years of age and older. In normal adults, the T-wave amplitude is most positive in V2 or V3, with upper normal thresholds for V2 from 1.0 to 1.4 mV in men (up to 1.6 mV in the 18- to 29-year age group) and from 0.7 up to 1.0 mV in women. Quantitative descriptors propose reporting T waves in I, II, aVL, and V2 to V6 as inverted when the T-wave amplitude is from −0.1 to −0.5 mV, as deep negative from −0.5 to −1.0 mV, and as giant negative when less than −1.0 mV; additionally, a T wave may be called low when its amplitude is less than 10% of the R-wave amplitude and flat when the peak T-wave amplitude is between 0.1 and −0.1 mV (with an R wave taller than 0.3 mV).

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT interval measurement and interpretation — definition, interlead variability, lead selection, handling U waves, automation, and validation: The QT interval is defined from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave, with key challenges including recognizing the onset and end points, selecting appropriate lead(s), and adjusting for QRS duration, gender, and rate. The onset of the QRS complex tends to occur up to 20 ms earlier in V2 and V3 than in the limb leads, and interlead QT differences of up to 50 ms have been regarded as normal, with others suggesting up to 65 ms, and this value is reported to be less in women than in men. When measuring QT in individual leads, the lead showing the longest QT should be used, usually V2 or V5; if the longest value differs by more than 40 ms from other leads, the measurement may be in error and adjacent leads should be considered. If T and U waves are superimposed or cannot be separated, it is recommended that the QT be measured in leads not showing U waves (often aVR and aVL) or by extending a tangent to the steepest proportion of the T-wave downslope to the TP segment, although defining the end of the T wave in these ways might underestimate the QT interval. Automated simultaneous-lead recordings often yield a longer QT than any single lead and may invalidate older normal values, and in view of the clinical importance of the QT-interval prolongation, it is essential to visually validate QT-interval prolongation reported by a computer algorithm. QT prolongation can result from conditions such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, and its presence on an ECG report should call for a careful clinical evaluation of possible causes.

Electrocardiographic interpretation for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) lists sex- and age-specific thresholds and posterior lead use.

Many patients with NSTE-ACS have either nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes or a normal ECG, and the absence of electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia does not exclude ACS.

U wave in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation — amplitude, rate dependence, pathologic variants, and reporting: U-wave amplitude has been suggested to be approximately 0.33 mV or 11% of the T wave, and its presence is heart-rate dependent, being rarely present at rates greater than 95 bpm and present in 90% of cases at heart rates less than 65 complexes per minute. Increased U-wave amplitude may occur with quinidine-like cardioactive drugs and hypokalemia; when K is less than 2.7 mmol/L the U-wave amplitude may exceed the T-wave amplitude, although fusion of the U wave with the T wave also occurs with increased sympathetic tone and markedly prolonged QT interval in congenital and acquired long-QT syndromes. An inverted U wave in leads V2 through V3 is abnormal. Recommendation: Statements concerning the U wave should be included in the ECG interpretation when the U wave is inverted, when it is merged with the T wave, or when its amplitude is greater than that of the T wave.

### Faulty cardiac repolarization reserve in alternating hemiplegia of childhood broadens the phenotype [^116RHhST]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

J wave changes

One patient (Patient 44) showed transient asymptomatic cove-shaped ST segment elevation (J-point elevation), characteristic of Brugada syndrome, on single-lead ECG recording during EEG-videotelemetry (Fig. 4 A and B). One individual (Patient 21) had intermittent, dynamic 1 mm J-point elevation in lead V1 (see below; Fig. 4 E); a further individual (Patient 18) had prominent notching of the terminal portion of the QRS complex without J-point elevation (Fig. 4 F) and four patients (Patients 9, 12, 14 and 40) had early repolarization changes associated with repolarization abnormalities (Fig. 4 C and D).

Changes with age and related to specific mutation

One individual (Patient 15) had a normal ECG with IVCD at the age of 3 years; at age 9 years, incomplete right bundle branch block and abnormal repolarization inferiorly were noted (Fig. 5 A and B). Dynamic changes were also seen in Patient 7 (Fig. 5 E and F). Overall, the prevalence of ECG abnormalities was significantly greater in individuals aged ≥ 16 years than in those < 16 years (P = 0·0095). Nineteen patients harboured the p.D801N mutation: all eight patients (42·1%) ≥ 16 years, but only 6/11 patients (18·8%) < 16 years, had abnormal ECGs (P = 0·045).

The prevalence of any ECG abnormalities, and of repolarization abnormalities, remained significantly higher in the alternating hemiplegia cohort than in the disease control cohort if only the 47 cases with alternating hemiplegia with ATP1A3 mutation were considered (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The QTc interval also remained significantly shorter when comparing only the 47 alternating hemiplegia cases with ATP1A3 mutation against all 52 disease controls (unpaired t -test, P < 0.0001).

Dynamic ECG changes

Three of five patients in whom serial 12-lead ECGs were available had dynamic electrocardiographic changes that varied from one ECG to another. Patient 9 had dynamic T wave inversion in leads V1–V3 (Fig. 5 C and D). Six individuals (11.5%) had dynamic beat-to-beat ECG changes: five had dynamic changes in the T wave morphology (Fig. 5 G), and one individual had intermittent 1 mm J-point elevation in lead V1 (Fig. 4 E).

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^113nt32C]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Three possible types of BrS can be observed on an ECG. The typical type I is characterized by a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm followed by a gradually descending ST segment and a negative T wave in the right precordial leads V1 and V2 at either the second, third, or fourth intercostal spaces, also called coved‐type ST‐segment elevation. Type 2, or saddleback ST segment, has a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm and a terminal ST‐segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm, followed by a positive or biphasic T wave in lead V2. Type 3 also has a saddleback ST segment with a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm in lead V2, but the terminal ST‐segment elevation is < 1 mm.

On top of an ECG, provocation testing is indicated in patients presenting with type 2 or 3 at baseline or those with a suspicion for BrS based on clinical or family history. In fact, type 1 may be unmasked by intravenous administration of class IA antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide and ajmaline, and class IC antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide and pilsicainide that act as sodium channel blockers. Some clinicians favor the use of ajmaline because its high sensitivity leads to a lower false‐negative rate. However, positive ajmaline tests do not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of BrS due to the potential for false positives, owing to the intricate mechanism of ajmaline. Therefore, based on the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines, BrS diagnosis is indicated in patients without underlying heart conditions who demonstrate a spontaneous type 1 pattern on their ECG, regardless of symptoms, and in induced type 1 pattern provided there are other clinical features such as episodes of polymorphic VT/VF, arrhythmic syncope, or pertinent family history.

### J wave, QRS slurring, and ST elevation in athletes with cardiac arrest in the absence of heart disease: marker of risk or innocent bystander? [^112z6Bis]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

QRS-ST changes in the inferior and lateral ECG leads are frequently observed in athletes. Recent studies have suggested a potential arrhythmogenic significance of these findings in the general population. The aim of our study was to investigate whether QRS-ST changes are markers of cardiac arrest (CA) of unexplained cause or sudden death in athletes.

Methods and Results

In 21 athletes (mean age, 27 years; 5 women) with cardiac arrest or sudden death, the ECG recorded before or immediately after the clinical event was compared with the ECG of 365 healthy athletes eligible for competitive sport activity. We measured the height of the J wave and ST elevation and searched for the presence of QRS slurring in the terminal portion of QRS. QRS slurring in any lead was present in 28.6% of cases and in 7.6% of control athletes (P = 0.006). A J wave and/or QRS slurring without ST elevation in the inferior (II, III, and aVF) and lateral leads (V(4) to V(6)) were more frequently recorded in cases than in control athletes (28.6% versus 7.9%, P = 0.007). Among those with cardiac arrest, arrhythmia recurrences did not differ between the subgroups with and without J wave or QRS slurring during a median 36-month follow-up of sport discontinuation.

Conclusions

J wave and/or QRS slurring was found more frequently among athletes with cardiac arrest/sudden death than in control athletes. Nevertheless, the presence of this ECG pattern appears not to confer a higher risk for recurrent malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^117EEejK]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inferolateral J waves are subtle ECG phenotypes that may be responsible for SCD in patients with no apparent SHD. Their occurrence at the QRST junction can be the expression of distinct substrates, early repolarization or delayed activation abnormality, or mixed forms. Distinguishing between these substrates could significantly improve genetic interpretation, risk stratification, and the therapeutic approach. Further studies are needed for quantitative assessment of the recorded signals and determination of the pathogenesis of inferolateral J waves.

### Ventricular repolarization components on the electrocardiogram: cellular basis and clinical significance [^116txq5n]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Ventricular repolarization components on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) include J (Osborn) waves, ST-segments, and T- and U-waves, which dynamically change in morphology under various pathophysiologic conditions and play an important role in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Our primary objective in this review is to identify the ionic and cellular basis for ventricular repolarization components on the body surface ECG under normal and pathologic conditions, including a discussion of their clinical significance. A specific attempt to combine typical clinical ECG tracings with transmembrane electrical recordings is made to illustrate their logical linkage. A transmural voltage gradient during initial ventricular repolarization, which results from the presence of a prominent transient outward K(+) current (I(to))-mediated action potential (AP) notch in the epicardium, but not endocardium, manifests as a J-wave on the ECG. The J-wave is associated with the early repolarization syndrome and Brugada syndrome. ST-segment elevation, as seen in Brugada syndrome and acute myocardial ischemia, cannot be fully explained by using the classic concept of an "injury current" that flows from injured to uninjured myocardium. Rather, ST-segment elevation may be largely secondary to a loss of the AP dome in the epicardium, but not endocardium. The T-wave is a symbol of transmural dispersion of repolarization. The R-on-T phenomenon (an extrasystole originating on the T-wave of a preceding ventricular beat) is probably due to transmural propagation of phase 2 re-entry or phase 2 early after depolarization that could potentially initiate polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

### Cellular and ionic basis of J-wave syndromes [^115Ac9J4]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

J-wave syndromes are disorders of ventricular repolarization characterized by prominent J waves on the ECG and have the potential to predispose affected individuals to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. These disorders share a common cellular mechanism with prominent Ito in ventricular epicardium. This current causes transmural dispersion of repolarization and the generation of phase 2 reentry, leading to short-coupled extrasystoles and VF. Several autonomic, chemical, and hormonal factors modulate Ito and are therefore vital in attenuating or increasing the arrhythmic potential of these syndromes. Future research should focus on evaluating the arrhythmogenic potential of patients with pathogenic genotypes and/or J waves and no history of VF.

### J-wave syndromes: Brugada and early repolarization syndromes [^112HSUMB]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

A prominent J wave is encountered in a number of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including the Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndromes. Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndromes differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J waves and are thought to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression termed J-wave syndromes. Despite two decades of intensive research, risk stratification and the approach to therapy of these 2 inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes are still undergoing rapid evolution. Our objective in this review is to provide an integrated synopsis of the clinical characteristics, risk stratifiers, and molecular, ionic, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying these 2 fascinating syndromes that have captured the interest and attention of the cardiology community in recent years.

### Transient Brugada-type electrocardiographic abnormalities in renal failure reversed by dialysis [^113NmbnE]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome (BRS) is a hereditary cardiac condition (characteristically with a gene mutation affecting sodium channel function) identified by an elevated terminal portion of the QRS complex (prominent J wave) followed by a descending ST-segment elevation ending in a negative T wave in the right precordial leads, and malignant tachyarrhythmias in patients without demonstrable structural heart disease. We report a patient with a previous history of epilepsy treated with psychotropic drugs (with a sodium channel blocking effect) and chronic renal failure on haemodialysis who developed hyperkalaemia (6.6 mmol/l) and ECG findings resembling BRS. This condition was manifested by the prominent J wave, the coved-type ST-segment elevation and the negative T wave in the right precordial leads. These ECG changes disappeared after haemodialysis when the potassium became normal. Subsequently, a flecainide test did not reproduce ST-segment elevation. We conclude that hyperkalaemia associated with cardiac membrane active drugs may cause ECG changes mimicking the Brugada syndrome.

### The prognostic value of early repolarization (J wave) and ST-segment morphology after J wave in Brugada syndrome: multicenter study in Japan [^11788fhm]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of a J wave and ST-segment morphology after J wave in inferolateral leads in Brugada syndrome (BS) is still unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the prognostic value of a J wave and ST-segment morphology after J wave in a large Japanese cohort of BS.

Methods

A total of 460 consecutive patients with BS (mean age 52 ± 14 years, 432 men) were enrolled. The presence and location of leads showing a J wave, ST-segment morphology after J wave, and clinical outcomes were evaluated in patients with documented ventricular fibrillation (VF) (N = 84), those with syncope without documented VF (N = 109), and subjects without symptoms (N = 267).

Results

The prevalence of a J wave in the inferior and/or lateral leads was 12% (53 cases). The prevalence of a J wave among the 3 groups was not different. The incidence of cardiac events (sudden cardiac death or VF) during a mean follow-up period of 50 ± 32 months was not different in patients with (11%) or without (8%) a J wave. Patients with a J wave in both inferior and lateral leads or with horizontal ST-segment morphology after J wave showed a higher incidence of cardiac events than those without (P = 0.04 and .02, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed symptoms, QRS duration in lead V2 > 90 ms, and inferolateral J wave and/or horizontal ST-segment morphology after J wave were important for predicting cardiac events.

Conclusion

The presence of a J wave in multiple leads and horizontal ST-segment morphology after J wave may indicate a highly arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with BS.

### Early repolarization: a rare primary arrhythmic syndrome and common modifier of arrhythmic risk [^113bRjkQ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite longstanding beliefs, early repolarization is not always a benign electrocardiographic observation. Its association with increased arrhythmic events has been observed in 2 strikingly different groups of individuals, retrospectively in young subjects with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and in long-term cohort studies from the general population. This form of primary electrical disease is now referred to as the early repolarization syndrome and has mechanistically been demonstrated to occur secondary to a transmural gradient of early cellular repolarization, resulting in the presence of an ST-elevation pattern and J-waves merged within or offset from the terminal QRS complex. In addition to creating a milieu of increased arrhythmic risk in isolation, an increasing number of studies have highlighted that the presence of early repolarization and J-waves may provide a baseline electrical substrate that modifies the risk of malignant arrhythmias in other clinical settings, such as acute myocardial ischemia. The challenge ahead lies in discerning when early repolarization may represent an ominous ECG marker, as opposed to a benign entity.

Right atrial abnormality — Right atrial abnormality is typically manifested as an increase in amplitude of the P wave and a tendency to rightward shift of the P-wave vector; a tall upright P wave in lead II (greater than 2.5 mm) is characteristic, and prominent initial positivity of the P wave in V1 or V2 (≥ 1.5 mm [0.15 mV] or more) also indicates right atrial abnormality. Rightward axis of the P wave and a peaked form without increased amplitude are supportive signs. Total P-wave duration is usually normal, but an exception occurs in patients with surgically repaired congenital heart disease (especially those with single-ventricle physiology) where significant P-wave prolongation occurs and is a risk factor for the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Conclusions

The current findings further underline the importance of an initial CMR study in addition to ECG, since the highest frequency of pathological imaging was seen by the use of T1 CMR technique. In our study, hormonal status did not seem to correlate with the observed morphologic changes obtained by CMR, however sporadic fluctuations in testosterone levels may remain undetected but have an impact on the spontaneous occurrence of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^1122Ypyk]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Early repolarization indicates a distinct electrocardiographic (ECG) phenotype affecting the junction (J point or J wave) between the QRS complex and the ST segment in inferolateral leads. It was initially described as a benign ECG finding or found in association with hypothermia. Subsequently, many other conditions producing this phenotype have been described, such as hypercalcemia, acute ischemia, and brain injury.

The link with an increased risk of arrhythmic death was later demonstrated in sporadic cases, in case control studies of unexplained sudden cardiac death (SCD), and in association with various types of structural heart disease (SHD). This article focuses on J-wave syndromes affecting inferolateral leads and reviews the current knowledge and the limitations in risk stratification. In addition, we report new clinical mapping data using high-density electrode mapping, which provides evidence that 2 distinct substrates, delayed depolarization and early repolarization abnormality, underlie inferolateral J-wave syndromes.

VF drivers in the 2 forms of inferolateral J-wave syndromes

VF drivers were mapped using a noninvasive methodand showed dominant drivers in the inferior part of myocardium during the initial stages of VF (Figure 6). VF in patients with J waves indicating delayed depolarization was dominantly associated with drivers in the inferior and anterior right ventricle. In contrast, VF in early repolarization was associated with drivers located in the inferior septum and adjacent regions. Note that this epicardial region overlying the inferior septum may be the breakthrough site of activity originating from the Purkinje posterior fascicle. Importantly, the cycle length of VF (measured at the 10th second after initiation) was significantly shorter in early repolarization than in delayed depolarization (n = 16; 148 ± 5 ms vs 175 ± 4 ms; p = 0.013), consistent with shorter ventricular refractory periods. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the differences between J waves due to early repolarization vs late depolarization.

Early repolarization (ER) risk stratification indicates prognostic value of J-point features: either slurred or notched J-point elevation ≥ 0.2 mV is associated with increased risk in the general population, J-point elevation in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) shows greater amplitude and electrocardiogram (ECG) lead distribution than in cardiac-arrest controls, transient changes in J-point presence and amplitude portend higher VF risk, and a horizontal or descending ST segment following J-point elevation is associated with a worse outcome in the general population.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^114AxDk5]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on these definitions, the results indicate that the ECG J wave can be the phenotypic expression of either delayed depolarization or early repolarization, in the inferior part of ventricles. In patients who had concomitant BrS (spontaneous or provoked by a sodium channel blocker), inferolateral J waves were consistently caused by delayed depolarization of inferior myocardium. In patients without BrS, inferolateral J waves were caused by delayed depolarization in 24% of patients, whereas an ER was the cause of J waves in 76%. Note that the true prevalence of depolarization vs repolarization abnormalities may be different, as the patients were often only referred after quinidine failure, which likely favors a higher proportion of patients with delayed repolarization. Ajmaline testing was performed in all patients and resulted in J-wave amplification or ST elevation in the inferior leads in a few patients. The latter had a delayed depolarization, whereas no patient with early repolarization had J/ST-wave amplification on ajmaline.

ECG features associated with physiological remodeling were the presence of J‐point elevation, early repolarization, biphasic TWIs, and voltage criteria for left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy. 15 On the other side, ECG markers more commonly associated with AC included TWI preceded by an isoelectric or a depressed ST‐segment and the presence of low QRS voltages. Markers in favor of the diagnosis of AC included also symptoms, like syncope, presence of Q waves or precordial QRS voltages < 1.8 mV, three abnormal SAECG parameters, delayed gadolinium enhancement identified by CMR, RV ejection fraction ≤ 45%, or wall motion abnormalities, and presence of premature ventricular beats. 15, 16, 17, 18

Diagnosis of early repolarization/inferolateral J-wave syndrome

Expert consensus recommendations, distinguish an early repolarization ECG pattern (ER) and an early repolarization syndrome. The pattern is defined as the presence of J-point elevation ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous inferior and/or lateral leads of a standard 12-lead ECG. The syndrome is said to be present when the pattern is found in (1) a patient resuscitated from otherwise unexplained ventricular fibrillation (VF); or (2) an SCD victim with a negative autopsy and medical chart review with a previous ECG. The J-point elevation may be a notch or a slur, with or without elevation of the ST segment.

The definition of J wave is sometimes ambiguous because of the small amplitude and spontaneous changes of the signal. J/ST elevation in inferior leads may be more easily missed as the pattern is less stereotypical than the Brugada syndrome (BrS). Bipolar limb leads (I, III, aVF) may be less sensitive than unipolar precordial leads in identifying discrete J/ST-segment abnormalities and in assessing the spatial extent of the J wave. Although no emphasized previously, a J wave may also be negative and less apparent when it follows a negative QRS complex. Figure 1A illustrates these ECG variations.

J waves and idiopathic VF: Risk stratification

Among patients with a history of idiopathic VF, several reports have provided clinical evidence of an increased prevalence of J-wave patterns. In the most recent study from Korea, J waves were observed in 35 of 81 patients (43%) with idiopathic VF and were associated with a higher risk of recurrences. The incidence of idiopathic VF associated with inferolateral J waves is estimated to be 3:100,000. This represents a low absolute risk compared with a prevalence of 1% to 24% in the population. Therefore, the majority of individuals with ER are at minimal risk for arrhythmic events, so asymptomatic patients with no family history of SCD should be reassured.

In symptomatic patients, several ECG markers have been assessed in relation to outcome. However, the spontaneous variability of the J-ST pattern is a limiting factor. Clinical variables such as gender or ethnicity have provided conflicting results in terms of prognostic value. A family history of sudden death has been reported to be more common in association with SCDand likely increases the individual risk. The prognostic value of QRS slurring vs notching, often coexisting or changing in time, is still unclear. The following variables have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of malignant arrhythmias: (1) a horizontal or descending type of ST segment in the inferior leads, as opposed to an upward ST segment; however the prevalence of this more risky ST pattern in controls may be up to 3%, reducing its specific value; (2) a higher magnitude of J waves (> 2.0 mm) in the inferior leads; and (3) an extensive ECG pattern involving anterior (leads V 1 –V 3) and inferior leads.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^115b3jWD]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Early repolarization indicates a distinct electrocardiographic phenotype affecting the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment in inferolateral leads (inferolateral J-wave syndromes). It has been considered a benign electrocardiographic variant for decades, but recent clinical studies have demonstrated its arrhythmogenicity in a small subset, supported by experimental studies showing transmural dispersion of repolarization. Here we review the current knowledge and the issues of risk stratification that limit clinical management. In addition, we report on new mapping data of patients refractory to pharmacologic treatment using high-density electrogram mapping at the time of inscription of J wave. These data demonstrate that distinct substrates, delayed depolarization, and abnormal early repolarization underlie inferolateral J-wave syndromes, with significant implications. Finally, based on these data, we propose a new simplified mechanistic classification of sudden cardiac deaths without apparent structural heart disease.

Electrocardiographic Analyses

The admission ECG for each patient was reviewed at a core laboratory, which included 4 researchers (J. A.B. A.P. J.G. A. and R.M.L.). The reviewers were blinded to patient sex or therapy. Reliability of electrocardiographic reading was tested in 100 randomly selected electrocardiographic tracings. Before starting electrocardiographic reading, intraobserver (1 reader [J. A.B.]) and interobserver (among the 4 readers of the core laboratory) variability was assessed in 100 randomly selected tracings for the following variables: abnormal Q waves, ST‐segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV in ≥ 2 contiguous leads (≥ 0.15 mV for V2–V3), ST‐segment depression ≥ 0.05 mV in ≥ 2 contiguous leads, and negative T waves. Agreement between pairs of observations and the κ index was used as measures of variability. During the reading period, borderline and doubtful cases (ranging from selection of the index tracing when different tracings of the same patient were provided, to diagnosis of QRS fragmentation, hemiblocks, and abnormal Q waves) were discussed with 1 of the core laboratory members (J.B.) and an agreement was reached. Intraobserver agreement for 4 major electrocardiographic findings (abnormal Q waves, ST elevation, ST depression, and T‐wave inversion) ranged between 96% and 99% (κ index, 0.89–0.98), and mean interobserver agreement for the same variables ranged between 87% and 90% (mean κ index, 0.61–0.80). We measured the magnitude of ST‐segment elevation or depression in each lead to the nearest 0.5 mm from a scanned copy of the initial ECG. We defined Q waves as pathological when they had a duration of ≥ 30 ms in ≥ 2 contiguous leads or in the presence of an R wave of ≥ 40 ms in lead V1 and an R > S amplitude in lead V2. 14 The presence of possible confounding factors, such as bundle branch block, ventricular hypertrophy, or poor ECG quality, was noted. We analyzed the following initial electrocardiographic variables: cardiac rhythm, heart rate, PR, QRS, and corrected QT interval duration, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by Sokolow‐Lyon criteria, pathological Q waves, number of leads with ST‐segment elevation or depression, total elevation of the ST segment, total depression of the ST segment (in both cases, the summation in millimeters in all the leads affected), and negative T waves. ST‐segment elevation was measured 0.02 seconds after the J point, and ST depression was measured 0.08 seconds after the J point, in the affected leads in comparison to the T‐P segment. The infarction was considered to be anterior (leads V1–V4), inferior (II, III, and aVF), or lateral (leads I, aVL, and/or V5 and V6). Negative T waves were defined as symmetric T waves of ≥ 0.25‐mV amplitude in ≥ 2 contiguous leads with a prominent R or with R > S amplitude. In cases in which the electrocardiographic findings were complex or ambiguous, the primary reader included any comments or questions in a spreadsheet that was reviewed by other core laboratory members to reach an agreement.

### Electrocardiographic and clinical predictors separating atherosclerotic sudden cardiac death from incident coronary heart disease [^117FCc8d]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify specific ECG and clinical predictors that separate atherosclerotic sudden cardiac death (SCD) from incident coronary heart disease (CHD) (non-fatal events and non-sudden death) in the combined cohorts of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and the Cardiovascular Health Study.

Methods

This analysis included 18,497 participants (58% females, 24% black individuals, mean age 58 years) who were initially free of clinical CHD. A competing risk analysis was conducted to examine the prognostic significance of baseline clinical characteristics and an extensive electronic database of ECG measurements for prediction of 229 cases of SCD as a first event versus 2297 incident CHD cases (2122 non-fatal events and 175 non-sudden death) that occurred during a median follow-up time of 13 years in the Cardiovascular Health Study and 14 years in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.

Results

After adjusting for common CHD risk factors, a number of clinical characteristics and ECG measurements were independently predictive of SCD and CHD. However, the risk of SCD versus incident CHD was significantly different for race/ethnicity, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), heart rate, QTc, abnormally inverted T wave in any ECG lead group and level of ST elevation in V2. Black race/ethnicity (compared to non-black) was predictive of high SCD risk but less risk of incident CHD (p value for differences in the risk (HR) for SCD versus CHD < 0.0001). Hypertension, increased heart rate, prolongation of QTc and abnormally inverted T wave were stronger predictors of high SCD risk compared to CHD (p value = 0.0460, 0.0398, 0.0158 and 0.0265, respectively). BMI was not predictive of incident CHD but was predictive of high SCD risk in a quadratic fashion (p value = 0.0220). On the other hand, elevated ST height as measured at the J point and that measured at 60 ms after the J point in V2 were not predictive of SCD but were predictive of high incident CHD risk (p value = 0.0251 and 0.0155, respectively).

Conclusions

SCD and CHD have many risk factors in common. Hypertension, race/ethnicity, BMI, heart rate, QTc, abnormally inverted T wave in any ECG lead group and level of ST elevation in V2 have the potential to separate between the risks of SCD and CHD. These results need to be validated in another cohort.

### Association between temporal changes in early repolarization pattern with long-term cardiovascular outcome: a population-based cohort study [^115KRX9X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large, community‐based study comprising a biracial population, subjects with baseline ERP, time‐varying ERP, new‐onset ERP, and consistent ERP were at significantly increased risks of SCD and cardiovascular death. However, for those with transient ERP, the ERP seems to be a benign phenomenon. In those with time‐varying ERP, J‐wave amplitudes > 0.2 mV appeared to indicate poor cardiovascular outcomes. A trend toward an increased risk associated with time‐varying ERP in White subjects and women was observed in the outcome of SCD.

In agreement with previous reports of a prevalence of ERP of 2.3% to 20.0%, the overall prevalence of ERP at baseline in our study was 13.1% (8.8% for White subjects, 25.7% for Black subjects). Variation in the prevalence of ERP might be associated with disparity in trait definition, detection technique, and demographical characteristics of the study samples. For instance, previous reports describing the clinical correlates and heritability of ERP that used ST‐segment elevation as a criterion found a prevalence of only 2.3% in the general population. However, other studies that used an approved definition of ERP proposed by experts, which did not include ST‐segment elevation as a required criterion, found that 23.9% to 29.3% of healthy control subjects manifested ERP, which compares with our finding of 13.1% in the general population.

### "Persistent juvenile" T-Wave pattern may not Be persistent: case series and literature review [^114AhDMY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

T-wave inversions (TWI) can signify serious pathology, but may also represent a benign variant. One such variant has been termed the "persistent juvenile" T-wave pattern (PJTWP). It is characterized by TWI in the right precordium, and has been understood to represent an arrested stage of the normal electrocardiographic evolution from childhood.

Case Report

A series of four African-American (AA) women, ages 20 to 43 years, presented to the Emergency Department, and were found to have right precordial TWI that was absent on prior electrocardiograms. The diagnostic evaluation did not reveal acute cardiopulmonary causes for these new TWIs. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The "persistent" juvenile pattern may not be actually persistent in the individual patient. In an appropriate patient, such as a young AA woman, where acute cardiopulmonary disease has been reasonably ruled out, the finding of new right precordial TWI should not preclude the diagnosis of PJTWP.

### Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: current state and future perspectives [^114RqNqF]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anterior TWI in precordial leads exceeding V2 may also be a physiological variant in adolescent athletes of ≤ 14 years, or in black (Afro‐Caribbean) athletes (both adolescent and young adults) when preceded by J‐point elevation and convex ST‐segment elevation, but also in some Caucasian endurance athletes with a persistent "juvenile pattern" 4, 9, 10, 11 (see section: TWI in specific populations).

In the clinical setting, anterior TWI is a recognized hallmark of AC (see Figure 1) and (more rarely) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This pattern is observed in 2% to 4% of patients with HCM, but it may be present in as many as 80% of patients with AC experiencing adverse events. 12, 13 Currently, anterior TWI is a major criterion for the diagnosis of AC. 14 Specifically, inverted T waves in right precordial leads (V1, V2, and V3) or beyond, in individuals > 14 years of age (in the absence of complete right bundle‐branch block QRS ≥ 120 ms) constitute a major diagnostic criterion for AC, while inverted T waves in leads V1 and V2 in individuals > 14 years of age (in the absence of complete right bundle‐branch block) is considered a minor criterion. 14 Conversely, in the presence of complete right bundle‐branch block, only anterior TWI beyond V3 could be considered a minor criterion. 14

### Spontaneous onset of ventricular fibrillation in Brugada syndrome with J wave and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads [^1166byUr]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 52-year-old man with variant Brugada syndrome who was successfully resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation (VF). Resting ECG showed J wave and ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads but no coved or saddleback ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. Pilsicainide infusion provoked coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and mild ST-segment elevation 80 ms after the J point in the inferior leads. During an emergency, 12-lead ECG showed that spontaneous onset of VF was preceded by left bundle branch block and superior axis-type ventricular extrasystoles. The present case provides additional information on the site of origin of VF in patients with Brugada syndrome.

### Clinical and mechanistic issues in early repolarization of normal variants and lethal arrhythmia syndromes [^113YgTD6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Early repolarization, involving ST-segment elevation and, sometimes, prominent J waves at the QRS-ST junction, has been considered a normal electrocardiographic variant for over 60 years. A growing number of case reports and case-control studies indicate that in some instances, early repolarization patterns are associated with increased risk of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Epidemiological evidence indicates a dose effect for the risk of cardiac and sudden death with the extent of J-point elevation. This paper reviews present knowledge regarding the epidemiology, presentation, therapeutic response, and mechanisms characteristic of early repolarization. We highlight major unanswered questions relating to our limited ability to determine which individuals with this common electrocardiographic variant are at risk for sudden death, our incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms, the inadequate information regarding genetic determinants and therapeutic responses, and the unclear relationship between early repolarization and other conditions involving accelerated repolarization and sudden arrhythmic death such as Brugada and short-QT syndromes. This review paper intends to inform the practicing physician about important clinical issues and to stimulate investigators to address the many unresolved questions in this rapidly evolving field.

6.2. Investigation of Sudden Death: Examination of Premorbid Investigations

Individuals who have succumbed to SUD may have had pertinent investigations prior to their death that aid in the diagnosis of the cause of their SUD. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most useful pre-SUD investigation. Although long or short QT interval, spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern, and early repolarization pattern are associated with fatal arrhythmias due to congenital long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, or early repolarization syndrome, – many patients with SUD without structural heart disease have a normal or near-normal ECG, particularly women. Additional ECG findings suggestive of arrhythmic syncope include bifascicular block; intraventricular conduction abnormalities (QRS duration > 0.12 s); Mobitz I second-degree atrioventricular block and first-degree atrioventricular block with markedly prolonged PR interval; sinus bradycardia (< 40 bpm) or slow atrial fibrillation (< 40 bpm); nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; pre-excited QRS complexes; negative T waves in right precordial leads or epsilon waves; and left ventricular hypertrophy, any of which may indicate potential diagnoses of inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as progressive cardiac conduction defect, familial pre-excitation, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the general population, premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are mostly benign; however, some frequent or complex PVCs significantly increase the risk of SCD. – If an ECG is recorded by the AED or EMS just before SCD, features such as J-wave or ST segment elevation (especially if augmented after a long pause) may help in the diagnosis of coronary spasm, early repolarization syndrome, or Brugada syndrome. Interpretation of ECGs obtained immediately after resuscitation/defibrillation should be performed with great caution (see Section 7.4).

Risk in association with SHD

Many studies have suggested that J waves associated with SHD increase the vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias but not to nonarrhythmic cardiac events. In a meta-analysis of 19 studies including 7268 SHD patients, a higher risk was associated with J waves specifically in inferior leads, with a notching configuration, and a horizontal or descending ST segment. An increased arrhythmic risk has also been shown in the event of myocardial ischemia. In an animal model, J waves appearing during left anterior descending artery occlusion were associated with 53% risk of VF.J waves, particularly in the inferior leads, were also associated with increased risk in patients with chronic coronary artery disease, or with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the presence of inferior J waves associated with SHD increases the incidence of arrhythmic events. J waves and their association with other ECG abnormalities (eg, Brugada, long QT, and short QT syndromes) also increase the risk of arrhythmias.

### Tachycardia-dependent augmentation of "notched J waves" in a general patient population without ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest: not a repolarization but a depolarization abnormality? [^116rzv7u]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

J waves can be observed in individuals of the general population, but electrocardiographic characteristics are poorly understood.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the J-wave dynamicity in a general patient population.

Methods

The responses of J waves (> 0.1 mV above the isoelectric line in 2 contiguous leads) to varying RR intervals were analyzed. Patients with aborted sudden cardiac death, documented ventricular fibrillation, or a family history of sudden cardiac death were excluded. The J-wave amplitude was measured at baseline, in beats with short RR intervals in conducted atrial premature beats (APBs) or atrial stimulation during the electrophysiology study, and in the beats next to APBs with prolonged RR intervals.

Results

Mainly notched J waves were identified in 94 of 701 (24.5%) general patients (13.4%), and APBs were present in 23 of 94 (24.5%) patients. The mean baseline amplitude of J waves was 0.20 ± 0.06 mV at the baseline RR interval of 853 ± 152 ms, 0.25 ± 0.11 mV at the RR interval in the conducted APB of 545 ± 133 ms (P = 0.0018), and 0.19 ± 0.08 mV at the RR interval of 1146 ± 314 ms (P = 0.3102). The clinical characteristics were not different between patients with and without tachycardia-dependent augmentation of J waves. Augmentation of J waves was confirmed by the electrophysiology study: 0.28 ± 0.12 mV vs 0.42 ± 0.11 mV at baseline and in the beats of atrial stimulation, respectively (P = 0.0001). However, no bradycardia-dependent augmentation (> 0.05 mV) was observed. Such tachycardia-dependent augmentation can represent depolarization abnormality rather than repolarization abnormality.

Conclusion

J waves in a general patient population were augmented at shorter RR intervals, but not at prolonged RR intervals. Mechanistically, conduction delay is most likely responsible for this.

### A 69-year-old woman with extended negative T wave [^111jHwC1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Answer

B. Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy

Extended negative T waves in a 12-lead ECG can be found in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, pericarditis and apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In this patient, pericarditis was unlikely because there was no ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was also unlikely because of the prolonged QT intervaland the lack of negative T waves with a strain pattern. However, it was challenging to differentiate an AMI from a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with a 12-lead ECG.

Negative T wave locations in an 18-lead ECG provide the critical clue to differentiate between the two diseases. Negative T waves in precordial (V1, V2, V3, V4), inferior (especially in II) and posterolateral (V6, syn-V7, syn-V8 and syn-V9) leads reflect pathological conditions of the anterior, inferior and posterolateral myocardium the possibility of a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be strongly considered because simultaneous changes in these leads in an AMI is extremely rare.

Early repolarization pattern — definition, prevalence, and risk: Early repolarization pattern is characterized by a distinct J point and ST elevation in the lateral or inferolateral leads and is more prevalent in young athletes, particularly African Americans, with 70% of the subjects being male; early repolarization ECG pattern (≥ 1 mm) in the inferior/lateral leads occurs in 1% to 13% of the general population and in 15% to 70% of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) cases, and population-based studies have shown association with increased risk of cardiac death; one study showed that the presence of a J wave increased the risk of VF from 3.4/100000 to 11.0/100000, but given the low incidence of VF the absolute risk remains low and, in patients with syncope, the clinical significance of the early repolarization pattern is unknown.

### ECG features and proarrhythmic potentials of therapeutic hypothermia [^114Ri4Xv]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothermia can induce ECG J waves. Recent studies suggest that J waves may be associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with structurally normal hearts. However, little is known about the ECG features, clinical significance or arrhythmogenic potentials of therapeutic hypothermia (TH)-induced J waves.

Methods

We analysed ECGs from 240 patients who underwent TH at six major university hospitals in Korea between August 2010 and December 2013. The prevalence, amplitudes and distributions of the J waves and the development of malignant arrhythmia were analysed.

Results

The average patient body temperature was 33.5 ± 1.0°C during TH. J waves were observed in 98 patients (40.8%). They were newly developed in 91 cases, and pre-existing J waves were augmented in seven patients. J waves during TH were primarily observed in leads II, III, aVF and V4–6. The average amplitude of the J waves was 0.239 ± 0.152mV. There were four VF events during TH. These events occurred in three patients who were finally diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, idiopathic VF or early repolarisation syndrome, respectively, and in one patient with non-cardiac aetiology (asphyxia).

Conclusions

J waves were recorded in about 40% of the patients who received TH. They were most frequently observed in the inferior limb leads or lateral precordial leads. Life-threatening VF occurred only rarely (1.7%) during TH and were mainly observed in patients with primary arrhythmic disorder. Although a causal relationship between TH-induced J waves and VF remains unknown, administering TH to this potentially susceptible, high-risk population may require careful attention.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^112KEyVn]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical significance

The ECG pattern of early repolarization was first reported in 1936 as a normal variant. In 1938, Tomaszewskidescribed a slow deflection between the QRS complex and the ST segment in an accidentally hypothermic man. In 1953, Osborndescribed a "current of injury" in experimental acidosis and hypothermia in dogs and which was often associated with the development of VF.

The ER was known for decades to be an innocent ECG feature that was more common in young men and in athletes, with a prevalence varying between 1% to 24% in the general population. However, case reports of unexpected SCD associated with an inferolateral J-wave abnormality were published as early as 1984, most of them concerning victims from Japan and Southeast Asia. Then, the potential arrhythmogenicity of ER was shown in wedge preparations by Yan and Antzelevitch. Finally, a definitive association between J waves and the pathogenesis of idiopathic VF was described in case control studies. Although these results have raised some concerns for the affected patients, the high prevalence of J waves in the general population causes them to portend a low absolute arrhythmia risk.

Risk in asymptomatic subjects

The prevalence of J waves in athletes is reported to be as high as 44%. In a study of 704 athletes (14% with a J wave) with follow-up of 6 years, there was no observation of arrhythmic events. Similarly, no association with higher risk of death was observed during long-term follow-up in young adults with J waves. Interestingly, a correlation was found between J-point elevation and septal hypertrophy, as well as a possible link with exercise-induced hypertrophy. False tendons have also been related to the genesis of J waves, potentially through altered depolarization in the Purkinje system due to localized stretching. Although J waves are common in African Americans, it is estimated that there is no increased risk in this subgroup, whereas a higher risk may be present in Asian populations. Noteworthy, the definition of ER in the previous literature varies in terms of J-wave or ST-elevation pattern; it may include individuals with only ST elevation and no J wave, which impacts on the reported prognostic value.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: new concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^113oz9Dx]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that in a previous noninvasive mapping study, Zhang et aldid not observe conduction abnormalities in inferolateral J-wave syndrome during sinus rhythm. A likely explanation is that the small depolarization fronts that are responsible for the late fractionated electrograms cannot be recognized as such by a mathematical inverse solution from body surface potentials.

Examples of J waves caused by late depolarization are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The fragmented electrograms occurred timely during the inscription of J waves and were in continuity with the depolarization field. The majority of abnormal electrograms were found on the epicardium (right ventricle and 2 cases in left ventricle), whereas 2 patients had late electrograms recorded endocardially and epicardially. They were recorded predominantly in the inferior right ventricle, at the sites of terminal activation as predicted by a modeling study. In the patients with BrS and inferolateral J-wave syndromes, the electrograms recorded in the inferior right ventricle were similar to those in the right ventricular outflow tract. The pathogenesis of inferolateral J waves here is dominantly due to abnormal delayed conduction, either limited to the inferior myocardium (right or left, endo- or epicardial) or combined with other locations (eg, anterior right ventricle). The cause responsible for electrogram fractionation (altered myocardial cells or their connections, fibrotic or fatty tissue infiltrations) is undetermined. In addition. not only a heterogeneous delay of activation but also a homogeneous delayed activation may lead to a J-wave. Finally, there is probably a potential contribution of a repolarization disparity (secondary to the depolarization alterations) to explain a part of J/ST-wave fluctuations or arrhythmogenesis, which requires additional studies.

### Subepicardial cardiomyopathy: a disease underlying J-wave syndromes and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation [^112L46BD]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence of Structural Disease in These Phenotypes

The presence of an apparently abnormal myocardial substrate in BrS has been widely reported in the literature, but the histological descriptions vary. Cardiomyopathic changes, including myocardial fibrofatty replacement of the RV free wall or the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, have been described in a series of studies. – Microstructural abnormalities have been reported in an earlier case series of 6 individuals with apparent iVF, one of whom fulfilled contemporary electrocardiographic criteria for BrS. A recent study by Miles et alreported pathological and clinical characteristics in a group of 28 decedents with BrS compared with control subjects without cardiac death. Quantitative analysis of cardiac tissue components demonstrated a 45% increase in collagen content among the BrS group compared with control subjects. Increases in collagen were observed across all sampled regions of RV and left ventricular myocardium, with the highest collagen proportions within the subepicardium of the RVOT. These findings suggest that fibrosis predominates in RV subepicardial myocardium but also appears to represent an adverse remodeling process in both ventricles. However, the syndromic description of BrS classifies patients as having RVOT disease, failing to recognize its true extent.

Although BrS and ERS are often considered distinct arrhythmia syndromes, overlapping clinical and pathophysiological features are increasingly recognized. It has been proposed that the electrocardiographic J wave, previously characterized in experimental studies by accentuation of the notch in the subepicardial action potential (caused by the transient outward potassium current [I to]), can also be caused by or related to activation delay, underpinning a spectrum of BrS and ERS disease phenotypes associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The conventional view of ERS as an exclusive disorder of enhanced local early repolarization in the absence of apparent structural cardiac abnormalities has also been challenged. Boukens et alrecently documented the presence of fibrosis within regions of inferior RV myocardium colocalizing with electrophysiological J waves observed during epicardial unipolar mapping. Here, transmural myocardial biopsies were obtained from a patient with ERS with recurrent VF undergoing epicardial mapping and ablation. High-resolution activation mapping identified the latest moment of electrical activation within the inferior RV free wall, in which high-amplitude local J waves were present on unipolar recordings occurring after the moment of slurring/notching in the QRS complex of the ECG. Extensive subepicardial fibrosis was observed histologically, along with fragments of surviving myocardium.

We present an interesting case of a 49-year-old woman with hypothermia and associated Osborn waves (also called J waves) on ECG. She was found on the floor of her home and difficult to arouse. On arrival to the emergency department (ED), her rectal temperature was 87.5°F. ECG showed Osborn waves in diffuse leads. She was intubated in the ED and was started on vasopressor support for hypotension refractory to intravenous fluid boluses. She was transferred to the critical care unit for continued respiratory and cardiovascular support. With active external rewarming her core body temperature continued to improve. Blood pressure also improved and vasopressor was tapered off. She was extubated and was transferred to the medical floor for continued supportive care. Osborn waves on ECG resolved within 12h of achieving normal range body temperature. The patient was eventually discharged home with medical follow-up.

ECG Evaluations

All of the 307 patients performed a treadmill exercise test (TMT). All ECGs were recorded without the use of any cardiac drugs. We explained the methods, requirements, and risks of the exercise test and obtained informed consent before the TMT. A repeat exercise test was performed in 140 patients at ≥ 1 month after the first exercise test. The protocol of the exercise test was the Bruce protocol with symptom‐limited or submaximal exercise (up to 90% of maximum predicted heart rate by age). A 12‐lead ECG with leads V1 and V2 located at the third intercostal spaces was recorded at rest, at every stage during exercise, at peak exercise, and every 1 minute during the recovery phase to 5 minutes and 20 seconds after exercise with a low‐pass filter of 0 to 25 Hz. We evaluated heart rate, blood pressure, ST‐segment levels as the J point in leads V1 and V2, and occurrence of arrhythmias in each ECG recording phase. ST‐segment elevation was measured as the calculated mean of 3 successive beats. ST‐segment augmentation after exercise was defined as ST‐segment amplitude increase ≥ 0.05 mV in one of leads V1 and V2 in the early recovery phase of the exercise test (2 and 3 minutes after peak exercise). 4 To classify the morphologies of the exercise‐related premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), we defined morphologies of PVCs as superior axis (0° to −90° and +180° to +270°) and inferior axis (0° to +180°) in limb leads and right bundle‐branch block (RBBB) type (voltage of R wave ≥ voltage of S wave in lead V1) and left bundle‐branch block (LBBB) type (voltage of R wave < voltage of S wave in lead V1). ECG patterns were reviewed blindly by 3 cardiologists (HM, TK, and SA).

Early repolarization syndrome epidemiology and risk — The prevalence of an early repolarization pattern on ECG with J point elevation in the inferior or lateral leads of at least 0.1 mV has been reported to be as high as 5.8% in adults and is more common in males, and the early repolarization pattern was lost during 10-year follow-up in > 60% of young males. Patients with cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation in the setting of an electrocardiographic pattern of early repolarization are at increased risk for subsequent recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation, occurring in at least 40% of patients. Patients with early repolarization are more susceptible to the development of ventricular fibrillation during acute cardiac ischemia and/or in the presence of QRS abnormalities due to LV hypertrophy or bundle-branch block, antiarrhythmic medications, with the exception of quinidine/ hydroquinidine, have limited efficacy in preventing recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, and to date genetic testing has not reliably identified mutations predisposing to early repolarization.

FIGURE 3
Anterior T‐wave inversion (TWI) in a 28‐year‐old male black athlete practicing basketball. On the left, the ECG showed negative T waves from V1 to V4 preceded by J‐point elevation and convex ST‐segment elevation; the electrocardiogram was collected at peak training. On the right, the electrocardiogram of the same athlete recorded after the period of low training regimen: a complete positivization of anterior TWI is observed after detraining in this subject, supporting the physiological interpretation of these data. ECG, electrocardiogram

A comparison between anterior TWI in groups of black and white healthy athletes, with patients with HCM and AC, demonstrated that both in white and black athletes the presence of TWI in leads V1 to V4 preceded by J‐point elevation ≥ 1 mm excluded a cardiomyopathy (100% negative predictive value). 10 A recent study by McClean et al investigated the prevalence and distribution of TWI in an adolescent and young population of Arab and black athletes (aged 11‐18 years) and reported that 15.8% presented anterior TWI, in the majority of cases confined to leads V1 to V3. 33 In this study, the prevalence of anterior TWI and of Jt elevation was higher in Arabic athletes aged < 16 years and in black athletes. Of notice, in three black athletes, a cardiac disease was diagnosed; in these cases, TWI in leads V1 to V4 was associated with other abnormal features, such as lateral TWI, Q waves, or wide QRS. Therefore, the interpretation of ECG in black athletes may be challenging, but the knowledge of physiological ECG variants in this ethnicity may useful to reduce the burden of false‐positive ECGs and to distinguish between physiological and pathological remodeling.

In summary, anterior TWI in black athletes should be considered a common ECG finding in presence of a J‐point elevation and convex ST‐segment elevation followed by TWI in V2‐V4, as recommended. 7 Conversely, when anterior TWI is associated with other ECG anomalies or when the characteristics of anterior TWI does not suggest a benign pattern of repolarization (eg, TWI preceded by ST‐segment depression of deep TWI), further investigations are recommended.

### J wave… [^1118p9qk]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

A J wave — also known as Osborn wave, camel-hump sign, late delta wave, hathook junction, hypothermic wave, K wave, H wave or current of injury — is an abnormal electrocardiogram finding. J waves are positive deflections occurring at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment, where the S point, also known as the J point, has a myocardial infarction-like elevation. Causes They are usually observed in people suffering from hypothermia with a temperature of less than 32 °C, though they may also occur in people with very high blood levels of calcium, brain injury, vasospastic angina, acute pericarditis, or they could also be a normal variant. Osborn waves on ECG are frequent during targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest, particularly in patients treated with 33 °C.

Osborn waves are not associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia, and may be considered a benign physiological phenomenon, associated with lower mortality in univariable analyses. Mechanism The J wave reflects the transmural gradient of amplitude of the cardiac transient outward K+ current: channels responsible for this current exhibit differential expression across ventricular myocardium, producing a more potent current in the epicardium than the endocardium. History The prominent J deflection attributed to hypothermia was first reported in 1938 by Tomaszewski. These waves were then definitively described in 1953 by John J. Osborn and were named in his honor. Over time, the wave has increasingly been referred to as a J wave, though is still sometimes referred to as the Osborn wave in most part due to Osborn's article in the American Journal of Physiology on experimental hypothermia.

### Repolarization… [^115wMXRT]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Repolarization typically results from the movement of positively charged K⁺ ions out of the cell. The repolarization phase of an action potential initially results in hyperpolarization, attainment of a membrane potential, termed the afterhyperpolarization, that is more negative than the resting potential. Repolarization usually takes several milliseconds. In this afterhyperpolarization, the cell sits at more negative potential than rest due to the slow inactivation of voltage gated K⁺ delayed rectifier channels, which are the primary K⁺ channels associated with repolarization. At these low voltages, all of the voltage gated K^+^ channels close, and the cell returns to resting potential within a few milliseconds. A cell which is experiencing repolarization is said to be in its absolute refractory period. Other voltage gated K⁺ channels which contribute to repolarization include A-type channels and Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels.

Protein transport molecules are responsible for Na⁺ out of the cell and K⁺ into the cell to restore the original resting ion concentrations. Deviations from normal repolarization Blockages in repolarization can arise due to modifications of the voltage-gated K⁺ channels. This is demonstrated with selectively blocking voltage gated K⁺ channels with the antagonist tetraethylammonium. By blocking the channel, repolarization is effectively stopped. Dendrotoxins are another example of a selective pharmacological blocker for voltage gated K⁺ channels. The lack of repolarization means that neuron stays at a high voltage, which slows sodium channel deactivation to a point where there is not enough inwards Na⁺ current to depolarize and sustain firing. Voltage gated K⁺ mechanisms The structure of the voltage gated K⁺ channel is that of six transmembrane helices along the lipid bilayer.

The selectivity of this channel to voltage is mediated by four of these transmembrane domains – the voltage sensing domain. The other two domains form the pore by which ions traverse. Activation and deactivation of the voltage gated K^+^ channel is triggered by conformational changes in the voltage sensing domain. Specifically, the S4 domain moves such that it activates and deactivates the pore. During activation, there is outward S4 motion, causing tighter VSD-pore linkage. Deactivation is characterized by inward S4 motion. The four types are Kᵥ1, Kᵥ2, Kᵥ3 and Kᵥ4. The Kᵥ1 channel primarily influences the repolarization of the axon. The Kᵥ2 channel is characteristically activated slower. The Kᵥ4 channels are characteristically activated rapidly. The rate of repolarization closely regulates the amount of Ca²⁺ ions entering the cell.

When large quantities of Ca^2+^ ions enter the cell due to extended repolarization periods, the neuron may die, leading to the development of stroke or seizures. The Kᵥ1 channels are found to contribute to repolarization of pyramidal neurons, likely associated with an upregulation of the Kᵥ4 channels. The Kᵥ2 channels were not found to contribute to repolarization rate as blocking these channels did not result in changes in neuron repolarization rates. Repolarization of atria cells Another type of K⁺ channel that helps to mediate repolarization in the human atria is the SK channel, which are K⁺ channels which are activated by increases in Ca²⁺ concentration. "SK channel" stands for a small conductance calcium activated potassium channel, and the channels are found in the heart. SK channels specifically act in the right atrium of the heart, and have not been found to be functionally important in the ventricles of the human heart.

### T wave… [^114nSh3m]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

In electrocardiography, the T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles. The interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the apex of the T wave is referred to as the absolute refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period or vulnerable period. The T wave contains more information than the QT interval. The T wave can be described by its symmetry, skewness, slope of ascending and descending limbs, amplitude and subintervals like the Tpeak–Tend interval. In most leads, the T wave is positive. This is due to the repolarization of the membrane. During ventricle contraction, the heart depolarizes. Repolarization of the ventricle happens in the opposite direction of depolarization and is negative current, signifying the relaxation of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles.

But this negative flow causes a positive T wave; although the cell becomes more negatively charged, the net effect is in the positive direction, and the ECG reports this as a positive spike. However, a negative T wave is normal in lead aVR. Lead V1 generally have a negative T wave. In addition, it is not uncommon to have a negative T wave in lead III, aVL, or aVF. A periodic beat-to-beat variation in the amplitude or shape of the T wave may be termed T wave alternans. Cardiac physiology The refractory period of cardiac muscle is distinct from that of skeletal muscle. Nerves that innervate skeletal muscle have an extremely short refractory period after being subjected to an action potential. This can lead to sustained or tetanic contraction. In the heart, contractions must be spaced to maintain a rhythm. Unlike in muscle, repolarization occurs at a slow rate.

This prevents the heart from undergoing sustained contractions because it forces the refractory period and cardiac action potential firing to be of the same length of time. Repolarization depends on the charges of ions and their flow across membranes. In skeletal muscle cells, repolarization is simple. First, sodium ions flow into the cell to depolarize it and cause skeletal muscle contraction. Once the action potential is over, potassium ions flow out of the cell due to increased cell membrane permeability to those ions. This high permeability contributes to the rapid repolarization of the membrane potential. This repolarization occurs quickly enough that another action potential can cause depolarization before the last action potential has dissipated. Cardiac muscle differs in that there are more calcium channels that counteract the potassium channels. While potassium quickly flows out of the cell, calcium slowly flows into the cell.

This causes the repolarization to occur more slowly, making the refractory period as long as the action potential, preventing sustained contractions. The T wave is representative of the repolarization of the membrane. In an EKG reading, the T wave is notable because it must be present before the next depolarization. An absent or strangely shaped T wave may signify disruption in repolarization or another segment of the heartbeat. Normal T wave Normally, T waves are upright in all leads, except aVR and V1 leads. Highest amplitude of T wave is found at V2 and V3 leads. The shape of the T wave is usually asymmetrical with a rounded peak. T wave inversions from V2 to V4 leads are frequently found and normal in children. In normal adults, T wave inversions from V2 to V3 are less commonly found but can be normal. The depth of the T wave also becomes progressively shallow from one to the next lead.
