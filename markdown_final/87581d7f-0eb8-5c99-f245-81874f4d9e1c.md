## Question

A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 6-day history of fever, severe muscle pain, and diffuse, painful swelling of his neck, underarms, and groin area. The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?

Answer Choices:
A. DNA helicase
B. Ribosomal assembly
C. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis
D. Glucuronosyltransferase
E. Topoisomerase II activity
F. Lipid synthesis
G. RNA polymerase activity
H. Cell wall synthesis
I. Proteasomal degradation
J. Phospholipase function

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cellular process or enzyme is targeted by the most effective antibiotic for a 25-year-old man with bubonic plague, given his clinical presentation and epidemiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify the first-line antibiotic and its mechanism of action. Next, I will map that mechanism to the provided answer choices. Finally, I will double-check alternatives and confirm the best match, correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and epidemiology. The triad of fever, severe myalgias, and painful lymphadenopathy (buboes) in the neck, axillae, and groin, following exposure in the Southwestern United States, is classic for bubonic plague due to Yersinia pestis, especially with a necrotic eschar or draining lesion suggesting flea-bite inoculation and regional lymphadenitis, so I should anchor on plague as the leading diagnosis [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line therapy before I jump to mechanisms. For plague, including bubonic disease, the recommended first-line antibiotic is streptomycin, with gentamicin as an alternative; streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that exerts bactericidal activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and disrupting protein synthesis, which directly implicates ribosomal assembly and translation as the target process [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism mapping to the choices. Among the options, "ribosomal assembly" best captures the 30S ribosome target and translation inhibition by aminoglycosides, whereas the other choices either reflect different antibiotic classes or non-antibiotic processes; for example, topoisomerase inhibition corresponds to fluoroquinolones, cell wall synthesis to beta-lactams, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis relates to off-target effects of linezolid rather than streptomycin, so those would be incorrect here [^24606343] [^1fa5dc91] [^012eab74].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "DNA helicase" might be involved because aminoglycosides are sometimes broadly described as interfering with nucleic acid processes, but that would be misleading; aminoglycosides do not directly inhibit DNA helicase, and their primary target is the ribosome, so I should correct that and stick with ribosomal assembly as the accurate answer [^f67ff5fb].

> I should double-check the alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a better fit. Topoisomerase II activity is a fluoroquinolone target, cell wall synthesis is beta-lactam territory, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis pertains to linezolid toxicity, none of which match streptomycin's 30S ribosomal mechanism, reinforcing that ribosomal assembly is the correct choice here [^24606343] [^1fa5dc91] [^012eab74].

> Final answer: The most effective antibiotic for this patient's bubonic plague is streptomycin, which interferes with ribosomal assembly by binding the 30S ribosomal subunit and disrupting protein synthesis, so the correct choice is B. Ribosomal assembly [^f67ff5fb].

---

The most effective antibiotic for this patient's bubonic plague is **streptomycin** or **gentamicin**, both aminoglycosides that bind the 30S ribosomal subunit and disrupt ribosomal assembly, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and causing bacterial death [^f67ff5fb]. The correct answer is **B. Ribosomal assembly**.

---

## Clinical diagnosis and epidemiological context

The patient's presentation — fever, severe muscle pain, and painful swelling of the neck, underarms, and groin — is classic for **bubonic plague**, especially with a history of exposure in New Mexico, where plague is endemic. The necrotic, draining lesion on the upper extremity is consistent with a bubo, a hallmark of bubonic plague.

---

## Pathophysiology of Yersinia pestis

Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a Gram-negative bacterium that **proliferates within lymphatic tissue**, causing severe inflammation, necrosis, and the formation of buboes. The bacterium also produces virulence factors, including the F1 capsule and V antigen, which contribute to immune evasion and systemic dissemination.

---

## Mechanism of action of streptomycin and gentamicin

Streptomycin and gentamicin are **aminoglycoside antibiotics** that exert their bactericidal effect by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby disrupting ribosomal assembly and inhibiting protein synthesis. This disruption leads to the production of aberrant proteins, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and ultimately bacterial cell death.

---

## Specific cellular process targeted by streptomycin and gentamicin

The specific cellular process targeted by streptomycin and gentamicin is **ribosomal assembly**, which is essential for protein synthesis in bacteria. By binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, these antibiotics prevent the correct assembly of ribosomes, thereby halting protein synthesis and causing bacterial death.

---

## Clinical implications of ribosomal assembly inhibition

Inhibition of ribosomal assembly by streptomycin and gentamicin results in **rapid bactericidal activity**, which is crucial in the treatment of severe infections such as bubonic plague. This mechanism of action also explains the effectiveness of these antibiotics against Yersinia pestis, as the bacterium relies heavily on protein synthesis for survival and proliferation.

---

## Alternative antibiotics and their mechanisms of action

While streptomycin and gentamicin are the first-line treatments for bubonic plague, alternative antibiotics include:

- **Doxycycline**: Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, similar to aminoglycosides.
- **Ciprofloxacin**: Inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, thereby disrupting DNA replication and repair.
- **Chloramphenicol**: Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.

However, for this specific case, **streptomycin or gentamicin** remains the most effective choice due to their rapid bactericidal activity and proven efficacy in treating bubonic plague.

---

## Conclusion

The most effective antibiotic for this patient's bubonic plague is **streptomycin or gentamicin**, both of which interfere with ribosomal assembly, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and causing bacterial death. The correct answer is **B. Ribosomal assembly**.

### Antibiotics and resistance in dermatology: focus on treating the elderly [^c3fe7fcd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Although elderly patients are at an increased risk for skin infections, the chief culprits are no different than in younger patients. However, many of these organisms have developed resistance to antibiotics. Resistance increases the morbidity, mortality, and cost of treating infections. The mechanisms by which resistance occurs include efflux of antibiotic through a cellular pump, inactivation of the antibiotic by enzymes, or changes in the target affinity for the antibiotic. For dermatologic conditions in the elderly, documented resistance is seen in staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. Clinicians can reduce the development of resistance by following infection control and antibiotic use guidelines. To optimize the antibiotic effect and minimize adverse effects in the elderly, pharmacokinetic changes seen with aging should guide antibiotic choice and dosing.

### Antibiotics in critically ill children-a narrative review on different aspects of a rational approach [^7b34995f]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Antibiotics can save lives, but at the same time exert harm to the individual by multiple mechanisms, ranging from direct impairment of cellular function to disturbance of physiological homeostasis and even contributing to the development of new diseases. Awareness of these potential harms must become an essential part of physician's decision-making for or against antibiotic treatment.

Critically ill children may be a patient group that needs wise decision-making on antibiotic therapies even more than others. Important aspects to consider on the path to adequate antibiotic treatment are diagnostic approaches to identify pathogens and guide antibiotic treatment, timing of antibiotics, empiric and targeted therapy, and therapeutic drug monitoring. To guide decision-making, we developed 6 key questions to answer before the initiation of antibiotic therapy in critically ill children.

### Antibiotic efficacy in the complex infection environment [^c18f860b]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Accurate prediction of antimicrobial efficacy is essential for successful treatment of bacterial infection. Beyond genetically encoded mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, the determinants of antibiotic susceptibility during infection remain poorly understood, and treatment failure is common. Traditional antibiotic susceptibility testing fails to account for extrinsic determinants of antibiotic susceptibility present in the complex infection environment and is therefore a poor predictor of antibiotic treatment outcome. Here we discuss how host-pathogen interaction, microbial interspecies interaction, and metabolic heterogeneity contribute to the success or failure of antibiotic therapy. Consideration of these factors during the treatment of disease will improve our ability to successfully resolve recalcitrant bacterial infection and improve patient health.

### How antibiotics kill bacteria: from targets to networks [^6914de99]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic drug-target interactions, and their respective direct effects, are generally well characterized. By contrast, the bacterial responses to antibiotic drug treatments that contribute to cell death are not as well understood and have proven to be complex as they involve many genetic and biochemical pathways. In this Review, we discuss the multilayered effects of drug-target interactions, including the essential cellular processes that are inhibited by bactericidal antibiotics and the associated cellular response mechanisms that contribute to killing. We also discuss new insights into these mechanisms that have been revealed through the study of biological networks, and describe how these insights, together with related developments in synthetic biology, could be exploited to create new antibacterial therapies.

### Mapping the perturbome network of cellular perturbations [^5dd6f27f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Biological function relies on the careful orchestration of numerous and diverse cellular components and their interactions. Disease states, but also therapeutic interventions, can be viewed as perturbations of this intricate system, either driving it away from homeostasis, or aiming to restore it, respectively. Understanding the combined effect of independent perturbations lies at the core of many fundamental, as well as practical challenges in current biology and medicine. Combination therapies, for example, provide promising new treatment strategies for diseases ranging from cancer to bacterial or viral infections. At the same time, interactions between drugs and/or comorbidities may also induce unexpected side effects. Adverse reactions are a primary cause for the failure of clinical trialsand represent a major challenge in drug development and repurposing –. Especially for elderly patients, for whom a combination of several disease conditions and simultaneous drug treatments is not uncommon, adverse effects can be a severe threat. Both for avoiding such detrimental effects, and for rationally designing beneficial combinations of therapeutic and/or disease associated perturbations, we need to first understand how different perturbations interact with each other.

Molecular networks provide a unifying platform to systematically investigate the combined effects of perturbations of biological systems. In recent years, an increasingly detailed network diagram of the complex machinery of interacting molecules that constitutes the basis of (patho-) physiological states has become available. Network-based analyses revealed an intimate relationship between structural properties of this interactome network of protein–protein interactions (PPIs), its functional organization, and consequences of its perturbation. The most essential cellular components, as well as genes associated with severe diseases, tend to be located at the center of the interactome. Genes that are associated with the same disease aggregate in specific network neighborhoods, or "disease modules". The closeness of a drug's target(s) to a disease module is related to its efficacy, but also to side effects that may occur. This again highlights our lack of a systematic understanding of how independent perturbations influence each other.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^cbc626df]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we aimed to systematically study how population growth dynamics are shaped by a broad panel of drugs in a single, well-characterized model system. We monitored the growth curves of E. coli exposed to twenty-one antibiotics and seventeen non-antibiotic drugs, that span diverse mechanisms, across a range of concentrations. Using the modified Gompertz equation, we quantitatively characterized changes in key growth parameters across drugs and concentrations and developed a mathematical framework to infer drug-induced growth phenotypes at comparable toxicity levels. A comparison of phenotypes revealed that drugs elicit considerably different inhibition phenotypes, such as how they influence the growth rate, and that even drugs targeting the same cellular process can produce distinct effects on growth dynamics. By testing the impact of different antibiotic resistance cassettes on growth curves, we identified enzymatic inactivation as a key factor that can influence growth inhibition phenotypes. Follow up experiments, using a functional assay for detecting drug inactivation, revealed that drug inactivation is a key factor underlying variation in inhibition phenotypes observed across the drug panel. Taken together, our results suggest that drug inactivation, rather than the drug's cellular target, is a major causal factor influencing growth inhibition phenotypes.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^a34bc4df]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic drugs target key cellular processes to arrest bacterial growth and, in some cases, kill the cells. Surveys of drug toxicity in different bacterial species have established that numerous non-antibiotic drugs, medications not administered to treat infectious diseases, can inhibit bacterial growth –. At subinhibitory drug concentrations, bacterial growth inhibition is incomplete, and compounds can influence different aspects of cell morphology and population growth dynamics. Such influences can be quantified by imaging single cells with a microscope, and by monitoring changes in optical density in batch cultures growing in liquid media. Interestingly, while changes in cellular morphology have been consistently associated with the mechanism of action underlying drug toxicity, far less is known about the factors that determine how growth phenotypes of bacterial cultures are reshaped by different drugs. Resolving what can be learned about bacteria–drug interactions from bulk-culture phenotypes is valuable, given the ubiquity and high throughput of standard microplate-reader assays.

### Mumps… [^41bb631b]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus. Initial symptoms of mumps are non-specific and include fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, and loss of appetite. These symptoms are usually followed by painful swelling around the side of the face, which is the most common symptom of a mumps infection. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure to the virus. About one-third of people with a mumps infection do not have any symptoms. Signs and symptoms Common symptoms The incubation period, the time between the start of an infection and when symptoms begin to show, is about 7–25 days, averaging 16–18 days. 20–40% of infections are asymptomatic or are restricted to mild respiratory symptoms, sometimes with a fever. Over the course of the disease, three distinct phases are recognized: prodromal, early acute, and established acute.

The prodromal phase typically has non-specific, mild symptoms such as a low-grade fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and sore throat. In the early acute phase, as the mumps virus spreads throughout the body, systemic symptoms emerge. Most commonly, parotitis occurs during this time period. During the established acute phase, orchitis, meningitis, and encephalitis may occur, and these conditions are responsible for the bulk of mumps morbidity. Complications Outside of the salivary glands, inflammation of the testes, called orchitis, is the most common symptom of infection. Pain, swelling, and warmness of a testis appear usually 1–2 weeks after the onset of parotitis but can occur up to six weeks later. During mumps orchitis, the scrotum is tender and inflamed. It occurs in 10–40% of pubertal and post-pubertal males who contract mumps. Usually, mumps orchitis affects only one testis but in 10–30% of cases both are affected.

Mumps orchitis is accompanied by inflammation of the epididymis, called epididymitis, about 85% of the time, typically occurring before orchitis. The onset of mumps orchitis is associated with a high-grade fever, vomiting, headache, and malaise. In prepubertal males, orchitis is rare as symptoms are usually restricted to parotitis.
- Aseptic meningitis, inflammation of the meninges, in 5–10% of cases and 4–6% of those with parotitis, typically occurring 4–10 days after the onset of symptoms. Mumps meningitis can also occur up to one week before parotitis as well as in the absence of parotitis. It is commonly accompanied by fever, headache, vomiting, and neck stiffness.
- Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, in about 4% of cases, which causes severe pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen below the ribs
- Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, in less than 0. 5% of cases.

People who experience mumps encephalitis typically experience a fever, altered consciousness, seizures, and weakness. Like meningitis, mumps encephalitis can occur in the absence of parotitis.
- Meningoencephalitis, inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes. Mumps meningoencephalitis is commonly accompanied by fever 97% of the time, vomiting 94% of the time, and headache 88. 8% of the time.
- Nephritis, inflammation of the kidneys, which is rare because kidney involvement in mumps is usually benign but leads to presence of the virus in urine.
- Inflammation of the joints, which may affect at least five joints, multiple nerves in the peripheral nervous system, pneumonia, gallbladder without gallstones, cornea and uveal tract, thyroids, liver, retina, and corneal endothelium, all of which are rare.

### Chikungunya… [^860a438a]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Chikungunya is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus. The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain, typically occurring four to eight days after the bite of an infected mosquito; however some people may be infected without showing any symptoms. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Symptoms usually improve within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months or years. The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease. Signs and symptoms Chikungunya can be asymptomatic, with estimates of between 17% and 40% of infections showing no symptoms. For those experiencing symptoms, they typically begin with a sudden high fever above 39 °C around 3 to 7 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. The fever is often accompanied by severe muscle and joint pain, which affects multiple joints in the arms and legs and is often symmetric – i.e.

if one elbow is affected, the other is as well. People with chikungunya also frequently experience headaches, back pain, nausea, and fatigue. Around half of those affected develop a rash, with reddening and sometimes small bumps on the palms, foot soles, torso, and face. For some, the rash remains constrained to a small part of the body; for others, the rash can be extensive, covering more than 90% of the skin. Some people experience gastrointestinal issues, with abdominal pain and vomiting. Others experience eye problems, namely sensitivity to light, conjunctivitis, and pain behind the eye. This first set of symptoms – called the "acute phase" of chikungunya – lasts around a week, after which most symptoms resolve on their own. For those with severe symptoms, approximately 30% to 40% continue to have symptoms after the "acute phase" resolves. The lasting symptoms tend to be joint pains: arthritis, tenosynovitis, and/or bursitis.

If the affected person has pre-existing joint issues, these tend to worsen. Overuse of a joint can result in painful swelling, stiffness, nerve damage, and neuropathic pain. Typically the joint pain improves with time; however, the chronic stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years. Almost all symptomatic cases feature joint pain, generally in more than one joint. Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints, such as the wrists, ankles, and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints, typically the shoulders, elbows and knees. Joints are more likely to be affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis. Pain may also occur in the muscles or ligaments. In more than half of cases, normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain. Infrequently, inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis, or uveitis, and retinal lesions may occur. Temporary damage to the liver may occur.

People with chikungunya occasionally develop long term neurologic disorders, most frequently swelling or degeneration of the brain, inflammation or degeneration of the myelin sheaths around neurons, Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, hypotonia, and issues with visual processing. Newborns, the elderly, and those with diabetes, heart disease, liver and kidney diseases, and human immunodeficiency virus infection tend to have more severe cases of chikungunya. Fewer than 1 in 1, 000 people with symptomatic chikungunya die of the disease; generally these are people with pre-existing health conditions. Rarely, the disease can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth, in women who become infected a few days before delivery.

### Treating inflammation in childhood neurodegenerative disorders [^a1511bc1]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the central nervous system is a prominent feature in many childhood neurodegenerative conditions, with various studies demonstrating the upregulation of the innate and adaptive immune system. Recent evidence also suggests that this inflammatory process can contribute to further neurodegeneration. Furthermore, immunosuppression in mouse models of a few lysosomal storage disorders has demonstrated that attenuation of this immune response can influence the clinical and neuropathological progression. However, there are significant challenges before this finding translates to patient care. Treating inflammation in neurodegenerative conditions requires the identification of the time point when inflammation becomes pathogenic, after which the safest therapeutic strategies are required to target the various components and confounders of inflammation. Nevertheless, as the progress made towards effective gene-, cellular-, and enzyme-based therapy in most of these disorders has been disappointing, treating pathogenic inflammation may offer the clinician another therapeutic strategy in managing these devastating disorders.

### Antibiotics with interleukin-15 inhibition reduce joint inflammation and bone erosions but not cartilage destruction in Staphylococcus aureus-induced arthritis [^aeea5591]. Infection and Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Synovitis was reduced in mice receiving the combination therapy, and the proportion of granulocytes in the synovium was lower. IL-15 influences neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites by modulating chemokine activity and inhibits neutrophil apoptosis. It is therefore not surprising that IL-15 inhibition reduces the proportion of granulocytes in the synovium of the arthritic joint. The question is whether the combination therapy leads to fewer osteoclasts in the joint via an inhibitory effect on synovial inflammation, consequently leading to a reduced osteoclast differentiation, or whether the effect is more directly targeted to the bone erosive process. There were no differences between the treatment groups in synovial mRNA levels of RANK, RANKL, or OPG at day 12 postinfection. This suggests that IL-15 does not interfere with this molecular triad at this time point. Importantly, the reduction of synovitis in mice treated with aIL-15ab and antibiotics was not accompanied by a significant reduction in cartilage destruction. Cartilage degradation is mediated by the inflammation-induced secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes, such as metalloproteinases. Notably, cartilage and bone destructive processes occur through distinct mechanisms, since in the absence of osteoclasts during arthritic conditions, the bone erosive process is arrested without affecting cartilage degradation or synovial inflammation. This could indicate that the effect of IL-15 inhibition on bone erosion is directly mediated through reduced osteoclastogenesis in the joint or the reduced recruitment of osteoclast precursors to the joint.

The antibiotic regime was chosen in order to mimic the clinical setting, where patients are started on i.v. antibiotics at diagnosis and continued until they are stabilized and later changed to oral antibiotics. However, one limitation of the study design is that the oral antibiotic consumption of each individual mouse was not tracked.

The irreversible nature of the joint damage in-induced arthritis, despite antibiotics, spurs a need for new therapeutic procedures. The inhibition of IL-15 and the use of antibiotics synergize in reducing synovitis and joint destruction in cases of-induced septic arthritis and, despite the fact that the combination therapy does not significantly influence cartilage destruction, this approach comprises a possible novel and safe treatment option.

### Mechanisms of drug interactions between translation-inhibiting antibiotics [^c4ccdedf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

While we focused on translation inhibitors, key elements of our framework can be generalized to drugs with other modes of action. Specifically, when considering a drug that targets a specific process mediated by an essential enzyme, our approach of equating the deprivation of the enzyme with the action of an antibiotic is readily applicable. Our observations also highlight the advantages of factor deprivation compared to simple overexpression: the former produced a quantitative prediction for drug interactions, while no meaningful prediction could be made from overexpression data (Supplementary Fig. 8). The general approach of depleting key accessory proteins is particularly useful for antibiotics targeting multi-component complexes or in cases where the effects of overexpressing the drug target are difficult to interpret.

Mimicking the effects of two drugs with controllable genetic perturbations generalizes the concept of genetic epistasis to continuous perturbations. Epistasis studies compare the effects of double gene knockouts to those of single knockouts and identify epistatic interactions — an approach that can reveal functional modules in the cell. Our results show that continuous genetic perturbations provide valuable additional information on genetic interactions (Fig. 6). Firstly, the direction of epistatic interactions cannot be extracted from measurements of single and double mutants. Secondly, the quantitative information obtained from such "continuous epistasis" measurements provides more stringent constraints for mathematical models of biological systems. In particular, continuous epistasis data can be powerful for the development of whole-cell models that describe the interplay of different functional modules in the cell. Thirdly, this approach allows including essential genes in epistatic interaction networks even for haploid organisms, which otherwise requires the use of less well-defined hypomorphs. Hence, continuous epistasis measurements augment all-or-nothing genetic perturbations.

### Tobramycin inhalation [^f67ff5fb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis in the bacterial cell which eventually leads to death of the cell. Tobramycin has activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa. It is bactericidal at or above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to inhibit growth of bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

The predominant mechanism of resistance to tobramycin in P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients is impermeability and to a lesser extent enzymatic modification and other mechanisms which cumulatively lead to decreased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin.

Cross Resistance

Cross resistance between aminoglycosides exists but the cross resistance is variable.

Development of Resistance

Treatment for six months with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in one clinical trial did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P. aeruginosa isolates tested; however, increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.

Susceptibility Testing

The clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative results of the in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physicians as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

### Bactericidal antibiotic treatment induces damaging inflammation via TLR9 sensing of bacterial DNA [^5bfc4afa]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Clinicians currently prescribe antibiotics based on bacterial susceptibility to different antibiotics. If they consider mechanism of action, they tend to preference cidal treatments despite clinical evidence that both classes are equally effective when used to treat a susceptible infection. Our study introduces a new consideration: downstream immunological consequences. We have uncovered a novel link between an antibiotic's mechanism, the extent to which it causes bacterial DNA release, and its downstream impact on host innate inflammatory responses and ultimately survival (Fig. S9). We can thus envision a future where clinicians proactively consider the impact of the treated bacteria on the host immune response when prescribing antibiotics. Which inflammatory outcome is more desirable will depend primarily on the clinical context. While further study is needed in the form of randomized control trials, these data create new actionable hypotheses. For example, in cases of overwhelming inflammation, static immune limiting antibiotics may be beneficial. In immunosuppressed patients, or infections where the pathogen suppresses inflammation, perhaps cidal acting pro-inflammatory treatments may be a better choice. Increased awareness of the inflammatory impacts of specific types of antibiotic treatments could thereby allow clinicians to translate these findings into individually targeted antibiotic therapies that simultaneously control bacterial burden and modulate immune responses to best fit each patient.

### How antibiotics can make us sick: the less obvious adverse effects of antimicrobial chemotherapy [^a56e7a1d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial agents are associated with side-effects, which are usually tolerated because the benefits of treatment outweigh the toxic effects. Clinicians know about these side-effects but are less likely to understand additional adverse events, such as the overgrowth of resistant microorganisms. Overgrowth can itself precipitate a secondary infection, which can be more difficult to treat. Resistant organisms then spread to other patients and the environment, and contribute to increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Organisms exposed to antibiotics undergo molecular changes that might enhance virulence. Enhanced pathogenicity would affect patients, particularly if the organism is also multiply resistant. Clinicians have a responsibility to select the correct antibiotic as soon as they have diagnosed infection, but an absence of microbiological understanding and ignorance of the potential environmental effects have contributed to inappropriate prescribing. The less obvious results of antimicrobial consumption probably go unrecognised in routine clinical care.

### Pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial drugs [^0e4fd56c]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the antimicrobial pharmacodynamic characteristics of a drug (inhibition of growth, rate and extent of bactericidal action, and postantibiotic effect) provides a more rational basis for determination of optimal dosing regimens in terms of the dose and the dosing interval. This article reviews concepts of antimicrobial pharmacodynamics, the effect of pharmacodynamics on the emergence of resistant bacterial subpopulations, and the development of pharmacodynamic breakpoints for use in the design of trials of these drugs and in treatment of infected patients.

### Leveraging laboratory and clinical studies to design effective antibiotic combination therapy [^b6a567ed]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Interest in antibiotic combination therapy is increasing due to antimicrobial resistance and a slowing antibiotic pipeline. However, aside from specific indications, combination therapy in the clinic is often not administered systematically; instead, it is used at the physician's discretion as a bet-hedging mechanism to increase the chances of appropriately targeting a pathogen(s) with an unknown antibiotic resistance profile. Some recent clinical trials have been unable to demonstrate superior efficacy of combination therapy over monotherapy. Other trials have shown a benefit of combination therapy in defined circumstances consistent with recent studies indicating that factors including species, strain, resistance profile, and microenvironment affect drug combination efficacy and drug interactions. In this review, we discuss how a careful study design that takes these factors into account, along with the different drug interaction and potency metrics for assessing combination performance, may provide the necessary insight to understand the best clinical use-cases for combination therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^b66abc6b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics — enzyme inhibition differences — form complexes with drug-oxidizing enzymes, including CYP enzymes, which render an inhibitory effect; erythromycin and clarithromycin are moderate to strong inhibitors, whereas azithromycin's propensity for causing clinically relevant drug interactions is the lowest because it does not form complexes with CYP enzymes that lead to enzyme inactivation.

### Linezolid-induced inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis [^012eab74]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that is increasingly used to treat drug-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. The mechanism of action is inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. Optic and/or peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis are reported side effects, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanism has not been unravelled.

Methods

We studied mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle, liver, and kidney samples obtained from a patient who developed optic neuropathy, encephalopathy, skeletal myopathy, lactic acidosis, and renal failure after prolonged use of linezolid. In addition, we evaluated mtDNA, respiratory chain enzyme activity, and protein amount in muscle and liver samples obtained from experimental animals that received linezolid or placebo.

Results

In the patient, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity was decreased in affected tissues, without ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities and without mutations or depletion of mtDNA. In the experimental animals, linezolid induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease of the activity of respiratory chain complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits and a decreased amount of protein of these complexes, whereas the amount of mtDNA was normal.

Conclusion

These results provide direct evidence that linezolid inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis with potentially severe clinical consequences. Prolonged courses of linezolid should be avoided if alternative treatment options are available.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^caa8bfbc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In patients with IBS, probiotics showed a modest improvement in overall symptoms, using both dichotomous and continuous data. However, it is interesting to note that neither of the two studies which contributed most of the weight in the analysis, were statistically significant. It is likely that the two Bifidobacterium strains used in these two studies may have been ineffective. Based on average control event rates the Numbers Needed to Treat is estimated to be between 9 and 21 to have 1 patient improve. By removing studies with quality scores less than four, the results remained stable to sensitivity analysis.

For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous and pooled continuous data. Using dichotomous data probiotics also improved symptoms of abdominal pain, flatulence and bloating. However using continuous data, the improvement in these symptoms were not statistically significant. One study used a cross-over design. The data presented allowed us to include it for dichotomous outcomes (bloating and abdominal pain). Excluding this study did not affect the findings for abdominal pain, but rendered the effect on bloating non-statistically significant. The heterogeneity was also high for symptoms of abdominal pain and flatulence. This is likely to be due to use of different scales in different studies.

Other therapies for IBS include antispasmodics, antidiarrhoeal agents, laxatives and antidepressants, but overall the evidence for efficacy of these existing drug therapies for IBS is weak. Probiotics have been used previously in different conditions. On entering the gastrointestinal tract, probiotics are unaffected by acid, bile salts and proteolytic enzymes. In the small bowel they multiply and live on the surface of epithelial cells. Their main beneficial effect is to act as a barrier to harmful organisms by adherence and production of substances that have an antibiotic effect, as well as stimulating immune processes in the host. In the colon they have a major role of fermenting undigested carbohydrates and soluble dietary fibre, producing short-chain fatty acids. Probiotics may change the flora, effecting the fermentation process, so less gases are produced that may cause symptoms, or they may interfere with the growth or harmful effect of producing diarrhoea, or they may stimulate the immune process to prevent some unidentified antigen response.

### Systematic analysis of drug combinations against Gram-positive bacteria [^e46a0ad6]. Nature Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

The dataset generated here can form the basis for future experiments to mechanistically dissect key interactions or assess potential for clinical application. For example, some of the synergies and antagonisms identified may guide future broad-spectrum empiric treatments, when antibiotic regimens are started without knowledge of the pathogen in time-sensitive contexts (for example, sepsis). Fosfomycin synergies that are strong and conserved across the Gram-positive/-negative divide are good candidates, as they are more likely to be broadly effective. Fosfomycin is increasingly used in clinics, but rarely in combinations. To enable further use of this resource, we made it browsable in a user-friendly interface.

We compared results with those we obtained previously using a similar screen with three Gram-negative species. The confidence and depth level of these comparisons are high, since the two studies have similar experimental and data analysis design, including the drugs tested. As for Gram-negative species, we found that drug interactions were largely species-specific for Gram-positive species, with synergies tending to be more conserved than antagonisms and driven by antibiotics sharing general cellular targets. In contrast, antagonisms were more common between antibiotics of different cellular targets and are less conserved, presumably because they are driven by interactions at the level of drug concentration. Overall, only a small number of interactions is conserved across Gram-positive and -negative species. Such interactions are more likely to be driven by interactions at the drug target and may thus hold true for strains and species not tested here, providing a high-confidence set for future exploitation. Differences in cell surface organization (for example, the outer membrane posing a permeability barrier for hydrophobic compounds) or in the degree of redundancy in cell-wall-building enzymes can explain some of the strong synergies observed specifically in Gram-positive or Gram-negative species. Our ability to replicate Gram-positive-specific synergies in hyperpermeable Gram-negative bacteria, together with previous evidence on the strong dependence of antagonisms on drug permeability, suggests that synergies rely more on drug targets and antagonisms more on drug intracellular concentrations. The exact degree to which this is true and whether this makes antagonisms less conserved (drug cellular targets are more conserved than their transport mechanisms) remain to be systematically assessed. In any case, this is presumably the reason why antagonisms were more frequent than synergies in Gram-negative speciesbut not here: synergies based on drug target are easier to detect in Gram-positive bacteria, and antagonisms are less common, as there are fewer permeability bottlenecks to overcome.

### Opposing effects of target overexpression reveal drug mechanisms [^20d2d4da]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Overexpression of a drug's molecular target often increases drug resistance, offering a pathway for adaptive evolution and a tool for target identification. It is unclear though why this phenomenon applies to some drugs but not others. Here we gradually overexpressed antibiotic targets in Escherichia coli and found that drug resistance can increase, remain unchanged, decrease or even change non-monotonically. Even a single target can produce opposing responses to its different inhibitors. We explain these contradicting effects with quantitative models of enzyme inhibition that account for fitness costs and the biochemical activity or inactivity of drug-enzyme complexes. Thus, target overexpression confers resistance or sensitivity as a predictable property of drug mechanism, explaining its variable presence in nature as a resistance mechanism. Though overexpression screens may fail at identifying unknown targets, overexpressing known or putative targets provides a systematic approach to distinguish between simple inhibition and complex mechanisms of drug action.

### Mechanisms of drug interactions between translation-inhibiting antibiotics [^ff3f801b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Translation is a fundamental, yet complex multi-step process that still lacks a comprehensive quantitative description. A key step toward such a description are bacterial "growth laws", which quantitatively capture the compensatory upregulation of the translational machinery in response to perturbations of translation. Growth laws have enabled a model that explains the growth-rate dependent bacterial susceptibility to individual translation inhibitors. Well-defined translation steps cannot only be perturbed chemically, but also genetically, as these steps are regulated by translation factors — specialized proteins that mediate the stability of ribosomal subunits, catalyze the assembly of 70S ribosomes and initiation, deliver charged tRNAs to the ribosome, release finished peptides, and mediate ribosome recycling (Fig. 1 a). Both genetic and chemical perturbations obstruct the progression of ribosomes along the translation cycle, which generally results in a lower growth rate. Comparing the effects of antibiotics to those of precisely defined genetic perturbations offers an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for drug interactions between translation inhibitors and could quantitatively test the equivalence of genetic and chemical perturbations of bacterial physiology.

Here, we hypothesize that a key determinant of interactions between pairs of translation inhibitors are the specific steps in the translation cycle where the two inhibitors halt ribosomal progression (Fig. 1 a). As a second key determinant of these drug interactions, we consider the compensatory physiological response to translation inhibition captured quantitatively by ribosomal growth lawstogether with the kinetics of antibiotic transport and ribosome binding. We show that these determinants suffice to explain most drug interactions between translation inhibitors and that these interactions can be predicted solely from known responses to the individual drugs. To establish this result, we use a combination of precise growth measurements, quantitative genetic perturbations of the translation machinery, and theoretical modeling.

### Mechanisms of drug interactions between translation-inhibiting antibiotics [^14b1bfc2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Antibiotics that interfere with translation, when combined, interact in diverse and difficult-to-predict ways. Here, we explain these interactions by "translation bottlenecks": points in the translation cycle where antibiotics block ribosomal progression. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions between translation inhibitors, we generate translation bottlenecks genetically using inducible control of translation factors that regulate well-defined translation cycle steps. These perturbations accurately mimic antibiotic action and drug interactions, supporting that the interplay of different translation bottlenecks causes these interactions. We further show that growth laws, combined with drug uptake and binding kinetics, enable the direct prediction of a large fraction of observed interactions, yet fail to predict suppression. However, varying two translation bottlenecks simultaneously supports that dense traffic of ribosomes and competition for translation factors account for the previously unexplained suppression. These results highlight the importance of "continuous epistasis" in bacterial physiology.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles of anti-infective dosing [^9ea0a6e0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

An understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine response to antimicrobial therapy can provide the clinician with better-informed dosing regimens. Factors influential on antibiotic disposition and clinical outcome are presented, with a focus on the primary site of infection. Techniques to better understand antibiotic PK and optimize PD are acknowledged.

Methods

PubMed (inception-April 2016) was reviewed for relevant publications assessing antimicrobial exposures within different anatomic locations and clinical outcomes for various infection sites.

Findings

A limited literature base indicates variable penetration of antibiotics to different target sites of infection, with drug solubility and extent of protein binding providing significant PK influences in addition to the major clearing pathway of the agent. PD indices derived from in vitro studies and animal models determine the optimal magnitude and frequency of dosing regimens for patients. PK/PD modeling and simulation has been shown an efficient means of assessing these PD endpoints against a variety of PK determinants, clarifying the unique effects of infection site and patient characteristics to inform the adequacy of a given antibiotic regimen.

Implications

Appreciation of the PK properties of an antibiotic and its PD measure of efficacy can maximize the utility of these life-saving drugs. Unfortunately, clinical data remain limited for a number of infection site-antibiotic exposure relationships. Modeling and simulation can bridge preclinical and patient data for the prescription of optimal antibiotic dosing regimens, consistent with the tenets of personalized medicine.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^e7dba9e6]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Studying how antibacterials operate at subinhibitory concentrations reveals how they impede normal growth. While previous works demonstrated drugs can impact multiple aspects of growth, such as prolonging the doubling time or reducing the maximal bacterial load, a systematic understanding of this phenomenon is lacking. It remains unknown if common principles dictate how drugs interfere with growth. We monitored growth curves across thirty-eight drugs, spanning multiple mechanisms of action in Escherichia coli to deconvolve their impact on the lag, growth rate, and carrying capacity and developed a mathematical framework to quantitatively compare their effects. We discovered that drugs induced considerably different inhibition phenotypes, which were independent from the drug's target. Functional assays of drug inactivation revealed that drug inactivation is a key shared factor underlying a lag-associated phenotype. Our work reveals that likely drug inactivation can be directly inferred from growth dynamics which is instrumental for rapidly identifying drug-inactivating bacteria.

### Key challenges in providing effective antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with bacterial sepsis and septic shock [^b5f770c9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Early initiation of effective antibiotic therapy is vitally important for saving the lives of critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock. The susceptibility of the infecting pathogen and the ability of the selected dosage regimen to safely achieve the required antibiotic exposure need to be carefully considered to achieve a high probability of a successful outcome. Critically ill patients commonly experience substantial pathophysiological changes that impact the functions of various organs, including the kidneys. Many antibiotics are predominantly renally eliminated and thus renal function is a major determinant of the regimen needed to achieve the required antibiotic exposure. However, currently, there is a paucity of guidelines to inform antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients, including those with sepsis or septic shock. This paper briefly reviews methods that are commonly used in critically ill patients to provide a measure of renal function, and approaches that describe the relationship between the exposure to an antibiotic and its antibacterial effects. Two common conditions that very substantially complicate the use of antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis, unstable renal function, and augmented renal clearance, are considered in detail and their potential therapeutic implications are explored. Suggestions are provided on how treatment of bacterial infections in critically ill patients with sepsis might be improved. Of high potential are model-informed approaches that aim to individualize initial treatment regimens based on patient and bacterial characteristics, with refinement of regimens during treatment in response to monitoring antibiotic concentrations, responsive measures of renal function, and other important clinical data.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^47a45b65]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Enzymatic drug inactivation by resistance cassettes leads to a prolonged-lag

Since drug mechanism of action does not always correlate with growth inhibition phenotypes, we reasoned that growth inhibition may be caused by mechanisms that are independent from the drug's cellular target. These could include drug-induced cellular responses, which confer resistance through a regulated response or drug inactivation over time by active drug biotransformation or passive chemical degradation. We expected that drug inactivation will manifest first in complete growth-arrest, due to initial high drug concentrations, and will be followed by a period of normal growth once drug concentration drops, due to its inactivation, below a critical threshold. Moreover, if drug inactivation depended on the number of cells in the culture, we would expect a rapid shift between these two periods due to positive feedback (as drug levels drop, the population size increases, and it collectively degrades more drug). We directly tested this hypothesis by genetically engineering the wild-type strain to express different drug resistance enzymes. Specifically, we wanted to test if enzymes that modify or degrade a drug will reshape the growth curve and prolong the lag period (Fig. 4A, left panels). Moreover, as a control, we wanted to validate that resistance that is independent from drug inactivation, such as that gained by efflux pumps, will not lead to a prolonged lag period since drug inactivation is not taking place (Fig. 4A, right panels).

### Therapeutic inhibition of metalloproteases by tetracyclines during infection by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas [^35c83d88]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Pseudomonas destroys the lung architecture and function through microbe-, inflammation-, and neutrophil-mediated degradation of mucin layers and structural proteins of the pulmonary connective tissue. Uncontrolled proteolysis directly correlates with disease severity, confounds effective antimicrobial responses, and may ultimately contribute to the decline in lung function. LasB is typically expressed during acute infections and in murine lung infections model, is essential in these conditions, and is a major driver of inflammation and damage. Here, we show that tetracyclines can inhibit LasB, resulting in protective effects similar to those seen with other LasB inhibitors.

Additional important considerations revealed by this work are the effects of antibiotics beyond direct microbe killing. For tetracycline-family antibiotics, this includes effects on metalloprotease virulence factors, host metalloproteases, and the inflammatory signaling pathways they regulate. In circumstances where the effects of metalloproteases are pathologic, tetracyclines may therefore have additional therapeutic effects when used to treat infections by susceptible bacteria. An intervention that imposes a fitness cost to a bacterium selects for its resistance. However, tetracyclines have both a direct antimicrobial effect and also sensitize Pseudomonas to host innate immune effectors by inhibiting a critical virulence factor, providing a more formidable challenge to the development of resistance during infection. Consequently, even MDR Pseudomonas with acquired tetracycline resistance may have their metalloprotease virulence factors inhibited.

### Typhoid fever… [^92856a95]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Typhoid fever, also known as typhoid, is a disease caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi bacteria, also called Salmonella typhi. Symptoms vary from mild to severe, and usually begin six to 30 days after exposure. Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days. This is commonly accompanied by weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, and mild vomiting. Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots. In severe cases, people may experience confusion. Without treatment, symptoms may last weeks or months. Diarrhea may be severe, but is uncommon. Other people may carry it without being affected, but are still contagious. Typhoid fever is a type of enteric fever, along with paratyphoid fever. Salmonella enterica Typhi is believed to infect and replicate only within humans. Signs and symptoms Classically, the progression of untreated typhoid fever has three distinct stages, each lasting about a week.

Over the course of these stages, the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated.
- In the first week, the body temperature rises slowly, and fever fluctuations are seen with relative bradycardia, malaise, headache, and cough. A bloody nose is seen in a quarter of cases, and abdominal pain is also possible. A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells occurs with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis; blood cultures are positive for S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. The Widal test is usually negative.
- In the second week, the person is often too tired to get up, with high fever in plateau around 39–40. 5 °C and bradycardia, classically with a dicrotic pulse wave. Delirium can occur, where the patient is often calm, but sometimes becomes agitated. This delirium has given typhoid the nickname "nervous fever".

Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. Rhonchi are heard in the base of the lungs. The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant, where a rumbling sound can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage, but constipation is also common. The spleen and liver are enlarged and tender, and liver transaminases are elevated. The Widal test is strongly positive, with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive.
- **In the third week of typhoid fever, possible complications include**:
- The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours. Dehydration ensues along with malnutrition, and the patient is delirious. A third of affected people develop a macular rash on the trunk.
- Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer's patches occurs; this can be very serious but is usually not fatal.
- Intestinal perforation in the distal ileum is a critical complication and often fatal. It may occur without alarming symptoms until sepsis or diffuse peritonitis sets in.
- Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis
- Encephalitis
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms, with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects.
- Metastatic abscesses, cholecystitis, endocarditis, and osteitis.
- Low platelet count is sometimes seen. Rapid diagnostic tests Rapid diagnostic tests such as Tubex, Typhidot, and Test-It have shown moderate diagnostic accuracy. Without treatment, some patients develop sustained fever, bradycardia, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal symptoms, and occasionally pneumonia. In white-skinned patients, pink spots, which fade on pressure, appear on the skin of the trunk in up to 20% of cases.

### How antibiotics work together: molecular mechanisms behind combination therapy [^2cf3033d]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics used in combination are an effective strategy for combatting numerous infectious diseases in clinical and veterinary settings, particularly as a last-line therapy for difficult-to-treat cases. Combination therapy can either increase or slow the rate of killing, broaden the antibiotic spectrum, reduce dosage and unwanted side-effects, and even control the emergence of resistance. The administration of antibiotics in combination has been used effectively against bacterial infections for > 70 years, first used to treat tuberculosis. However, effective antibiotic combinations and their dosage regimes have been largely determined empirically in the clinic, and the molecular mechanisms underpinning how these combinations work remains surprisingly elusive. This review focuses on studies that have outlined the genetics and molecular mechanisms of action underlying antibiotic combinations, as well as those that examine how resistance develops. We highlight the need for further experimentation and genetic validation to fully realise the potential of combination therapy.

### Clinical pharmacology of antibiotics [^75abae50]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial pharmacology and its effect on prescribing is quite complex. Selecting an antibiotic that will optimally treat an infection while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance is only the first step, as one must also consider the patient's individual pharmacokinetic alterations and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug when prescribing it as well. Patients with CKD may have alterations in their protein binding, volumes of distribution, kidney clearance, and nonrenal clearance that necessitates antibiotic dose adjustments to prevent the development of toxicity. Knowledge of a drug's pharmacodynamics, defined as the relationship between drug exposure and antibacterial efficacy, provides some guidance regarding the optimal way to make dose adjustments. Different pharmacodynamic goals, such as maximizing the time that free (unbound) drug concentrations spend above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for time dependent drugs (e.g., β -lactams) or maximizing the free peak-to-MIC ratio for concentration-dependent antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides), require different adjustment strategies; for instance, decreasing the dose while maintaining normal dosing frequency or giving normal (or even larger) doses less frequently, respectively. Patients receiving hemodialysis have other important prescribing considerations as well. The nephrologist or patient may prefer to receive antibiotics that can be administered intravenously toward the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, newer dialysis technologies and filters can increase drug removal more than originally reported. This review will discuss the place in therapy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other pharmacologic considerations encountered when prescribing commonly used antibiotics in patients with chronic kidney disease or ESKD.

### Unveiling the critical roles of cellular metabolism suppression in antibiotic tolerance [^0495a3b1]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

In our prior investigation, we demonstrated that heterocyclic phenothiazines (e.g. thioridazine (TDZ), chlorpromazine), commonly utilized as antipsychotic medications, effectively diminish persister levels across various bacterial strains. This includes Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (an opportunistic pathogen notorious for causing persistent lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients), highly virulent strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Our research also demonstrated that phenothiazines can eradicate persister cells originating from quinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, along with beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. When administered at sublethal concentrations, phenothiazines impede cellular repair and recovery processes, transiently modify membrane integrity, and disrupt the proton concentration gradient across the cell membrane, ultimately disrupting the PMF.

While phenothiazines have been shown to reduce cell survival fractions in the presence of antibiotics, this effect was not observed with other known metabolic inhibitors such as chloramphenicol (CAM; a translation inhibitor), rifampicin (RIF; a transcription inhibitor), and arsenate (ARS; an ATP production inhibitor). The underlying cause of this phenomenon remains unclear; however, persister cells damaged by antibiotics may rely on specific levels of transcription/translation activities and energy molecules for survival. It appears that highly potent metabolic inhibitors may prove detrimental to persisters by irreversibly impairing these crucial processes. Furthermore, the impact of treatment time and concentrations of metabolic inhibitors on persister survival is yet to be fully understood and warrants further investigation. In this study, we systematically investigated the combination of various inhibitors, including CAM, RIF, ARS, and TDZ, with ofloxacin using multiple synergy models. TDZ consistently demonstrated strong synergy, particularly in pre- and co-treatment conditions, while CAM, RIF, and ARS showed minimal synergy, indicating antagonistic effects. Furthermore, multivariable linear regression analyses revealed a correlation between the efficacy of metabolic inhibitors in eradicating antibiotic-tolerant cells and their ability to suppress cellular energy metabolism. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of thorough synergistic analysis in evaluating the potential of metabolic inhibitors as anti-persistence adjuvants.

### Effects of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines on mitochondria of human retinal MIO-M1 cells [^60308c0c]. Experimental Eye Research (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Antibiotics have saved millions of lives by preventing and treating a myriad of infectious diseases. Fluoroquinolones are bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity. They can be classified into four generations based on the range of their activity. Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin are two antibiotics administered by topical, intravitreal and systemic routes for ocular infections such as endophthalmitis. Their mechanisms of action are through the direct inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are vital enzymes in the DNA synthesis process.

In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated medications. However, some individuals have significant adverse effects including optic neuropathy, cardiac arrhythmias, hypomania, and hypoglycemia. Between 2000 and 2007, Etminan and colleagues conducted a case control study among 989,591 Canadian patients with usage of oral fluoroquinolones. Retinal detachment after fluoroquinolone use was identified in 4384 (3.3%) cases of participants, demonstrating a small but real risk for patients using these antibiotics. Tetracyclines (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline and minocycline) are bacteriostatic antibiotics with activity against a wide array of gram positive and gram-negative bacteria. These antibiotics interact with the bacterial protein synthesis processes by reversibly binding to the libosomal 30s subunit, which blocks the binding of the mRNA-ribosome complex to the aminoacyle-tRNA acceptor site. They also have anti-inflammatory properties and have been used at low doses to improve inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis, scleroderma and ocular rosacea. Tetracyclines chelate ZN 2+ leading to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity. Side effects of the different types of tetracyclines including interference of bone growth and oral mucosa. Wallace et al. validated the significant reduction of aqueous humor and intraocular pressure in rabbits after one day of intravitreal administration of tetracycline derivatives.

### Cefotaxime [^dd556b1d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefotaxime should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefotaxime is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefotaxime or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Drug Interactions

As with other cephalosporins, cefotaxime may potentiate the nephrotoxic effects of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, NSAIDs and furosemide.

Probenecid interferes with the renal tubular transfer of cefotaxime, decreasing the total clearance of cefotaxime by approximately 50% and increasing the plasma concentrations of cefotaxime. Administration of cefotaxime in excess of 6 grams/day should be avoided in patients receiving probenecid (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions).

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Cephalosporins, including cefotaxime sodium, are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs' test.

A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (Benedict's or Fehling's solution or with CLINITEST®tablets), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria (e.g. CLINISTIX®or TesTape®). There are no reports in published literature that link elevations of plasma glucose levels to the use of cefotaxime.

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^571cae5a]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam PD characteristics

Knowledge of the antimicrobial PD characteristics (inhibition of growth, rate and extent of bactericidal action, and post-antibiotic effect (PAE)) provides a more rational basis for determination of optimal dosing regimens in terms of the dose and the dosing interval.

The antimicrobial activity of drugs is usually assessed by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the drug under specific conditions in vitro. These in vitro conditions are very different from those expected at the site of infection, where the milieu is frequently acidic and anaerobic, and tissue protein may bind a variable amount of the drug. Additionally, these parameters do not provide information on the time course of the antimicrobial effect — the fluctuating levels that are present in a patient treated with the drug — and are measured against a standard bacterial inoculum (about 10 colony-forming units (CFU) per millilitre) that does not necessarily correspond to bacterial densities at site of infection (10 CFU per gram of tissue or pus). For bactericidal drugs, the MBC is generally not more than fourfold higher than the MIC. The size of the residual bacterial population at the end of each dosing interval, and ultimately the efficacy of the antimicrobial regimen, depends on the interplay of a variety of bacterial, drug, and host factors that include the size of the initial bacterial population, the potency (MIC and MBC) and PK characteristics of the antimicrobial agent, the rate and extent of any bactericidal effect, the presence of a post-antibiotic effect (PAE), the rate of re-growth of persistent organisms, and the state of host defences.

### Amplified copper ion interference and immunomodulation using self-thermophoretic nanomotors to treat refractory implant-associated biofilm infections [^2c7653b8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Orthopedic implant-associated biofilm infections (IABIs) are the leading cause of surgical failure in orthopedic procedures and pose a significant, ongoing challenge in clinical practice –. Unfortunately, IABIs are refractory to elimination and show a high risk of relapse rate because of dense microbial biofilms formed on the implant, which call for large amounts of antibiotics and multiple revision surgeries, bringing tremendous physical and mental torture to patients. Moreover, common pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which reside within biofilm shelters, exhibit robust resistance to conventional antibiotics and innate host immunity responses. Additionally, the highly acidic, hypoxic, and nutrient-depleted biofilm microenvironment (BME) compromises local immunological competence and promotes the polarization of pro-inflammatory immune cells toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes, further complicating antibiofilm therapeutic strategies –. Therefore, developing antibiotic-free treatments that can effectively disrupt biofilms while reprogramming immune cells holds great promise for achieving improved therapeutic outcomes for IABIs with minimal risk of drug resistance.

Recently, a variety of nanomaterials that simultaneously exhibit antimicrobial properties and immunomodulatory effects have been investigated. Copper serves as an essential cofactor for all living organisms, playing a critical role in numerous biochemical processes. However, when its concentration exceeds the threshold regulated by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms, copper becomes toxic and disrupts bacterial metabolism. Specifically, the accumulation of copper within cellular structures interacts with lipid-acylated components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), initiating cuproptosis in cells and cuproptosis-like death in bacteria, thereby providing insights into copper-based therapeutic nanomaterials –. Moreover, copper ions can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a Fenton-like reaction upon exposure to BME. This process enhances macrophage immune function by facilitating chemotaxis toward planktonic bacteria escaping from disintegrating biofilms through phagocytosis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, due to their direct antimicrobial capabilities coupled with their excellent reprogramming effect on immune cells, copper ion-based treatments are considered promising candidates for antibiotic-free treatment options in the post-antibiotic era. Copper peroxide (CP) nanodots represent emerging candidates as copper ion donors. Under acidic conditions, these CP nanodots decompose into copper(II) along with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), which subsequently generates hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These radicals contribute to disrupting bacterial membrane integrity, thereby enhancing copper uptake while promoting cuproptosis.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^84c88607]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.

The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; it may affect immune function.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Two reports describe in vitro methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mononuclear cells, and another describes in animal polyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production. Other laboratories, however, have been unable to demonstrate similar effects. Clarification of methotrexate's effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies.

In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin. This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.

Methotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as a part of the treatment of patients with non- metastatic osteosarcoma. The original rationale for high dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin. More recent evidence suggests that high dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport, decreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of dihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglutamation of methotrexate. The actual mechanism of action is unknown.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^05f546da]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Rifamycin-related induction interactions note that rifamycin antibiotics are potent inducers of Phase 1 and Phase 2 drug-metabolizing reactions and also affect various transporters; when a rifamycin antibiotic must be combined with an interacting drug, close monitoring for clinical efficacy of the coadministered agent is advised, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), if available, may facilitate any necessary dose adjustments. For rifampin specifically, "Rifampin (also known as rifampicin): Interactions may not be apparent in the first several days of rifampin therapy", but "with daily doses of rifampin, enzyme induction increases over a week or more".

### Dysregulation of bacterial proteolytic machinery by a new class of antibiotics [^48c21876]. Nature Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Here we show that a new class of antibiotics-acyldepsipeptides-has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in several rodent models of bacterial infection. The acyldepsipeptides are active against isolates that are resistant to antibiotics in clinical application, implying a new target, which we identify as ClpP, the core unit of a major bacterial protease complex. ClpP is usually tightly regulated and strictly requires a member of the family of Clp-ATPases and often further accessory proteins for proteolytic activation. Binding of acyldepsipeptides to ClpP eliminates these safeguards. The acyldepsipeptide-activated ClpP core is capable of proteolytic degradation in the absence of the regulatory Clp-ATPases. Such uncontrolled proteolysis leads to inhibition of bacterial cell division and eventually cell death.

### Mechanisms of drug interactions between translation-inhibiting antibiotics [^a5f6e686]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We established a framework that combines mathematical modeling, high-throughput growth rate measurements, and genetic perturbations to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions between antibiotics inhibiting translation. Kinetics of antibiotic-target binding and transport together with "growth laws", i.e. the physiological response to translation inhibition (Fig. 2), form a biophysically realistic baseline model for predicting antibiotic interactions from properties of individual antibiotics alone. This model explained many interactions, but not all, failing specifically for suppressive interactions. Predictions improved by taking into account the step-wise progression of ribosomes through the translation cycle (Figs. 4, 5). This was achieved by mimicking antibiotic perturbations of this progression genetically, which directly identified the contribution of antibiotic-imposed translation bottlenecks to the observed drug interactions. Finally, to explain the origin of suppressive interactions unaccounted for by the biophysical model, we modeled the traffic of translating ribosomes explicitly. Our results show that translocation inhibition can cause ribosomal traffic jams, which dissolve in a non-equilibrium phase transition when initiation is inhibited simultaneously with translocation, thereby restoring growth (Fig. 6). This phase transition explains the suppressive drug interactions between antibiotics targeting initiation and translocation.

### Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence [^835849c2]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Increasing concerns about the rising rates of antibiotic therapy failure and advances in single-cell analyses have inspired a surge of research into antibiotic persistence. Bacterial persister cells represent a subpopulation of cells that can survive intensive antibiotic treatment without being resistant. Several approaches have emerged to define and measure persistence, and it is now time to agree on the basic definition of persistence and its relation to the other mechanisms by which bacteria survive exposure to bactericidal antibiotic treatments, such as antibiotic resistance, heteroresistance or tolerance. In this Consensus Statement, we provide definitions of persistence phenomena, distinguish between triggered and spontaneous persistence and provide a guide to measuring persistence. Antibiotic persistence is not only an interesting example of non-genetic single-cell heterogeneity, it may also have a role in the failure of antibiotic treatments. Therefore, it is our hope that the guidelines outlined in this article will pave the way for better characterization of antibiotic persistence and for understanding its relevance to clinical outcomes.

### Cytoplasmic condensation induced by membrane damage is associated with antibiotic lethality [^c5744dfa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In summary, our results, which include both single-cell biophysical and conventional bulk-culture approaches, suggest the following physical biology-based model of bacterial cell death. Upon the primary antibiotic–target interaction, cells generate reactive molecules from increased flux through metabolic pathways including glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as previously reported. These reactive metabolic by-products lead to cellular damage by promiscuously reacting with nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane lipids. Reactions with the membrane in processes including lipid peroxidation induce loss of membrane integrity, which results in cytoplasmic condensation through the leakage of cytoplasmic contents and coincides with the loss of viability in cells. Intriguingly, because cytoplasmic condensation is not seen in all dead cells, our results suggest that alternative cell death pathways — which may involve cellular damage to nucleic acids and proteins resulting from both the primary drug–target interaction and subsequent generation of reactive metabolic by-products — also contribute to antibiotic-induced cell death.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^840f9189]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate.

The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; it may affect immune function.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Two reports describe in vitro methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mononuclear cells, and another describes in animal polyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production. Other laboratories, however, have been unable to demonstrate similar effects. Clarification of methotrexate's effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies.

In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin. This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.

Methotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as a part of the treatment of patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. The original rationale for high dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin. More recent evidence suggests that high dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport, decreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of dihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglutamation of methotrexate. The actual mechanism of action is unknown.

### Mapping human microbiome drug metabolism by gut bacteria and their genes [^26b5c34e]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Individuals vary widely in their responses to medicinal drugs, which can be dangerous and expensive owing to treatment delays and adverse effects. Although increasing evidence implicates the gut microbiome in this variability, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here we show, by measuring the ability of 76 human gut bacteria from diverse clades to metabolize 271 orally administered drugs, that many drugs are chemically modified by microorganisms. We combined high-throughput genetic analyses with mass spectrometry to systematically identify microbial gene products that metabolize drugs. These microbiome-encoded enzymes can directly and substantially affect intestinal and systemic drug metabolism in mice, and can explain the drug-metabolizing activities of human gut bacteria and communities on the basis of their genomic contents. These causal links between the gene content and metabolic activities of the microbiota connect interpersonal variability in microbiomes to interpersonal differences in drug metabolism, which has implications for medical therapy and drug development across multiple disease indications.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^f0231e12]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that we are now faced with greater antibiotic resistance challenges than ever before, limiting treatment options for patients with severe infections. The rate of development of new antimicrobial agents has failed to keep pace with the "ingenuity" of bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics. We have to adapt to this threat by reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We need to optimize control measures to minimize the risk of spread of resistant bacteria, and we have to find novel ways to detect pathogens early. These approaches will help prevent the spread of MDR pathogens and could enable us to direct last-line (and in some cases, narrow-spectrum) antibiotics more effectively to those patients who need them most, rather than the current "broad-spectrum is best" approaches.

### Mechanisms of action of antimicrobials: focus on fluoroquinolones [^24606343]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Five bacterial targets have been exploited in the development of antimicrobial drugs: cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, ribonucleic acid synthesis, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and intermediary metabolism. Because resistance to drugs that interact with these targets is widespread, new antimicrobials and an understanding of their mechanisms of action are vital. The fluoroquinolones are the only direct inhibitors of DNA synthesis; by binding to the enzyme-DNA complex, they stabilize DNA strand breaks created by DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ternary complexes of drug, enzyme, and DNA block progress of the replication fork. Cytotoxicity of fluoroquinolones is likely a 2-step process involving (1) conversion of the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA complex to an irreversible form and (2) generation of a double-strand break by denaturation of the topoisomerase. The molecular factors necessary for the transition from step 1 to step 2 remain unclear, but downstream pathways for cell death may overlap with those used by other bactericidal antimicrobials. Studies of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants and purified topoisomerases indicate that many quinolones have differing activities against the two targets. Drugs with similar activities against both targets may prove less likely to select de novo resistance.

### Modeling the impact of drug interactions on therapeutic selectivity [^42255b67]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Combination therapies that produce synergistic growth inhibition are widely sought after for the pharmacotherapy of many pathological conditions. Therapeutic selectivity, however, depends on the difference between potency on disease-causing cells and potency on non-target cell types that cause toxic side effects. Here, we examine a model system of antimicrobial compound combinations applied to two highly diverged yeast species. We find that even though the drug interactions correlate between the two species, cell-type-specific differences in drug interactions are common and can dramatically alter the selectivity of compounds when applied in combination vs. single-drug activity — enhancing, diminishing, or inverting therapeutic windows. This study identifies drug combinations with enhanced cell-type-selectivity with a range of interaction types, which we experimentally validate using multiplexed drug-interaction assays for heterogeneous cell cultures. This analysis presents a model framework for evaluating drug combinations with increased efficacy and selectivity against pathogens or tumors.

### Bactericidal antibiotics induce mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in mammalian cells [^8e834f88]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prolonged antibiotic treatment can lead to detrimental side effects in patients, including ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and tendinopathy, yet the mechanisms underlying the effects of antibiotics in mammalian systems remain unclear. It has been suggested that bactericidal antibiotics induce the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria. We show that clinically relevant doses of bactericidal antibiotics-quinolones, aminoglycosides, and β-lactams-cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS overproduction in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that these bactericidal antibiotic-induced effects lead to oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. Mice treated with bactericidal antibiotics exhibited elevated oxidative stress markers in the blood, oxidative tissue damage, and up-regulated expression of key genes involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms, which points to the potential physiological relevance of these antibiotic effects. The deleterious effects of bactericidal antibiotics were alleviated in cell culture and in mice by the administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine or prevented by preferential use of bacteriostatic antibiotics. This work highlights the role of antibiotics in the production of oxidative tissue damage in mammalian cells and presents strategies to mitigate or prevent the resulting damage, with the goal of improving the safety of antibiotic treatment in people.

### Neutrophil-anti-microbial interaction in the established infection: effect on Staphylococcus aureus [^2c99e497]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if differences in drug-related Staphylococcus aureus killing, associated in vivo with neutropenia, is neutrophil-related in vitro, and the mechanisms of this interaction.

Methods

To evaluate the influence of living neutrophils on drug-S. aureus interactions, cell wall enzymes, the PBPs, were isolated and their binding to five (beta lactam and other) antibiotics was evaluated following incubation (or not) with neutrophils. S. aureus killing by the test drugs was assayed in growth media of sterile filtered abscess fluid, either neutropenic infected or normal infected. At MBCs for the test isolate, each drug or saline control was incubated with S. aureus 10(6)and dilution-plated.

Results

Neutrophil incubation with S. aureus eliminated the S. aureus PBP-2 band in all Western blots irrespective of the drug used to tag the PBPs. Time-kill of S. aureus grown in neutropenic or normal abscess fluid showed greater kill by all drugs in neutropenic abscess fluid (p = 0.029 6h incubation). Killing difference between the media correlates with drug PBP-2 activity.

Conclusions

Drug activity against S. aureus in vitro is changed by neutrophil incubation. The neutrophil-induced loss of S. aureus PBP-2 drug binding suggests novel host-bacterial interaction that may impinge on drug treatment of S. aureus infections.

### Mortality in septic patients treated with vitamin C: a systematic meta-analysis [^f0d6823a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting annually more than 48 million patients worldwide. This leads to more than 10 million deaths every year representing the cause of nearly 20% of all global deaths. A cornerstone of its pathophysiology is based on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven modification of proteins affecting cellular signaling, gene expression, and other essential cellular processes which are initiated by enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

Vitamin C mitigates apoptosis by preserving the integrity of the endothelial barrier and counteracts these enzymes that propagate ischemia–reperfusion injury. This was demonstrated in vitro with cultured endothelial cells where nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase is the major source of ROS. Furthermore, vitamin C has been proven to play a crucial role in the microcirculation and organ function in animal models and volunteer studies.

Consequently, intravenous supplementation of vitamin C was investigated in multiple clinical studies exploring the effects in septic patients. Early studies such as the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I safety trial published by Fowler et al. and the retrospective before–after study by Marik et al. demonstrated its safety and suggested reduced mortality rates. However, following studies provided contradicting results with respect to the effects of vitamin C on mortality prompting uncertainty in the community.

As a consequence, potential beneficial or detrimental effects could not be sustainably determined by previously published meta-analyses due to divergent patient subsets, heterogenous interventions, and limited numbers of studies included. Notably, only in 2020, eight new large clinical trials were published supporting the high interest and relevance of this topic. However, consistent data on the effects on mortality of septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C are still lacking. Therefore, we performed the present meta-analysis on mortality of septic patients treated with vitamin C alone or combined with hydrocortisone/thiamine when compared to standard care.

### Clinical relevance of bacteriostatic versus bactericidal mechanisms of action in the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections [^2bf98a6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents appears to be clear according to the in vitro definition, but this only applies under strict laboratory conditions and is inconsistent for a particular agent against all bacteria. The distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. The supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with gram-positive bacteria, particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. Bacteriostatic agents (e.g., chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and linezolid) have been effectively used for treatment of endocarditis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis — indications that are often considered to require bactericidal activity. Although bacteriostatic/bactericidal data may provide valuable information on the potential action of antibacterial agents in vitro, it is necessary to combine this information with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to provide more meaningful prediction of efficacy in vivo. The ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.

### Computer-aided drug design to generate a unique antibiotic family [^f926efb7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also determined toxicity of DNM0547 as well as DNM0652 and DNM0755 to COS7 and HEK293 cells in culture (Cell lines were obtained from ATCC). Increasing amounts of each compound were incubated with each cell line for 24 h and cell viability was determined (Supplementary Fig. 9). The lethal concentration (LC) for 50% of cell death (LC 50) for DNM0547 for COS7 and HEK293 cells was 21 μg/mL and 41 μg/mL, respectively, for DNM0652 the LC 50 was 37 μg/mL and 35 μg/mL; for DNM0755 the LC 50 was 109 μg/mL and 33 μg/mL. The estimated LC 100 for each DNM compound tested was 50 μg/mL. This favorably compares to 0.25–2 ug/mL for elimination of cell growth for susceptible bacterial strains.

In summary, a broad spectrum antibiotic class has been developed that has a unique structure and mechanism of action, is bactericidal, and is effective against antibiotic resistant strains. We determined that DNM0547 within this family is efficacious in animal models of MRSA infection and was effective against MDR strains of Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. These compounds inhibit the enzymatic activity of purified AcpS as increased expression of AcpS in bacteria results in an increase in MIC against DNM0547 demonstrating mechanism of action. DNM0547 is an effective topical antibiotic with bacterial killing properties in an important area of medical concern or which there a currently no effective solutions, ischemic infections such as those present in the extremities of DFU patients that lead to hundreds of thousands of amputations per year, or systemic spread and death if amputations are not performed in a timely manner. In addition, beyond DNM0547, there are over 30 other molecules in this antibiotic family to further explore, this new antibiotic family may form the basis for several AMR programs.

### Omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin (omeclamox-pak) [^7bb1df60]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Omeprazole, an antisecretory drug with the substituted benzimidazoles, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-dependent and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Omeprazole can also exhibit anti-bacterial activity depending on the culture conditions. Animal studies indicate that after rapid disappearance from plasma, omeprazole can be found within the gastric mucosa for a day or more.

Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.

Amoxicillin acts through the inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide.

Triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections as indicated [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Interactions with Other Antibacterial Drugs

In vitro studies show that chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with bactericidal effects of penicillin; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.

Drug Resistance

Helicobacter pylori Pretreatment Resistance

Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 9.3% (41/439) in omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (≤ 0.25 μg/mL) were found in 99.3% (436/439) of the patients in the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy studies [see Clinical Studies (14)].)

Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology:

Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including proton pump inhibitors, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter.

Susceptibility Testing

### The effect of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes: importance of proper evaluation of appropriate therapy [^843d2d50]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

The impact of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes can be effectively measured only if the appropriateness of the antimicrobial therapy received is properly measured. Definition of appropriate therapy should include not only in vitro susceptibility but also the clinical adequacy of the antibiotic used, taking into account the pathogen isolated, the site of infection, known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug, and dosing. In the absence of these data, the effect of delay or absence of appropriate therapy in patients infected with resistant bacterial pathogens is subject to confounding, and the true effect of resistance on outcomes may be obscured.

Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Beta-lactam resistance suppression targets in preclinical models — Resistance suppression has been defined phenotypically (e.g., growth on 3x MIC plates) as well as with genotypic mutations, and generally, minimum targets for resistance suppression for timelines up to 5 days were most frequently identified at drug concentrations of four to six times the MIC; however, these concentrations do not invariably prevent the emergence of resistance, most resistance studies have been performed in vitro (as opposed to in vivo), and the translational relevance is less clear.

Preclinical PK/PD models — future research needs for infusion strategies emphasize that additional adequately powered studies with formalized statistical analysis plans that mimic humanized concentration–time profiles of short infusion (SI) or prolonged infusion (PI) β-lactams are needed to ascertain differential bacterial killing and regrowth/resistance suppression; a diverse array of pathogens should be included; there is a need to evaluate concentration–time profiles across patient types and infection sites for older, recently approved, and investigational β-lactams; and, when feasible, starting inoculums should mirror clinical bacterial burden and study durations should be consistent with current treatment practices.

### Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective [^303a6984]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Role of Mathematical Models

Transmission-dynamic modeling can also play an important role in bridging the gap between individual- and group-level effects (,–). These models take information about individual-level effects as parameters and make predictions about the response of the population to changes in such parameters as transmission risk or antibiotic usage. Although models cannot substitute for empirical intervention studies, they can be particularly valuable in at least four ways: 1) generating hypotheses about the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance that can be used in designing and prioritizing empirical studies; 2) defining the conditions under which a particular intervention is likely to work, thereby suggesting how empirical results can (and cannot) be extrapolated to other settings; 3) providing explanations for phenomena that have been observed but whose causes were uncertain; and 4) identifying biological mechanisms that, while important, remain poorly understood.

An example of models for generating hypotheses comes from the question of antimicrobial rotation or "cycling". Cycling of antimicrobial classes in hospitals has been suggested and is currently being evaluated for its ability to curtail resistance in major nosocomial pathogens (,–). One mathematical model of this process has suggested that using a mixture of different drug classes simultaneously (e.g. if two drug classes are available for empiric therapy of certain infections, treat half of the patients with one drug class and half with the other) will reduce resistance more effectively than cycling under a broad range of conditions. This suggests that such mixed regimens would be good candidates for comparison with cycling in controlled trials.

As a second example, levels of resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens may change rapidly within a matter of weeks or months after changes in antimicrobial use. By contrast, studies of reductions in antimicrobial use in communities have shown slow and equivocal effects on resistance in community-acquired pathogens. Mathematical models suggest that, in communities, the key factor driving the change in resistance levels may be the "fitness cost" of resistance, i.e. resistance will decline after a reduction in antimicrobial use if resistant organisms in untreated patients are at a disadvantage for transmission or persistence. This cost may be small in many bacteria, accounting for the slow response. In contrast, a model indicates that, in hospitals, changes in resistance may be driven primarily by the admission of new patients who often bring with them drug-susceptible flora, and this may rapidly "dilute" levels of resistance in the absence of continuing selection by antibiotics. If correct, this explanation suggests that the success of antimicrobial control measures should be evaluated differently for hospitals and for communities.

### Mechanisms of drug interactions between translation-inhibiting antibiotics [^823a3113]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Effects of translation bottlenecks predict drug interactions

We reasoned that the effects of translation bottlenecks on antibiotic action should also have predictive power for drug interactions between translation inhibitors. We, therefore, sought a quantitative way of probing the contribution of translation bottlenecks to drug interactions between translation inhibitors.

Ribosomes progress through the translation cycle in a sequence of steps (Fig. 4 a). Antibiotics and genetic translation bottlenecks hinder this progression by reducing the transition rates between these steps. If an antibiotic specifically targets a single translation step and reduces the same transition rate as a genetic translation bottleneck, the effects of the drug and the bottleneck should be equivalent, i.e. the consequences of any perturbation elsewhere in the translation cycle should be independent of the exact means by which such a reduction is achieved (Fig. 4 b).

To establish the equivalence of specific translation bottlenecks and antibiotic action, we first transformed the measurements of growth rate as a function of translation factor induction into dose–response curves of a corresponding idealized antibiotic that targets a single translation step with perfect specificity. In essence, this procedure converts inducer concentrations into equivalent antibiotic concentrations: the two concentrations are identified as equivalent if they lead to the same relative growth rate (Fig. 4 c, d; Supplementary Methods). If the perturbations of factor and antibiotic are equivalent, then the true and the idealized antibiotic should act as substitutes for each other, and exhibit an additive drug interaction. Conversely, we can use this comparison (Fig. 4 e and Supplementary Fig. 4) to test systematically if the action of antibiotics is quantitatively equivalent to specific translation bottlenecks.

### Pharmacogenomic and clinical data link non-pharmacokinetic metabolic dysregulation to drug side effect pathogenesis [^c6e01067]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Drug side effects cause a significant clinical and economic burden. However, mechanisms of drug action underlying side effect pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we integrate pharmacogenomic and clinical data with a human metabolic network and find that non-pharmacokinetic metabolic pathways dysregulated by drugs are linked to the development of side effects. We show such dysregulated metabolic pathways contain genes with sequence variants affecting side effect incidence, play established roles in pathophysiology, have significantly altered activity in corresponding diseases, are susceptible to metabolic inhibitors and are effective targets for therapeutic nutrient supplementation. Our results indicate that metabolic dysregulation represents a common mechanism underlying side effect pathogenesis that is distinct from the role of metabolism in drug clearance. We suggest that elucidating the relationships between the cellular response to drugs, genetic variation of patients and cell metabolism may help managing side effects by personalizing drug prescriptions and nutritional intervention strategies.

### Effect of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment on clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients with infection and sepsis patients: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^9257016d]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have recently published a similar individual patient data meta-analysis looking at patients with different types and severities of respiratory infections. Similar to what was seen in the current analysis, patients with respiratory infections also benefited from PCT-guided therapy, experiencing lower mortality and needing significantly reduced antibiotic exposure. The current analysis further expands these findings, also showing similar effects in subgroups of other types of infections — an analysis that was not possible in all previous meta-analyses based on aggregate data. While the effects seem similar between different subgroups, we did not find PCT to be associated with reduced antibiotic use in patients with abdominal infections and those with renal impairment. It is possible that, in these two patient groups, the PCT kinetics are impaired by bacterial translocation due to mucositis even if the initial infection has resolved, and by the slower decline of PCT in patients with renal impairment. Additional investigations will be needed to understand whether PCT algorithms require further adaptation in these two patient groups.

Although we have no definitive explanations for the positive effects of PCT-guided antibiotic treatment on mortality, several mechanisms seem plausible. First, PCT provides additional prognostic information in patients with sepsis and may influence site-of-care decisions and timing of discharge. The MOSES study investigating PCT kinetics over 72 h in several US emergency departments validated the prognostic potential of PCT independent of other prognostic scores. Hence, early identification of treatment nonresponders has the potential to prevent adverse events, although this was not true in the PASS trial, a study investigating whether escalation of diagnostic and therapeutic measures based on high PCT levels would decrease mortality. Second, prolonged antibiotic exposure has a toxic effect and thus may increase risk of treatment failure in control patients. Unexpected PCT results may also prompt physicians to further examine patients and look for additional explanations and illnesses. Finally, several observational studies have reported lower mortality and risk of treatment failure associated with early antibiotic de-escalation in patients with sepsis, although pathophysiological mechanisms are incompletely understood.

This analysis is based on a comprehensive literature search and retrieval of all relevant trials and a network that permitted inclusion of individual patient data from most eligible trials. We also standardized definitions across trials and were able to perform appropriate subgroup analyses looking at different sepsis severities and types of infection. Limitations of this analysis include incomplete adherence to the PCT algorithm among the included trials, exclusion of immunocompromised patients in most trials, and heterogeneity among trials with regard to patient populations and follow-up of patients. In addition, cost-effectiveness analyses need to be undertaken to determine whether using PCT-guided care is a cost-effective intervention.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^75740e65]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults — among patients with inhalation anthrax during 1900–2005, antimicrobial drug combination therapy was more likely to be curative than antimicrobial drug monotherapy. There is also a theoretical benefit for combined use of bactericidal and protein synthesis inhibitor agents, and in vitro toxin production is inhibited earlier by protein synthesis inhibitors than by bactericidal agents. Combination antimicrobial drug regimens were used in all 8 survivors of inhalation anthrax during 2001–2012; five survivors were also treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor. Patients hospitalized for systemic anthrax should be immediately treated with a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial drug treatment pending confirmatory test results because any delay may prove fatal.

Definitions of certainty in the evidence and strength of recommendations — levels of certainty and user-facing implications are specified as follows: High certainty is defined as "We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect"; moderate certainty as "We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; low certainty as "Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; and very low certainty as "We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect". For implications of strong versus conditional recommendations, patients: strong — "Most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; patients: conditional — "Most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". Clinicians: strong — "Most patients should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator"; clinicians: conditional — "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". Policy makers: strong — "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations"; policy makers: conditional — "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^825600bd]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Future research may determine how FMT performs without antibiotic pre-treatment and how it measures in patients with their initial CDI. Investigations of treatment kinetics, time to effect, required dosing, and mechanisms of action may guide the clinical use of FMT. Application of encapsulated donor faeces holds practical benefits but requires more processing steps that need evaluation in clinical studies.

In conclusion, high-quality evidence documents FMT as an effective treatment for recurrent CDI. The effect varies with the delivery method and the number of administrations, with repeat FMT by lower GI endoscopy being most effective. The low NNT for FMT versus antibiotics suggests that advancing the treatment recommendations for FMT to all instances of recurrent CDI may effectively manage the infection and provide the most effective patient care.

### Aqueous humor tyrosinase activity is indicative of iris melanocyte toxicity [^e3be51c1]. Experimental Eye Research (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are commonly used to treat ocular infections but are also known to cause dermal melanocyte toxicity. The release of dispersed pigments from the iris into the aqueous humor has been considered a possible ocular side effect of the systemic administration of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin, and this condition is known as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT). Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris (BADI) is a similar condition, with iris pigment released into the aqueous, but it has not been reported as a side effect of FQL. Iris pigments are synthesized by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) and can be detected but not quantified by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The correlation between dispersed pigments in the aqueous and the extent of melanocyte toxicity due to topical antibiotics in vivo is not well studied. Here, we aimed to study the effect of topical FQLs on iris tissue, the pigment release in the aqueous humor and the development of clinically evident iris atrophic changes. We evaluated this process by measuring the activity of TYR in the aqueous humor of 82 healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery following topical application of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin (27 eyes, preservative-free) or Ciprofloxacin (29 eyes, with preservative) or the application of non-FQL Tobramycin (26 eyes, with preservative) as a control. In addition, the patients were questioned and examined for ocular side effects in pre- and post-operative periods. Our data showed a significantly higher mean TYR activity in the aqueous humor of Ciprofloxacin-treated eyes compared to Moxifloxacin- (preservative free, p < 0.0001) or Tobramycin-treated eyes (p < 0.0001), which indicated that few quinolones under certain conditions are toxic to the iris melanocytes. However, the reduced TYR activity in the aqueous of Moxifloxacin-treated eyes was possibly due to the presence of a higher drug concentration, which inhibits TYR activity. Consistently, immunoblotting analysis of the aqueous humor from both Ciprofloxacin- and Moxifloxacin-treated eyes showed the presence of soluble TYR enzyme, thus reflecting its toxicity to iris melanocytes and corresponding to its activity in the aqueous humor. Intriguingly, none of these patients developed any clinically appreciable ocular side effects characteristic of BAIT or BADI. Overall, our results suggest that topical antibiotics cause different levels of iris melanocyte toxicity, releasing dispersed pigments into the aqueous humor, which can be measured through TYR enzyme activity. Hence, we conclude that topical FQLs may cause subclinical toxicity to the iris melanocytes but may not be the sole cause of the development of BAIT or BADI.

### Residual N-acetyl-α-glucosaminidase activity in fibroblasts correlates with disease severity in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB [^6b90d180]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

In most SP fibroblasts, culturing at 30 °C resulted in levels of NAGLU activity that exceeded 10% of control enzyme activity (reference values for NAGLU activity in fibroblasts used in our diagnostic laboratory are 9–17 nmol.mg −1.hr −1). Ten percent of control NAGLU activity is often associated with the amelioration of symptoms. Our findings indicate that residual NAGLU activity can potentially be enhanced and that MPS IIIB patients with a SP phenotype might benefit from therapies that interfere with protein folding, such as chemical and pharmacological chaperones (Meijer et al). However, more research is needed to elucidate the underlying processes and the effects of therapies that interfere with these mechanisms.

To be able to measure low levels of NAGLU activity and to detect minor changes in enzyme activity at different conditions in all patient cell lines, we optimized the assay normally used in our diagnostic department. Using this optimized assay, in patient 25 remarkably high levels of NAGLU activity and low HS levels were found at all culture conditions, despite previous genetic and biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis MPS IIIB. The use of high concentrations of 4MU-α-G1cNAc substrate (1.5 mg/mL final concentration) in combination with an optimized pH and incubation time, might have favored the particular kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme in this patient. Furthermore, NAGLU with this particular mutation might have an increased affinity to the 4MU-substrate, as compared to natural substrates present in vivo. This is currently being further investigated.

In conclusion, we show that NAGLU activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30 °C can be used to discriminate between RP and SP MPS IIIB patients and that the capacity of cells to increase NAGLU activity at lower temperatures correlates with disease severity and progression. Prediction of the phenotype of an individual patient may become of high relevance in the near future for assessment of the efficacy of disease modifying treatments for MPS IIIB.

### Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria [^1fa5dc91]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of action. Mechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., beta-lactams and glycopeptide agents), inhibition of protein synthesis (macrolides and tetracyclines), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (fluoroquinolones and rifampin), inhibition of a metabolic pathway (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and disruption of bacterial membrane structure (polymyxins and daptomycin). Bacteria may be intrinsically resistant to ≥ 1 class of antimicrobial agents, or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organisms. Acquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug, to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target, to modify the drug's target site, or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drug. Acquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the host's genome or plasmids. Use of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Herein 3 case histories-one involving Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, another focusing on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a third detailing multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa — are reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop.

### Lyme disease… [^fed5364a]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans, which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. The Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms.

People with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid and may be accompanied for several weeks by variable headache and, less commonly, usually mild meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms. Up to 76. 5% of them present as tinnitus, the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness and hearing loss were the next most common symptoms. In children, partial loss of vision may also occur.

Cranial neuritis is an inflammation of cranial nerves. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating, migrating, worse at night, rarely symmetrical, and often accompanied by extreme sleep disturbance. Mononeuritis multiplex is an inflammation causing similar symptoms in one or more unrelated peripheral nerves. Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, with symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gait, ocular movements, or speech, impaired movement, impaired motor planning, or shaking. In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement. In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy, other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis.

Symptoms may include heart palpitations, dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also be present, such as EM rash, joint aches, facial palsy, headaches, or radicular pain. In some people, however, carditis may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. In early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and, over time, possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis that discovered poor documentation of this manifestation, experts wondered if it exists at all in the US or is merely very rare. A neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a general sense of feeling unwell, and changes in personality. Lyme encephalopathy is controversial in the US and has not been reported in Europe.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^f212779a]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — the inoculum effect denotes reduced antimicrobial activity at high bacterial densities, where the effective minimum inhibitory concentration at the site of infection with bacterial densities of 10⁸ to 10¹¹ colony-forming units per 1 g tissue can be much higher than with a standard inoculum of 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter; β-lactams and glycopeptides are less active against highly dense bacterial populations, whereas fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are less affected; an inoculum effect also occurs with β-lactamase–susceptible β-lactams versus β-lactamase–producing bacteria (observed with enterococci, S aureus, and Gram-negative bacilli), and high inocula are more likely to harbor resistant subpopulations with reduced vancomycin activity at 10⁸ colony-forming units per milliliter in an in vitro PD model.

### Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals [^9c056851]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MICROBIOLOGY

Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antimicrobial agent with activity against certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of nitrofurantoin is unusual among antibacterials.

Nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates which inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other acromolecules. As a result of such inactivations, the vital biochemical processes of protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis are inhibited. Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The broad-based nature of this mode of action may explain the lack of acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin, as the necessary multiple and simultaneous mutations of the target macromolecules would likely be lethal to the bacteria.

Interactions with Other Antibiotics

Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolone antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

Development of Resistance

Development of resistance to nitrofurantoin has not been a significant problem since its introduction in 1953. Cross-resistance with antibiotics and sulfonamides has not been observed, and transferable resistance is, at most, a very rare phenomenon.

Nitrofurantoin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE):

### Intracellular pharmacology of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors: role of transporter molecules [^8c7edacf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral agents target HIV replication within infected cells. It is therefore important to focus on the pharmacology of these drugs at their site of action rather than just in plasma. Activation of nucleoside analogues to a triphosphate is essential for antiretroviral activity. Following activation, by intracellular kinases, drug triphosphates compete with endogenous triphosphates for HIV reverse transcriptase. Methodologies to measure triphosphates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV patients have been described. This has allowed investigation of once-daily dosing regimens, drug interactions, modulation of intracellular activation and the bypassing of initial phosphorylation steps. Drug accumulation within a cell is a balance between influx and efflux. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that transport proteins are vitally important in regulating intracellular concentrations of antiretroviral drugs. Allelic variants, inhibition (or induction) are all potentially critical determinants of active drug present in the cell. It is hoped that understanding the intracellular pharmacology will improve long-term therapy and reduce the likelihood of cellular resistance in therapeutic failure.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^9aac643e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^852cc606]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 5: Significant drug interactions for drugs used to treat or prevent opportunistic infections states that there is the potential for significant drug interactions and overlapping toxicities in patients receiving medications for treatment or prevention of opportunistic infections (OIs), and that these patients often are receiving other medications, including antiretrovirals that interfere with metabolism or elimination of OI medications. Protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors affect the CYP450 or other transporter systems and may be associated with clinically significant drug interactions, whereas the integrase inhibitor raltegravir is metabolized by UGT1A1 and may be a suitable option when trying to minimize interactions with other drug classes. The table provides clinicians with information regarding known or suspected drug interactions between drugs commonly used for treatment or prevention of HIV-associated OIs and treatment of HIV infection; the interaction information is generally obtained from studies involving healthy adult volunteers, with some pharmacokinetic (PK) data from studies involving HIV-infected adults, whereas data in children are extremely limited. The text emphasizes that it is important to carefully review a patient's current medications, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, and notes that it is difficult to predict the interaction potential when three or more drugs with similar metabolic pathways are co-administered and there is substantial inter-patient variability in the magnitude of these interactions. When possible, alternative agents with less drug interaction potential or use of therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered, and Table 5 contains only a partial listing of drug interactions for drugs used to treat or prevent OIs, with additional tools providing more comprehensive and up-to-date information as new PK data become available.

### Sepsis… [^54e3bde9]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

This initial stage of sepsis is followed by dysregulation of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever. Risk factors include being very young or old, a weakened immune system from conditions such as cancer or diabetes, major trauma, and burns. A shortened sequential organ failure assessment score, known as the quick SOFA score, has replaced the SIRS system of diagnosis. qSOFA criteria for sepsis include at least two of the following three: increased breathing rate, change in the level of consciousness, and low blood pressure.

Sepsis guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures before starting antibiotics; however, the diagnosis does not require the blood to be infected. Medical imaging is helpful when looking for the possible location of the infection. Other potential causes of similar signs and symptoms include anaphylaxis, adrenal insufficiency, low blood volume, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. Signs and symptoms In addition to symptoms related to the actual cause, people with sepsis may have a fever, low body temperature, rapid breathing, a fast heart rate, confusion, and edema. Early signs include a rapid heart rate, decreased urination, and high blood sugar. Signs of established sepsis include confusion, metabolic acidosis, low blood pressure due to decreased systemic vascular resistance, higher cardiac output, and disorders in blood-clotting that may lead to organ failure.

Fever is the most common presenting symptom in sepsis, but fever may be absent in some people, such as the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. The drop in blood pressure seen in sepsis can cause lightheadedness and is part of the criteria for septic shock. Oxidative stress is observed in septic shock, with circulating levels of copper and vitamin C being decreased. Pathophysiology Sepsis is caused by a combination of factors related to the particular invading pathogen and the status of the immune system of the host. The early phase of sepsis, characterized by excessive inflammation, may be followed by a prolonged period of decreased functioning of the immune system. Either of these phases may prove fatal. On the other hand, systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurs in people without the presence of infection, for example, in those with burns, polytrauma, or the initial state in pancreatitis and chemical pneumonitis.

However, sepsis also causes a similar response to SIRS. Inflammatory responses cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome through various mechanisms as described below. Increased permeability of the lung vessels causes leaking of fluids into alveoli, which results in pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Impaired utilization of oxygen in the liver impairs bile salt transport, causing jaundice. In the gastrointestinal tract, increased permeability of the mucosa alters the microflora, causing mucosal bleeding and paralytic ileus. In the central nervous system, direct damage of the brain cells and disturbances of neurotransmissions causes altered mental status. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 may activate procoagulation factors in the cells lining blood vessels, leading to endothelial damage.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^cdbc6f76]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Short duration antibiotic courses

Since the classic paper in the 1980s elucidating the concept that clinical resistance in Gram-negative pathogens occurs on the basis of selection by antibiotics of spontaneously mutant strains of bacteria which possess resistance mechanisms, there has been increasing awareness about the importance of appropriately limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. This strategy has taken two important forms in recent years. One has been de-escalation of therapy, in which the spectrum of empiric antibiotics is narrowed when microbiological data become available to minimize the selective pressure of antibiotics. A second strategy has been antimicrobial stewardship, which targets the duration of therapy as an important means of achieving optimal clinical outcomes. Current guidelines recommend a course of 7–10 days for most severe infections, although some recent data support the use of shorter courses in certain infections, such as intraabdominal infections. Many clinicians, however, remain hesitant about prescribing fewer fixed days of antibiotics for patients with severe bacterial infection, and prefer to customize antibiotic duration based on the clinical course of the disease and/or using serial determinations of a biological marker of infection, such as procalcitonin (PCT). Adapting the antimicrobial treatment duration to PCT kinetics has been demonstrated as useful in several randomized trials targeting patients with acute respiratory infection. Nevertheless, PCT kinetics should only be used as a tool to support clinical judgment.

### The negative impact of antibiotic resistance [^16aba23f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Antibacterial therapy is one of the most important medical developments of the twentieth century; however, the spread of resistance in healthcare settings and in the community threatens the enormous gains made by the availability of antibiotic therapy. Infections caused by resistant bacteria lead to up to two-fold higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with similar infections caused by susceptible strains. These adverse outcomes may be clinical or economic and reflect primarily the failure or delay of antibiotic treatment. The magnitude of these adverse outcomes will be more pronounced as disease severity, strain virulence, or host vulnerability increases. The negative impacts of antibacterial resistance can be measured at the patient level by increased morbidity and mortality, at the healthcare level by increased resource utilization, higher costs and reduced hospital activity and at the society level by antibiotic treatment guidelines favouring increasingly broad-spectrum empiric therapy. In this review we will discuss the negative impact of antibiotic resistance on patients, the healthcare system and society.

Rifamycins — induction potency, half-lives, and de-induction — note that larger daily doses of rifampin (e.g., 1,200 mg or more) appear to produce about the same maximum induction as lower doses but occur more rapidly; rifabutin as a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer is about 40% of the potency of rifampin and is also a CYP3A4 substrate, and when used with interacting drugs rifabutin dosage modification, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and/or more frequent monitoring for rifabutin-related toxicities may be needed; daily rifapentine is at least as potent an inducer as rifampin, while interactions with once-weekly rifapentine are not well studied and once-weekly rifapentine is likely to reduce exposure of concurrent CYP3A4 substrates with drug-specific variability; after discontinuation, enzyme induction effects gradually diminish and, generally, after five half-lives a drug is substantially eliminated, but although rifampin has a short plasma half-life (3–5 hours) de-induction largely depends on enzyme decay, with a 2-week interval after the final dose of rifampin found sufficient for enzyme levels to return to baseline; rifapentine and rifabutin have longer half-lives (approximately 13 and 45 hours, respectively) and may exhibit a more prolonged de-induction period than rifampin, whereas rifabutin induces enzymes to a lesser extent necessitating a shorter de-induction phase.

### Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective [^19c0654f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Combinations of Direct and Indirect Effects on Resistance

A third mechanism by which antimicrobial use increases the number of patients colonized or infected with resistant organisms is by modifying the treated host's colonization resistance (Figure, C; Table). Eradication or reduction of drug-susceptible normal flora by antibiotic treatment may increase vulnerability to acquisition of new strains. This effect will increase the patient's probability of being colonized with a resistant organism if, during or shortly after treatment, he or she is exposed to others with resistant organisms. This mechanism is direct in the sense that it increases the treated patient's risk of colonization with resistant organisms but is also associated with indirect effects because of the requirement for transmission. An index host given antibiotics is placed at greater risk for colonization with resistant organisms (direct effect), but this risk is amplified by his or her exposure to other patients harboring resistant organisms, which is in turn enhanced by their use of antibiotics (indirect effect).

### Neomycin polymyxin b sulfates and dexamethasone [^41f253e4]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow the healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case.

When a decision to administer both a corticoid and an antimicrobial is made, the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience, with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of both drugs is administered, plus assured compatibility of ingredients when both types of drugs are in the same formulation and, particularly, that the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained.

The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure, concentration, and release from the vehicle.

### Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) [^361695bb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Upadacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.

JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g. JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In a cell-free isolated enzyme assay, upadacitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1 and JAK2 relative to JAK3 and TYK2. In human leukocyte cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1 and JAK1/JAK3 more potently than JAK2/JAK2 mediated STAT phosphorylation. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Inhibition of IL-6 I nduced STAT3 and IL-7 I nduced STAT5 P hosphorylation

In healthy volunteers, the administration of upadacitinib (immediate release formulation) resulted in a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2)-induced STAT3 and IL-7 (JAK1/JAK3)-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in whole blood. The maximal inhibition was observed 1 hour after dosing which returned to near baseline by the end of dosing interval.

Lymphocytes

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, treatment with upadacitinib was associated with a small, transient increase in mean ALC from baseline up to Week 36 which gradually returned to, at or near baseline levels with continued treatment.

Immunoglobulins

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, small decreases from baseline in mean IgG and IgM levels were observed with upadacitinib treatment in the controlled period; however, the mean values at baseline and at all visits were within the normal reference range.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 2.5 times the mean exposure of the maximum therapeutic dose, 45 mg once daily dose, there was no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval.

The exceptions to this general rule are RFB and the fluoroquinolones. Inhibitors of CYP3A increase the serum concentrations of RFB and one of its metabolites (25-O-desacetyl-rifabutin).

### Approach to the patient with hidradenitis suppurativa: evaluating severity to guide therapy [^df1277d6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic condition with a multifaceted pathoetiology requiring a multimodal management approach. The HS evaluation process involves the use of multiple tools to determine the extent and activity of disease, patient-reported outcomes, and the effectiveness of therapy. The multimodal approach to treatment based on severity includes lifestyle modifications, topical medications, systemic antibiotics, immunomodulators, and surgical interventions. Patients with HS benefit from medical optimization before surgical interventions. It is imperative to have treatment plans tailored to the disease severity and burden of each patient in order to effectively manage HS.

Rifamycin antibiotics — interaction considerations — are potent inducers of Phase 1 and Phase 2 drug metabolizing reactions, and studies have demonstrated that with daily doses of rifampin, enzyme induction increases over a week or more, whereas single doses of rifampin may not produce significant induction. Based on limited data, larger doses of rifampin (e.g., 1,200 mg) appear to produce the same maximum induction as lower doses, but more rapidly. In general, rifabutin as a CYP3A4 inducer is about 40% of the potency of rifampin, and daily rifapentine (for active TB disease) is at least as potent an inducer as rifampin, while with once weekly rifapentine (prescribed with isoniazid for latent TB infection) the potential of drug interactions is not well studied and may result in reduced exposure of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates. When using a rifamycin antibiotic with a potential interacting drug is necessary, close monitoring for clinical efficacy of the coadministered agent is advised.

Results

Defining drug susceptibility determinants in A. baumannii

To examine the genome-wide molecular mechanisms that modulate antibiotic action in A. baumannii, we measured the effects of transposon insertion mutations on bacterial growth during challenge with a broad set of antimicrobial compounds by Tn-seq. Antibiotics were selected that target a variety of essential cellular processes, with about half of the treatments targeting the cell envelope (Fig. 1). This subset includes antibiotics that target distinct aspects of cell wall biogenesis governing elongation or division. In addition to defining elements of intrinsic drug susceptibility, the use of multiple distinct stress conditions facilitates the determination of specific fitness phenotypes for a large swath of genes in A. baumannii. The relatedness of these fitness profiles is predicted to provide leads regarding the function of uncharacterized proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

### A reversible state of hypometabolism in a human cellular model of sporadic Parkinson's disease [^7f577f42]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Astonishing, however, is that external stimuli that are thought to have a beneficial effect on DAn functionality and survival negatively impact internal metabolic processes in an sPD-specific manner. Under normal conditions, SHH signaling mediates cellular and neurochemical homeostasis within the nigrostriatal circuits, whereas diminished SHH signaling results in DAn degeneration. Contrary, our sPD patient-derived hNPCs already react to physiological SHH signaling unusually sensitive, initiating a cascade that ultimately results in an sPD-specific state of hypometabolism. The mechanisms underlying the development of primary cilia dysfunction and thus most metabolic alterations remain still unknown and have to be investigated in the future.

Based on these data, we present a model in which complex I deficiency and the SHH-mediated hypometabolism develop as two independent hits that negatively impact cellular energy supply as well as ROS homeostasis, but also each other, thereby creating a vicious cycle of self-destruction. To interfere with both processes by firstly inhibiting the overactive SHH signaling and secondly by rescuing complex I deficiency might be a combinatorial neuroprotective therapy beneficial during early stages of sPD.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy in the critically ill [^af540eb4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly likely to have or develop infection, in part because infection is a reason for admission and in part because of immunosuppression associated with critical illness and the large number of invasive devices used in these patients. Correct and adequate antibiotic coverage is essential but can be complex as a result of delayed identification of microorganisms, the impact of critical illness and therapy on pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of antibiotics, and the high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains.

In this review, we briefly highlight the importance of early infection diagnosis before discussing some of the key issues related to antibiotic management, including problems associated with timing, duration, and dosing. We also briefly consider ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the use of inhaled antibiotics, and new antibiotic and adjunct strategies for the future. We focus on bacterial infections and issues associated with multi-drug resistance will not be covered.
