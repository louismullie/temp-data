## Question

which organs are included insplanchnic vein thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which organs are included in splanchnic vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of splanchnic vein thrombosis across sources. Then, I should verify exactly which venous segments are included in SVT. Next, I will review data on how commonly each vein is involved. After that, I need to check the anatomy of venous drainage to map veins to organs. Finally, I will reconcile terminology nuances such as Budd-Chiari syndrome and deliver a succinct synthesis of organs involved based on venous drainage.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I do not over- or under-include venous territories. Multiple reviews consistently define splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) as thrombosis affecting one or more abdominal veins draining the splanchnic circulation, specifically the portal, mesenteric, splenic, and supra-hepatic (hepatic) veins, the latter corresponding to Budd-Chiari syndrome when thrombosed.

> I should confirm the specific venous segments that are universally counted within SVT. Hold on, let me verify across cohort and guideline-style summaries: SVT routinely includes portal vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis (superior and/or inferior), splenic vein thrombosis, and hepatic vein thrombosis as Budd–Chiari syndrome; these are reiterated in large observational series and disease overviews alike, which helps anchor scope and terminology.

> Next, I will examine how frequently each vein is involved to ensure I am not misrepresenting the clinical landscape. Portal vein involvement predominates in large cohorts and cancer-associated SVT, commonly around 89–90% of identified SVT, whereas superior mesenteric vein involvement is particularly associated with symptomatic presentations and bowel ischemia; pancreatitis-related SVT shows a high proportion of splenic vein events, reflecting local venous anatomy and inflammation [^112xMMZe] [^112X3mmb] [^112X3mmb] [^112ne9Y1] [^114ZHCyx].

> Now I need to map venous segments to organ drainage to identify which organs are "involved" by virtue of their venous outflow. Let me think this through and double-check: the splanchnic venous system drains the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small bowel, colon), spleen, pancreas, and ultimately the liver via the portal system; the hepatic veins drain the liver into the systemic circulation, so hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd–Chiari) implicates the liver directly; mesenteric veins drain small and large bowel; the splenic vein drains the spleen and joins the portal confluence; taken together, SVT affects organs including bowel, pancreas, spleen, and liver via these venous pathways.

> Wait, I should correct a potential imprecision before proceeding. I initially thought to state that the portal vein "drains the spleen", but that is imprecise; hold on, I should verify the tributary anatomy. The spleen is drained by the splenic vein, which then contributes to the portal venous confluence, so spleen involvement in SVT is via splenic vein thrombosis and its confluence with the portal system rather than direct portal venous drainage from the spleen itself.

> I will now synthesize organ involvement explicitly. Given that SVT comprises portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins plus hepatic veins in Budd–Chiari syndrome, the organs inherently involved are the small and large intestines via the mesenteric veins, the spleen via the splenic vein, the pancreas and stomach via the portomesenteric venous system, and the liver via the hepatic veins and via portal venous inflow obstruction in portal vein thrombosis; these relationships are consistently described across pathophysiology and clinical overviews of SVT [^116Njgff].

> But wait, what about terminology nuances — do all sources uniformly include hepatic veins within "splanchnic" veins? Let me reconsider and confirm. Several authoritative reviews explicitly include hepatic (supra-hepatic) veins within the SVT spectrum and reserve the term Budd–Chiari syndrome for hepatic vein outflow obstruction, which is therefore part of SVT in most modern definitions, ensuring the liver is a core organ in the SVT framework [^111gwxDN] [^115KQRDF] [^116Njgff].

> Final answer, keeping the clinical mapping tight: Splanchnic vein thrombosis encompasses thrombosis of the portal vein, the mesenteric veins (superior and inferior), the splenic vein, and the hepatic veins as Budd–Chiari syndrome. By venous drainage, the principal organs involved are the small and large intestines, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and liver, with portal vein involvement being the most common venous site across cohorts and hepatic vein thrombosis specifically denoting Budd–Chiari syndrome within the SVT spectrum [^112xMMZe] [^114taVRd] [^116Njgff] [^115KQRDF].

---

The organs included in splanchnic vein thrombosis [^116kYBTT] are the **liver (portal and hepatic veins)** [^111gwxDN], **spleen (splenic vein)** [^114ZHCyx], and **intestines (mesenteric veins)** [^114Rniry]. Thrombosis in these veins can cause portal hypertension [^113p2hwt], hepatic dysfunction [^113p2hwt], and intestinal ischemia [^114Rniry], and may involve multiple veins simultaneously [^112xMMZe].

---

## Veins involved in splanchnic vein thrombosis

SVT primarily involves the following **veins**:

- **Portal vein**: Drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen into the liver [^111gwxDN]; portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the most common SVT site [^112xMMZe] [^113CtPer].

- **Hepatic veins**: Drain blood from the liver into the inferior vena cava [^111gwxDN]; thrombosis here is known as Budd-Chiari syndrome [^116yojPG].

- **Splenic vein**: Drains blood from the spleen [^113CtPer]; splenic vein thrombosis is common, especially with pancreatitis [^114ZHCyx] [^117YRiWw].

- **Mesenteric veins**: Drain blood from the intestines [^115oXo8E]; mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) can cause severe intestinal ischemia [^114Rniry].

---

## Organs included in splanchnic vein thrombosis

SVT involves veins draining **specific abdominal organs**:

| **Vein involved** | **Organ(s) affected** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Portal vein | Liver | - Portal hypertension <br/> - Hepatic dysfunction [^116yojPG] [^116C8mQs] |
| Hepatic veins | Liver | - Budd-Chiari syndrome <br/> - Hepatic congestion [^116yojPG] |
| Splenic vein | Spleen | - Splenomegaly <br/> - Hypersplenism [^114ZHCyx] |
| Mesenteric veins | Intestines (small and large bowel) | - Intestinal ischemia <br/> - Infarction [^114Rniry] [^115oXo8E] |

---

## Clinical implications of splanchnic vein thrombosis

SVT can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Portal hypertension**: Increased pressure in the portal system, causing varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy [^116yojPG].

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Impaired liver function from reduced blood flow [^116NPMLn].

- **Intestinal ischemia**: Reduced intestinal blood flow, potentially causing infarction and necrosis [^114Rniry].

- **Splenomegaly and hypersplenism**: Enlarged spleen with increased sequestration of blood cells [^114ZHCyx].

---

## Risk factors and underlying conditions

Several factors increase **SVT risk**:

- **Liver cirrhosis**: Major risk for portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis [^116C8mQs].

- **Malignancy**: Especially abdominal cancers (e.g. pancreatic, hepatobiliary) [^115KQRDF].

- **Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)**: Strongly associated with SVT [^115gsFxL].

- **Thrombophilia**: Inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states [^112ne9Y1].

- **Abdominal surgery or trauma**: Increases SVT risk [^113cB5Lv].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on imaging tailored to the clinical context. Ultrasound (US) is the **initial non-invasive screening tool** [^116Njgff] [^113WvfFC]. Computed tomography (CT) provides detailed assessment of thrombus extent and organ involvement [^116C8mQs]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an **alternative to CT**, especially when contrast use is a concern [^111p86rv].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management focuses on preventing thrombus progression and recurrence while addressing underlying etiologies [^113biX49]. Anticoagulation therapy prevents **thrombus progression and recurrence** [^113biX49] [^111u5x58]. Endovascular interventions (**thrombolysis or thrombectomy**) are considered in severe cases [^116WvU1e]. Concurrent treatment of underlying conditions such as **cirrhosis, malignancy, or thrombophilia** is recommended [^113WvfFC].

---

Splanchnic vein thrombosis involves the **portal, hepatic, splenic, and mesenteric veins**, affecting the liver, spleen, and intestines [^111gwxDN]. It can cause serious complications such as portal hypertension, hepatic dysfunction, and intestinal ischemia, and requires prompt diagnosis and management [^114Rniry] [^116C8mQs].

### Clinical approach to splanchnic vein thrombosis: Risk factors and treatment [^111gwxDN]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an unusual manifestation of venous thromboembolism that involves one or more abdominal veins, such as the portal, splenic, mesenteric, and supra-hepatic veins. SVT may be associated with different underlying disorders, either local — like abdominal cancer, liver cirrhosis, intra-abdominal inflammation or surgery — or systemic, including hormonal treatment and thrombophilic conditions.

In recent decades, myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) has emerged as the leading systemic cause of SVT. The JAK2 mutation, even in the absence of known MPN, has shown a strong association with the development of SVT, and SVT has been suggested to be the first clinical manifestation of MPN. Recently, an association between SVT, particularly supra-hepatic vein thrombosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria has also been reported.

SVT occurs with heterogeneous clinical presentations, ranging from incidentally detected events to extensive thrombosis associated with overt gastrointestinal bleeding, representing a clinical challenge for treatment decisions. In the absence of major contraindications, anticoagulant therapy is generally recommended for all patients presenting with acute symptomatic SVT. However, there is no consensus about the use of anticoagulant drugs in chronic or incidentally detected SVT. High-quality evidence on the acute and long-term management is substantially lacking, and the risk-to-benefit ratio of anticoagulant therapy in SVT still needs to be better assessed.

For each SVT case, clot characteristics were abstracted from the radiology report, including location (portal vein, including its branches, splenic vein, mesenteric veins — superior or inferior — or hepatic veins); whether it was occlusive; presence of tumor thrombus, as opposed to bland thrombus; presence of characteristics suggesting chronicity; and whether previous imaging studies demonstrated nondiagnostic findings suggestive of SVT.

From our hospital's data warehouse, we extracted basic information, including time and location of the SVT diagnosis, which was classified as outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient. For patients diagnosed in the emergency department or as inpatients, we determined whether full anticoagulation was provided after the diagnosis of SVT.

All cases were then anonymously linked to population-based data sets using encrypted patient healthcare numbers. We linked to the Registered Patients Database, capturing the date of all Ontarian deaths, including those outside the province, to determine if and when patients died. We linked to the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, which captures all emergency department visits, and the Discharge Abstract Database, which captures all hospitalizations and same-day surgeries, to determine whether, before the diagnosis of SVT, patients had been diagnosed with cirrhosis, undergone epigastric surgery in the previous six months, or been diagnosed with acute or chronic pancreatitis in the previous six months.

### Mesenteric venous thrombosis [^114Rniry]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

This review explores the literature on the natural history, diagnosis, and management of mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) in the modern era.

- **Methods**: A review of the contemporary literature from 1997 to 2016 on MVT and its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment was performed.

- **Results**: MVT is an insidious and lethal disease associated with acute mesenteric ischemia. The prevalence of MVT has increased sharply during the past two decades, commensurate with an increase in radiographic imaging for abdominal complaints. The optimal treatment of and approach to MVT is controversial, given the poorly understood natural history of this rare disease. Both endovascular and open surgical strategies, in addition to systemic anticoagulation, have been used as adjuncts to treat MVT with limited success. Despite advances in treatment, mortality associated with MVT is still high. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that failure to recanalize the portomesenteric venous system leads to an increased risk for development of sequelae of portal hypertension.

- **Conclusions**: MVT is a challenging disease to treat, given the difficulty in establishing a prompt initial diagnosis and the inability to reliably monitor patients for evidence of impending bowel infarction. Careful selection of patients for endovascular, open, or hybrid approaches is key to achieving improved outcomes. However, the paucity of prospective data and our evolving understanding of the natural history of MVT make consensus treatment strategies difficult to ascertain.

### Prognostic factors in noncirrhotic patients with splanchnic vein thromboses [^112ne9Y1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), not associated with cancer or liver cirrhosis, is a rare event with limited data available on its natural history, long-term prognosis, and treatment. This study included 121 patients with SVT consecutively seen from January 1998 to December 2005, with 95 of them followed up for a median time of 41 months. Screening for thrombophilic factors was conducted in 104 patients. New thrombotic or bleeding episodes were recorded, and anticoagulant therapy was administered based on pre-established criteria.

- **Results**: SVT was an incidental finding in 34 (28.1%) patients; 34 (28.1%) presented with abdominal infarction; 39 (32.2%) experienced bowel ischemia or acute portal vein thrombosis; and 14 (11.6%) had bleeding from portal hypertensive sources. Survival rates at 1, 3, and 7 years were 95%, 93.3%, and 89.6%, respectively. Notably, 87.5% of deaths occurred at the onset of SVT due to complications of intestinal infarction. Patients with isolated portal vein thromboses manifested symptoms and intestinal infarction in 16/41 (39%) and 0/41 (0%) of cases, respectively. In contrast, superior mesenteric vein thromboses, isolated or otherwise, were associated with symptoms and intestinal infarction in 69/75 (92%) and 34/75 (45%) of cases, respectively. During follow-up, 14 (14.7%) patients experienced 39 episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, with no fatalities. A previous gastrointestinal bleed was linked to new hemorrhagic events during follow-up. New venous thrombotic episodes occurred in 10 of 95 patients (10.5%), with 73% of these episodes occurring in the splanchnic area.

### ACG clinical guideline: Disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^111p86rv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the evaluation of portal vein thrombosis, the ACG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. This is to assess the extension of thrombus into the mesenteric veins and to exclude tumor thrombus in patients with cirrhosis who are developing new portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombus.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^112xMMZe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Previous studies regarding survival in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) are limited. This study measured overall survival in a large cohort of SVTs through linkage to population‐based data.

- **Methods and results**: Using a previously derived text‐search algorithm, we screened the reports of all abdominal ultrasound and contrast‐enhanced computed tomography studies at The Ottawa Hospital over 14 years. Screen‐positive reports were manually reviewed by at least two authors to identify definite SVT cases by consensus. Images of uncertain studies were independently reviewed by two radiologists. One thousand five hundred sixty-one adults with SVT (annual incidence ranging from 2.8 to 5.9 cases/10,000 patients) were linked with population‐based data sets to measure the presence of concomitant cancer and survival status. Thrombosis involved multiple veins in 314 patients (20.1%), most commonly the portal vein (n = 1410, 90.3%). Compared with an age-sex-year matched population, patients with SVT had significantly reduced survival, particularly with local cancer (adjusted relative excess risk for recent cases 12.0 [95% CI, 9.8–14.6] and for remote cases 9.7 [7.7–12.2]), distant cancer (relative excess risk for recent cases 5.7 [4.5–7.3] and for remote cases 5.4 [4.4–6.6]), cirrhosis (relative excess risk 8.2 [5.3–12.7]), and previous venous thromboembolism (relative excess risk 3.8 [2.4–6.0]). One hundred fifty (23.9%) of patients > 65 years of age were anticoagulated within one month of diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: SVT is more common than expected. Most patients have cancer.

### Use of therapeutic anticoagulation in splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YRiWw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis is a well-recognized local vascular complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), estimated to occur in approximately 15% of patients. While splanchnic vein recanalization occurs spontaneously in approximately one-third of patients, severe complications such as bowel ischemia and liver failure have also been reported. At present, there is no consensus on whether patients presenting with AP-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis should receive therapeutic anticoagulation.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases from inception through December 2020 to collect studies that compared the clinical outcomes of patients with AP and splanchnic vein thrombosis who received therapeutic anticoagulation (AC group) with those who did not (N-AC group). A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the relative risk (RR) of vessel recanalization, bleeding complications, collateral formation, and death in the two groups.

- **Results**: Seven studies with 8,353 patients, 339 of whom had splanchnic vein thrombosis, were included in the final analysis. A total of 154 patients (45.4%) had acute severe pancreatitis. A significantly higher proportion of patients had vessel recanalization in the AC group: RR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.17–2.27; I² = 0%; P = 0.004. There was no difference between the two groups in the RR of bleeding complications, collateral formation, and death.

- **Conclusions**: Our analysis demonstrated that, among patients with AP-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis, therapeutic anticoagulation resulted in recanalization of the involved vessels without significant adverse outcomes.

### Incidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis after abdominal surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cB5Lv]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal surgery may increase the risk of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). We determined the incidence of SVT after abdominal surgery and identified groups at the highest risk.

- **Materials and methods**: MEDLINE and Embase were searched for clinical studies evaluating the incidence of postoperative SVT after abdominopelvic surgery. Study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out independently by two reviewers. Clinical heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses (i.e. type of intra-abdominal procedure and organ group).

- **Results**: Of 5549 abstracts screened, 48 were analyzed. The pooled incidence of SVT (n = 50,267) was 2.68% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.24 to 3.11] (1347 events), I² = 96%. The pooled incidence of SVT in high-risk procedures were splenectomy with devascularization (24%), hepatectomy in patients with cirrhosis (9%), and pancreatectomy with venous resection (5%). The pooled incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SVT was 1.02% (95% CI: 0.97% to 1.07%) and 0.98% (95% CI 0.88% to 1.07%), respectively. The most common causes of SVT-related mortality were irreversible thrombosis, bowel ischemia, liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. Most studies included were at a high risk of bias due to lack of prospective data collection and lack of SVT screening for all participants.

- **Conclusions**: Incidence of SVT after abdominal surgery is low but remains a relevant complication. Patients undergoing procedures involving surgical manipulation of the venous system and splenectomy are at the highest risk. Given the life-threatening risks associated with SVT, further studies with prospective designs and comprehensive screening are necessary.

### How I treat rare venous thromboses [^116NPMLn]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism may involve venous sites other than the lower limbs, such as cerebral, splanchnic, and upper limb veins. Although uncommon, these thromboses may be clinically severe and challenging for caregivers. In this review, the main pathogenic, clinical, and therapeutic features of thromboses in rare venous sites are discussed.

Even though there has been significant recent progress in understanding the mechanistic role of inherited and acquired thrombophilia and the interactions between different risk factors, the optimal management of these patients remains unsettled. Currently, management is based on the consensus of experts due to the lack of randomized trials. The implementation of large interdisciplinary registries is a necessary step to optimize the treatment of rare venous diseases.

### Incidence of the JAK2 V617F mutation among patients with splanchnic or cerebral venous thrombosis and without overt chronic myeloproliferative disorders [^115gsFxL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombosis of splanchnic or cerebral veins is a typical manifestation of polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). The recently identified Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F somatic mutation is closely related to chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD).

- **Objective**: To assess the incidence of the JAK2 V617F mutation among patients with splanchnic or cerebral venous thrombosis with or without overt CMD.

- **Patients and methods**: We searched for the mutation in 139 adult patients (> 18 years old) with thrombosis of hepatic veins (HVT, n = 15), or extrahepatic portal vein (PVT) and/or mesenteric vein (MVT) (n = 79), or cerebral veins (CVT, n = 45). Only 19 patients fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of PV (n = 8) or ET (n = 11) at the time of thrombosis: four had HVT, 11 PVT and/or MVT, and four CVT.

- **Results**: The JAK2 V617F mutation was found in 94.7% [95% CI 75.3–99.0] of the patients with overt CMD at the time of thrombosis, in 21.5% (95% CI 13.8–31.7) of the patients with abdominal venous thrombosis and without overt CMD, and in 4.8% (95% CI 1.3–16.1) of the patients with CVT and without overt CMD. Among the patients without overt CMD or thrombophilia and with unprovoked thrombosis, 29.4% (95% CI 16.8–46.1) with splanchnic venous thrombosis and 42.8% (95% CI 24.4–63.4) with PVT had the JAK2 V617F mutation.

- **Conclusions**: A substantial proportion of patients with splanchnic venous thrombosis and a small, but significant, number of patients with CVT can be recognized as carriers of the JAK2 V617F mutation in the absence of overt signs of CMD.

### Acute mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis: Etiology, diagnosis, and interventional management [^116WvU1e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVT) can lead to fatal mesenteric ischemia, with mortality rates ranging from 37% to 76%. Early diagnosis and prompt venous revascularization are crucial in symptomatic cases. Spontaneous recanalization in PVT is rare, making systemic anticoagulation the first-line treatment. However, even with early anticoagulation, recanalization occurs in only 35%-40% of cases. Involvement of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) increases the risk of bowel ischemia, which is associated with poor outcomes.

The primary goals of endovascular treatment for portomesenteric thrombectomy and lysis are to restore blood flow, prevent bowel ischemia, and reduce thrombus burden. This approach aims to alleviate symptoms, preserve liver and intestinal function, and facilitate anticoagulation while minimizing procedural risks. For patients who deteriorate despite anticoagulation, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) via percutaneous transhepatic or transjugular access provides a safe and effective minimally invasive adjunctive treatment.

### Cancer-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis: Clinical implications and management considerations [^115KQRDF]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), a thrombosis involving the portal, mesenteric, splenic veins, and Budd-Chiari syndrome, represents an uncommon type of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Evidence indicates a significant association between SVT and cancer, particularly intra-abdominal solid malignancies such as hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Clinical symptoms of SVT in cancer patients can be ambiguous and are frequently attributed to the primary cancer. Alternatively, SVT may be asymptomatic, detected incidentally during cancer staging or follow-up evaluations.

SVT can also precede the diagnosis of cancer and is associated with poorer outcomes in patients with liver or pancreatic cancers. Therefore, unprovoked SVT warrants a thorough evaluation for underlying malignancy or MPN. Cancer-associated SVT carries a high risk of VTE extension, recurrence, and bleeding; thus, extended anticoagulant treatment is often required in the absence of a high bleeding risk.

Guidelines suggest treatment with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), although available data on the safety and effectiveness of DOACs in these patients is limited. This comprehensive review outlines the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and diagnosis of cancer-associated SVT, and underscores the importance of comprehensive patient evaluation and evidence-based management.

### Anticoagulant therapy for splanchnic vein thrombosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^113biX49]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

Robust evidence on the optimal management of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is lacking. We conducted an individual-patient meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation for SVT. Medline, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to June 2021 for prospective cohorts or randomized clinical trials including patients with SVT. Data from individual datasets were merged, and any discrepancy with published data was resolved by contacting study authors.

Three studies involving a total of 1,635 patients were included. Eighty-five percent of patients received anticoagulation for a median duration of 316 days (range, 1–730 days). Overall, incidence rates for re-venous thromboembolism (reVTE), major bleeding, and mortality were 5.3 per 100 patient-years (p-y; 95% confidence interval, 5.1–5.5), 4.4 per 100 p-y (95% CI, 4.2–4.6), and 13.0 per 100 p-y (95% CI, 12.4–13.6), respectively. The incidence rates of all outcomes were lower during anticoagulation and higher after treatment discontinuation or when anticoagulation was not administered.

In multivariable analysis, anticoagulant treatment appeared to be associated with a lower risk of reVTE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27–0.64), major bleeding (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30–0.74), and mortality (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17–0.31). Results were consistent in patients with cirrhosis, solid cancers, myeloproliferative neoplasms, unprovoked SVT, and SVT associated with transient or persistent nonmalignant risk factors. In patients with SVT, the risk of reVTE and major bleeding is substantial.

### Splanchnic venous thrombosis and pancreatitis [^114ZHCyx]. Pancreas (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis is an inflammatory process with both local and systemic manifestations. A significant local manifestation is thrombosis in the splanchnic venous circulation, predominantly affecting the splenic vein. The literature addressing this critical complication is notably sparse. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms of thrombosis, its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management within the context of both acute and chronic pancreatitis.

### Clinical manifestations and imaging tools in the diagnosis of splanchnic and cerebral vein thromboses [^116Njgff]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) and cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) are uncommon manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), occurring less frequently than deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities and pulmonary embolism. SVT encompasses portal vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, and the Budd-Chiari syndrome. It is, therefore, a heterogeneous disease with differences in clinical manifestations according to the site of thrombosis. CVT includes thrombosis of the cortical or deep cerebral veins and thrombosis of the major dural venous sinuses. Clinical presentation is variable, with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms that can mimic other cerebral diseases.

- **Imaging tools**: There are no clinical algorithms or specific laboratory tests that can guide the identification of SVT and CVT; therefore, the diagnosis relies exclusively on imaging tests. Conventional angiography was once the gold standard for diagnosing SVT and CVT, but it is rarely used nowadays. Abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) with angiography are currently used for diagnosing SVT, while cerebral CT and MR with angiography are used for diagnosing CVT. These imaging tests have different sensitivities and specificities, with various advantages and disadvantages that should be considered when choosing the appropriate imaging test based on the suspected site of thrombosis.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: Treatment algorithm 2018 [^114esgqd]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Ruxolitinib has been specifically evaluated in 21 patients with MPN-associated SVT in a phase 2 clinical trial. The majority of cases were diagnosed with PMF (12), and the others with PV (5 cases) and ET (4 cases). Eighteen patients had spleno-portal-mesenteric thrombosis, two had BCS, and one had both sites involved. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated, with hematological toxicities consistent with those of patients without SVT. After 24 weeks of treatment, a spleen volume reduction of over 35% by MRI was achieved by 29% of patients. MPN-related symptoms, evaluated by dedicated questionnaires, improved significantly during treatment. Treatment with ruxolitinib did not produce meaningful improvements in the status of esophageal varices but was associated with substantial stabilization of varices grade at week 72, as observed in 85% of the patients; furthermore, there was only one bleeding episode. This compares favorably with a prospective study in non-cirrhotic, non-tumoral PVT, where the probability of worsening existing esophageal varices at 1 year was 13%. Overall, the trial showed that ruxolitinib is safe in patients with MPN-associated SVT and effective in reducing spleen size and disease-related symptoms.

ASCT is recommended for all eligible PMF patients with IPSS/DIPSS/DIPSS-plus high or intermediate-2 risk and in selected cases with intermediate-1 risk. A careful evaluation of patient performance status and additional comorbidities is critical in the assessment of transplant candidacy. The impact of SVT has not been specifically studied, but the presence of portal hypertension is a significant concern.

### Safety of vitamin K antagonist treatment for splanchnic vein thrombosis: a multicenter cohort study [^115QMUKu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

The treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is challenging due to the increased risk of bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications. Recommendations are based on evidence from the treatment of venous thrombosis in usual sites, but small observational studies in the SVT population suggest that the bleeding risk may offset the benefit of anticoagulant treatment in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in SVT patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively included SVT patients treated with VKAs followed by 37 Italian anticoagulation clinics until June 2013. The primary outcome was the incidence of major bleeding (MB), according to the ISTH definition, during VKA treatment. Vascular events, including both arterial and venous thrombosis, and mortality were also documented.

- **Results**: Three hundred and seventy-five patients were included (median age 53 years; 54.7% males). During a median VKA treatment duration of 1.98 years, 15 MB events occurred, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.24 (95% confidence interval, 0.75–2.06) per 100 patient-years. Gastrointestinal bleeding represented 40% of all MB events. At multivariate analysis, the presence of esophageal varices emerged as an independent predictor of MB (hazard ratio 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4–21.1). The incidence rate of vascular events on treatment was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.84–2.23) per 100 patient-years, and the mortality rate was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.44–1.54) per 100 patient-years.

### Use of therapeutic anticoagulation in splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xvabp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis is a well-recognized local vascular complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), estimated to occur in approximately 15% of patients. While splanchnic vein recanalization occurs spontaneously in approximately one-third of patients, severe complications such as bowel ischemia and liver failure have also been reported. At present, there is no consensus on whether patients presenting with AP-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis should receive therapeutic anticoagulation.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases from inception through December 2020 to collect studies that compared the clinical outcomes of patients with AP and splanchnic vein thrombosis who received therapeutic anticoagulation (AC group) with those who did not (N-AC group). A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the relative risk (RR) of vessel recanalization, bleeding complications, collateral formation, and death in the two groups.

- **Results**: Seven studies with 8,353 patients, 339 of whom had splanchnic vein thrombosis, were included in the final analysis. A total of 154 patients (45.4%) had acute severe pancreatitis. A significantly higher proportion of patients had vessel recanalization in the AC group: RR 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.17–2.27; I² = 0%; P = 0.004. There was no difference between the two groups in the RR of bleeding complications, collateral formation, and death.

- **Conclusions**: Our analysis demonstrated that, among patients with AP-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis, therapeutic anticoagulation resulted in recanalization of the involved vessels without significant bleeding complications, collateral formation, or mortality differences.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: Risk factors for recurrences in a cohort of 181 patients [^114Cz4dc]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted across 23 centers within the European Leukaemia Network on patients diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) according to the World Health Organization 2008 criteria, following approval from ethics committees. Primary approval was obtained from the central ethics committee of the coordinating center on October 2, 2014.

The participating centers were asked to select patients who had been diagnosed consecutively with MPN and had experienced venous thromboembolism (VTE) objectively documented since January 2005. This included deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the limbs, pulmonary embolism (PE), thrombosis of the cerebral and splanchnic veins (hepatic, portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins), and thrombosis of the retinal vein. Patients selected had also received a course of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants.

Data collection was managed electronically, with centers reporting the total number of medical files by entering data into a specifically developed electronic database. To protect personal privacy, patients were de-identified with an alphanumeric code.

### Successful treatment of extensive splanchnic arterial and portal vein thrombosis associated with ulcerative colitis [^1114MNKY]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Venous and arterial thromboembolism is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Arterial thrombosis of the splanchnic region is a rare event with a very high mortality rate and represents a challenging complication, as it tends to be overlooked and misinterpreted as a clinical exacerbation of UC. We present the case of a 62-year-old female with pancolonic UC complicated by an extensive arterial thrombosis involving the aorta, the celiac trunk, hepatic, gastric, and splenic arteries, and the superior mesenteric artery. Additionally, thrombosis of the splenic vein extending into the proximal portal vein was present. The patient was successfully treated by a combined interventional-radiological and surgical approach. We discuss the rationale behind our management of this case and review the literature on splanchnic arterial thrombosis associated with UC.

### Splanchnic venous thrombosis in a nephrotic patient following COVID-19 infection: a case report [^1139FicN]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The nephrotic syndrome, as well as COVID-19 infection, are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), which involves one or more of the portal, splenic, superior mesenteric, or hepatic veins, is much less common than usual sites of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and has rarely been reported in nephrotic patients. It has also been reported in COVID-19 infected patients and following vaccination with the adenoviral vector-based ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca).

Herein, we report an unvaccinated young adult male with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) who relapsed following SARS-CoV-2 infection and developed portal vein thrombosis (PVT), which rapidly propagated to the spleno-mesenteric, intrahepatic, and the right hepatic veins, resulting in intestinal gangrene.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: Risk factors for recurrences in a cohort of 181 patients [^115XTrUf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) encompasses hepatic veins (Budd–Chiari syndrome, BCS), as well as portal, mesenteric, and splenic veins, and is a rare event in the general population. The annual incidence is 0.8 per million for BCS, 0.7 per 100,000 for portal vein thrombosis, and 2.7 per 100,000 for mesenteric vein thrombosis. In these cases, the JAK2V617F mutation, a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), can be detected in 13.6–26.6% of non-cirrhotic and non-malignant SVT patients, even in the absence of a clear diagnostic picture of MPN.

In fully expressed Philadelphia-negative MPN, including polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia, and primary myelofibrosis, thrombosis more frequently occurs in arterial vessels or leg veins and pulmonary embolisms (PEs). However, it can also occur in unusual sites such as cerebral veins and SVT. These latter sites occur at a much higher frequency (1–10%) than in the general population, where the incidence of these rare events is no more than 2–3 per 100,000.

Whether these events have a higher frequency than in the non-MPN population has not yet been assessed in a large series of patients with a well-established diagnosis of fully expressed MPN. To prevent recurrence, there is a general consensus that vitamin K-antagonist (VKA) should be prescribed long-term, very often in combination with cytoreductive therapy. However, this recommendation is based on a consensus among experts and is not universally accepted. A recent survey involving expert hematologists revealed a marked heterogeneity of choices on the management of these patients.

### The association of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype with non-splanchnic venous thrombosis [^113HHBWX]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

The inherited JAK2 46/1 haplotype is strongly associated with the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and its increased frequency has also been reported in splanchnic venous thrombosis (SVT). In the present study, the role of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype in non-splanchnic venous thrombosis (non-SVT) was investigated.

- **Methods and results**: We genotyped 438 patients with non-SVT, 226 patients with MPNs, and 459 healthy controls for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which tag the JAK2 46/1 haplotype (rs12342421 G > C, rs12343867 T > C, and rs10974944 C > G). We found a statistically significant association of the rs12342421 GC+CC genotypes (OR = 1.40; p = 0.023) and the rs12343867 TC+CC genotypes (OR = 1.83; p = 7.02 x 10(-5)) with non-SVT. We also found that the CC haplotype of these two SNPs was associated with an increased risk of the disease (OR = 1.68; p = 0.009). Stratification analysis indicated that the observed association of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype with non-SVT was probably largely free of the confounding effect of thrombophilic risk factors. In addition, we established a strong association of SNPs rs12342421 and rs10974944 and their CG haplotype with MPNs and with JAK2 V617F-positive MPNs.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides statistical evidence that SNPs rs12342421 and rs12343867 are associated with an increased risk of non-SVT. Consistently, haplotypes of the SNPs were also associated with non-SVT risk, suggesting that inherited genetic variation in the JAK2 gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-SVT. Furthermore, the reported associations of the JAK2 46/1 haplotype underline the importance of genetic factors in understanding this condition.

### Impact of thrombocytopenia on bleeding and thrombotic outcomes in adults with cancer-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis [^112X3mmb]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

- **Patient characteristics**: A total of 581 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 63.6% (n = 368) were male, and 44.2% (n = 257) of patients had a previous diagnosis of cirrhosis. Additionally, 5.2% (n = 30) had a history of VTE, and 6.0% (n = 35) had abdominal surgery in the last 3 months. The most common cancer types were hepatobiliary (55.2%; n = 321), pancreatic (22.0%; n = 128), and colorectal (5.3%; n = 31). Hematologic malignancies accounted for 6.2% (n = 36) of cancers. Most cancers (92.8%; n = 525) were classified as active at the time of index SpVT.

The most common presenting symptom of SpVT was abdominal pain (42.3%; n = 246), whereas 32.7% (n = 190) were diagnosed incidentally. The most commonly involved site in the splanchnic bed was the portal vein (89.3%; n = 519). Based on radiographic characteristics, 70.6% (n = 408) of patients had bland SpVT, whereas 19.9% (n = 115) had tumor SpVT, and 5.5% (n = 32) were mixed type. Of cases for which data were available, the majority of SpVT (68.2%, n = 264) were radiologically classified as partially occlusive.

### Acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis: one disease or two [^11263v75]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the etiology and natural history of acute superior mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) with and without splenic or portal vein involvement.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was carried out on patients with acute superior MVT evaluated between 1979 and 1998. Case records were reviewed, and a questionnaire was mailed to patients for follow-up evaluation. A search was conducted to identify etiologies such as malignancy, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and other risk factors. Patients were divided into two groups: isolated MVT or MVT with splenic or portal vein involvement.

- **Results**: A specific etiology (malignancy, thrombophilia, inflammatory bowel disease, or surgery) was found in 35 of 69 patients. Thirty patients had isolated MVT with involvement predominantly of the small mesenteric veins; in the remaining 39, there was also portal or splenic vein involvement. Patients with isolated MVT were less likely to be diagnosed by imaging studies such as ultrasonography and CT and more likely to have bowel necrosis, requiring surgery more frequently. Inherited hypercoagulable disorders were more often found in patients with isolated MVT. During follow-up, six patients experienced recurrent MVT, and one patient with combined mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis developed variceal bleeding.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with isolated MVT are more likely to have hypercoagulable disorders. Isolated MVT is more difficult to diagnose and more likely to require surgery. Classification of patients with MVT into those with small vessel involvement reveals significant differences in clinical presentation and outcomes.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114jFyge]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) in the setting of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a unique clinical entity that requires close interdisciplinary coordination for proper diagnosis and management. The pathobiology of MPN-SVT is not fully understood, but recent developments have revealed the central role of endothelial cells. In this multidisciplinary review, we summarize the epidemiology of MPN-SVT and then critically evaluate the pathogenic features of this complication, with a focus on endothelial cell biology. We then discuss diagnostic considerations, including imaging modalities and MPN-specific investigations. Finally, we critically review the evidence supporting clinical management of MPN-SVT, including anticoagulation, interventional radiology procedures, MPN-related therapies, and liver transplantation. We conclude that further studies are needed to improve our understanding of MPN-SVT and the outcomes of patients with this debilitating complication.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: Treatment algorithm 2018 [^112mN1Rg]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) may represent the first clinical manifestation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), particularly when the JAK2V617F mutation is present. The prevalence of the JAK2V617F mutation in patients with SVT ranges from 28% in non-malignant, non-cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) to 41% in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Screening for the JAK2V617F mutation in patients with SVT who do not exhibit overt MPN features identified MPN in about 15% of cases. These patients are included in the MPN, unclassifiable (MPN-U) category of the WHO classification, among those MPN-like neoplasms that cannot be clearly classified into other MPN subcategories.

Management of SVT in MPN poses a clinical challenge due to the frequent young age of the patients and the severity of short-term and long-term outcomes if inadequately treated. Therapy should focus on three main goals:

- **Preventing recurrences of thrombosis**: This is essential to mitigate the risk of further complications.
- **Managing the underlying MPN**: Effective management can help control disease progression.
- **Supporting organ dysfunction**: Particular attention should be given to liver function due to its vulnerability in such conditions.

### Anticoagulant therapy for splanchnic vein thrombosis: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111u2s5n]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

The present work provides prospective data on the management and clinical outcomes of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) in a large study population with long-term follow-up. The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE), major bleeding, and all-cause mortality was lower during anticoagulant treatment after adjustment for potentially relevant patient characteristics and across high-risk patient subgroups. The incidence rates of all outcomes increased after anticoagulant treatment discontinuation and were high in patients who did not receive any anticoagulation.

In agreement with previous observations, the present data confirm that a non-negligible proportion of patients with SVT remained untreated (15%), and an additional 16% received treatment for less than 3 months. Although the risk of reVTE in patients with SVT is relevant, concerns for bleeding complications remain major drivers of the decision whether to use anticoagulation. Several studies suggested that anticoagulant therapy may actually lower bleeding risk in these patients, presumably by promoting vein recanalization with decreased intravascular pressure in the splanchnic circulation and gastrointestinal varices. A recent study-level meta-analysis seemed to support this concept, showing increased rates of vein recanalization, lower rates of thrombosis progression, and reduced risk of bleeding complications in anticoagulated patients with SVT. Our results strengthen and extend these earlier observations, confirming the lower risks of reVTE and major bleeding with anticoagulant treatment after adjustment for relevant confounders.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis: Clinical manifestations, risk factors, management, and outcomes [^117JEToU]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations and optimal management strategies in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) are not well characterized.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all newly diagnosed SVT evaluated between January 2007 and December 2018. The efficacy outcome was thrombosis resolution, and safety outcomes included death and occurrence of bleeding.

- **Results**: We included 155 patients with a mean age of 56.2 years (range 18–87). Local risk factors were present in 118 (76.1%) patients, and 30 (19.4%) had only systemic/thrombophilia risk factors. Local risk factors included abdominal cancers (31%), surgery (20.6%), and liver cirrhosis (19.4%). Thrombophilia screening was conducted in approximately 50% of patients. Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin G20210A mutations were observed in 7.1% of patients, whereas 14.4% were JAK2V617F mutation positive. The most common manifestation at onset was abdominal pain (56.1%), while 44.6% of cases were incidentally found. Portal vein thrombosis was observed more in primary cases (91.9% vs. 69.5%, p = 0.012). Anticoagulation was used in 93.5% of cases, with indefinite anticoagulation being used more frequently in primary SVT (62.2% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.045). Thrombosis resolution and bleeding complications among primary (without local risk factors) and secondary (with local risk factors) SVT were observed in 48.5%, 65%, 8.1%, and 11.9%, respectively, with no difference when comparing patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants or warfarin and/or low molecular weight heparin (58% vs. 62%, p = 0.326, 9% vs. 12%, p = 0.518).

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort, an evaluation of SVT management was conducted, highlighting significant findings related to risk factors, treatment, and outcomes.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^116gKn9f]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is one of the most important complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although MPN are common causes of SVT, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this predisposition, their epidemiology, and natural history are not fully understood. Studies have concentrated on the generalized prothrombotic environment generated by MPN and their relationship with abnormal blood counts, thereby furthering our knowledge of arterial and venous thrombosis in this population. In contrast, there are few studies that have specifically addressed SVT in the context of MPN.

Recent research has demonstrated in patients with MPN the existence of factors increasing the risk of SVT, such as the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation and its 46/1 haplotype. Features unique to the circulating blood cells, splanchnic vasculature, and surrounding micro-environment in patients with MPN have been described. There are also abnormalities in local haemodynamics, haemostatic molecules, the spleen, and splanchnic endothelial and endothelial progenitor cells. This review considers these important advances and discusses the contribution of individual anomalies that lead to the development of SVT in both the pre-neoplastic and overt stage of MPN. Clinical issues relating to epidemiology, recurrence, and survival in these patients have also been reviewed, and their results discussed.

### Use of therapeutic anticoagulation in splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cipHa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Characteristics and quality of included studies**: Seven studies with 8,353 patients, out of which 339 had splanchnic vein thrombosis, were included in the final analysis. The severity of pancreatitis was defined according to the Atlanta Criteria, Revised Atlanta Classification, and Balthazar score. Of 135 patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis reported in five studies, 78 (57.7%) were classified as having severe acute pancreatitis (AP). In another study, all 148 of the included patients were classified as having moderately severe or severe AP. Six of the included studies were retrospective in design, while one was a prospective multicenter study. Only one of the included studies was published in abstract form but presented pertinent outcomes of interest. Two studies were conducted in the United States, four in Europe, and one in India. Based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scoring system, all included studies were considered to be of high quality.

- **Search results and population characteristics**: Our initial search strategy yielded 67 results. All search results were exported to Endnote, where 26 obvious duplicates were removed, leaving 41 citations. A schematic diagram demonstrating our study selection process is available. All studies reported information on thrombus location: 26 patients had isolated portal vein thrombosis (PVT), 194 had isolated splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT), and 5 patients had isolated superior mesenteric vein thrombosis (SMVT). A vast majority of patients had a combination of vessels involved. Details of patient characteristics and demographics were available in five studies. A total of 172 males and 91 females were included in our analysis, with mean ages ranging from 36.6 to 58 years.

- **Timeline of events**: Fig. 2 illustrates the timeline of events. Abd.: abdominal; PVT: portal vein thrombosis; SVT: splanchnic vein thrombosis (portal, splenic, mesenteric, and right hepatic veins).

- **Workup for additional hypercoagulable risk factors**: The patient tested negative for lupus anticoagulant, antibodies to cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, and B2-glycoprotein. Additionally, testing was negative for factor V Leiden, MTHFR, JAK2 v617f, and prothrombin G 20210 mutations. Subsequent tests at week 9 showed normal functional protein C and antithrombin III levels. Functional protein S level, measured on two occasions (9 and 18 weeks), was mildly decreased at 0.56 and 0.46 IU/ml respectively (normal range 0.6–1.4 IU/ml), both with normal free protein S levels, suggesting a mild type II deficiency. The test for activated protein C (APC) resistance was negative. Flow-cytometry was negative for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Homocysteine level was mildly elevated at 23 μmol/l, which then normalized. His COVID-19 PCR was intermittently positive for 3 weeks after his initial presentation, while his SARS-CoV-2 total, IgM, and IgG antibodies were positive.

### Safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in splanchnic vein thrombosis associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms [^113K7nnq]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). High credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is one of the vascular complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We designed a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in reducing splenomegaly and improving disease-related symptoms in patients with MPN-associated SVT. Patients diagnosed with myelofibrosis (12 cases), polycythemia vera (5 cases), and essential thrombocythemia (4 cases) received ruxolitinib for 24 weeks in the core study period. Spleen volume was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and splanchnic vein circulation by echo-Doppler analysis.

Nineteen patients carried the JAK2V617F mutation, one had the MPLW515L mutation, and one had the CALRL367fs*46 mutation. Eighteen patients had spleno-portal-mesenteric thrombosis, two had Budd-Chiari syndrome, and one had involvement of both sites; 16 patients had esophageal varices. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with hematological toxicities consistent with those of patients without SVT, and no hemorrhagic adverse events were recorded. After 24 weeks of treatment, a spleen volume reduction of ≥ 35% by MRI was achieved by 6/21 (29%) patients, and a ≥ 50% spleen length reduction by palpation at any time up to week 24 was obtained by 13/21 (62%) patients. At week 72, 8 of the 13 (62%) patients maintained the spleen response by palpation.

No significant effect of treatment on esophageal varices or in splanchnic circulation was observed. MPN-related symptoms, evaluated by MPN-Symptom Assessment Form (SAF) TSS questionnaire, improved significantly during the first 4 weeks and remained stable up to week 24. In conclusion, this trial shows that…

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia secondary to portal, splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis [^111WTyNY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischaemia represents an uncommon complication of splanchnic vein thrombosis, which requires a high level of suspicion to diagnose in a timely manner. This report discusses a case of portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis leading to mesenteric ischaemia and infarct in a 79-year-old man. The diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia and splanchnic vein thrombosis remains difficult due to the non-specific symptoms of these conditions. As diagnosis continues to improve, treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia using medical management has become increasingly possible before ischaemia advances to the point at which surgical resection is required.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^111g5S4F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In patients over 65 years of age, we added parameters for anticoagulation in the prior six months and within the first 30 days following diagnosis to the model. Anticoagulation was classified as any exposure to oral anticoagulants (including warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants) or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). To explore possible reasons for nontreatment, we randomly audited the hospital record of 60 patients with SVT who had been diagnosed in the hospital and received no acute treatment. Patients diagnosed with SVT in the hospital who were fully anticoagulated were classified as having received postdiagnosis LMWH regardless of whether oral anticoagulants were started later.

The treatment analysis excluded four patients who died within the first month of their SVT diagnosis before being exposed to anticoagulants (either in the hospital when diagnosed or as an outpatient) to avoid time-dependent bias.

We screened the reports of all abdominal ultrasounds and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans conducted between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2015, for splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). This process used a text search algorithm derived from a random sample of 4,999 abdominal ultrasound reports, where 16 cases (0.3%) cited an SVT. Our analysis found that reports of these cases contained the text "PORTAL" with "THROMB" elsewhere in the same sentence, achieving 100% sensitivity. The specificity and positive predictive value of this text algorithm were 99.4% and 28.1%, respectively. Cases involving patients under 18 years of age were excluded.

All reports identified by our text search between 2001 and 2015 were independently reviewed by two reviewers to determine whether a definite diagnosis of SVT was made.

Reports considered diagnostic of SVT used descriptors such as:

- **Definite indications**: "Acute thrombus", "acute thrombosis", "acute intraluminal filling defect", "fresh thrombus", "definite thrombus", "evidence of thrombosis", "in keeping with thrombosis", "consistent with thrombosis"

Reports classified as "equivocal" used terms such as:

- **Suggestive terms**: "Suggestive", "probably", "compatible with", "suspicious", "appears to be", "suspected", "likely", "possibly", "implied by", "indicative of", "could be", "believe to be", "might be", "presumably", "may be"
- **Concerning terms**: "Worrisome for", "question of", "favor thrombosis", "thrombus considered", "seems to be", "questionable for", "concerning for", "may represent"

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis: Management for the thrombosis specialist [^113p2hwt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT) is an uncommon site of venous thrombosis associated with complications including portal hypertension and hepatic dysfunction. The evaluation and management of this patient population have evolved in recent years; however, there are limited data from clinical trials to guide management. Given the various acquired and biological risk factors leading to the development of SpVT and the potential complications that can arise from it, input from a multidisciplinary team can be valuable. This team may include thrombosis specialists or hematologists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons.

In this article, we present four cases highlighting important issues and considerations in the evaluation of SpVT, including:

- **Initial diagnostic approach**: In a patient with a new diagnosis of SpVT.
- **Considerations for anticoagulant therapy**: Addressing the appropriate use and regimen for anticoagulants.
- **Management in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms**: Discussing specific strategies tailored to these patients.
- **The role of interventional vascular procedures**: Examining their utility in the management of SpVT.

By reviewing the literature, we address clinically relevant questions that are posed to clinicians managing patients with SpVT and identify gaps in our knowledge that merit future investigation.

### Rivaroxaban for the treatment of noncirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis: An interventional prospective cohort study [^111Zch3L]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of the study was major bleeding during the 3 months of active treatment and up to 2 days after the end of study treatment. Major bleeding events were classified using a modified ISTH definition and the European Medicines Agency definition. According to this definition, bleeding was considered major if it was associated with death; if it was overt and associated with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration by at least 2.0 g/L or with the need for transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells; if it occurred in a critical area or organ such as retroperitoneal, intracranial, intraocular, intraspinal, intraarticular, or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome; or if it resulted in surgical intervention.

Secondary outcomes included all-cause and SVT-related mortality; clinically relevant, nonmajor bleeding occurring during the 3 months of active treatment and up to 2 days after the end of study treatment; detection of alanine aminotransferase levels of 3 times the upper limit of the normal range or higher, with or without bilirubin levels of 2 times the upper limit of the normal range or higher during follow-up; patency of the portal vein trunk and at least one of its main right or left branches; patency of the superior and inferior mesenteric veins and of the splenic veins; symptomatic reSVT; symptomatic VTE in other sites; and mesenteric infarction.

In patients who died during follow-up, death certificates and, if available, autopsy findings were reviewed to establish the cause of death.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^114taVRd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a potentially life‐threatening thrombotic condition that includes thromboses in the portal, splenic, hepatic, or mesenteric veins. SVT has an estimated annual incidence of 0.5 to 1 case per million people per year. SVT presents a clinical challenge for physicians due to a lack of studies evaluating treatment and because acute symptoms may go unrecognized, resulting in patients not getting diagnosed during the acute phase of the disease.

The impact of SVT on survival is uncertain. Deaths associated with SVT could occur due to direct causes like ascites, liver failure, or infarcted bowel, or indirect causes such as the induction of a thrombogenic state, increasing the risk of venous thrombosis at other sites, or an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, studies are limited. Three studies have used primary data collection to examine the survival of patients with SVT, but they included few participants (ranging from 28 to 97). The largest primary data-collection study regarding SVT survival involved 604 cases, followed for a median of 2 years, and recorded 106 deaths. These primary data-collection studies were susceptible to missing deaths from loss to follow-up. Three SVT studies have used population-based death registries to completely measure patient survival, but identified cases using diagnostic codes with uncertain accuracy.

To our knowledge, no study has examined the influence of patient and thrombus characteristics on death risk in SVT. Additionally, the influence of treatment on survival in patient populations remains understudied.

### Rivaroxaban for the treatment of noncirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis: An interventional prospective cohort study [^115VH9bj]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an unusual site manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Of the different sites of SVT, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is the most frequently detected, with a gender-specific annual incidence of 3.78 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in men and 1.73 per 100,000 inhabitants in women. The most common predisposing factors for SVT include liver cirrhosis, solid abdominal cancer, myeloproliferative neoplasms, abdominal surgery, and intra-abdominal infection or inflammatory diseases.

SVT is a potentially life-threatening disease, with a broad range of clinical presentations, including abdominal infarction or gastrointestinal bleeding. The complex balance between bleeding risk and the risk of thrombus extension or recurrence makes the treatment of SVT a clinical challenge. Without anticoagulation, the estimated rates of major bleeding, extension of SVT, and recurrent VTE (reVTE) were 16%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Compared with no treatment, the use of anticoagulation significantly reduced the risk of thrombosis progression and major bleeding by 76% and 27%, respectively; it also increased the rate of recanalization by more than twofold, which is likely the main driver for the observed reduction in bleeding in anticoagulated patients with SVT.

In the absence of major contraindications, anticoagulant therapy is therefore recommended for all patients presenting with acute symptomatic SVT, starting with either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) with a transition to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in most cases.

### Clinical history and antithrombotic treatment of incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis: A multicentre, international prospective registry [^111a9p6H]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). High credibility.

Little information is available about the clinical history of patients with incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis, and its therapeutic management remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors, therapeutic strategies, and long-term outcomes of incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from patients with incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis who were enrolled in an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of splanchnic vein thrombosis between 2008 and 2012. The study was conducted at 31 centers in 11 countries (Italy, South Korea, Germany, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, USA, France, Israel, UK). Information about demographic characteristics, risk factors, and treatment was collected. The study outcomes during the 2-year follow-up were major bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition plus the need for hospital admission), thrombotic events (venous or arterial thromboses), and mortality. The primary analysis period was from the diagnosis of incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis until the first adjudicated clinical outcome or the end of follow-up.

- **Findings**: Between May 2, 2008, and Jan 30, 2012, we enrolled 177 patients with incidentally detected splanchnic vein thrombosis (median age 57 years [IQR 49–66], 118 [67%] men, 138 [78%] patients with portal vein thrombosis). The most common underlying diseases were liver cirrhosis (82 [46%] patients) and solid cancer (62 [35%] patients). Anticoagulant treatment was prescribed to

### Role of thrombophilia in splanchnic venous thrombosis in acute pancreatitis [^111qV6Pu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Splanchnic venous thrombosis (SVT) was present in 26 (27.1%) patients. A single vessel, two vessels, and all three vessels were involved in 19 (73.1%), 3 (11.5%), and 4 (15.4%) patients, respectively. The most commonly involved vessel was the splenic vein in 22 (84.6%) patients, followed by the portal vein in 11 (42.3%) patients and the superior mesenteric vein in 4 (15.3%).

- **Comparison of patients with and without SVT**: When patients with SVT were compared to those without, there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to age, sex, duration of hospitalization, or etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, on clinical presentation, a lump or pleural effusion were present in significantly more patients in the SVT group compared with the no-SVT group. Laboratory parameters were comparable between the two groups. When the outcome variables were compared between the two groups, the presence of necrotizing pancreatitis, CTSI > 6, and MCTSI > 6 were significantly associated with SVT. There was no significant association of SVT with BISAP > 2, presence of SIRS, presence and number of organ failure, severity, need for intervention, or mortality.

In follow-up, none of the recovered patients had variceal bleeding or intestinal ischemia at the 2-month mark.

### Incidence and factors predictive of recurrent thrombosis in people with non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis [^114xvdn8]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Aims: Clinical guidelines do not recommend long-term anticoagulation in non-cirrhotic splanchnic vein thrombosis (NC-SVT) without underlying thrombophilia, as it is assumed that there is a very low risk of recurrent thrombosis (RT). Our first aim was to describe the incidence of RT in people with NC-SVT without an indication for long-term anticoagulation. The second aim was to identify RT risk factors and subsequently verify them in a validation cohort.

Methods: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study evaluating risk factors for RT in 64 people with NC-SVT of idiopathic or local factor etiology. In a subgroup of 48 individuals, the potential value of additional thrombophilic parameters to predict RT was analyzed. Findings were validated in 70 individuals with idiopathic or local factor NC-SVT.

Results: Of the 64 participants in the training cohort, 17 (26%) presented with splanchnic and/or extrasplanchnic RT (overall-RT) during follow-up (cumulative incidence: 2%, 10%, 19%, and 34% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively). Additionally, 53% of people with splanchnic RT were asymptomatic. No clinical or biochemical parameters predicted overall-RT. However, in the 48 individuals who underwent an additional comprehensive thrombophilic study, factor VIII levels ≥ 150% were the only independent factor predicting overall-RT (hazard ratio: 7.10, 95% CI: 2.17–23.17, p < 0.01). The predictive value of factor VIII was significant as it remained a sole predictor for RT in this cohort.

### Survival and recurrence in patients with splanchnic vein thromboses [^115sGQAV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

This study examines the survival and recurrence in patients with thromboses in different segments of the splanchnic vein. **Aims**: The hepatic, splenic, portal, and mesenteric veins are integral parts of the splanchnic system, and it is unclear whether thromboses of isolated segments are distinct entities. We compared etiologies, recurrence rates, and survival among patients with thromboses in various splanchnic venous segments.

- **Methods**: We identified an inception cohort of individuals with their first lifetime incident of splanchnic vein thrombosis occurring between 1980 and 2000. We conducted a case-controlled comparison of re-thrombosis and survival data between these individuals and patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

- **Results**: Our study involved 832 patients (mean age, 53 ± 17 years; 42% women) with isolated portal (n = 329), mesenteric (n = 76), splenic (n = 62), and hepatic (n = 45) vein thrombosis, as well as those with multi-segment involvement (n = 320). Malignancy (27%) and cirrhosis (24%) were the most common etiologies. Recurrence-free survival at 10 years following splanchnic vein thrombosis (76%) was similar to that after DVT (68%) and showed no improvement with anticoagulant therapy. Hormone therapy emerged as the only independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–4.45; p = 0.03). Major bleeding occurred at a rate of 6.9 per 100 patient-years. Independent predictors of bleeding included gastroesophageal varices (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.72–4.03; P < .001) and warfarin therapy (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.25–2.92; p = 0.003). The 10-year survival rate for patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis (60%) was lower than for those with DVT (68%, P < .05). Older age was an associated factor (HR, 1.03; 95% CI).

### Cytomegalovirus-associated splanchnic vein thrombosis in immunocompetent patients: A systematic review [^113CztF6]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occur in more than 5% of hospitalized patients with acute CMV infection. In immunocompetent patients, splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) and splenic infarction have been suggested to represent approximately half of the published cases of CMV-associated VTE. We performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and natural history of CMV-associated SVT in immunocompetent patients.

- **Methods**: Studies were identified by a PubMed and Google Scholar electronic database search until January 2018. All published papers describing immunocompetent adults with SVT occurring concomitantly with an acute CMV infection were included.

- **Results**: Forty-four patients with CMV-associated SVT were described in 38 papers. Twenty-three patients were male, with a mean age of 38.1 years (range, 17–68). Symptomatic SVT occurred in 31 patients, while incidental SVT was found in 13 patients. In symptomatic SVT, an acute and severe onset with small bowel or splenic infarction required surgical treatment for resolution in 22.6% of cases. Anticoagulation induced both a favorable clinical outcome and a recanalization of SVT in more than 70% of the remaining cases. In incidental SVT, a favorable clinical outcome and a complete recanalization of SVT by anticoagulation were reported in more than 80% of cases. No patient with CMV-associated SVT died, and no SVT recurrence was reported.

- **Conclusions**: CMV-associated SVT likely has a favorable clinical course in most patients. Only future, well-designed, prospective studies will elucidate the precise clinical outcomes.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^117VrfHL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, although our case identification process was strong, it could be criticized that we did not have two independent radiologists interpret all imaging studies for SVT status; we relied upon the interpreting radiologist's opinion. If the radiologist indicated definitively in their report that an SVT was present, that patient was identified as an SVT case. However, as stated above, we did review the primary imaging study if the radiologist indicated uncertainty regarding SVT status, which could introduce some misclassification bias to our study.

Second, we cannot accurately determine the cause of the SVT in the patients without cancer. Third, with respect to the treatment data, we could only link treatment data to those over 65 years of age and did not perform detailed, individual chart reviews on all patients. Although most patients did not receive treatment, oral anticoagulants were associated with survival, which we could not demonstrate for LMWH. This is likely because very few patients received LMWH, leading to wide confidence intervals on the survival outcome, and patients taking LMWH may have had advanced oncological disease negating the need for biopsy confirmation. Such cases would not make it into the population-based cancer registry and would be missed by our study.

Finally, we chose not to provide information on cancer treatment or cancer types. We provided information on whether the cancer was local (i.e. in the region of the splanchnic bed) or distant because we thought that these factors could influence both the incidence and outcome.

### Role of red cell mass evaluation in myeloproliferative neoplasms with splanchnic vein thrombosis and normal hemoglobin value: A study of the France Intergroupe des Syndromes myeloprolifératifs [^115fkLsm]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) includes portal vein thrombosis (PVT), Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), and splenic and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis (S/MVT). These conditions are frequently associated with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), with up to 50% of idiopathic SVT cases exhibiting the JAK2 V617F mutation. Diagnosing MPN in the context of SVT is challenging because the resultant portal hypertension, subsequent splenomegaly, and hypersplenism can lower blood cell counts, obscuring the elevated counts typical of MPN.

The routine inclusion of JAK2 V617F mutation screening in SVT patient evaluations has enabled the identification of MPN that lack the usual hematological features, representing about 15% of BCS and PVT cases. These patients, who otherwise would remain undiagnosed, are categorized as having unclassified MPN (MPN-U), leaving the decision to initiate cytoreductive therapy unresolved.

Prior to the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, demonstrating an increased red cell mass (RCM) through isotopic methods was a key diagnostic criterion for polycythemia vera (PV). According to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, hemoglobin levels above 18.5 g/dL in males and 16.5 g/dL in females were considered indicative of increased RCM, leading to the discontinuation of RCM measurement in many facilities. We hypothesized that for patients with JAK2 V617F-positive SVT and normal hemoglobin levels, RCM measurement could facilitate the diagnosis of PV, thereby guiding the initiation and adjustment of cytoreductive therapy.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis: New risk factors and management [^116kYBTT]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a rather heterogeneous disease involving one or more abdominal veins draining from different organs, including the small and large bowel, liver, spleen, and pancreas. It may be associated with a wide spectrum of underlying disorders, either local or systemic. In recent years, the role of new risk factors for SVT, such as the JAK2 V617F mutation and the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone, has been highlighted. The clinical presentations of SVT are variable and may not uncommonly include the concomitant presence of extensive thrombosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, representing a clinical challenge for treatment decisions. High-quality evidence on the acute and long-term management of SVT is substantially lacking, necessitating further research in this area.

### Association of splanchnic vein thrombosis on survival: 15-year institutional experience with 1561 cases [^117X5J2J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

A multicenter, prospective, registry study suggests that 77% of patients will receive treatment, but less than 30% were treated in our population. Our random chart audit of hospital‐based SVT suggested good reasons for this; many had concomitant active bleeding or were considered palliative at the time of diagnosis. The higher proportion of treated patients with SVT in Ageno's registry may be because of their recruitment methods. Although elderly patients were anticoagulated uncommonly in our unselected cohort, treatment of acute SVT with oral anticoagulants was associated with a significant improvement in relative survival.

We are unable with our study design to determine whether this is because of a "healthy‐patient effect", in which treatment is indicative of those with less serious comorbidities and a better prognosis. Certainly, our chart audit suggested that patients who were not treated frequently had grave prognoses. Cohort studies that have reported on treatment likely also had selection bias in which treatment was provided to patients with a better prognosis than those who were left untreated. Therefore, although our study does not provide evidence that refutes guidelines recommending anticoagulation in SVT, it does emphasize the importance of performing a large randomized controlled trial in this population. A recent small randomized trial suggests that rivaroxaban or other direct oral anticoagulants would be justified in such a study.

### ACG clinical guideline: Disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^111zcND4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of portal vein thrombosis, more specifically concerning the choice of anticoagulation, the ACG 2020 guidelines recommend considering initiating either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) once a decision is made to start anticoagulation in patients with portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis with cirrhosis. Preference should be given to UFH in the presence of renal insufficiency, and LMWH in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

### ACG clinical guideline: Disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^116iF7WA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute mesenteric ischemia — particularly in patients with mesenteric vein thrombosis — diagnostic imaging per ACG 2020 guidelines recommends obtaining contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. This approach helps to assess the extension of thrombus into the mesenteric veins and to exclude tumor thrombus in patients with cirrhosis who develop new portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombus.
