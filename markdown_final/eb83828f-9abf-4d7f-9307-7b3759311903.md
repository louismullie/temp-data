## Question

A 32 year old gay man is admitted to the ICU with suspected meningitis. He has neck stiffness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and confusion. He isn't aware of place or time. He had labs in the ED and a lumbar puncture came back positive on India Ink preparation. He is found to have a CD4 count of 89. Which of the following is indicated? Group of answer choices IV flucytosine ART ART and fluconazole Amphotericin B

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment is indicated for a 32-year-old man with advanced HIV who presents with cryptococcal meningitis confirmed by India ink, and how to choose among IV flucytosine, ART, ART and fluconazole, or amphotericin B. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the clinical context. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care induction regimen for cryptococcal meningitis in people with HIV. Next, I will examine why the distractors are incorrect, including ART timing and monotherapy issues. Finally, I will synthesize the correct choice and briefly note adjunctive management steps that would be implemented in parallel, even though they are not among the options presented.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and clinical context. The patient has classic meningitic features with neck stiffness, fever, photophobia, and altered mental status, and the CSF India ink is positive for encapsulated yeast, which in an HIV patient with a CD4 count of 89 strongly supports cryptococcal meningitis. I should double-check that India ink has imperfect sensitivity and that cryptococcal antigen testing is preferred when available, but a positive India ink in this setting is actionable and consistent with CM, so I can proceed with CM-directed therapy while planning confirmatory antigen testing and cultures as feasible [^115yhTnS] [^1132BTUv].

> Next, I should review the standard induction regimen. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what do the guidelines say? The preferred first-line induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is amphotericin B plus flucytosine for 14 days, with liposomal amphotericin B 3–4 mg/kg/day plus flucytosine 25 mg/kg four times daily as the preferred regimen in settings where available, and amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day plus flucytosine as an alternative when liposomal is not accessible; this combination achieves faster CSF sterilization and improved survival compared with alternatives, and it is consistently recommended across IDSA, HIV.gov, and WHO guidance [^116muDaC] [^116ZXmsL] [^113Jjn9o].

> Wait, let me verify the role of flucytosine alone. Flucytosine is never used as monotherapy for cryptococcal meningitis because of rapid resistance emergence and inferior outcomes; it must be paired with amphotericin B during induction, so choosing IV flucytosine alone would be inappropriate here [^116ZXmsL] [^116muDaC].

> I need to check the timing of ART. The question includes ART and ART plus fluconazole as options, but I should confirm that immediate ART is contraindicated in active cryptococcal meningitis due to increased mortality from immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Guidelines recommend deferring ART for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy, with individualized consideration in high-resource settings only if strict ICP monitoring and close follow-up are assured, so selecting ART now would be unsafe [^111gLwRx] [^11316BLX] [^111pRz2U].

> Let me consider fluconazole monotherapy. Fluconazole alone is not appropriate for induction therapy in cryptococcal meningitis; it is reserved for consolidation after 2 weeks of induction with amphotericin B plus flucytosine, or as an alternative oral regimen only when amphotericin is unavailable, and even then WHO prefers fluconazole combined with flucytosine rather than fluconazole alone, so ART plus fluconazole now would be incorrect timing and suboptimal therapy [^116muDaC] [^11269GhK] [^113XpT9j].

> I should double-check the role of amphotericin B alone. While amphotericin B monotherapy has activity, the standard of care is combination with flucytosine because the combination accelerates CSF sterilization and improves survival. Thus, among the listed choices, amphotericin B alone is closer to correct than the other distractors, but strictly speaking it is incomplete without flucytosine, so if forced to pick the single best available option here, amphotericin B is the most defensible choice, recognizing that the ideal regimen would add flucytosine [^116ZXmsL] [^116muDaC] [^113Jjn9o].

> But wait, what about adjunctive management I must not overlook? I need to ensure opening pressure is measured and managed aggressively with daily therapeutic lumbar punctures if elevated, and I should plan inpatient monitoring for at least 7–14 days with repeat LPs to guide ICP control. These steps are integral to care but are not among the pharmacologic options presented in the question stem [^116muDaC] [^115PaJqY] [^1173es1g].

> Synthesis: Given the options, the most appropriate single indicated therapy is amphotericin B, with the understanding that the evidence-based standard is to combine it with flucytosine for induction. ART should be deferred for 4–6 weeks, and fluconazole enters later for consolidation and maintenance after CSF culture conversion, so the correct choice here is amphotericin B [^116muDaC] [^116ZXmsL] [^111gLwRx].

---

The correct answer is **amphotericin B** because cryptococcal meningitis in advanced HIV requires induction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine [^116ZXmsL] [^113Jjn9o]; flucytosine alone is insufficient, ART should be delayed 4–6 weeks to avoid IRIS [^111gLwRx] [^11316BLX], and fluconazole monotherapy is not appropriate for induction [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and clinical context

- **India ink staining**: Rapidly identifies Cryptococcus neoformans by highlighting the capsule; however, it has lower sensitivity than cryptococcal antigen assays and should be confirmed with CSF cryptococcal antigen testing or culture [^1132BTUv] [^112PxHJh].

- **CD4 count**: 89 cells/mm³ indicates advanced immunosuppression, placing the patient at high risk for opportunistic infections, including cryptococcal meningitis [^111WmEBH].

- **Clinical presentation**: Neck stiffness, fever, photophobia, nausea, confusion, and altered mental status are classic features of cryptococcal meningitis [^114PnMCy].

---

## Indicated treatment: induction therapy

The standard induction regimen for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients is **amphotericin B plus flucytosine** for 14 days [^116ZXmsL] [^113Jjn9o]. This combination achieves faster CSF sterilization and reduces mortality compared to other regimens [^112YdvaF].

---

### Rationale for amphotericin B plus flucytosine

- **Amphotericin B**: A polyene antifungal that disrupts fungal cell membranes, providing potent fungicidal activity against Cryptococcus species [^notfound].

- **Flucytosine**: A synergistic partner that inhibits DNA synthesis, enhancing fungal clearance and reducing relapse rates [^112YdvaF].

- **Clinical evidence**: Multiple guidelines and studies endorse this combination as the gold standard for induction therapy in cryptococcal meningitis [^113Jjn9o] [^116muDaC].

---

## Why other options are incorrect

| **Option** | **Reason for incorrectness** |
|-|-|
| IV flucytosine alone | - Insufficient as monotherapy <br/> - Must be combined with amphotericin B for effective induction [^116ZXmsL] [^113Jjn9o] |
| ART alone | - ART is essential for immune recovery but should be delayed 4–6 weeks after antifungal initiation to avoid immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [^111gLwRx] [^11316BLX] |
| ART and fluconazole | - ART should be delayed <br/> - Fluconazole monotherapy is inadequate for induction; it is used in consolidation/maintenance phases [^111gLwRx] [^116muDaC] |

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting amphotericin B plus flucytosine

- **IDSA guidelines**: Recommend amphotericin B (preferably liposomal) 3–4 mg/kg/day IV plus flucytosine 25 mg/kg orally four times daily for 2 weeks [^notfound].

- **WHO guidelines**: Emphasize the importance of this combination, especially in resource-limited settings, and provide alternative regimens if flucytosine is unavailable [^115C6qSr] [^111Xpde6].

- **HIV.gov guidelines**: Reinforce the use of amphotericin B plus flucytosine as the preferred induction regimen [^111N53YV].

---

## Adjunctive management considerations

- **Intracranial pressure management**: Therapeutic lumbar punctures are recommended to manage elevated intracranial pressure, which is common in cryptococcal meningitis [^115PaJqY] [^1173es1g].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of renal function, electrolytes, and liver enzymes is essential during induction therapy due to potential toxicity from amphotericin B and flucytosine [^111N53YV].

- **ART initiation**: Delay ART initiation for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy to minimize the risk of IRIS [^111gLwRx] [^11316BLX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **amphotericin B**, as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in advanced HIV requires amphotericin B plus flucytosine. This regimen is supported by robust clinical evidence and international guidelines, ensuring optimal patient outcomes.

Monitoring treatment response — central nervous system (CNS) cryptococcosis includes assessment of mycological response by a repeat lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination at 2 weeks of treatment, with continuation of induction therapy until CSF culture is negative. Monitoring serial serum cryptococcal antigen titers is not useful for following treatment efficacy. Serial measurement of CSF cryptococcal antigen is more useful; in one study, an unchanged or increased titer of antigen in CSF correlated with clinical and microbiologic treatment failure, and a rise in CSF antigen titer during suppressive therapy was associated with relapse of cryptococcal meningitis. However, monitoring of CSF cryptococcal antigen levels requires repeated lumbar punctures and is not routinely recommended for monitoring response.

Cryptococcal meningitis and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — trial data — show controversy and risks with very early ART. Optimal timing for ART initiation in patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis is controversial, with one randomized, controlled trial including 35 patients suggesting ART was safe when started within the first 14 days of diagnosis, but another African study finding significantly worse outcomes in 54 patients started within 72 hours compared with delay for at least 10 weeks. In a randomized clinical trial at 2 African sites, starting ART within 1 to 2 weeks (median 8 days) versus deferring until 5 weeks (median 36 days) during induction with deoxycholate amphotericin B (0.7–1.0 mg/kg daily) plus 800 mg of fluconazole daily resulted in a significant increase in 6-month mortality in the early ART group (45% vs 30%, P = 0.03), most pronounced during the first 8 to 30 days (P = 0.007), especially when the CSF white cell count was < 5 cells/μL (P = 0.008). The excess deaths were attributed to cryptococcosis, but whether due to meningitis or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is unclear.

Learning points arising from this case:

This case demonstrates the utility of (bedside) fingerprick serum CrAg testing, which gave an immediate clue to the diagnosis.
Do not forget about other opportunistic infections in patients with advanced HIV (her symptoms were also compatible with a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis).
Patients can develop raised ICP even with normal baseline LP OP and when established on treatment — need to maintain close follow-up and ideally have a clear schedule for LPs.
This case illustrates marked global health inequalities in cryptococcal meningitis management; despite persistently raised opening pressures on multiple lumbar punctures and ventriculomegaly on neuroimaging (which would almost certainly have led neurosurgeons to intervene in a high-income setting), she had to endure prolonged, distressing symptoms, repeated procedures and a long hospital stay.

### Treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis in HIV infected adults, with an emphasis on resource-limited settings [^112YdvaF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the advent and increasingly wide availability of antiretroviral therapy, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity amongst individuals with HIV infection in resource-limited settings. The ideal management of CM remains unclear. The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for deciding on which antifungal regimen to use as well as other modalities of management to utilise especially resource poor settings in order to achieve the best possible outcome and enable an individual with CM to survive their acute illness and benefit from antiretroviral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the most effective initial and consolidation treatment strategy for CM in HIV infected adults.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane HIV/AIDS group search strategy was used. Key words in the search included, meningitis, cryptococcus neoformans, treatment, trial, human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, antifungal agents, amphotericin, flucytosine, fluconazole, azole, lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and acetazolamide.

Selection Criteria

Randomised of HIV-infected adults with a first episode of CM diagnosed on CSF examination, by India ink staining, CSF culture or cryptococcal antigen testing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using standardised forms and analysed using Rev Man 4.2.7 software.

Main Results

Six studies are included in the review. Five of the studies compared antifungal treatments and one study addressed lowering intracranial pressure. This study was stopped early due to excess adverse effects. The results of the other five studies as summarised as follows. Mayanja-Kizza 1998 compared fluconazole to fluconazole with 5 flucytosine. The dose of fluconazole used 200mg initially is lower than the recommended initial dose of 400mg. No survival advantage was found with the use of 5 flucytosine in addition to fluconazole. Two studies Brouwer 2004 and van der Horst 1997 compared Amphotericin (AmB) to AmB with 5 flucytosine. Both drugs were given at currently recommended doses for 2 weeks. No survival difference was found at 14 days or at 10 weeks (only recorded in Brouwer 2004). There were significantly more patients with sterile CSF cultures at 14 days in the group that received AmB with flucytosine. Brouwer 2004 compared AmB given alone to AmB given with flucytosine and fluconazole alone or in combination. This was a small study and no differences in mortality were noted between the groups. Bicanic 2008 compared high to standard dose AmB both with flucytosine. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups or adverse events. Leenders 1997 compared standard AmB to liposomal AmB. There was no difference in death rates between the two groups. But there were significantly fewer side effects in the group treated with liposomal AmB.

Authors' Conclusions

The main aim of this review was to determine the best treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. In these settings usually only AmB and fluconazole are available. No studies suitable for inclusion in the review were found that compared these two drugs. Therefore we are unable to recommend either treatment as superior to the other. The recommended treatment for CM is a combination of AmB and flucytosine. The optimal dosing of AmB remains unclear. Liposomal AmB is associated with less adverse events than AmB and may be useful in selected patients where resources allow. Future research into the management of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings should focus on the most effective use of medications that are available in these settings. Flucytosine in combination with AmB leads to faster and increased sterilisation of CSF compared to using AmB alone. As Flucytosine is often not available in developing countries, policy makers and national departments of heath should consider procuring this drug for HIV treatment programmes.

### Cryptococcal meningitis diagnostics and screening in the era of point-of-care laboratory testing [^116C5Zdy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the past ten years, standard diagnostics for cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected persons have evolved from culture to India ink to detection of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), with the recent development and distribution of a point-of-care lateral flow assay. This assay is highly sensitive and specific in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but is also sensitive in the blood to detect CrAg prior to meningitis symptoms. CrAg screening of HIV-infected persons in the blood prior to development of fulminant meningitis and preemptive treatment for CrAg-positive persons are recommended by the World Health Organization and many national HIV guidelines. Thus, CrAg testing is occurring more widely, especially in resource-limited laboratory settings. CrAg titer predicts meningitis and death and could be used in the future to customize therapy according to burden of infection.

Monitoring and adverse events — raised intracranial pressure (ICP) management in cryptococcal meningitis includes that "At the time of diagnosis and on subsequent lumbar punctures, all patients with cryptococcal meningitis should have their lumbar opening pressure measured". Patients with symptoms of increased ICP "should be managed using measures to decrease ICP". An approach is to "measure pressure continuously or repeatedly during the lumbar puncture procedure and to remove CSF until the pressure is approximately half the opening pressure but still no lower than normal", and "This may be repeated as often as every day until symptoms and signs consistently improve". In children, "a cutoff opening pressure of 28 cm of water has been proposed… above which the pressure should be considered elevated". "CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy can be considered… (BIII)", and "Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP in adults with cryptococcal meningitis".

We present two cases of cryptococcal meningitis in people subsequently diagnosed with idiopathic CD4+ lymphopenia. Both presented with new onset headaches without sinister features and were sent home on multiple occasions from emergency departments. Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-negative patients poses major diagnostic and management problems; the associated mortality is 9%-27%. We suggest performing blood and cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen tests in all people with lymphocytic meningitis.

Diagnosis

Figure 4 outlines a plan for approaching patients with suspected CM, encompassing clinical features, differential diagnosis and basic investigations. Box 1 presents practical diagnostic tips, and figure 5 shows images of important diagnostic tests. CM diagnostics have been transformed in recent years, but it is still useful to know the characteristic findings of CSF analysis. These include elevated opening pressure in the left lateral position (sitting lumbar puncture (LP) pressures are unreliable), lymphocytic pleocytosis, high CSF protein and low CSF glucose. In HIV-CM, the CSF white cell count may be lower than expected, or even normal, so it is important to perform specialised tests as outlined in table 1. The recommendations made in table 1 are adapted from the British Society for Medical Mycology 2015 best practice guidelines.

Box 1
Diagnostic tips

Think about cryptococcal meningitis (CM) if your patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows abnormal white cell count (especially lymphocytosis), glucose or protein concentrations.
In a UK setting, for the correct CSF tests to be performed, it is important to specify that a patient is immunocompromised on the test request, or notify the laboratory.
India ink microscopy is no longer recommended unless cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assays are unavailable.
Serum and CSF CrAg are qualitative lateral flow tests with high sensitivity and specificity — in symptomatic patients, negative CSF CrAg effectively rules out CM.
Once positive, CrAg remains so for many months — it cannot be used to monitor treatment response or to diagnose early CM relapse.
Fungal culture can be helpful for diagnosis, but treatment is not usually contingent on antifungal sensitivities; it is, therefore, most useful in CM recurrence and relapse.
Where possible, a contrast-enhanced MRI brain should be performed within 48 hours in immunocompromised patients with suspected or proven meningitis and/or new neurological features such as seizures, persistent headache and altered mental state.

### Functional outcomes in adults with tuberculous meningitis admitted to the ICU: a multicenter cohort study [^116TQr3N]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) represents the most severe form of tuberculosis. TBM is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in nonendemic areas and may represent an underestimated cause in patients presenting with acute meningoencephalitis. It is frequently associated with neurologic complications requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), including brain infarction, acute hydrocephalus, tuberculomas, and basal arachnoiditis.

Diagnosis of TBM remains difficult, mainly based on brain MRI and the isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the CSF, and the initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy remains empirical. Since 2010, a consensus diagnostic score has been proposed to identify each suspected case as defined, probable, possible, or excluded TBM.

Mortality in adult TBM reaches 30–60%, and severe disability is reported in more than 25% of survivors. Main indicators of poor outcome in adult patients include delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, higher Medical Research Council (MRC) disease severity grade, lower cerebrospinal fluid lymphocyte cell count, and anti-tubercular drug resistance. Adjunctive steroids reduce mortality, but may have no effect on disabling neurologic sequelae in survivors. Moreover, the benefit of steroids is controversial in HIV-infected individuals and in patients with MRC grade 3 illness at presentation. However, most prognostic studies have been conducted in endemic areas of TBM, with no or limited access to intensive care. Data on TBM patients requiring ICU admission are scarce and mainly based on retrospective single-center studies conducted in low or middle-income countries.

In the present study, we aimed to identify indicators of poor functional outcome in adult patients with severe TBM in a nonendemic area with high access to intensive care. In particular, we investigated the effect of adjunctive steroids on functional outcomes and 1-year mortality.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis — Detection of cryptococcal antigen in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other body fluids is highly effective for rapid and accurate diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. A lumbar puncture should be done in any patient with suspected cryptococcal meningitis; CSF cell count, glucose, and protein can be virtually normal with central nervous system cryptococcosis, but the opening pressure usually is elevated. Microscopic examination of CSF on India ink-stained wet mounts can be performed but is largely replaced with the use of the cryptococcal antigen test, and in more than 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis cryptococcal antigen can be detected in CSF or serum by latex agglutination test. Fungal cultures from CSF, sputum, and blood can identify the organism, and in some cases susceptibility testing of the C. neoformans isolate can be beneficial; overall, in vitro resistance to antifungal agents remains uncommon. Diffuse pulmonary disease can be diagnosed through bronchoalveolar lavage with direct examination of India ink-stained specimens, culture, and antigen detection, and focal pulmonary and skin lesions may require biopsy with culture and staining.

Suspecting a case of tubercular meningitis (TBM; as tuberculosis is the commonest opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients in India), a lumbar puncture was performed and a cerebrospinal fluid study revealed TBM. The patient was started on combination antitubercular drug therapy from directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) (Cat 1 regimen) along with pyridoxine 40 mg/day and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy. However, despite adequate antitubercular therapy for 4 weeks, the patient did not show any improvement in his clinical condition.

### Repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures in cryptococcal meningitis-necessity and / or opportunity? [^112cTZiQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Overall, 50–70% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis have raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Multiple international treatment guidelines recommend repeated therapeutic lumbar punctures as adjunctive management. Here, we review the recent evidence for the role of repeated lumbar punctures on clinical outcome in cryptococcal meningitis and also review the increasing body of data utilizing these repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples as a window into understanding immunopathogenesis of cryptococcal meningitis.

Recent Findings

Adjunctive dexamethasone led to higher adverse advents and disability and poorer CSF fungal clearance. Performance of a therapeutic lumbar puncture is associated with 69% relative survival protection. An activated innate immune system in the CSF is associated with future cryptococcosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome development. The zebrafish model is being utilized in cryptococcal studies allowing live visualization of central nervous system invasion.

Summary

Therapeutic lumbar punctures are a critical part of cryptococcal meningitis management and CSF immunological assays are increasingly being performed in research settings. Finer manipulation of CSF removal and safer surgical techniques for intracranial pressure management applicable to resource-limited settings are needed. More precise and validated guidelines in resource-available settings would be an improvement for care. We look forward to identifying a set of biomarkers, easily performed in routine laboratories or at point-of-care, so as to translate these assays into clinical care. Wide-scale '-omic' studies are likely to be required in future cryptococcal meningitis studies to improve our understanding of this deadly fungus.

Table 3
Complications of cryptococcal meningitis

Clinical deterioration in patients established on treatment may herald CM relapse or treatment failure; an inflammatory treatment reaction; stroke or concurrent pathology (especially in immunocompromised hosts). In this scenario, reimaging and repeat CSF analysis for fungal culture are essential. Repeat CSF CrAg does not help and the presence of yeasts on microscopy should be ingored if cultures are sterile, as this implies non-viability. In patients with negative fungal cultures but persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis, one should consider a diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome. In HIV-CM, starting antiretroviral therapy boosts immune function, improving recognition of fungal antigens and prompting a significant inflammatory response ('paradoxical' immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)). In a high-quality clinical trial, starting antiretroviral therapy 1–2 weeks after CM diagnosis was associated with increased 10-week mortality versus delayed initiation at 5 weeks. As such, in HIV-CM, one should measure the CD4 count at diagnosis, defer starting antiretroviral therapy until 4–6 weeks of antifungal treatment, and use the CD4 count to define fluconazole duration. Fluconazole can be stopped once viral suppression has been achieved and CD4 count exceeds 200 cells/µL. Inflammatory reactions also occur in HIV-negative subgroups, often in immunocompetent hosts. This is termed postinfectious inflammatory response syndrome, a rare phenomenon that occurs 3–5 weeks after starting treatment. Clinically, it resembles CM relapse but patients demonstrate fungal clearance. Consensus global guidelines advocate corticosteroid therapy with close monitoring and management of CSF pressure changes. Steroid-refractory patients may require cyclophosphamide.

Cryptococcomas are single or multifocal space occupying CNS lesions, more common in C. gattii. A more prolonged induction period of 4–6 weeks should be considered in these patients. Corticosteroids are indicated if there is perilesional oedema (seen in 75% of cases) and mass effect; they should be slowly tapered over 4–6 weeks to mitigate the risk of IRIS. Where possible, all cases should be discussed in an multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting involving a surgeon and neuroradiologist, given the wide radiological differential diagnosis for these lesions (including pyogenic brain abscess, tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis and neurocysticercosis), and their frequent need for surgical intervention. There are case reports of persistent radiological lesions in patients who have achieved microbiological and clinical cure.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGENEMIA

Cryptococcal antigenemia constitutes a spectrum of clinical conditions, from preclinical asymptomatic infection (CSF CrAg-negative) through subclinical infection (CSF CrAg-positive, India ink microscopy, or culture positive for Cryptococcus spp. but without overt meningism) to clinical symptomatic infection, usually presenting as fulminant meningitis. Around one-third of individuals with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia have subclinical CM. Additionally, comprehensive screening of 67 asymptomatic CrAg-positive patients in South Africa revealed subclinical cryptococcal infection elsewhere (blood culture growth of C. neoformans in 11 of 67 (16%) and pulmonary cryptococcosis in 2 of 32 (7%) who had samples cultured).

Without treatment, the detection of CrAg in the blood heralds the onset of clinical symptomatic CM, although individuals with antigenemia can remain asymptomatic for weeks to months before clinical meningitis occurs. In South Africa, a cohort study of 707 patients initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) demonstrated that retrospectively determined and thus untreated baseline cryptococcal antigenemia predicted the development of subsequent CM within 1 year with 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity. No cases of meningitis occurred in 294 CrAg-negative patients with CD4 counts ≤ 100 cells/µL within 1 year of testing. Retrospective testing of blood samples taken from patients with HIV-associated CM in Uganda found that cryptococcal antigenemia preceded clinical symptoms by a median of 22 days (range, 5–234). Cryptococcal infection rarely develops in patients who initially test CrAg-negative, occurring in 19 (1.3%) of 1519 CrAg-negative participants of a primary prophylaxis trial in Uganda, mostly prior to ART commencement. Immune reconstitution may be sufficient to clear asymptomatic cryptococcal infection in some CrAg-positive individuals, as observed in 11 of 21 (52%) patients who started ART but not antifungal therapy and remained disease-free, most with decreasing antigen titers during the following year.

Selection of CSF samples for analysis. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.

The presenting symptoms and signs of 87 remaining patients are listed in Table 1. All the patients presented with headache, approximately two‐thirds experienced fever and photophobia, and under half had neck stiffness noted on examination. Eight percent of patients had a rash on presentation. No patient had a seizure documented in the past 7 days of initial presentation.

Table 1
Symptoms and signs of meningitis

The patient clinical and laboratory characteristics are shown in Table 2. One patient was treated for presumed sepsis with a background of immunosuppression post solid organ transplant and monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 2 days without requiring any organ support. There was no other referral to ICU or inpatient mortality. More than half (56.3%) of the patients were admitted under the care of neurologists and 21 (24.1%) were managed by infectious diseases physicians. A small number of patients (11.5%) were discharged home from the emergency department. Persisting neurological sequelae were identified in one patient who was diagnosed with a partial right sixth nerve palsy and right optic disc swelling that required ongoing neurology follow‐up. The cause was believed to be unrelated to the episode of aseptic meningitis. Over half (51.7%) of the patients had a positive viral PCR result on their CSF. The median PCR test turnaround time was 21 h but ranged from 2 to 168 h from the time of collection. A large proportion of patients with negative viral PCR results did not have further investigation for alternative causes of aseptic meningitis including syphilis serology, cryptococcal antigen, India ink stain, or HIV serology during their inpatient admission. Interestingly, 36 (41.4%) of the patients received IV aciclovir despite a presumed diagnosis of meningitis. This was more commonly prescribed to patients admitted under the care of neurologists (27/48; 56.2%) than an infectious diseases physicians (5/21; 23.8%) (p = 0.013).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcosis in HIV — diagnosis and screening: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generally demonstrates mildly elevated levels of serum protein, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and pleocytosis consisting mostly of lymphocytes, and the opening pressure in the CSF may be elevated, with pressures ≥ 25 cm H₂O occurring in 60% to 80% of patients. Cryptococcal disease can be diagnosed through culture, CSF microscopy, or by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection; in patients with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis, 55% of blood cultures and 95% of CSF cultures are positive and visible colonies can be detected within 7 days. India ink staining of CSF demonstrates encapsulated yeast in 60% to 80% of cases. CSF CrAg is usually positive in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, serum CrAg is usually positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset, and a positive serum CrAg should prompt a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal disease. Three methods exist for antigen detection — latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassays, and lateral flow assay — and testing for the antigen in the serum is a useful initial screening tool in diagnosing cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients and may be particularly useful when a lumbar puncture is delayed or refused.

Recommendations for treating cryptococcosis — treating CNS and/or disseminated disease: Treatment consists of three phases — induction, consolidation, and maintenance — and induction therapy has a duration of 2 weeks followed by consolidation therapy. During induction, patients must be followed carefully in the hospital for at least 7 days and ideally 14 days (AII); lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed at Day 7 and Day 14, and if increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is documented, daily LP should be performed until the pressure is decreased into the normal range and symptoms have abated (AII). In the United States and other settings where intensive monitoring is feasible, a preferred induction regimen is liposomal amphotericin B 3–4 mg/kg IV once daily plus flucytosine 25 mg/kg PO four times a day for 2 weeks (AII).

Consolidation and maintenance dosing and relapse risk — evidence could lend support for a higher consolidation dose of 800 mg daily of fluconazole in some settings, though whether this regimen is required across all patient groups and settings is contentious; for maintenance, fluconazole 200 mg daily has been shown to be highly effective at preventing relapse, superior to weekly amphotericin B and itraconazole capsules. A low incidence of cryptococcal meningitis relapse is observed after a minimum 1 year of antifungal therapy in people living with HIV established on ART, who are virologically suppressed or have a CD4 count more than 100 cells/mm3.

Cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure management — "Opening pressure should be measured at every lumbar puncture in patients with cryptococcal meningitis". "Acute symptomatic elevation of the intracranial pressure (≥ 20 cm of CSF) should be managed by daily therapeutic lumbar punctures… usually around 20–30 mL… to reduce the pressure to 50% of opening pressure or to a normal pressure of ≤ 20 cm of CSF". "Perform a scheduled therapeutic lumbar puncture 48–72 h after initial lumbar puncture or 7 days, regardless of initial opening pressure", and persistent raised pressure "should be managed by surgical decompression via temporary lumbar drainage, shunting, or ventriculostomy".

Cryptococcal meningitis induction therapy — preferred regimens and hospital management emphasize that irrespective of which regimen is used, patients must be followed carefully in the hospital for at least 7 days and ideally 14 days (AII), and lumbar puncture should be performed on Day 7 and Day 14 of treatment with daily lumbar punctures if increased ICP is documented until the pressure and symptoms are decreased to the normal range (AII). In the United States and other settings where daily monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function and administration of electrolytes and intravenous fluids is possible, liposomal amphotericin B (IV 3–4 mg/kg daily) plus flucytosine (25 mg/kg orally [PO] four times daily) for 2 weeks is the regimen preferred and recommended by the Panel on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections Adults and Adolescent With HIV (AII). In resource-limited health care settings, a single dose of liposomal amphotericin B (IV 10 mg/kg on Day 1) combined with oral flucytosine (25 mg/kg four times daily) and fluconazole (1,200 mg/day) for 2 weeks is the preferred regimen recommended by the World Health Organization (AI).

Antiretroviral therapy timing for TB meningitis — American Thoracic Society (ATS)/CDC/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend that people with TB meningitis should not start ART before 8 weeks of TB treatment is completed, regardless of CD4 count, based primarily on a randomized trial in 253 people with HIV and TB meningitis conducted in Vietnam. This trial compared immediate ART within 7 days of starting TB treatment with delayed ART started two months after starting TB treatment. The study showed no difference in mortality or TB outcomes, but those receiving immediate ART had a higher rate of severe adverse events. The Panel recommends that for ART-naive people with HIV and TB meningitis, ART should be started once the TB meningitis is under control, after at least 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment (AIII). The greatest risk of early ART is the occurrence of intracerebral TB-IRIS after starting ART, which has been reported in up to 50% of people with HIV and TB meningitis and may increase morbidity and mortality.

Isolated, fully asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia — Whether to sample the CSF to rule out CNS disease is dependent on underlying risk and the serum CrAg LFA titer. Those at lower risk and with serum CrAg titer < 1:80 by LFA (or < 1:20 by EIA or latex agglutination) can be safely treated without lumbar puncture, as empiric treatment for meningitis does not improve outcomes (AI), and all others should undergo CSF sampling to rule out CNS disease.

### Covert cryptococcal meningitis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematous [^112gkPbq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cryptococcal meningitis is a rare but well-recognized illness with a high mortality rate in immunosuppressed patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis in these patients can be challenging, especially in the emergency department (ED), as the clinical presentation may be non-specific, which can lead to delayed treatment.

Objective

To recognize risk factors associated with the development of cryptococcal meningitis infection in patients with SLE and to provide an update on the clinical presentation, prognosis, and therapeutic options.

Case Report

A 21-year-old man with SLE presented with a 4-day history of headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting after being discharged from the ED 1 day before this visit, after lumbar puncture showed normal values. One week before, he had completed 7-day pulse therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide and intravenous methylprednisone for lupus nephritis. The patient was febrile, but the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia. Given his immunocompromised state, a cryptococcal antigen was added to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sent from the prior ED visit and was positive at a titer of 1:8. The patient was treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine for 6 weeks. Ten months later the patient remained free of infection.

Conclusion

Normal neurological and CSF examination do not exclude cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients with SLE. India ink or, preferably, latex agglutination test and CSF fungal culture are recommended. A high level of suspicion is the key in the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis and will help avoid delays in treatment.

Cryptococcal meningitis management when cultures remain positive after induction: For people who completed a 2-week induction but have not improved clinically or remain clinically unstable, continuation or starting of amphotericin B plus flucytosine is recommended until CSF fungal cultures are confirmed negative (BIII). For outpatients with positive CSF cultures after completing 2 weeks of induction therapy, flucytosine can continue for an additional 2 weeks with fluconazole at a dose of 1,200 mg daily or fluconazole monotherapy can be administered at 1,200 mg daily (BIII). A lumbar puncture should be performed after 4 weeks of induction therapy to confirm that the cultures have become negative.

Cryptococcosis — diagnosis in suspected meningitis emphasizes that detection of cryptococcal antigen in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or other body fluids is highly effective, and a lumbar puncture should be done in any patient with suspected cryptococcal meningitis; CSF cell count, glucose, and protein can be virtually normal in central nervous system disease, but the opening pressure usually is elevated. Microscopic examination of CSF on India ink–stained wet mounts can be performed but is largely replaced by cryptococcal antigen testing, and in more than 90% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, cryptococcal antigen can be detected in CSF or serum by latex agglutination test. Fungal cultures from CSF, sputum, and blood can identify the organism; in some cases of refractory or relapsed disease, susceptibility testing of the C. neoformans isolate can be beneficial, and overall, in vitro resistance to antifungal agents remains uncommon. Diffuse pulmonary disease can be diagnosed through bronchoalveolar lavage with direct examination, culture, and antigen detection, and focal pulmonary and skin lesions may require biopsy with culture and staining.
