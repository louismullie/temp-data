## Question

A 32-year-old woman brought to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of palpitations and shortness of breath. She has congestive heart failure. Current medications include furosemide, lisinopril, and atenolol. Her pulse is 124/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows coarse crackles over the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with digoxin is started. Five days later, an ECG shows prolongation of the PR interval. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the observed effect of this drug?
A. Inhibition of myocardial Na+/K+ ATPase
B. Inhibition of AV node L-type Ca2+ channels
C. Increase in vagal tone
D. Decrease in intracellular cAMP

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains why digoxin prolongs the PR interval in a patient with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the PR interval represents and why it might lengthen. Then, I should verify digoxin's primary molecular mechanism and how that translates to electrophysiologic effects. Next, I will examine indirect autonomic effects, especially vagal tone, and whether they meaningfully contribute to PR prolongation. After that, I need to check whether digoxin directly inhibits AV nodal L-type calcium channels or alters cAMP signaling. Finally, I will weigh the options and confirm which mechanism is most directly supported by authoritative sources and clinical labeling.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the ECG finding. The PR interval reflects atrioventricular nodal conduction; prolongation indicates slower AV nodal conduction, which is a recognized effect of therapeutic digoxin dosing and is explicitly described in FDA labeling as a pharmacodynamic effect at therapeutic levels, not necessarily toxicity [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72].

> Now, I need to verify digoxin's primary mechanism. Digoxin inhibits the sodium–potassium ATPase pump, which increases intracellular calcium in myocardium and conduction tissue, increases inotropy, and reduces conduction velocity; importantly, this direct effect includes slowing of AV nodal conduction, which mechanistically explains PR prolongation at therapeutic doses [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72] [^c939f028].

> Wait, let me verify the role of vagal tone. Digoxin does increase parasympathetic tone and slow SA and AV nodal conduction indirectly, but I should be careful not to overstate this as the principal cause of PR prolongation; the FDA labeling emphasizes that the electrophysiologic effects, including PR prolongation, are expected at therapeutic doses and are mediated through Na/K-ATPase inhibition, with vagal effects as contributory rather than primary, so I should not choose "increase in vagal tone" as the best explanation even though it is partially correct [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calcium channels. I initially wondered if digoxin might directly block L-type calcium channels in the AV node like nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, but wait, I should double-check that; digoxin's direct molecular target is Na/K-ATPase, not L-type calcium channels, so option B is not accurate even though calcium flux changes are downstream of Na/K-ATPase inhibition [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72].

> I need to check whether decreased intracellular cAMP is a mechanism. Digoxin does not primarily reduce cAMP; in fact, its indirect autonomic effects include reduced sympathetic tone and enhanced baroreceptor sensitivity, and while cAMP signaling can modulate AV nodal conduction, digoxin's principal mechanism remains Na/K-ATPase inhibition rather than cAMP downregulation, making option D unsupported as the primary explanation [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the hierarchy. The most direct and authoritative explanation for PR prolongation with therapeutic digoxin is inhibition of myocardial Na/K-ATPase, which slows AV nodal conduction; increased vagal tone contributes but is secondary, and digoxin does not directly inhibit AV nodal L-type calcium channels nor does it primarily decrease cAMP, so the best answer is A [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72].

---

The most likely explanation for PR interval prolongation after starting digoxin is **inhibition of myocardial Na+/K+ ATPase** [^83a3b92b], which increases intracellular calcium and slows AV nodal conduction [^cf088f72]. This is a direct, expected effect of therapeutic digoxin and is not itself a sign of toxicity [^83a3b92b]. Increased vagal tone contributes but is not the primary mechanism, and digoxin does not directly block AV node L-type Ca2+ channels or reduce cAMP.

---

## Mechanism of digoxin-induced PR interval prolongation

Digoxin exerts its therapeutic and electrophysiologic effects primarily by **inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump** in cardiac myocytes and conduction tissue [^83a3b92b]. This inhibition increases intracellular calcium via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, enhancing contractility and slowing AV nodal conduction, which prolongs the PR interval [^cf088f72]. This effect is dose-related and expected at therapeutic levels, not necessarily indicating toxicity [^83a3b92b].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Mechanism** | **Relevance to pr interval prolongation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Inhibition of myocardial Na+/K+ ATPase | Direct inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase increases intracellular calcium and slows AV nodal conduction | Primary and direct mechanism of PR prolongation [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72] |
| B. Inhibition of AV node L-type Ca2+ channels | Direct blockade of L-type Ca2+ channels would slow AV conduction | Not a recognized mechanism of digoxin; digoxin does not directly block L-type Ca2+ channels |
| C. Increase in vagal tone | Enhanced parasympathetic activity slows AV nodal conduction | Contributory but secondary to Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72] |
| D. Decrease in intracellular cAMP | Reduced cAMP would decrease AV nodal conduction | Not a recognized mechanism of digoxin |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the correct answer

FDA labeling states that therapeutic digoxin can cause **PR interval prolongation** as an expected electrophysiologic effect, reflecting slowed AV nodal conduction from Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition [^83a3b92b] [^cf088f72]. This is distinct from toxicity, which presents with additional features such as arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurologic effects [^50eac19e].

---

## Clinical implications and management

PR prolongation alone, without other signs of toxicity, is **generally benign** and does not require dose adjustment or discontinuation. Clinicians should monitor for concomitant factors that increase digoxin levels or toxicity risk, such as renal impairment, hypokalemia, or drug interactions (e.g. amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine) [^2da704bd] [^50eac19e].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely explanation for PR interval prolongation after starting digoxin is **inhibition of myocardial Na+/K+ ATPase** [^83a3b92b], which slows AV nodal conduction. This is a direct, expected effect of therapeutic digoxin and is not itself a sign of toxicity [^cf088f72].

After 200 years of use, digitalis still appears to have a place in our armamentarium for heart failure and atrial fibrillation despite the proven survival benefits with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. Digoxin therapy is inexpensive and well tolerated and may result in considerable savings. Digoxin is the only oral inotrope that does not increase mortality in heart failure patients, particularly if low doses are being used. Digoxin therapy should be used in patients with systolic heart failure who continue to have signs and symptoms despite therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitors or diuretics or in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure for rate control.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Heart Failure: Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and improves heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure symptoms as evidenced by exercise capacity and heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but an optimal order for starting these three drugs cannot be specified.

Atrial Fibrillation: Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation—trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

Introduction

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are two emerging epidemics of the 21st century. Despite considerable advances in the management of both conditions, there remain controversies regarding some of the most widely used drugs, including β blockersand cardiac glycosides.Digitalis, first introduced to clinical cardiology by William Withering in Birmingham around 1785, has widely been used as a positive inotrope in heart failure and for its negative chronotropic activity in atrial fibrillation. Recently, the use of digoxin has declined,partially because of concerns about safety after the publication of observational studies reporting increased mortality with digoxin.In contrast, the largest randomised controlled trial of digoxin in heart failure (the DIG trial) showed neutral effects on mortality and a reduction in admissions to hospital compared with placebo, as well as a decrease in mortality among those with low serum digoxin concentrations.The results of several smaller randomised trials were consistent with these findings, showing that digoxin improves symptoms and prevents clinical deterioration.

In atrial fibrillation, however, no such experimental trials exist, and confusion about whether digoxin is truly linked to adverse prognosis has led to the downgrading of digoxin in clinical practice guidelines.Two recent meta-analyses have supported this view but were based solely on a small selection of observational studies,highlighting the need for a more comprehensive assessment. Furthermore, the finding that β blockers have no prognostic impact in patients with heart failure and concomitant atrial fibrillationhas again led to questions as to what alternatives clinicians have available. There is therefore a clear imperative to define the place of digoxin in the clinical management of both heart failure and atrial fibrillation and to guide physicians and patients with an indication for treatment with digoxin.

Digoxin is particularly prone to prescription bias as clinicians have been trained to use digoxin in sicker patients. Statistical adjustment of observational data does not remove all confounding, and even techniques such as propensity score matching cannot replace randomised allocation.Different types of adjustment for confounders often result in conflicting findings, adding to confusion for clinicians. For example, with the same dataset, three post hoc analyses of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial reported different conclusions regarding the safety of non-randomised prescriptions of digoxin.

In view of the potential usefulness of digoxin in heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and in an attempt to settle the uncertainty over adverse outcomes, we assessed the efficacy and safety of digoxin by comprehensively meta-analysing all available observational and experimental studies. Our hypothesis was that study design would have an important impact on the observed mortality associated with digoxin.

As digoxin is no longer first line treatment for either atrial fibrillation or heart failure, it is often prescribed when clinicians detect deterioration in patients resistant to initial treatment. Thus, treatment with digoxin is likely to be influenced by the probability of mortality, creating a scenario of “confounding by indication.”We have clearly shown the profound differences in baseline characteristics between patients in digoxin and control groups in observational studies and exposed their impact on all cause mortality through meta-regression methods. These differences could partly explain the conflicting results from recent observational studies derived from similar cohorts,a problem not unique to cardiology trials.The disparity in these studies promotes the notion that even sophisticated statistical methods should be interpreted with caution and cannot replace randomisation. Although statistical adjustment for known confounders is often used to combat allocation bias (for example, with propensity matching), important confounders can be unknown or masked. Even with a reasonable selection of adjustment variables, when treatment and control groups differ vastly in characteristics, reliable effect estimates are not possible without breaching the assumptions of the statistical model.With regards to digoxin, our analysis shows that adjustment for known confounders mitigates bias to an extent but will leave residual confounding that results in important clinical impact. Although digoxin has a higher tendency to such bias than other treatments, the same principle will apply to other cardiovascular treatments, providing a cautionary reminder that observational data are hypothesis generating, rather than definitive.

Several additional studies in patients with atrial fibrillation were published during the analysis stage of our study, and these are highlighted in table F in appendix 1. All were either post hoc assessments of trials or cohort/registry studies.One study found a lower death rate in patients treated with digoxin, three identified no association, and four identified higher mortality in patients treated with digoxin. In all studies there were substantial differences in the patients receiving digoxin compared with those receiving control treatment, including higher rates of heart failure, more advanced atrial fibrillation, prognostically worse baseline demographics, and receipt of drugs that have previously been associated with increased mortality, including anti-arrhythmic drugs. Taking all studies into account, our systematic review suggests that digoxin should continue to be considered as a treatment option to achieve control of heart rate in those with atrial fibrillation and also to avoid hospital admissions in patients with heart failure (fig 5). Despite our reassuring data with respect to mortality, clinicians should adhere to guidelines—for example, by ensuring the use of recommended drugs and devices in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, and appropriate anticoagulation in those with atrial fibrillation.

### Digoxin: the good and the bad [^71fda639]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

After 230 years of use, digitalis remains an important and useful therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and the 30-50 % of patients with both conditions. Although the combination of positive inotropic activity with negative chronotropic effects has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in heart failure, there is a distinct lack of robust trial data, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. We recently performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all digoxin studies and demonstrated a neutral effect on mortality. This contradicts prior observational data that overlook the fact that digitalis is usually given as second-line therapy to the sickest patients. Use of these agents in clinical practice should take account of appropriate dose, serum concentration, drug interactions, and potential side effects. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence base for cardiac glycosides and provide a pragmatic guide to their advantages and disadvantages.

### Safety and efficacy of digoxin: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and controlled trial data [^25e55946]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation often co-exist, leading to further adverse prognosis.A recent individual patient data meta-analysis showed that β blockers had no significant effect on mortality or hospital admission in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and concomitant atrial fibrillation.In this context, clinicians have only a single other choice of rate control treatment—namely, digoxin—as calcium channel blockers can have negatively inotropic effects in failing hearts.In this increasingly prevalent population, our findings regarding digoxin might be of particular clinical importance. Our analysis confirmed that, similar to β blockers, digoxin has a neutral effect on mortality in patients with co-existing heart failure and atrial fibrillation, even in observational studies with associated prescription biases. Although there were insufficient data to assess hospital admissions specifically in patients with heart failure plus atrial fibrillation, we found that digoxin reduced admissions for any cause, cardiovascular causes, and heart failure across all study types. Whether digoxin has other beneficial effects, such as an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction or improvement in quality of life, has yet to be determined in patients with atrial fibrillation (for example, the proposed RAte control Therapy Evaluation in Atrial Fibrillation [RATE-AF] randomised trial). This type of information is vital if we are to defend against the enormous healthcare burden posed by these two conditions.

### Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure: risk factors, mechanisms, and treatment [^79fed3fa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF) are commonly encountered together, and either condition predisposes to the other. Risk factors for AF and CHF include age, hypertension, valve disease, and myocardial infarction, as well as a variety of medical conditions and genetic variants. Congestive heart failure and AF share common mechanisms, including myocardial fibrosis and dysregulation of intracellular calcium and neuroendocrine function. Pharmacological treatments including beta-blockers, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can be useful in treating both of these conditions. Antiarrhythmic medications intended to achieve and maintain sinus rhythm may be beneficial in some patients with AF and CHF. Advances in pacemaker and defibrillator therapy, including cardiac resynchronization therapy, may also benefit patients with AF and CHF. Surgical and catheter-based ablation therapy can restore sinus rhythm in patients with AF, with proven benefit in patients with concommitant CHF. Investigational biologic therapy, including cell and gene based therapy, offers promise for the future of reversing the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie AF and CHF.

### Impact of digoxin versus β-blocker in patients with coexistent atrial fibrillation and heart failure: a target trial emulation [^a30bef9f]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of HF therapy, with their benefits in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) strongly supported by large RCTs. As a result, they are given a Class IA recommendation in both European and American guidelines. Beta-blockers are also recommended (Class IB) for AF management due to their ability to slow conduction through the atrioventricular node. However, this recommendation is not based on large, randomized outcome trials. In a patient-level meta-analysis of landmark RCTs including individuals with HFrEF, beta-blockers significantly reduced all-cause mortality in patients with sinus rhythm but not in those with AF at baseline. This discrepancy may stem from the lack of benefit associated with slower heart rates in AF compared to sinus rhythm, and a low heart rate in patients with AF may be an expression of an underlying conduction disorder, which may be associated with impaired outcome itself. Although additional prospective studies are required to elucidate this relationship further, beta-blockers are generally considered safe for patients with AF and HF and are supported by a Class IIa recommendation.

The mechanism of action of digoxin includes neurohormonal (antiadrenergic or vagal) effects, electrophysiological effects (prolongation of the atrioventricular node refractory period), cellular effects (inhibition of the sodium–potassium ATPase pump), and resultant hemodynamic changes. Digoxin is recommended as a Class IIb therapy for symptomatic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, based on evidence from the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) study, which showed that digoxin reduces hospitalization rates and symptom burden but has a neutral effect on mortality. For AF patients, digoxin is recommended as a Class IB therapy for heart rate control, similar to beta-blockers, though previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding its impact on mortality. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested a neutral effect of digoxin on mortality, whereas a 2023 umbrella review indicated that digoxin use is associated with a moderately increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, making a declined trend in digoxin prescription.

14.2 Chronic Atrial Fibrillation

Digoxin has also been studied as a means of controlling the ventricular response to chronic atrial fibrillation in adults. Digoxin reduced the resting heart rate, but not the heart rate during exercise.

In 3 different randomized, double-blind trials that included a total of 315 adult patients, digoxin was compared to placebo for the conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Conversion was equally likely, and equally rapid, in the digoxin and placebo groups. In a randomized 120-patient trial comparing digoxin, sotalol, and amiodarone, patients randomized to digoxin had the lowest incidence of conversion to sinus rhythm, and the least satisfactory rate control when conversion did not occur.

In at least one study, digoxin was studied as a means of delaying reversion to atrial fibrillation in adult patients with frequent recurrence of this arrhythmia. This was a randomized, double-blind, 43-patient crossover study. Digoxin increased the mean time between symptomatic recurrent episodes by 54%, but had no effect on the frequency of fibrillatory episodes seen during continuous electrocardiographic monitoring.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with HF (rate control), ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating digoxin for rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy in patients with AF and HF if other agents are not tolerated.

Discussion

Digoxin has a neutral effect on all cause mortality in randomised trials and is associated with a reduction in hospital admission. This finding is based on a comprehensive systematic review including over 600 000 patients, with meta-analysis incorporating a combined total of four million patient years of follow-up. Based on our analysis, observational studies that report increased mortality with digoxin use (regardless of statistical methods) were unable to adjust for systematic differences in the type of patients who received digoxin. Uniquely, we were able to show that studies exhibiting a higher risk of bias reported a stronger association with all cause mortality, highlighting the need to base clinical decisions relating to patient management on high quality data derived from controlled trials, rather than post hoc or observational data.

Heart failure and atrial fibrillation cause a substantial burden of disease worldwide.Throughout most of the past century, digoxin was routinely used to improve cardiac output and to avoid admission to hospital. Based on information from large randomised trials, the use of digoxin has been eclipsed by the widespread initiation of drugs with prognostic benefit, including ACE inhibitors, β blockers (in sinus rhythm),and aldosterone antagonists.This decline in use followed evidence from the DIG Trial that digoxin does not reduce mortality in patients with heart failure,despite high rates of concomitant digoxin use in most trials of treatment for heart failure. Currently, European and American guidelines recommend digoxin for persistent symptoms, despite optimal treatment, or as an alternative/adjunct to reduce hospital admissions.Atrial fibrillation guidelines preferentially suggest treatment with β blockers over digoxin, except in sedentary patients or as an adjunct for additional rate control.

Atrial fibrillation—combination therapy for rate control emphasizes need and precautions. Combinations of drugs may be required to achieve adequate rate control in some patients with AF, but care should be taken to avoid bradycardia, and the addition of other drugs to digoxin is commonly required to control the rate during exercise.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic (...) [^1a7f8313]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Part I of this guideline detailed how the therapeutic paradigm of heart failure has changed over the past decade. 1 This new understanding of heart failure has led to new treatment approaches. The end point of treatment is no longer merely the limiting of congestive symptoms. Rather, the new standard for treatment also includes decreasing mortality. Part II presents evidence-based treatment options that are practical for use by primary care physicians. The treatment guideline is based on the symptomatic classification scheme described in the first part of this article. 1 The methods for guideline development and the evidence weighting for the recommendations are also detailed in part I.
1. Pharmacologic Therapy: Primary Drugs In this guideline, drugs specifically indicated for use in patients with heart failure are referred to as “primary drugs. ” Use of these drugs according to the new classification scheme is presented in Table 1.

2 Dosing and cost information are provided in Table 2, 2 and “clinical pearls” are given in Table
3. 2 A comparison of the guideline’s recommendations with those from other recent guidelines is presented in Table 4. 3–5 Common drug interactions are listed in Table 5.
2. ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated in the treatment of all patients with systolic heart failure. A number of landmark randomized, controlled trials 6–8 have demonstrated the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing morbidity and mortality in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Unless absolutely contraindicated, ACE inhibitor therapy should be considered a priority. Because of perceived risks and contraindications, ACE inhibitors are often avoided in patients with heart failure. Renal dysfunction and cough should not be considered absolute contraindications to the use of these agents.

When the systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mm Hg or the creatinine level is elevated, careful monitoring is warranted during the initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy. The dosing of ACE inhibitors is controversial. Target dosages that reflect those used in mortality trials are provided in. Table 2. 2 The table includes only agents that have been tested in mortality trials. The Assessment of Treatment with Lisinopril and Survival Study 9 sought to explore whether higher dosages of ACE inhibitors would be more effective. However, the ATLAS study compared high dosages to low dosages, and there was no comparison to the target dosages that had been shown to be effective in mortality trials. Pharmacologic Therapy: Secondary Drugs Drugs occasionally used in patients with heart failure but not specifically recommended for use in this setting are referred to as “secondary drugs” in this guideline.

DIRECT-ACTING VASODILATORS In combination, the direct-acting vasodilators isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine were the first medications shown to improve survival in heart failure. 21, 22. Subsequent studies 23, 24 using the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in patients with New York Heart Association III/IV symptoms suggested that the drugs were safe but did not demonstrate their efficacy. INOTROPES Intravenous inotropic therapy with the sympathomimetics or the phosphodiesterase inhibitors is reserved for use in patients hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure who do not respond adequately or in a timely manner to diuretic therapy, although mortality data are lacking.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Digoxin use in heart failure—patient selection and rate control indicates that physicians may consider adding digoxin in patients with persistent symptoms of HF during therapy with diuretics, an ACEI or ARB, and a beta-blocker, and digoxin may also be added to the initial regimen in patients with severe symptoms who have not yet responded symptomatically during treatment with diuretics, an ACEI, and beta-blockers. Alternatively, treatment with digoxin may be delayed until the patient’s response to ACEIs and beta-blockers has been defined and be used only in patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with the neurohormonal antagonists, and yet another strategy is to initiate aldosterone antagonists and delay the addition of digoxin except in patients who do not respond or who cannot tolerate aldosterone antagonists. If a patient is taking digoxin but not an ACEI or a beta-blocker, treatment with digoxin should not be withdrawn, but appropriate therapy with the neurohormonal antagonists should be instituted. For rate control, digoxin is prescribed routinely in patients with HF and chronic atrial fibrillation, but beta-blockers are usually more effective when added to digoxin in controlling the ventricular response, particularly during exercise, and because beta blockers improve survival and may be effective in controlling rate alone, digoxin should be considered as an adjunctive agent for rate control.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^a3a02737]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this observational study in patients with AF, digoxin use was associated with worse clinical outcomes. In patients with HF, digoxin use was associated with all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, SCD, HF death, and HF hospitalizations. In patients without HF, digoxin use was significantly associated with SCD. While the results in patients with HF might be caused by residual confounding, our results highlight the need to examine digoxin use in patients with AF without HF, in a randomized controlled trial. Given the availability of other rate‐control agents, until the safety of digoxin in patients with AF without HF has been established, the use of the drug in this population should be undertaken with great care, if at all.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

All of digoxin’s actions are mediated through its effects on Na-K ATPase. This enzyme, the “sodium pump,” is responsible for maintaining the intracellular milieu throughout the body by moving sodium ions out of and potassium ions into cells. By inhibiting Na-K ATPase, digoxin

causes increased availability of intracellular calcium in the myocardium and conduction system, with consequent increased inotropy, increased automaticity, and reduced conduction velocity
indirectly causes parasympathetic stimulation of the autonomic nervous system, with consequent effects on the sino-atrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes
reduces catecholamine reuptake at nerve terminals, rendering blood vessels more sensitive to endogenous or exogenous catecholamines
increases baroreceptor sensitization, with consequent increased carotid sinus nerve activity and enhanced sympathetic withdrawal for any given increment in mean arterial pressure
increases (at higher concentrations) sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to both cardiac and peripheral sympathetic nerves
allows (at higher concentrations) progressive efflux of intracellular potassium, with consequent increase in serum potassium levels.

The cardiologic consequences of these direct and indirect effects are an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial systolic contraction (positive inotropic action), a slowing of the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect), decreased conduction velocity through the AV node, and a decrease in the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system (neurohormonal deactivating effect).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The times to onset of pharmacologic effect and to peak effect of preparations of digoxin are shown in Table 7.

Hemodynamic Effects: Short- and long-term therapy with the drug increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance in patients with heart failure. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.

ECG Changes: The use of therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause prolongation of the PR interval and depression of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. Digoxin may produce false positive ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram during exercise testing. These electrophysiologic effects are not indicative of toxicity. Digoxin does not significantly reduce heart rate during exercise.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^b9b87b92]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Digoxin, a positive inotropic agent that blocks atrioventricular conduction, is widely used in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), despite the lack of randomized clinical trials in this population. 1 In patients with AF and concomitant heart failure (HF), digoxin may be prescribed for both of these indications, while in patients without HF, it is used mainly as a rate‐control therapy. 2, 3 The 2014 AF guidelines of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society recommend using digoxin to control resting heart rate in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (class I, level of evidence C), and also in combination with β‐blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, regardless of HF status (class IIa, level of evidence B). 4, 5 The 2016 European Society of Cardiology AF guidelines recommend using digoxin in the long‐term management of AF patients with LVEF above or below 40% (class I, level of evidence B). 3

Conflicting data exist regarding adverse outcomes that are associated with digoxin use in patients with AF. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 While several retrospective studies and meta‐analyses have demonstrated an association between digoxin use and all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and sudden cardiac death (SCD), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 other studies have not found a compelling association. 14, 15, 16 These contradictory results can be attributed to the nature of observational studies and to digoxin prescription biases. It remains unclear whether the association between digoxin and worse clinical outcome is causal or may be the result of residual confounding, mainly dominated by the presence of HF.

Thus, we aimed to examine the association between digoxin use and clinical outcomes (fatal and nonfatal events) in a large contemporary cohort of patients with AF both with and without HF.

### Digoxin (digox) [^f389024d]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) main trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled mortality study of 6801 patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.45. At randomization, 67% were NYHA class I or II, 71% had heart failure of ischemic etiology, 44% had been receiving digoxin, and most were receiving concomitant ACE inhibitor (94%) and diuretic (82%). Patients were randomized to placebo or Digoxin, the dose of which was adjusted for the patient’s age, sex, lean body weight, and serum creatinine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), and followed for up to 58 months (median 37 months). The median daily dose prescribed was 0.25 mg. Overall all-cause mortality was 35% with no difference between groups (95% confidence limits for relative risk of 0.91 to 1.07). Digoxin was associated with a 25% reduction in the number of hospitalizations for heart failure, a 28% reduction in the risk of a patient having at least one hospitalization for heart failure, and a 6.5% reduction in total hospitalizations (for any cause).

Use of digoxin was associated with a trend to increase time to all-cause death or hospitalization. The trend was evident in subgroups of patients with mild heart failure as well as more severe disease, as shown in Table 3. Although the effect on all-cause death or hospitalization was not statistically significant, much of the apparent benefit derived from effects on mortality and hospitalization attributed to heart failure.

In situations where there is no statistically significant benefit of treatment evident from a trial’s primary endpoint, results pertaining to a secondary endpoint should be interpreted cautiously.

Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, digoxin slows rapid ventricular response rate in a linear dose-response fashion from 0.25 to 0.75 mg/day. Digoxin should not be used for the treatment of multifocal atrial tachycardia.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^2ce87fcf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This study has several clinical implications, mainly in patients with AF without HF, in whom randomized studies with digoxin are absent. In these patients, digoxin is usually not prescribed as a first‐line therapy, but rather as an add‐on treatment with another rate‐control agent. Indeed, in our study, about 70% of the patients without HF treated with digoxin were also treated with β‐blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. However, prescribing digoxin as a single rate‐control agent in patients with AF without HF is not rare and may be the result of an adverse event, such as bradycardia experienced with the other rate‐control therapies. Regardless of the reason for prescribing digoxin in patients with AF without HF, our study emphasizes the concern with the use of therapy, which is not supported by adequately sized randomized clinical trials. Consistent with prior data, 1, 27 our findings highlight the complex intersection between digoxin use, HF, and worse clinical outcomes, and raise a concern of a possible association between digoxin use and SCD. This study highlights the unmet need for examining digoxin use in patients with AF with, but particularly without, HF in a randomized trial.

Limitations

This study is an observational post hoc analysis of a randomized trial and should be considered hypothesis generating. Dose and drug concentrations of digoxin were not available during the study. Digoxin use was considered at baseline and data regarding its use during the trial were available only every 3 months in the study visit. Nevertheless, using digoxin as a time‐variant covariate did not change the key results. In addition, both methods of analyzing a concomitant medication have their limitations. 28 Given the low rates of some end points, the multivariable models may be overspecified. Nevertheless, to be consistent, similar multivariate models were used throughout. With regard to SCD, several important factors were not available in this study including documentation of arrhythmia, family history of SCD, and genetic tests; however, all SCD events were adjudicated by an independent committee. The ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial included patients with AF who were at moderate‐high risk, and our results may not be generalized to low‐risk patients with AF. Nevertheless, this study is based on the largest randomized controlled trial in patients with AF. Finally, the association between digoxin and worse clinical outcomes as demonstrated in the current analysis was not demonstrated in the only prospective trial with digoxin in patients with HF. 29 However, this trial was limited to patients in sinus rhythm, and no conclusions can be made with regards to patients with AF.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^0f52175c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

SCD is the single most common cause of death among patients with AF, accounting for about a third of all deaths. 23, 24, 25, 26 In a recent analysis from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, the cause for SCD was unknown in most cases and an arrhythmia was documented in only a minority of SCD events (11.5%). 25 Digoxin is an important factor associated with SCD in this population. 25 The association between digoxin use and SCD in patients with AF appears to be more dominant in individuals without HF, yet the causality is not clear and seems complex. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range and is influenced by drug‐to‐drug interactions, serum electrolyte concentrations, and renal function. 3 In patients with AF, the majority of whom are elderly with concomitant medically treated conditions, digoxin concentration may fluctuate. In this study, patients without HF who were treated with digoxin were elderly (more than half were ≥75 years) with a high burden of comorbidities including diabetes mellitus and reduced renal function. These characteristics may have predisposed them to abnormal digoxin concentration, yet our results did not show any heterogeneity for the risk of SCD by any of these factors, perhaps owing to low statistical power. Whether the concomitant use of β‐blockers with digoxin in patients without HF has a protective effect against SCD is not known and it cannot be established from this observational study. In addition, whether digoxin's inotropic activity in patients without HF can be harmful deserves further research. Thus, revealing additional mechanisms of the association between digoxin use and SCD in patients with AF without HF is of interest.

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

Orthodromic AVRT with pre-excitation—digoxin harms: Oral digoxin is potentially harmful for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and pre-excitation on their resting ECG, and because digoxin shortens the accessory pathway refractory period such that atrial fibrillation may induce ventricular fibrillation and AVRT may degenerate into atrial fibrillation, oral digoxin should not be used to treat patients with a manifest accessory pathway.

### Should we SHIFT our thinking about digoxin? Observations on ivabradine and heart rate reduction in heart failure [^34815e3c]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The importance of heart rate in the pathophysiology of heart failure with reduced LVEF has recently attracted attention. In particular, the findings of the Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine Trial (SHIFT) have put special emphasis on heart rate reduction with ivabradine for improvement in clinical outcomes. Of course, there is a much older drug that reduces heart rate, i.e. digoxin.

Methods and Results

In this short commentary, we retrospectively analyse the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) Trial looking at the primary composite endpoint used in SHIFT (i.e. cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure) and compare the effect of digoxin on this endpoint with that of ivabradine. A remarkably similar risk reduction in the composite outcome and in its components appears evident among patients receiving the active treatment in both studies (although ivabradine was added to a beta-blocker, whereas digoxin was not).

Conclusions

This raises the question of whether the Cardiological community dismissed digoxin too readily and if we should reappraise its potential role in the treatment of heart failure.

7.1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Drugs Prolonging the QT Interval (Inducing Torsade de Pointes)

Coadministration of drugs prolonging the QT interval (such as certain phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain macrolide antibiotics, and Class I and III antiarrhythmics) is contraindicated because of the potential risk of torsade de pointes–type ventricular tachycardia [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Digoxin

In the ANDROMEDA (patients with recently decompensated heart failure) and PALLAS (patients with permanent AF) trials baseline use of digoxin was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic or sudden death in dronedarone-treated patients compared to placebo. In patients not taking digoxin, no difference in risk of sudden death was observed in the dronedarone versus placebo groups [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] .

Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of dronedarone (such as decreased AV-node conduction). Dronedarone increases exposure to digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity .

Calcium Channel Blockers

Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects on the sinus and AV nodes could potentiate dronedarone's effects on conduction.

Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Beta-Blockers

In clinical trials, bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in combination with beta-blockers.

Give a low dose of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

The study DIG was published by Digitalis Investigation Group. and colleagues in 1997 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the DIG study, the trial question was: what is the role of digoxin in patients with a LVEF ≤ 0.45 being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors? In the DIG study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DIG study, the population was: 6800 patients (1520 female, 5280 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with an LVEF ≤ 0.45 being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. The key exclusion criteria were age < 21 years, myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery within 4 weeks, unstable or refractory angina < 1 month, acute myocarditis, HCM, cor pulmonale, or complex congenital heart disease. In the DIG study, the interventions were: n=3397 digoxin (0.25 mg/day) n=3403 placebo (matching placebo per day). In the DIG study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes (34.8% vs. 35.1%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.91 to 1.07). In the DIG study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for worsening HF (26.8% vs. 34.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79) No significant difference in death attributed to worsening HF (11.6% vs. 13.2%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (29.9% vs. 29.5%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.1).

Drug Interactions

Potassium-depleting diuretics are a major contributing factor to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly if administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum digoxin concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result. Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase digoxin absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Absorption). Propantheline and diphenoxylate, by decreasing gut motility, may increase digoxin absorption. Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal digoxin absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations. Rifampin may decrease serum digoxin concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin. There have been inconsistent reports regarding the effects of other drugs [e.g., quinine, penicillamine] on serum digoxin concentration. Thyroid administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of digoxin. Concomitant use of digoxin and sympathomimetics increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Succinylcholine may cause a sudden extrusion of potassium from muscle cells, and may thereby cause arrhythmias in digitalized patients. Although beta-adrenergic blockers or calcium channel blockers and digoxin may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.

Due to the considerable variability of these interactions, the dosage of digoxin should be individualized when patients receive these medications concurrently. Furthermore, caution should be exercised when combining digoxin with any drug that may cause a significant deterioration in renal function, since a decline in glomerular filtration or tubular secretion may impair the excretion of digoxin.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The use of therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause prolongation of the PR interval and depression of the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. Digoxin may produce false positive ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram during exercise testing. These electrophysiologic effects reflect an expected effect of the drug and are not indicative of toxicity.

Digitalis glycosides—mechanism and clinical effects summarize that the digitalis glycosides exert their effects in patients with HF by virtue of their ability to inhibit sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and although a variety of digitalis glycosides have been used in the treatment of HF for the last 200 years, the most commonly used preparation in the United States is digoxin. Several placebo-controlled trials have shown that treatment with digoxin for 1 to 3 months can improve symptoms, quality of life, and exercise tolerance in patients with mild to moderate HF, and these benefits have been seen regardless of the underlying rhythm, cause of HF, or concomitant therapy. In a long-term trial, treatment with digoxin for 2 to 5 years had no effect on mortality but modestly reduced the combined risk of death and hospitalization.

### Rate control in atrial fibrillation [^59b51e1b]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Control of the heart rate (rate control) is central to atrial fibrillation management, even for patients who ultimately require control of the rhythm. We review heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, including the rationale for the intervention, patient selection, and the treatments available. The choice of rate control depends on the symptoms and clinical characteristics of the patient, but for all patients with atrial fibrillation, rate control is part of the management. Choice of drugs is patient-dependent. β blockers, alone or in combination with digoxin, or non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (not in heart failure) effectively lower the heart rate. Digoxin is least effective, but a reasonable choice for physically inactive patients aged 80 years or older, in whom other treatments are ineffective or are contraindicated, and as an additional drug to other rate-controlling drugs, especially in heart failure when instituted cautiously. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker insertion for rate control should be used as an approach of last resort but is also an option early in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with cardiac resynchronisation therapy. However, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation should be considered before atrioventricular node ablation. Although rate control is a top priority and one of the first management issues for all patients with atrial fibrillation, many issues remain.

### Carvedilol alone or in combination with digoxin for the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure? [^25514eec]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study examined the relative merits of digoxin, carvedilol, and their combination for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF).

Background

In patients with AF and HF, both digoxin and beta-blockers reduce the ventricular rate, and both may improve symptoms, but only beta-blockers have been shown to improve prognosis. If combined therapy is not superior to beta-blockers alone, treatment of patients with HF and AF could be simplified by stopping digoxin.

Methods

We enrolled 47 patients (29 males; mean age 68 years) with persistent AF and HF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 24%) in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. In the first phase of the study, digoxin was compared with the combination of digoxin and carvedilol (four months). In the second phase, digoxin was withdrawn in a double-blinded manner in the carvedilol-treated arm, thus allowing a comparison between digoxin and carvedilol (six months). Investigations were undertaken at baseline and at the end of each phase.

Results

Compared with digoxin alone, combination therapy lowered the ventricular rate on 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (p < 0.0001) and during submaximal exercise (p < 0.05), whereas LVEF (p < 0.05) and symptom score (p < 0.05) improved. In phase 2, there was no significant difference between digoxin alone and carvedilol alone in any variable. The mean ventricular rate rose and LVEF fell when patients switched from combination therapy to carvedilol alone. Six-minute walk distance was not significantly influenced by any therapy.

Conclusions

The combination of carvedilol and digoxin appears generally superior to either carvedilol or digoxin alone in the management of AF in patients with HF.

Ventricular arrhythmias—triggered activity mechanisms are described, noting that early afterdepolarizations occur during late repolarization and can precipitate torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT), whereas delayed afterdepolarizations arise after repolarization with intracellular calcium overload and underlie VT in specific contexts. Early afterdepolarizations occur “during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential” and “are the trigger for torsades de pointes VT associated with QT prolongation either induced by medications or other acquired factors or due to mutations of ion channels causing the long QT syndrome.” In contrast, “Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization and develop under conditions of intracellular calcium overload,” and they are “the underlying mechanism for VT in the setting of digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA,” and are “also considered to be an important trigger of VA in the setting of HF.” The substrate may be Purkinje-related, as “Purkinje cells are more susceptible to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release than ventricular myocytes suggesting that delayed afterdepolarizations may be an important mechanism for some Purkinje fiber-related VA.”

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

LANOXIN may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Triggered activity in ventricular arrhythmia (VA) describes early and delayed afterdepolarization mechanisms and their clinical associations. Early afterdepolarizations occur during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential and are the trigger for torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with QT prolongation due to medications, other acquired factors, or long QT syndrome. Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization under intracellular calcium overload; contributing factors include tachycardia, catecholamines, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). Delayed afterdepolarizations are the underlying mechanism for VT in digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA, are considered an important trigger of VA in HF, and Purkinje cell susceptibility to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release suggests early and/or delayed afterdepolarizations as a mechanism for some Purkinje fiber–related VA.

Patients with hyperkalemia or arrhythmias in the setting of digoxin serum levels of >2 ng/mL are at increased risk of death; signs and symptoms of toxicity can manifest at lower serum levels; and adverse events attributable to digoxin Fab therapy are rare and usually clinically insignificant; potassium levels should be monitored.

### Digoxin use is associated with reduced interstage mortality in patients with No history of arrhythmia after stage I palliation for single ventricle heart disease [^f67adc9e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our study offers some initial support for the occult arrhythmia hypothesis as a potential mechanism of IM, although, by no means, proof. Should these findings be confirmed with further research, many questions remain regarding the mechanism of action(s) of digoxin in this setting. In addition to its antiarrhythmia properties, digoxin has effects on the neurohormonal axis of heart failure, and thus the potential mechanism of action may be complex and multifactorial.

Study Limitations

There are several limitations to this study, including the usual limitations when using retrospective registry data, such as the inability to independently verify registry data and the inability to collect any missing data points. The current study used the multiple imputation technique to minimize the latter issue, and, importantly, the findings of increased IM associated with no use of digoxin at discharge were consistent across all imputations. Whereas the number of patient variables collected between birth and time of discharge post‐S1P is extensive in this database, there may be unmeasured confounders that could affect the results. In addition, there is no information collected in the registry on the precise indication for starting digoxin, the drug dosages used, and no data regarding actual patient/family adherence to giving the medication. Although our analysis was based upon digoxin use at S1P discharge and treatment crossover in the interstage period was possible and did occur, data from the last clinic visit before reaching an endpoint (BDG, IM, or transplant) showed that over 90% of infants in each group continued to be prescribed or not prescribed digoxin. Last, though the small number of events created a wide CI, the lower OR confidence limit of 1.9 is still a clinically relevant effect.

### Digoxin use and subsequent outcomes among patients in a contemporary atrial fibrillation cohort [^49e963c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although digoxin has long been used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), its safety remains controversial.

Objectives

This study sought to describe digoxin use over time in patients with AF who were stratified by the presence or absence of HF, to characterize the predictors of digoxin use and initiation, and to correlate digoxin use with outcomes.

Methods

Longitudinal patterns of digoxin use and its association with a variety of outcomes were assessed in a prospective outpatient registry conducted at 174 U.S. sites with enrollment from June 2010 to August 2011.

Results

Among 9,619 patients with AF and serial follow-up every 6 months for up to 3 years, 2,267 (23.6%) received digoxin at study enrollment, 681 (7.1%) were initiated on digoxin during follow-up, and 6,671 (69.4%) were never prescribed digoxin. After adjusting for other medications, heart rate was 72.9 beats/min among digoxin users and 71.5 beats/min among nonusers (p < 0.0001). Prevalent digoxin use at registry enrollment was not associated with subsequent onset of symptoms, hospitalization, or mortality (in patients with HF, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for death: 1.04; without HF, HR: 1.22). Incident digoxin use during follow-up was not associated with subsequent death in patients with HF (propensity adjusted HR: 1.05), but was associated with subsequent death in those without HF (propensity adjusted HR: 1.99).

Conclusions

After adjustment for detailed clinical factors, digoxin use in registry patients with AF had a neutral association with outcomes under most circumstances. Because of the multiple conflicting observational reports about digoxin's safety and possible concerns in specific clinical situations, a large pragmatic trial of digoxin therapy in AF is needed.

### GDMT for heart failure and the clinician's conundrum [^783e74cc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 IVABRADINE AND HEART RATE REDUCTION IN HF, WHY NOT DIGOXIN?

McAlister et al, 16 based on their analysis of landmark beta‐blocker trials, reported an 18% reduction in the risk of death with every 5‐bpm reduction in heart rate for HF patients. Ivabradine was included in the GDMT(class IIa) based on the SHIFT Trial 17 in which despite a 9‐bpm reduction in heart rate, no mortality benefit was shown, perhaps because of the underutilization of beta‐blockers. Only 26% of the patient in the SHIFT trial were on a target dose of beta blockers,11% were not on any beta blockers and 15% were on nonguideline recommended beta blockers. The 26% reduction in heart failure hospitalization in the trial was much lower, than the landmark trials of beta‐blockers, which showed approximately similar posttreatment heart rates, but a 30%‐35% reduction in mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (Table 1). Not surprisingly, a recent report found a limited role for ivabradine in HF patients when beta‐blocker therapy was adequately optimized. 27

Table 1 
Beta blockers, ivabradine, and digoxin trials showing heart rate reduction and mortality and hospitalization outcomes

In patients truly intolerant to beta‐blockers due to hypotension or myocardial depression, reasons for digoxin (class IIb) not favored despite treatment experience of more than century, instead of ivabradine are not clearly explained in the guidelines. Digoxin, by increasing vagal tone while decreasing sympathetic tone, decreases heart rate and acts as a positive inotrope, and it is either neutral to blood pressure or increases it. Unlike ivabradine, digoxin decreases heart rate even in the presence of atrial fibrillation, which was reported to be present in 14%‐16% of patients with HF in the IMPROVE‐HF registry. 5

In the DIG trial 26 digoxin reduced the relative risk of the composite endpoint of death and hospitalization comparably to ivabradine (Table 1), even without concomitant beta‐blocker therapy.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: digitalis toxicity [^678ae5cd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Toxicity from the digitalis family of cardiac glycoside medications remains common. Successful treatment depends on early recognition; however, the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening toxicity remains difficult because the clinical presentation is often nonspecific and subtle. The hallmark of cardiac toxicity is increased automaticity coupled with concomitant conduction delay. Though no single dysrhythmia is always present, certain aberrations such as frequent premature ventricular beats, bradydysrhythmias, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, junctional tachycardia, and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia are common. Treatment depends on the clinical condition rather than serum drug level. Management varies from temporary withdrawal of the medication to administration of digoxin-specific Fab fragments for life-threatening cardiovascular compromise.

### Low-dose digoxin improves cardiac function in patients with heart failure, preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation-the RATE-AF randomized trial [^7601dc4b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To compare the effect of digoxin versus beta-blockers on left ventricular function, in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and symptoms of heart failure within the RATE-AF randomized trial.

Methods and Results

Blinded echocardiograms were performed at baseline and 12-month follow-up using a pre-defined imaging protocol and the index-beat approach. The change in systolic and diastolic function was assessed, stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Overall, 145 patients completed follow-up, with median age 75years (interquartile range 69-82) and 44% women. In 119 patients with baseline LVEF ≥50%, a significantly greater improvement in systolic function was noted in patients randomized to low-dose digoxin versus beta-blockers: adjusted mean difference for LVEF 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3-4.2; p=0.021), s' 1.1cm/s (95% CI 1.0-1.2; p=0.001) and stroke volume 6.5ml (95% CI 0.4-12.6; p=0.037), with no difference in global longitudinal strain (p=0.11) or any diastolic parameters. There were no significant differences between groups for patients with LVEF 40-49% and <40%. Digoxin reduced N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide compared to beta-blockers (geometric mean difference 0.77; 95% CI 0.64-0.92; p=0.004), improved New York Heart Association functional class (odds ratio [OR] 11.3, 95% CI 4.3-29.8; p<0.001) and modified European Heart Rhythm Association arrhythmia symptom class (OR 4.91, 95% CI 2.36-10.23; p<0.001), with substantially less adverse events (incident rate ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.13-0.31; p<0.001). There were no interactions between treatment effects and baseline LVEF for these outcomes (interaction p=0.62, 0.49, 0.07 and 0.13, respectively).

Conclusions

Low-dose digoxin in patients with symptoms of heart failure, preserved LVEF and permanent AF leads to a significantly greater improvement in systolic function compared to treatment with beta-blockers.

### Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of digoxin toxicity [^9dbed8b0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

### Safety and efficacy of digoxin: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and controlled trial data [^e636a785]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To clarify the impact of digoxin on death and clinical outcomes across all observational and randomised controlled trials, accounting for study designs and methods.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Comprehensive literature search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and ongoing studies according to a prospectively registered design (

Prospero

CRD42014010783), including all studies published from 1960 to July 2014 that examined treatment with digoxin compared with control (placebo or no treatment).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Unadjusted and adjusted data pooled according to study design, analysis method, and risk of bias.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome (all cause mortality) and secondary outcomes (including admission to hospital) were meta-analysed with random effects modelling.

Results

52 studies were systematically reviewed, comprising 621,845 patients. Digoxin users were 2.4 years older than control (weighted difference 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.6), with lower ejection fraction (33% v 42%), more diabetes, and greater use of diuretics and anti-arrhythmic drugs. Meta-analysis included 75 study analyses, with a combined total of 4,006,210 patient years of follow-up. Compared with control, the pooled risk ratio for death with digoxin was 1.76 in unadjusted analyses (1.57 to 1.97), 1.61 in adjusted analyses (1.31 to 1.97), 1.18 in propensity matched studies (1.09 to 1.26), and 0.99 in randomised controlled trials (0.93 to 1.05). Meta-regression confirmed that baseline differences between treatment groups had a significant impact on mortality associated with digoxin, including markers of heart failure severity such as use of diuretics (P=0.004). Studies with better methods and lower risk of bias were more likely to report a neutral association of digoxin with mortality (P<0.001). Across all study types, digoxin led to a small but significant reduction in all cause hospital admission (risk ratio 0.92, 0.89 to 0.95; P<0.001; n=29,525).

Conclusions

Digoxin is associated with a neutral effect on mortality in randomised trials and a lower rate of admissions to hospital across all study types. Regardless of statistical analysis, prescription biases limit the value of observational data.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation—rate control (Class IIa): A combination of digoxin and either a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is reasonable to control heart rate at rest and during exercise in AF, with individualized choice and dose modulation to avoid bradycardia (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to use ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node or accessory pathway to control heart rate when pharmacological therapy is insufficient or causes side effects (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone can be useful to control heart rate when other measures are unsuccessful or contraindicated (Level of Evidence: C). When electrical cardioversion is not necessary in AF with an accessory pathway, intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is a reasonable alternative (Level of Evidence: C).

- Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body.
- Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure. Overview Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body. Heart failure is a serious condition, but it does not mean that the heart has stopped beating. Facts about heart failure in the United States
- In the United States, nearly 6. 7 millionadults 20 years old or older have heart failure.
- In 2023, heart failure was mentioned on 452, 573 death certificates.
- Heart failure cost the nation an estimated $30. 7 billionin
2012. This total includes the cost of health care services, medicines to treat heart failure, and missed days of work. Deaths from heart failure vary by geography Heart failure is more common in some areas of the United States than in others.

Below is a map showing the rate of death from heart failure by county. Symptoms Common symptoms of heart failure include:
- Shortness of breath during daily activities.
- Trouble breathing when lying down.
- Weight gain with swelling in the feet, legs, ankles, or stomach.
- Generally feeling tired or weak. Risk factors Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure, including:
- Coronary artery disease and heart attacks.
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Obesity
- Other conditions related to heart disease
- Heart valve disease Unhealthy behaviors can also increase your risk for heart failure, especially for people who have one of the conditions listed above. Unhealthy behaviors include:
- Smoking tobacco.
- Eating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
- Not getting enough physical activity.
- Excessive alcohol intake.

Treatment and recovery Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality and length of life for people who have heart failure. Treatment usually involves the following:
- Taking medicines.
- Reducing sodium in the diet.
- Drinking less liquids.
- Using devices that remove excess salt and water from the blood.
- Having heart transplant and other surgeries.
- Getting daily physical activity. People with heart failure also track their symptoms each day so that they can discuss these symptoms with their health care team.

### Association of digoxin with preserved echocardiographic indices in the interstage period: a possible mechanism to explain improved survival? [^63f9f61b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Digoxin’s protective effect on the RV remodeling is still to be investigated and there are several biologically plausible mechanisms to contemplate.One of them is digoxin’s well‐known inotropic effect through inhibition of the Na, K‐ATPase pump.However, another possible benefit may come from its sympatholytic effect resulting in slowing the heart rate.One can speculate that the drop of the heart rate allows for better coronary perfusion and that leads to less adverse remodeling over time.

In conclusion, our study offers initial support that digoxin might be associated with preservation of the RV indices during interstage. Besides digoxin’s hemodynamic effects, it has also antiarrhythmic effects and modulates the neurohormonal axis of heart failure; thus, digoxin’s potential mechanism of action may be complex and multifactorial. Additional studies will be needed to explore the exact mechanism of action and whether digoxin may carry also longer term survival advantage beyond stage II palliation.

Study Limitations

There are several limitations to this study, including the usual limitations when using retrospective registry data, such as the inability to independently verify registry data and the inability to collect any missing data points. The participants were also not randomized to receive digoxin. In addition, there is no information collected in the registry on the indication for starting digoxin, the drug dosages used, and no data regarding actual patient adherence to giving the medication. However, if digoxin was prescribed to these children because they were felt to be in more‐severe heart failure, one would expect their outcomes to be worse, not better and have worsening echocardiographic findings. There were also 31 patients who died during the interstage period and 10 patients who remained inpatient during interstage for whom we could not identify if they were on or not on digoxin and presumably were the sickest patients of this population and thus would benefit more.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias—management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

### Efficacy and safety of digoxin in acute heart failure triggered by tachyarrhythmia [^e365ee74]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome was heart rate reduction at 24 h and 48 h after 0.75 mg or more of digoxin was given. The primary safety outcomes were AEs possibly related to digoxin, transfer to the ICU, and those observed compared to predicted 30‐day mortality. MEESSI score was calculated to compare observed and predicted mortality. Secondary endpoints included change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 24 h and 48 h.

Among 210 patients recruited between January 2012 and December 2018, the mean age was 79 years, 61% were women, and most had mild‐to‐moderate renal dysfunction (Table S1). Twenty‐three percent of patients had received intravenous beta blockers in the ED prior to receiving digoxin. No patient received additional intravenous beta blocker within 48 h of digoxin (Table S2). One hundred and fifty‐seven patients (75%) remained in atrial fibrillation 48 h after receiving at least 0.75 mg of digoxin. Ninety‐one patients (43%) were discharged with the maintenance dose of digoxin. One hundred and twenty‐two patients (58%) received at least 0.75 mg digoxin within 24 h of admission, while 26% received it within 48 h and the rest of the patients received it after 48 h of admission. Among these patients, heart rate was significantly reduced from 141 ± 22 beats per minute (bpm) at presentation to 101 ± 23 bpm at 24 h and 98 ± 22 bpm at 48h (both p < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure increased significantly after 24 h and 48 h (p < 0.001) with a consistent response irrespective of sex or renal function (Fig. 1, Tables S3 and S4). One patient (0.5%) experienced relevant nausea possibly related to digoxin (Table S5). Predicted and observed 30‐day mortality (10.9% [95% confidence Interval (CI): 9.4–12.5] and 9.0% [95% CI 5.9–13.7], respectively) were comparable.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^50eac19e]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline—digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

### Digoxin therapy and associated clinical outcomes in the MADIT-CRT trial [^6c6aa281]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Digoxin's pharmacological, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological properties are well understood. However, in modern heart failure (HF) treatment, its effect has yet to be fully investigated.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of digoxin on outcomes in patients with mild HF implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) device.

Methods

We investigated the effect of digoxin treatment on the end points of HF/death, HF alone, death alone, and ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in 1820 patients with mild HF (New York Heart Association class I and II), prolonged QRS duration (≥130 ms), and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤30%) enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy trial. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the effect of time-dependent digoxin usage on the end points.

Results

Digoxin therapy was not associated with an increased or decreased risk of HF/death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-1.33; P = .0.56), HF alone (HR 1.1.04; 95% CI 0.82-1.32; P = .76), or death alone (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.67-1.32; P = .71). However, digoxin was associated with a significant 41% increased risk of VT/VF (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.14-1.75; P = .002), which was driven by a significantly increased risk of VT/VF with heart rate ≥200 beats/min (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.27-2.15; P ≤ .001), whereas no increased risk of VT/VF with heart rate <200 beats/min was evident (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92-1.57; P = .19). No significant differences in digoxin's effect on any of the end points were found between patients with ICD and patients with CRT-D (interaction P > .5).

Conclusion

The use of digoxin in patients with mild HF implanted with an ICD or CRT-D device was not associated with reductions in HF/death events. However, digoxin therapy was associated with an increased risk of high-rate VT/VF (≥200 beats/min).

### Digoxin initiation and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation [^7d066252]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Digoxin reduces the risk of heart failure hospitalization but has no effect on mortality in patients with heart failure without atrial fibrillation in the randomized controlled trial setting. Observational studies of digoxin use in patients with atrial fibrillation have suggested a higher risk for poor outcomes. Less is known about this association in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, the examination of which was the objective of the current study.

Methods

We conducted an observational propensity score-matched study of predischarge digoxin initiation in 1768 hospitalized patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation in the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, balanced on 56 baseline characteristics (mean age, 79 years; 55% women; 7% African American). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes were estimated for the 884 patients initiated on digoxin compared with 884 not initiated on digoxin.

Results

HRs (95% CIs) for 30-day, 2-year, and 4-year all-cause mortality were 0.80 (0.55-1.18; P = .261), 0.94 (0.87-1.16; P = .936), and 1.01 (0.90-1.14; P = .729), respectively. Respective HRs (95% CIs) for heart failure readmission were 0.67 (0.49-0.92; P = .014), 0.81 (0.69-0.94; P = .005), and 0.85 (0.74-0.97; P = .022), and those for all-cause readmission were 0.78 (0.64-0.96; P = .016), 0.90 (0.81-1.00; P = .057), and 0.91 (0.83-1.01; P = .603). These associations were homogeneous between patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45% vs >45%.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized older patients with heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation, initiation of digoxin was associated with a lower risk of heart failure readmission but had no association with mortality.

### Effectiveness of digoxin in reducing one-year mortality in chronic heart failure in the digitalis investigation group trial [^36455071]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Post hoc analyses of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial indicate that digoxin at low (0.5 to 0.9 ng/ml) serum digoxin concentration (SDC) reduces mortality, which is eliminated at higher (>or=1 ng/ml) SDC, and that low-dose digoxin (<or=0.125 mg/day) predicts low SDC. In the DIG trial, patients with ambulatory chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure (HF) (n = 7,788) in normal sinus rhythm receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics were randomized to receive placebo (n = 3,899) or digoxin (n = 3,889). The median dose of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) and the target SDC (0.8 to 2.5 ng/ml) were higher than what are currently recommended, which in part may explain the lack of long-term mortality benefit of digoxin in the DIG trial. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of digoxin on short-term outcomes; 1-year all-cause mortality occurred in 392 and 448 patients respectively in the digoxin and placebo groups (hazard ratio for digoxin 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.995, p = 0.043). Respective hazard ratios for cardiovascular and HF deaths were 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.01, p = 0.072) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.85, p = 0.001). All-cause hospitalization occurred in 1,411 and 1,529 patients receiving digoxin and placebo respectively (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, p = 0.002). Respective hazard ratios for cardiovascular and HF hospitalizations were 0.82 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.89, p <0.0001) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.66, p <0.0001). In conclusion, digoxin reduced 1-year mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic HF receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effect of low-dose digoxin in contemporary patients with chronic HF.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^1b260e73]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The development of advanced atrioventricular block (AVB) in patients on bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic therapy (drug-related AVB) represents a clinical challenge, raising the question of whether the AVB is directly caused by these agents (drug-induced AVB) or if the offending drugs exacerbate an underlying conduction system disease. Traditionally, β-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of advanced AVB. However, recent evidence shows a weak cause-and-effect relationship between these drugs and AVB in the elderly, along with high recurrence rates of AVB despite initial resolution after drug discontinuation. This may also apply to patients on high doses of these medications, drug combinations, or with additional reversible factors such as hyperkalemia. Despite these considerations, the European Guidelines do not suggest permanent pacing for AVB due to transient causes that are correctable, including bradycardic/antiarrhythmic drug therapy. On the other hand, the American Guidelines recommend permanent pacing for selected patients with symptomatic second- or third-degree AVB who are on stable, necessary antiarrhythmic or β-blocker treatment, without waiting for drug washout or reversibility. Notably, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that true drug-induced AVB is rare, while recurrence rates are high. Therefore, early permanent pacing should be recommended, especially for frail elderly patients. Moreover, in patients with drug-related AVB and atrial tachyarrhythmias, adopting an early permanent pacing approach seems prudent when bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic treatment is necessary. Finally, delays in permanent pacing are not justified when temporary pacing is needed, given the increased associated risks in such cases.

### Multi-ancestry GWAS of the electrocardiographic PR interval identifies 202 loci underlying cardiac conduction [^9720e924]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Contributing studies

A total of 40 studies (Supplementary Methods) comprising 293,051 individuals of European (N = 271,570), African (N = 8,173), Hispanic (N = 11,686), and Brazilian (N = 485) ancestries contributed GWAS summary statistics for PR interval. Study-specific design, sample quality control and descriptive statistics are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 – 3. For the majority of the studies imputation was performed for autosomal chromosomes and X chromosome using the 1000 Genomes (1000 G:) projectreference panel. A few studies used whole genome sequence data and the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC:)/UK10K and 1000 G phase 3 panel was used for UK Biobank (Full details are provided in Supplementary Table 2).

Ethical approval

All contributing studies had study-specific ethical approvals and written informed consent. The details are provided in Supplementary Note 1.

PR interval phenotype and exclusions

The PR interval was measured in milliseconds (ms) from standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), except in the UK Biobank where it was obtained from 4-lead ECGs (CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51) recorded during a 15 second rest period prior to an exercise test (Supplementary Methods). We requested exclusion of individuals with extreme PR interval values (<80 ms or >320 ms), second/third degree heart block, AF on the ECG, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, those who had a pacemaker, individuals receiving class I and class III antiarrhythmic medications, digoxin, and pregnancy. Where data were available these exclusions were applied.

Study-level association analyses

We regressed the absolute PR interval on each genotype dosage using multiple linear regression with an additive genetic effect and adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, heart rate and any other study-specific covariates. To account for relatedness, linear mixed effects models were used for family studies. To account for population structure, analyses were also adjusted for principal components of ancestry derived from genotyped variants after excluding related individuals. Analyses of autosomal variants were conducted separately for each ancestry group. X chromosome analyses were performed separately for males and females. Analyses using rank-based inverse normal transformed residuals of PR interval corrected for the aforementioned covariates were also conducted. Residuals were calculated separately by ancestral group for autosomal variants, and separately for males and females for X chromosome variants.

### Atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz) [^2e4e2193]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Atazanavir in combination with diltiazem increased diltiazem plasma concentration by 2-fold with an additive effect on the PR interval. When used in combination with atazanavir, a dose reduction of diltiazem by one-half should be considered and ECG monitoring is recommended. In a pharmacokinetic study between atazanavir 400 mg once daily and atenolol 50 mg once daily, no clinically significant additive effect of atazanavir and atenolol on the PR interval was observed. Dose adjustment of atenolol is not required when used in combination with atazanavir. [See Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) .] Pharmacokinetic studies between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval including beta blockers [other than atenolol, see Drug Interactions (7)], verapamil, and digoxin have not been performed. An additive effect of atazanavir and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore, caution should be exercised when atazanavir is given concurrently with these drugs, especially those that are metabolized by CYP3A (eg, verapamil).

5.3 Rash

In controlled clinical trials, rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in approximately 20% of patients
treated with REYATAZ. The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7.3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1.4 weeks. Rashes were generally mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash (occurring at a rate of ≥2%) are presented for the individual clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Dosing with REYATAZ was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash. The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was <1%. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic skin eruptions have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ. [See Contraindications (4) .]

### Digoxin in atrial fibrillation: report from the stockholm cohort study of atrial fibrillation (SCAF) [^18e17787]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies of patients with heart failure and of patients receiving intensive care indicate that digoxin may increase mortality if the patient has atrial fibrillation (AF). Objective To study which patients receive digoxin treatment for AF and what the prognosis is for patients given this treatment.

Method

2824 patients with AF were studied prospectively for a mean of 4.6 years. Information about medication was obtained from the local hospital registry. Information about diagnoses, hospitalisations and deaths was obtained from national registries. Propensity score matching and Cox regression was used to account for confounding.

Results

Factors associated with digoxin use were permanent AF (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.2, confidence interval (CI) 2.7 to 3.9), absence of pacemaker (HR = 2.3, CI 1.6 to 3.2), history of heart failure (HR = 2.0, CI 1.7 to 2.5), treatment in an internal medicine ward rather than a cardiology ward (HR = 1.6, CI 1.3 to 2.0), female sex (HR = 1.6, CI 1.3 to 1.9) and age >or=80 years (HR = 1.4, CI 1.1 to 1.7). More patients with than without digoxin died (51% vs 31%, p<0.001). After adjustment for covariates, however, no disadvantages related to digoxin use could be found for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, time to readmission to hospital or days at hospital/year at risk. The only end point significantly associated with digoxin use was pacemaker implantations, which were more common in digoxin-treated patients (HR = 2.0, CI 1.2 to 3.4).

Conclusion

Digoxin is mainly given to an elderly and frailer subset of patients with AF and is thus associated with an increased mortality. When differences in patient characteristics are accounted for digoxin use seems to have a neutral effect on mortality and major cardiovascular events in patients with AF.
