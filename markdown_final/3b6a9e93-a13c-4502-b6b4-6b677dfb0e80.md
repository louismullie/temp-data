## Question

Warmth compress vs ice pack for breast feeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to use warmth compresses versus ice packs for breastfeeding-related breast pain and engorgement, and how to apply each safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios across the mastitis spectrum and how inflammation and edema drive symptoms. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines (ABM 2022, AAFP 2024) recommend for ice versus heat. Next, I will examine the physiologic rationale to ensure the recommendations align with pathophysiology. After that, I should review the quality of evidence and note any conflicting data. Finally, I will translate this into practical, scenario-based guidance with dosing, safety, and follow-up, and I will double-check for any exceptions where heat might still be appropriate or harmful.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios and pathophysiology. Breastfeeding-related pain spans engorgement, inflammatory mastitis, and persistent pain syndromes such as vasospasm. The unifying mechanism is tissue edema and inflammation, often compounded by hyperlactation and tissue trauma from aggressive massage or pumping, which can worsen symptoms and perpetuate the cycle of edema and pain [^113Cwz1d] [^114RnUKa] [^117ML1Xi].

> I need to check the highest-credibility guidance on first-line supportive care. ABM Clinical Protocol #36 (2022) explicitly recommends ice and NSAIDs to reduce edema and inflammation and provide symptomatic relief, with practical use of ice every hour or more frequently as desired, ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, and acetaminophen 1,000 mg every 8 hours in the acute setting. It also cautions that heat may vasodilate and worsen symptoms, even though some patients report comfort from warmth [^111oRj84] [^116jffmR]. Hold on, I should verify alignment with primary care guidance: AAFP's 2024 rapid review likewise recommends breast rest, ice, and NSAIDs as conservative management for mastitis spectrum disorders, reinforcing ice as a core intervention [^111c41tY].

> Now, let me consider the physiologic rationale to ensure internal consistency. Ice produces vasoconstriction, reduces capillary leak, and lowers tissue metabolism, which directly counters edema and inflammation; this aligns with ABM's emphasis on anti-inflammatory measures and with the observation that edema may resolve more quickly with ice and lymphatic drainage, supporting ice as the preferred modality in acute inflammatory presentations [^111oRj84] [^117ML1Xi]. Wait, let me verify the caution about heat: warmth causes vasodilation, which can increase interstitial fluid and exacerbate engorgement and pain in inflamed tissue, explaining why ABM advises against heat in the acute inflammatory phase [^111oRj84].

> Next, I should review the evidence quality and note any conflicting data. ABM notes that studies have not shown cabbage leaves to be superior to ice, and that any benefit from cabbage is likely due to the cold rather than a unique property of cabbage; this supports choosing simple ice over unproven botanical compresses [^1113opLY]. I will now examine engorgement-specific trials: Cochrane reviews conclude that while some interventions (cold cabbage leaves, cold gel packs, herbal compresses, massage) may show signals of benefit, the certainty of evidence is low to very low and heterogeneous, so no single modality has definitive superiority; nonetheless, multiple trials suggest cold interventions are safe and may reduce pain and hardness, which is consistent with guideline direction toward ice for symptomatic relief [^115dESyh] [^114zHRVW]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought older Cochrane reviews found no benefit for cold packs; let me reconsider — those earlier analyses often found insufficient evidence due to small, heterogeneous studies rather than evidence of harm or lack of effect, and more recent reviews still rate the certainty as low while acknowledging potential symptomatic benefit from cold, which reconciles the apparent discrepancy [^112yHDPv] [^115dESyh].

> I should confirm practical application and dosing. For ice, ABM suggests application every hour or more frequently as desired, typically 10–20 minutes per session with a barrier to protect skin; this can be continued through the acute inflammatory phase over 24–48 hours, then tapered as edema and pain improve [^111oRj84]. Let me verify adjuncts: NSAIDs are recommended alongside ice for anti-inflammatory analgesia, and gentle lymphatic drainage can be added to facilitate decongestion; importantly, ABM advises avoiding deep massage or aggressive techniques that cause tissue trauma and worsen edema, favoring light sweeping motions or manual lymphatic techniques instead [^111oRj84] [^117UQRxN] [^1112GzPF].

> But wait, what if the presentation is not purely inflammatory — are there exceptions where warmth is appropriate? I need to ensure I address vasospasm, where the pathophysiology is vasoconstriction and ischemic pain; ABM Protocol #26 recommends warmth (compresses, heat pads) after feeds or during pain episodes and advises avoiding cold on the breasts and nipples in this specific phenotype, which is a clear exception to the general "ice-first" rule [^113Cwz1d]. Hold on, I should verify that this exception does not contradict the broader mastitis guidance; it does not, because vasospasm is a distinct vascular pain syndrome where warmth restores perfusion and relieves ischemic pain, whereas mastitis/engorgement pain is driven by edema and inflammation where ice is beneficial [^113Cwz1d] [^111oRj84].

> I will now translate this into scenario-based guidance. For acute engorgement, inflammatory mastitis, or focal breast pain with erythema and edema, prioritize ice, NSAIDs, and rest from overstimulation. Avoid heat, deep massage, and pumping to "empty", as these can worsen tissue edema and inflammation. Continue breastfeeding or hand-express small volumes for comfort while addressing latch and milk transfer [^111oRj84] [^117ML1Xi]. For persistent or recurrent "plugged duct" discomfort without systemic signs, gentle warmth before feeds may help with milk flow, but I should confirm that this is paired with careful latch optimization and avoidance of aggressive massage; ABM notes that heat, direct pressure, and milk expression can offer relief in this localized, noninfectious context, but the overarching principle remains to minimize tissue trauma and hyperlactation [^1173Sybg] [^114RnUKa]. For vasospasm, use warmth after feeds and avoid cold exposure to the nipples, as cold triggers vasoconstriction and pain in this phenotype [^113Cwz1d].

> Next, I should review safety and follow-up. Ice should be applied with a barrier and limited to reasonable intervals to avoid skin injury. If pain, erythema, or systemic symptoms worsen despite 24–48 hours of conservative therapy, I need to check for abscess or alternative diagnoses and consider ultrasound or clinical reassessment, with antibiotic therapy guided by clinical severity and, when needed, culture results. ABM and AAFP support a short trial of conservative measures before antibiotics in typical cases, reserving imaging for refractory or atypical presentations [^111oRj84] [^116d529F]. I should double-check that patients are counseled to continue breastfeeding unless absolutely contraindicated, as effective milk removal remains central to resolution and prevention of complications [^111oRj84].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and consistent with evidence and guidelines: ice is the first-line nonpharmacologic therapy for inflammatory breastfeeding pain and engorgement because it reduces edema and inflammation. Warmth is reserved for specific exceptions such as vasospasm or, selectively, for comfort with careful technique in noninfectious "plugged duct" scenarios. Throughout, avoid deep massage and overstimulation, and escalate care if symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management [^111oRj84] [^111c41tY] [^113Cwz1d].

Ice packs are preferred for **acute breast pain, engorgement, and mastitis** because they reduce inflammation, edema, and pain via vasoconstriction and are supported by ABM 2022 and AAFP 2024 guidelines [^111oRj84] [^111c41tY]. Warm compresses are reserved for **blocked ducts or milk flow issues**, as heat can worsen inflammation in acute mastitis. Use ice for 10–20 minutes every 1–2 hours with a barrier, and apply warmth only when needed for milk flow, not for acute pain or infection.

---

## Physiological mechanisms

### Ice packs (cold therapy)

- **Vasoconstriction**: Reduces blood flow, edema, and inflammation, lowering pain and swelling [^1113opLY].
- **Reduced metabolic activity**: Lowers tissue metabolism and oxygen demand, limiting inflammation and pain.
- **Analgesic effect**: Numbs superficial nerves, providing immediate pain relief [^115GdDFb].

---

### Warm compresses (heat therapy)

- **Vasodilation**: Increases blood flow, potentially worsening edema and inflammation in acute mastitis [^111oRj84].
- **Muscle relaxation**: May ease muscle tension and discomfort in non-acute settings.
- **Milk flow enhancement**: Can help with blocked ducts or milk stasis by promoting milk ejection and drainage [^1173Sybg].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

| **Condition** | **Ice packs** | **Warm compresses** |
|-|-|-|
| Engorgement | Recommended by ABM 2022 and AAFP 2024; reduces edema and pain [^111oRj84] [^116mC52G] | Not recommended due to potential to worsen edema and inflammation [^111oRj84] |
| Mastitis | Recommended to reduce inflammation, edema, and pain [^111oRj84] [^111c41tY] | Not recommended due to potential to worsen inflammation [^111oRj84] |
| Blocked ducts | May be used if inflammation is present | Recommended to promote milk flow and relieve obstruction [^1173Sybg] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

### Ice packs

- **Engorgement**: Apply for 10–20 minutes every 1–2 hours with a barrier to prevent skin damage [^notfound].
- **Mastitis**: Use to reduce inflammation, edema, and pain; combine with NSAIDs and continued breastfeeding or milk removal [^111oRj84] [^111c41tY].
- **Postpartum breast pain**: Provides immediate analgesia and reduces swelling [^111oRj84].

---

### Warm compresses

Use warm compresses for **blocked ducts** to promote milk flow and relieve obstruction, and consider them for **non-acute discomfort** to relax muscles and provide comfort when inflammation is minimal.

---

## Safety considerations

Ice packs should be applied for 10–20 minutes with a barrier to avoid skin damage and discontinued if numbness or discomfort occurs, whereas **warm compresses** should be used cautiously in acute inflammation to avoid worsening edema and pain [^111oRj84].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Ice packs**: Preferred for acute breast pain, engorgement, and mastitis due to anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects [^111oRj84] [^111c41tY].
- **Warm compresses**: Reserved for blocked ducts or non-acute discomfort; avoid in acute inflammation [^1173Sybg] [^111oRj84].

---

Ice packs are the primary therapy for **acute breastfeeding pain, engorgement, and mastitis**, while warm compresses are reserved for blocked ducts or non-acute discomfort.

### Management of mastitis in breastfeeding women… [^114VUHRM]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus to breastfeeding education alone, application of topical mupirocin 2% ointment or fusidic acid ointment, or oral therapy with cloxacillin or erythromycin. 12 The mothers in the oral antibiotic group had significantly better resolution of cracked nipples. Blocked milk ducts can also lead to mastitis. This condition presents as localized tenderness in the breast from inadequate milk removal from one duct. A firm, red, tender area is present on the affected breast, and a painful, white, 1-mm bleb may be present on the nipple. This bleb is thought to be an overgrowth of epithelium or an accumulation of particulate or fatty material. Removal of the bleb with a sterile needle or by rubbing with a cloth can be beneficial. 3 Other treatments include frequent breastfeeding and the use of warm compresses or showers. Massaging the affected area toward the nipple is often helpful.

Constrictive clothing should be avoided. 11 Application of 1% gentian violet in water is an inexpensive and often effective alternative. Before a feeding, the solution is applied with a cotton swab to the part of the infant's mouth that comes into contact with the nipple. After the feeding, any areas of the nipple that are not purple are painted with the solution. Diagnosis Culture is rarely used to confirm bacterial infection of the milk because positive cultures can result from normal bacterial colonization, and negative cultures do not rule out mastitis. Treatment Treatment of mastitis begins with improving breastfeeding technique. If the mother stops draining the breast during an episode of mastitis, she will have increased milk stasis and is more likely to develop an abscess. Consultation with an experienced lactation consultant is often invaluable. Mothers should drink plenty of fluids and get adequate rest.

3 In addition, milk from a breast with mastitis has been shown to contain increased levels of some anti-inflammatory components that may be protective for the infant. 19 Continuation of breastfeeding does not pose a risk to the infant; in fact, it allows for a greater chance of breastfeeding after resolution of the mastitis and allows for the most efficient removal of the breast milk from the affected area. However, some infants may dislike the taste of milk from the infected breast, possibly because of the increased sodium content. 20 In these cases, the milk can be pumped and discarded.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^114zQVK4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5 months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a recurrent episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalisation.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be associated with milk stasis, nipple damage and maternal fatigue. Cracked nipples may facilitate entrance of microorganisms through the skin, and incomplete emptying of the breasts may result in milk stasis which provides a susceptible and receptive culture media for microorganisms. Decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection may be a result of maternal fatigue. Other risk factors include a history of mastitis with a previous child, using an antifungal nipple cream and using a manual breast pump.

Current management of mastitis generally centers on symptom management (i.e. applying hot/cold compresses, analgesics), encouragement of the continuation of breastfeeding (including fully emptying the affected breast, feeding more frequently, and changing feeding positions often), and antibiotic therapy. A Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in treating symptoms of mastitis in breastfeeding women showed a trend towards a benefit of treatment, but only 2 trials were included and were of limited quality, with one conducted over 30 years ago. As such, authors deduced there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^114G9zxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus Aureus. Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007) and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as "supportive therapy" versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^116r1YVM]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

For the management of postpartum perineal pain, multimodal analgesia strategies combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are commonly employed in clinical practice. Among pharmacological options, NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, alleviate local inflammation and pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, and are suitable for mild to moderate pain relief. A systematic review by Abalos et aldemonstrated that a single dose of paracetamol can effectively relieve perineal pain following vaginal delivery. Regarding local anesthetics, a study by Abu-Zaid et alfound that ropivacaine offers several advantages over conventional lidocaine, including a longer duration of analgesia and reduced injection discomfort, resulting in significantly higher maternal satisfaction (OR = 7.13, P < 0.001).

As an important adjunct to pharmacological approaches, non-pharmacological therapies have received increasing attention in recent years and have demonstrated promising potential in the management of postpartum perineal pain. A growing body of research suggests that various non-pharmacological interventions can play a beneficial role in alleviating postpartum discomfort. In terms of physical therapies, studies by Kurnaz et aland Francisco et alconfirmed that local application of ice packs is an effective and easy-to-implement method for relieving perineal pain. In addition, a systematic review by Abdelhakim et alreported that antenatal perineal massage not only reduces the incidence of perineal tears but also promotes wound healing and alleviates postpartum perineal pain. Traditional Chinese therapies have also shown effectiveness in managing acute postpartum perineal pain. Acupuncture and its related techniques, such as auricular acupressure, have been proven to relieve pain, potentially through activation of the endogenous opioid system. Acupressure, particularly at points such as LV4 (Zhongfeng) and LI4 (Hegu-4), has been shown to significantly reduce pain intensity within 30 to 120 minutes after delivery. This technique offers prolonged analgesic effects, high maternal acceptability, and is considered a safe, economical, and non-invasive intervention. Moreover, emerging technologies have been explored in this context. A study by Filippini et alfound that carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser therapy may help reduce postpartum perineal discomfort. However, its clinical efficacy and long-term safety need to be further validated in larger patient populations.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^111frjpe]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — Oversupply identified by "Breast fullness, milk leakage" is managed by reducing stimulation in which patients should "Stop any overstimulation by not pumping or hand expression in lieu of breastfeeding or if breasts are overfull before feeds", consider "Block feeding is a strategy that many lactation consultants endorse, but is controversial with limited evidence. This involves feeding from one breast for a block of time, typically 3 hours. The other breast rests, allowing the fullness to provide feedback to the breast to reduce milk supply", and note that "Medication such as pseudoephedrine and sage extract have been used to reduce milk supply as has the oral contraceptive pill containing estrogen".

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^1131RbWS]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the development of clinical protocols for managing common medical problems that may impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient. These guidelines are not intended to be all-inclusive, but to provide a basic framework for physician education regarding breastfeeding.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^117ML1Xi]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — feeding and positioning during the mastitis spectrum states that overfeeding from the affected breast or "pumping to empty" perpetuates a cycle of hyperlactation and is a major risk factor for worsening tissue edema and inflammation; mothers can hand express small volumes of milk for comfort until their milk production downregulates to match the infant's needs, and mothers using breast pumps should express only the volume their infant consumes. In some instances in which the retroareolar region is so edematous and inflamed that no milk is expressible by infant breastfeeding or hand expression, the mother should not continue to attempt feeding from the affected breast during the acute phase; she can feed from the contralateral breast and return to feeding from the affected breast when edema and inflammation subsides. Edema may resolve more quickly with ice and lymphatic drainage, and she should be counseled that a decrease in milk production is expected, but can later be augmented. No evidence exists to support "dangle feeding" (i.e., feeding an infant on the floor with the mother hovering above) or other unsafe infant positions; patients may consider safe variations on standard feeding positions, with the understanding that this may improve comfort; however, this does not address underlying inflammation. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.

### Contraindications to breastfeeding… [^113uG7JB]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Human milk provides the most complete form of nutrition for infants, including premature and sick newborns. However, in rare exceptions, human milk or breastfeeding is not recommended. What to know Breastfeeding is the best source of nutrition for most infants. It can also reduce the risk for certain health conditions for both infants and mothers. Physicians should make case-by-case assessments to determine if a woman should interrupt, stop, or never start breastfeeding due to an environmental exposure, medical condition, or infant's medical condition. Reasons to temporarily stop breastfeeding Mothers should temporarily not breastfeed or feed expressed breast milk to their infants if:

- They are infected with untreated brucellosis.
- They are taking certain medications.
- They are undergoing diagnostic imaging with radiopharmaceuticals.
- They have an active herpes simplex virus infection with lesions present on the breast.
- They have monkeypox virus infection infection that developed between 5 days before delivery and 2 days following delivery. Taking medications while breastfeeding There are few medications that you cannot take while breastfeeding. Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have no known adverse effect on milk supply or infant well-being. However, healthcare providers should always weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to women who are breastfeeding.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^114xbGte]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

Early SSC for term or late preterm infants can be divided into two subcategories, as follows.

In immediate or very early SSC, the naked infant is placed prone on the mother's bare abdomen or chest less than 10 minutes postbirth. The infant is suctioned while on the mother's abdomen or chest, if medically indicated, thoroughly dried and covered across the back with a prewarmed blanket. To prevent heat loss, the infant's head may be covered with a dry cap that is replaced when it becomes damp. Ideally, all other interventions are delayed until at least one hour postbirth or after the first successful breastfeeding.
Early SSC can begin anytime between 10 minutes and 24 hours postbirth. The baby is naked (with or without a diaper and cap) and is placed prone on the mother's bare chest between the breasts. The mother may wear a blouse or shirt that opens in front, or a hospital gown worn backwards, and the baby is placed inside the gown so that only the head is exposed. What the mother wears and how the baby is kept warm and what is placed across the baby's back may vary. What is most important is that the mother and baby are in direct ventral‐to‐ventral SSC and the infant is kept dry and warm.

Standard contact includes a variety of conditions: swaddled or dressed infants held in the arms of their mother or another family member, infants placed in open cribs or under radiant warmers, or infants placed in a cot in the mother's room or elsewhere without holding. No infant in the comparison arm could have SSC during study implementation.

Outcome measures

We excluded trials that reported none of our prespecified outcomes.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^114RnUKa]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — ductal narrowing ("plugging") is characterized as microscopic ductal inflammation related to alveolar distension and/or mammary dysbiosis, with "innumerable and interlacing" ducts making it "not physiologically or anatomically possible for a single duct to become obstructed with a macroscopic milk 'plug'. It presents as a tender focal induration or more globally congested breast tissue that "may be mildly erythematous" and "does not have associated systemic symptoms", may resolve spontaneously with transient residual pain, and relief may occur with breastfeeding because it decreases alveolar distension, but repeated feeding to relieve a "plug" "will suppress FIL, increase milk production, and ultimately exacerbate inflammation and ductal narrowing". The protocol states that "physiological breastfeeding and anti-inflammatory measures… are most efficacious", and warns that attempts to extrude a "plug" by squeezing or aggressive massage "are ineffective and result in tissue trauma".

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^114HeKsQ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Vasospasm of the nipple — presentation and risk features include color change and cold sensitivity. Vasospasm presents with blanching or purple color changes of the nipple accompanied by sharp, shooting, or burning pain, and may be triggered after breastfeeding, after a warm shower, or by cold temperatures such as in the frozen food section of the grocery store. Symptoms may be bilateral or unilateral with current or past nipple trauma; mothers may report cold hands and feet or a diagnosis of Raynaud's syndrome, and those with connective tissue disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or prior Raynaud's are at risk for vasospasm of the nipple.

### Local cooling for relieving pain from perineal trauma sustained during childbirth [^115owcsz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Perineal trauma is common during childbirth and may be painful. Contemporary maternity practice includes offering women numerous forms of pain relief, including the local application of cooling treatments.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of localised cooling treatments compared with no treatment, other forms of cooling treatments and non-cooling treatments.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (10 January 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 10 January 2012), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (10 January 2012) and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials (RCTs) that compared localised cooling treatment applied to the perineum with no treatment or other treatments applied to relieve pain related to perineal trauma sustained during childbirth.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. A sub-set of data were double checked for accuracy. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis where data allowed. We sought additional information from the authors of three trials.

Main Results

Ten published RCTs were included (involving 1825 women). Comparisons were local cooling treatments (ice packs, cold gel pads (with or without compression) or cold/iced baths) with no treatment, gel pads with compression, hamamelis water (witch hazel), pulsed electromagnetic energy (PET), hydrocortisone/pramoxine foam (Epifoam), oral paracetamol or warm baths. Ice packs provided improved pain relief 24 to 72 hours after birth compared with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.91; one study, n = 208). Women preferred the utility of the gel pads compared with ice packs or no treatment (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.73, 0.92). Differences detected in a composite of perineal oedema and bruising and overall wound healing were noted in one small study, favouring cold gel pads (n = 37) over ice (n = 35, mean difference (MD) 0.63 on a scale of 0 to 15; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.06) or no treatment (n = 39, MD -2.10; 95% CI -3.80 to -0.40) three to 14 days after giving birth. Women reported more pain (RR 5.60; 95% CI 2.35 to 13.33; one study, 100 women) and used more additional analgesia (RR 4.00; 95% CI 1.44 to 11.13; one study, 100 women) following the application of ice packs compared with PET.

Authors' Conclusions

There is only limited evidence to support the effectiveness of local cooling treatments (ice packs, cold gel pads, cold/iced baths) applied to the perineum following childbirth to relieve pain.

### WITHDRAWN: treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^1123p9bx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

National surveys have shown that painful breasts are the second most common reason for giving up breastfeeding in the first two weeks after birth in the UK. One factor contributing to such pain can be breast engorgement. Views differ as to how engorgement arises, although restrictive feeding patterns in hospital are likely to have contributed in the past. These differing views are reflected in the range of solutions offered to treat engorgement in breastfeeding mothers and these treatments are assessed in this review.

Objectives

To determine the effects of any proposed intervention to relieve symptoms of breast engorgement among breastfeeding women.

Search Strategy

The register of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. CINAHL and MEDLINE were also searched. Date of last search: December 2000.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and 'quasi-randomised' controlled trials, with or without blinding, that assess the effectiveness of treatments for the alleviation of symptoms in breastfeeding women experiencing engorgement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer.

Main Results

Eight trials, involving 424 women, were included. Three different studies were identified which used cabbage leaves or cabbage leaf extracts;. no overall benefit was found. Ultrasound treatment and placebo were equally effective. Use of Danzen (an anti-inflammatory agent) significantly improved the total symptoms of engorgement when compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3–10.3) as did bromelain/trypsin complex (OR 8.02, 95% CI 2.8–23.3). Oxytocin and cold packs had no demonstrable effect on engorgement symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Cabbage leaves and gel packs were equally effective in the treatment of engorgement. Since both cabbage extract and placebo cream were equally effective, the alleviation in symptoms may be brought about by other factors, such as breast massage. Ultrasound treatment is equally effective with or without the ultra-wave emitting crystal, therefore its effectiveness is more likely to be due to the effect of radiant heat or massage. Pharmacologically, oxytocin was not an effective engorgement treatment while Danzen and bromelain/trypsin complex significantly improved the symptoms of engorgement. Initial prevention of breast engorgement should remain the key priority.

### Breastfeeding in primiparous women-expectations and reality: a prospective questionnaire survey [^114ZBpw3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prophylaxis is not solely the responsibility of the attending gynecologist. In addition to analgesia, anti-inflammatory therapy and antibiotic treatment if necessary, supportive measures such as frequent breastfeeding, pumping, correct positioning, breast massage and application of hot or cold compresses should be performed. These measures can be communicated to the patient and checked by the midwife. Most difficulties with breastfeeding occur within the first month after delivery. In Austria, health insurance covers a daily home visit by the attending midwife in the first 5 days postpartum. Moreover, an additional seven home visits or consultations can be claimed within the first 8 weeks after delivery. This service was appreciated by 92.1% of the respondents and significantly influenced the duration of breastfeeding.

The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative requires that all pregnant women should be informed about the benefits and practice of breastfeeding. Kepler University Hospital is no certified Baby-Friendly Hospital, but was awarded the 'periZert', which certifies the highest quality of care and expertise in perinatal medical care for mother and child. The WHO's ten steps to successful breastfeeding are implemented and International Board Certified Lactation Consultants try to best support the mothers. This includes uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact after giving birth and the initiation of breastfeeding as soon as possible. Rooming-in 24 h a day is practiced and mothers are made aware of their infants' signals for feeding and learn how to respond. Trained staff advise the mothers on the use of breast pumps and the risks of bottle-feeding or pacifiers. If the women are hospitalized during pregnancy, information on the benefits and management of breastfeeding is provided. The importance of these aspects may be underlined by the results of this study, as a detailed level of prepartum knowledge was found to have a significant impact on breastfeeding confidence. Among the study participants, 74.8% received advice from their families. Although a considerable amount of information can be passed on in this way, it is based on individual experiences that may contain negative aspects and convey uncertainty and fear. It is therefore important for patients to receive information from professionals as well. In Austria, pregnancy care includes a midwife consultation between gestational weeks 18 and 22. Among other things, the purpose of this discussion is to provide expectant mothers with basic knowledge about breastfeeding and address their fears and concerns. In the present study, 12.1% of the respondents reported needing more information in the early postpartum period. Individual counselling and support can be provided by the hospital staff during the initial days of postpartum care in hospital.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^1175Cokg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This review summarizes the results of 69 trials (7290 mother‐infant pairs) that met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (43) compared immediate SSC with standard hospital care. Twelve trials were conducted in low‐middle‐income countries, 25 in upper‐middle‐income countries, and 32 in high‐income countries. Ten studies recruited late preterm infants and 15 recruited women who had a cesarean birth. Four trials compared immediate SSC (initiated < 10 minutes postbirth) with early SSC (initiated ≥ 10 minutes postbirth), and two trials compared high‐dose SSC (> 60 minutes) with low‐dose SSC (< 60 minutes). Risk of bias assessments for the included studies can be found in Figure 2, Figure 3, and the Risk of bias in included studies section.

Mothers who have SSC are probably 36% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month postbirth (12 trials, 1556 mother‐infant pairs) and 38% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at six weeks to six months postbirth (11 trials, 1135 mother‐infant pairs). These findings of improved breastfeeding were similar in lower‐middle‐income countries and upper‐middle‐ to high‐income countries. We consider these results to be clinically significant.

The included studies relating to consumer experience with SSC reflect that SSC is a positive experience for families, and mothers would choose SSC for future births (Carfoot 2004; Mahmood 2011; Nahidi 2011).

We considered the mean infant axillary temperature difference of 0.28 °C favoring the SSC group (11 trials, 1349 infants) was not clinically meaningful, but clinicians can be assured that infants who receive SSC are not at greater risk for hypothermia.

### Non-pharmacological management for vaccine-related pain in children in the healthcare setting: a scoping review [^115GdDFb]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management measures for vaccine-related pain in children mainly involve taste, tactile, olfactory, visual, exercise, and postural interventions and injection technique. The pain outcomes of different studies were generally similar, mainly including a series of physiological parameters such as heart rates, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, as well as pain scales, crying time and behavioral variations. Non-pharmacological interventions are known to be safe and effective, but their application in vaccine-related pain needs further promotion.

Mother's unique odor stimulates the release of cholecystokinin to support pain relief, which may explain why both breastfeeding and breast milk odor can relieve pain in children. Breastfeeding is thought to promote mother-infant bonding and provide psychological comfort, which is especially suitable for neonates and infants. The analgesic mechanism of sweeteners is controversial, but its analgesic effects have been confirmed in many studies. It is important to note that the long-term effects of sweeteners on development and neurological function are not yet known, the dose, concentration and duration of taste intervention require further study to clarify.

When referring to analgesic mechanisms of BUZZY, on the one hand, cold can directly affect peripheral nerves and slow down the spread of pain, on the other hand, cold can indirectly reduce pain by relieving edema, swelling and muscle spasm. The analgesic mechanism of Shotblocker, flick, and foot reflexology is similar. In the Gate Control Theory, the pressure exerted by massage, friction and pressure on the skin stimulates smaller diameter, faster-transmitting nerve cells, temporarily blocking the pain signal by closing the door to the central nervous system, thereby reducing the pain experienced. However, the tactile intervention studies included in this scoping review were all compared to standard care, and could not compare the advantages and disadvantages of different tactile interventions.

Exercise is considered an analgesic, and its analgesic mechanisms include activation of the endogenous opioid system, increase of serotonin, influence of descending inhibitory pathways, and decrease of sensory neuron activation. When experiencing vaccine-related pain, 2-month-old infants do not have fully developed neck muscles for effective head control, and do not like being held in upright position. Older children, whose head muscles are fully developed, may prefer upright position. As for the pain-relieving mechanism of rapid injection without aspiration, it can be explained by the shorter residence time of the needle in the skin tissue and less needle shaking.

### Puerperal vulvar edema and hematoma complicated by overuse of cold therapy-a report of two cases [^111Eo1ub]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Puerperal vulvar edema and hematoma are rare complications of the postpartum period. The two conditions have similar risk factors and are known to occur together. The outcome of vulvar edema or hematoma is typically favorable, as both reabsorb with local perfusion mechanisms. Management recommendations vary, with recommendations based on limited evidence and anecdotal experience.

Cases

We report two cases, one of puerperal vulvar edema and one of puerperal vulvar hematoma, which became complicated by overuse of cold therapy during conservative management.

Conclusions

In both cases, initial conservative management failed. The common aspect was the overuse of ice packs directly applied to the perineum for comfort. Although studies indicate cold therapy should be applied to the perineum immediately postpartum for best pain relief results, there are no evidence-based indications for the duration of treatment. This report should serve to alert providers of the potential complication of excessive and prolonged ice application. We suggest clarification of conservative management to include the following: apply cool gel packs in short intervals, use cold therapy only within the first 24 to 48 hours postpartum, and no direct application of ice therapy.

### Comparative efficacy of breastfeeding or feeding of breast milk on blood sampling pain relief in full-term neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112WtgzF]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of breastfeeding or feeding of breast milk in reducing blood sampling pain in full-term neonates by comparing with other intervention measures. Methods: Related literature was searched from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which reported the effect of breastfeeding or feeding of breast milk on blood sampling pain in full-term neonates, were eligible. The primary outcome was set as pain score on scales, and the secondary outcomes as physiological and behavioral indicators. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1. Main Results: A total of 17 RCTs were included. Breastfeeding showed a stronger effectiveness in reducing blood sampling pain, compared with nonintervention, placebo, mother's holding, breast milk odor, mother's heartbeat, music therapy, skin-to-skin, and Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics ointment. However, the efficacy of glucose or sucrose (12.5%-30% concentration) seems better than breastfeeding. When compared with other interventions, feeding of breast milk yielded different results. Its effect was only stronger than placebo (sterile water or distilled water), massage, or nonintervention. Conclusions: Breastfeeding might be effective for alleviating blood sampling pain in full-term neonates. Its effect is second only to that of glucose/sucrose. The efficacy of feeding of breast milk in reducing blood sampling pain in full-term neonates might not be guaranteed.

### Predictors of mothers' home cord care, breastfeeding, and thermoregulation practices for newborns in a south-Eastern state, Nigeria [^1161cfdB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proper cord care, breastfeeding, and thermoregulation are fundamental components of essential newborn care, each playing a critical role in safeguarding the health and survival of both mothers and infants. The first 28 days of life are the most vulnerable and critical period for a child's survival, accounting for approximately 50–70% of infant mortality globally. According to the World Health Organization, 2.3 million children die within the first 28 days of life in 2022, with sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the highest neonatal mortality rate at 27 deaths per 1,000 live births. Nigeria, in particular, faces an even higher rate of 38 per 1,000 live births. Most neonatal deaths linked to inadequate or poorly implemented newborn care practices, especially in the areas of umbilical cord care, thermal regulation, and breastfeeding.

Optimal umbilical cord care is essential for preventing infections and promoting proper healing. In Nigeria, umbilical cord infections are responsible for 10–19% of neonatal admissions and contribute to an estimated 30–49% of neonatal deaths. Many studies have demonstrated that application of unclean substances to the cord stump creates a favorable environment for bacterial growth, increasing the risk of sepsis and death.

The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care and, where infection risk is high, the use of topical antiseptics. Despite these guidelines, the use of unorthodox substances such as hot compresses, cow dung, herbs, ash, and petroleum jelly persists in some communities, elevating the risk of tetanus and sepsis.

Similarly, breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and immunological protection for infants, benefiting both children and mothers. However, global exclusive breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal, reported at 44% in 2021, with even lower rates in low- and middle-income countries. Many mothers do not maintain exclusive breastfeeding for the recommended 4–6 months, often due to a lack of support or misinformation. Understanding the determinants of breastfeeding practices is crucial for designing effective interventions to improve rates of early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding.

### Physical therapy intervention for breast symptoms in lactating women: a randomized controlled trial [^111qEC1t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast pain, tenderness, redness, engorgement, fever, malaise, chills, lethargy, sweating, headache, nipple damage, and a hot spot on the breast are common complaints in women who breastfeed. Despite the high prevalence of breast symptoms in lactating women during the first 12 weeks after childbirth, some breast symptoms can occur or persist throughout the entire period of lactation, which may last up to six months. If these breast symptoms are not managed and treated during early postpartum clinic visits, the discomfort of the lactating breast may lead to various breast disorders, such as blocked milk ducts, mastitis, and abscess, potentially resulting in early cessation of breastfeeding.

Therapeutic ultrasound (91%); education and advice regarding eliminating duct obstruction/trauma, feeding, lifestyle changes, thermal/cryo therapy, and alternative interventions (83%); and massage (54%) have been reported as the three most common interventions provided by the physical therapists for breast symptoms in lactating women. However, postpartum women are often unaware of physical therapy treatment options for breast symptoms, with some women having only been prescribed antibiotics and/or encouraged by the doctor to use active expression of human-milk to relieve the symptoms. The majority of women felt that care for breastfeeding women with breast symptoms could be improved and were desperate for help from healthcare professionals.

A Cochrane review identified 17 different interventions for breast engorgement in breastfeeding women and concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of any intervention for breast engorgement to justify widespread implementation. Furthermore, the evidence on the effects of ultrasound, education, and massage delivered in combination is inconsistent due to various intervention designs. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to draw evidence-based conclusions regarding the effects of the combination of physical therapy interventions (i.e. therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage) for breast symptoms during lactation.

This study aimed to explore the effects of the combination of therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage on breast symptoms in lactating women and to compare them to patients receiving sham ultrasound treatment and usual obstetric care. We hypothesized that the outcomes of interest would improve following the physical therapy interventions, and the ultrasound group would show a greater improvement in the outcomes compared to the sham and usual care groups.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^116d529F]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^112iR2pn]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast Pain

Postpartum breast pain is a common concern among lactating women and can compromise breastfeeding continuation. A study by Amir et alreported that over 70% of first-time mothers experience breast pain. Common etiologies include ductal obstruction, mastitis, breast abscesses, nipple blisters, dermatitis, vasospasm, and milk stasis — with ductal blockage being the most prevalent.

Pathophysiologically, pain is often triggered by retained milk and subsequent inflammation or infection of breast tissue. Predisposing factors include inadequate milk expression, poor latch, sustained breast compression, and hyperlactation. Retained milk creates a favorable environment for microbial growth. A systematic review by Christine et alidentified Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species as the primary pathogens associated with mastitis. However, a retrospective cohort study by Betts et alin 2021 reported that many patients did not experience sustained relief following antifungal treatment. Based on these findings, the evidence supporting Candida infection as a cause of breastfeeding-related breast pain remains insufficient. The study recommends that clinical evaluations should not rely on presumptive diagnoses based solely on suspected Candida involvement.

Management of postpartum breast pain should be based on the specific etiology. In cases of ductal obstruction, warm compresses, gentle massage, and milk expression (manual or through breastfeeding) are effective. For infectious mastitis, mild cases can be managed conservatively, while moderate-to-severe cases may require antibiotics (cephalosporins). Breast abscesses often necessitate ultrasound-guided aspiration or surgical drainage. For nipple-related conditions, such as blisters or fissures, proper hygiene, drying, and application of breast milk can prevent secondary infection. Fluconazole may be considered when fungal infection is confirmed by culture or clinical evidence.

In addition, several non-pharmacological therapies have been preliminarily applied and validated in the clinical management of breast pain, offering more treatment options — particularly for patients who are unable or unwilling to use medications. A study by Çağan et aldemonstrated that the Oketani breast massage technique can effectively relieve breast engorgement. Han et alfound that auricular acupressure significantly increased the pressure pain threshold in specific regions of the breast, suggesting its potential effectiveness in alleviating breast tenderness. Although these interventions have shown promising initial results, their efficacy and underlying mechanisms require further confirmation through high-quality studies.

### Interventions for treating painful nipples among breastfeeding women [^114wik9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Leading health authorities all recommend exclusive breastfeeding to six months' postpartum. While most women initiate breastfeeding, many discontinue due to difficulties encountered rather than maternal choice. One common breastfeeding difficulty is painful nipples. Research has identified poor infant positioning or latch as a common cause of painful nipples. While many different interventions designed to reduce nipple pain in breastfeeding women have been evaluated, it is unclear which intervention is the most effective treatment. An understanding of nipple pain and treatment options are needed to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates and to address systematically one of the most frequent difficulties encountered by breastfeeding women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of all interventions in the resolution or reduction of nipple pain and the impact of the interventions on other outcomes such as nipple trauma, nipple infections, breast mastitis, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and scanned secondary references.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate any intervention for treating nipple pain among breastfeeding women. Trials using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. The following interventions were eligible for inclusion compared with each other or usual care (i.e. education only): pharmacological (e.g. antifungal creams); non-pharmacological topical treatments (e.g. lanolin); dressings (e.g. hydrogel dressings); nipple protection devices (e.g. breast shells), phototherapy, and expressed breast milk. Nipple pain in women who are feeding with expressed breast milk (i.e. women of infants in neonatal units) is associated with other methods of removing milk from the mother's breast such as manual expression and various types of breast pumps. Nipple pain and subsequent treatment is different in this unique maternal population and thus we excluded women solely feeding with expressed breast milk from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, evaluated methodological quality, and checked data for accuracy. We sought additional information from several trial researchers.

Main Results

We included four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women in the review. The four included trials evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine postpartum care to both treatment and control groups. Pooled data existed only for the comparison of lanolin versus usual care. We did not pool data for other outcomes due to either heterogeneity in outcome measures or differing interventions. There was no evidence that glycerine gel dressings or breast shells with lanolin significantly improved nipple pain. One trial found no clear differences in nipple pain (at one to three days, four to five days, or six to seven days' post-treatment) between women who applied lanolin or nothing to their nipples. In contrast, the same trial found that women who applied expressed breast milk had significantly lower perceptions of nipple pain following four to five days of treatment than women who applied lanolin. However, this beneficial effect was not maintained after six to seven days of treatment. There were no group differences in nipple pain perceptions at any assessment between women who applied expressed breast milk and women who applied nothing. Women who applied an "all-purpose nipple ointment", in comparison to women who applied lanolin, had no improvement in nipple pain after seven days of treatment. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, or all-purpose nipple ointment improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for the treatment of nipple pain. However, one important finding was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women nipple pain reduced to mild levels after approximately seven to 10 days' postpartum. The provision of anticipatory guidance regarding usual time to pain reduction may be a useful strategy in assisting women to continue to breastfeed and to do so exclusively. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain as assessed using GRADE was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, breast shells with lanolin, lanolin alone, or the all-purpose nipple ointment significantly improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. The results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin. The quality of the evidence for this review did not lead to robust conclusions regarding the objectives assessed. We included only four trials, incorporating 656 women, in the review and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, study outcome measures, and standards of usual care. The methodological quality of the included studies was good but the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^116Prq7q]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence as to the effectiveness of a range of interventions. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included and although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61). When one of the trials amongst HIV infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively. However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics in the absence of clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not just for the participants, but in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms. Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider implementation of strategies to improve adherence such as extended consultation time with participants when recruiting participants to explain and reinforce instruction; designing interventions such as tailoring drug regimens to patient lifestyle; frequent follow up when initialising or changing treatment regimes; and the use of reminder calls and alerts to keep participants focused.

### The effect of breast massage and warm compress application on milk production and anxiety in mothers with premature newborn: a randomized controlled trial [^1148Cbby]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of breast massage and warm compression on milk secretion and anxiety in the mothers of premature newborns. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 mothers of premature newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were assigned to three intervention groups (massage, n = 30; warm compression, n = 30; massage-warm, n = 30) and one control group (n = 30). Mothers in the massage group performed massage, those in the warm compression group applied compresses, and the combined group used both methods, whereas the control group used a breast pump with no intervention. Milk production was measured in milliliters (mL) after each pumping session over 4 days, and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and on the 4th day. Results: Mothers with premature newborns in the NICU had mean breast milk amounts of 1,321.43 ± 569.01 mL in the massage group, 1,470 ± 718.93 mL in the warm compression group, 1,484.23 ± 889.28 mL in the massage-warm group, and 913.75 ± 679.90 mL in the control group. The massage, warm compression, and massage-warm groups had significantly higher milk production than the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, anxiety levels in the intervention groups significantly decreased compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Mothers reported satisfaction with all interventions, with no significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Breast massage, warm compression, and breast massage-warm compression can be suggested as effective, simple, and cost-effective methods for increasing milk quantity and decreasing maternal anxiety.

### Effect of herbal compresses for maternal breast engorgement at postpartum: a randomized controlled trial [^115xLeAm]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal breast engorgement is one of the most common problems in the postpartum period. There are several alternative treatments, but there have not been any randomized controlled trial studies about the effects of herbal compresses for breast engorgement.

Objective

The objective is to investigate the effects of herbal compresses for maternal breast engorgement.

Materials and Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The postpartum mothers who had breast engorgement were randomly assigned to herbal or hot compress treatments. The breast engorgement pain scores were assessed by visual analog scales pre- and post-treatment. The pain reduction scales of the herbal compress treatments were analyzed and compared with the hot compress treatments. The adverse effects of each treatment were recorded and collected after 24 hours from treatments.

Results

The data from 500 postpartum mothers with breast engorgement were available for analyses, 250 from the herbal compress group and 250 from the hot compress group. The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar except baseline breast engorgement pain score (herbal compress group higher than hot compress group). There were statistically significant mean differences of breast engorgement pain before and after treatment between the herbal and hot compress groups. No serious complications were found after treatment from herbal compresses.

Conclusion

Among the postpartum mothers who had breast engorgement, the herbal compresses could decrease breast engorgement pain. The pain reduction after herbal compresses was found to be greater than with the hot compresses.

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^115dESyh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Engorgement is the overfilling of breasts with milk, often occurring in the early days postpartum. It results in swollen, hard, painful breasts and may lead to premature cessation of breastfeeding, decreased milk production, cracked nipples and mastitis. Various treatments have been studied but little consistent evidence has been found on effective interventions.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for engorgement in breastfeeding women.

Search Methods

On 2 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All types of randomised controlled trials and all forms of treatment for breast engorgement were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

For this udpate, we included 21 studies (2170 women randomised) conducted in a variety of settings. Six studies used individual breasts as the unit of analysis. Trials examined a range of interventions: cabbage leaves, various herbal compresses (ginger, cactus and aloe, hollyhock), massage (manual, electromechanical, Oketani), acupuncture, ultrasound, acupressure, scraping therapy, cold packs, and medical treatments (serrapeptase, protease, oxytocin). Due to heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not possible and data were reported from single trials. Certainty of evidence was downgraded for limitations in study design, imprecision and for inconsistency of effects. We report here findings from key comparisons. Cabbage leaf treatments compared to control For breast pain, cold cabbage leaves may be more effective than routine care (mean difference (MD) -1.03 points on 0–10 visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.53 to -0.53; 152 women; very low-certainty evidence) or cold gel packs (-0.63 VAS points, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.17; 152 women; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. We are uncertain about cold cabbage leaves compared to room temperature cabbage leaves, room temperature cabbage leaves compared to hot water bag, and cabbage leaf extract cream compared to placebo cream because the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast hardness, cold cabbage leaves may be more effective than routine care (MD -0.58 VAS points, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.34; 152 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about cold cabbage leaves compared to cold gel packs because the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast engorgement, room temperature cabbage leaves may be more effective than a hot water bag (MD -1.16 points on 1–6 scale, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.96; 63 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about cabbage leaf extract cream compared to placebo cream because the CIs were wide and included no effect. More women were satisfied with cold cabbage leaves than with routine care (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.64; 152 women; low certainty), or with cold gel packs (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.38; 152 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if women breastfeed longer following treatment with cold cabbage leaves than routine care because CIs were wide and included no effect. Breast swelling and adverse events were not reported. Compress treatments compared to control For breast pain, herbal compress may be more effective than hot compress (MD -1.80 VAS points, 95% CI -2.07 to -1.53; 500 women; low-certainty evidence). Massage therapy plus cactus and aloe compress may be more effective than massage therapy alone (MD -1.27 VAS points, 95% CI -1.75 to -0.79; 100 women; low-certainty evidence). In a comparison of cactus and aloe compress to massage therapy, the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast hardness, cactus and aloe cold compress may be more effective than massage (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87; 102 women; low-certainty evidence). Massage plus cactus and aloe cold compress may reduce the risk of breast hardness compared to massage alone (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; 100 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of compress treatments on breast engorgement and cessation of breastfeeding because the certainty of evidence was very low. Among women receiving herbal compress treatment, 2/250 experienced skin irritation compared to 0/250 in the hot compress group (moderate-certainty evidence). Breast swelling and women's opinion of treatment were not reported. Medical treatments compared to placebo Protease may reduce breast pain (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04, 0.74; low-certainty evidence; 59 women) and breast swelling (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; 59 women; low-certainty evidence), whereas serrapeptase may reduce the risk of engorgement compared to placebo (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; 59 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if serrapeptase reduces breast pain or swelling, or if oxytocin reduces breast engorgement compared to placebo, because the CIs were wide and included no effect. No women experienced adverse events in any of the groups receiving serrapeptase, protease or placebo (low-certainty evidence). Breast induration/hardness, women's opinion of treatment and breastfeeding cessation were not reported. Cold gel packs compared to control For breast pain, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of cold gel packs compared to control treatments because the certainty of evidence was very low. For breast hardness, cold gel packs may be more effective than routine care (MD -0.34 points on 1–6 scale, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.08; 151 women; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if women breastfeed longer following cold gel pack treatment compared to routine care because the CIs were wide and included no effect. There may be little difference in women's satisfaction with cold gel packs compared to routine care (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.40; 151 women; low-certainty evidence). Breast swelling, engorgement and adverse events were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Although some interventions may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement, such as cabbage leaves, cold gel packs, herbal compresses, and massage, the certainty of evidence is low and we cannot draw robust conclusions about their true effects. Future trials should aim to include larger sample sizes, using women - not individual breasts - as units of analysis.

### Evidence-based labor management: postpartum care after vaginal delivery (part 6) [^115Fhabu]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

In the setting of postpartum care after vaginal delivery, rooming-in is associated with a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding rate at hospital discharge, but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute rooming-in to increase breastfeeding at 6 months. Education and support for breastfeeding are valuable interventions to promote initiation of breastfeeding whether it is offered by a healthcare professional, nonhealthcare professional, or peer. A combined intervention, a professional provider-led intervention, having a protocol available for the provider training program, and implementation during both the prenatal and postnatal periods increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. There is no single effective treatment for breast engorgement. Breast massage, continuing breastfeeding, and pain relief are recommended by national guidelines. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen are better than placebo for relief of pain caused by uterine cramping and perineal trauma; acetaminophen is effective in breastfeeding individuals who underwent episiotomy; and local cooling pain relievers have been shown to reduce perineal pain for 24 to 72 hours, compared with no treatment. There is insufficient evidence to assess the safety and efficacy of postpartum routine universal thromboprophylaxis after vaginal delivery. Anti-D immune globulin administration is recommended in Rhesus-negative individuals who have given birth to a Rhesus-positive infant. There is very low-quality evidence that a universal complete blood count is useful in reducing the risk of receiving blood products. In the absence of any postpartum complication, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a routine postpartum ultrasound. Measles, mumps, and rubella combination; varicella; human papillomavirus; and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines should be administered in nonimmune individuals in the postpartum period. Smallpox and yellow fever vaccines should be avoided. Individuals undergoing postplacental placement are more likely to use an intrauterine device at 6 months than those advised to follow-up for placement during outpatient postpartum care. An implant is safe and effective for immediate postpartum contraception. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine administration of micronutrient supplements in breastfeeding women. Placentophagia does not provide any benefits and exposes mothers and offspring to infectious risks. Therefore, it should be discouraged. Because of the low level of evidence, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of home visits in the postpartum period. There is insufficient evidence to recommend when to resume daily activities, and individuals should be counseled to return to prepregnancy level of activity or exercise when comfortable. Sexual activity, housework exercise, driving, climbing stairs, and lifting weights should be resumed as soon as postpartum individuals want. A behavioral educational intervention reduces depression symptoms and increases breastfeeding duration. Physical activity after delivery is protective against postpartum mood disorders. There is no strong evidence that supports early discharge after vaginal delivery compared with standard discharge (ie, ≥ 48 hours).

### Physical therapy intervention for breast symptoms in lactating women: a randomized controlled trial [^116KWCrk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that participants with breast symptoms who received a physical therapy program consisting of therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage demonstrated greater improvement in the severity of breast engorgement than the usual care group. However, there was no difference in improvements between the ultrasound and sham group. No adverse events were reported during the study period, and all participants in the ultrasound group reported being very satisfied with the intervention, considering the program highly acceptable for this population. This study suggests that physical therapy intervention is generally safe and beneficial for treating breast symptoms during lactation.

Therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage are the most common interventions provided by physical therapists to mothers with breast symptoms in clinical practice. Our findings support the use of these interventions as monotherapy or combination therapy for the alleviating breast symptoms after childbirth, as all three groups in our study showed significant improvements in self-reported severity of breast symptoms after interventions. Previous studies had also reported the effectiveness of breast massage alone, therapeutic ultrasound combined with conventional therapy including massage, hot moist pack, proper latching technique and/or proper fitting bra, and breast massage combined with laser therapy, breast pumping, cold compress, and education in relieving breast engorgement, breast pain, and breast lump. Therefore, physical therapy for lactating women with breast symptoms is essential and beneficial.

While our findings suggest that combinations of ultrasound, massage and education, and massage and education may be superior to usual care (i.e. education alone) in reducing the severity of breast engorgement, no additive effect of therapeutic ultrasound was found in treating breast symptoms and improving breastfeeding self-efficacy when compared to the sham group. These findings are in agreement with the study by Mclachlan et al. which reported improvements in subjectively perceived pain and hardness after both ultrasound and sham interventions in women with breast engorgement. Although the low-power ultrasound with a frequency of 1 MHz may penetrate about 3–5 cm below the skin and induce effects through thermal and nonthermal mechanisms, the improvements found in both ultrasound and sham groups suggest that the ultrasound effects may be attributed to increasing cell wall permeability, micro-massage, and heat generated by the transducer, which helps to open the duct, increase circulation, improve the flow of human-milk, and reduce pain. Further, the lack of intergroup differences between the ultrasound group and sham group in all outcome measures may be related to the small sample size and the placebo effect.

### Methods of milk expression for lactating women [^116qMpBv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane review. Breastfeeding is important. However, not all infants can feed at the breast and methods of expressing milk need evaluation.

Objectives

To assess acceptability, effectiveness, safety, effect on milk composition, contamination and cost implications of methods of milk expression.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), conference proceedings, secondary references and contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing methods at any time after birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

This updated review includes 34 studies involving 1998 participants, with 17 trials involving 961 participants providing data for analysis. Eight studies compared one or more types of pump versus hand expression and 14 studies compared one type of pump versus another type of pump, with three of these studies comparing both hand expression and multiple pump types. Fifteen studies compared a specific protocol or adjunct behaviour including sequential versus simultaneous pumping protocols (five studies), pumping > 4 times per day versus < 3 times per day (one study), provision of a milk expression education and support intervention to mothers of preterm infants versus no provision (one study), provision of audio/visual relaxation to mothers of preterm infants versus no specific relaxation (two studies), commencing pumping within one hour of delivery versus between one to six hours (one study), breast massage before or during pumping versus no massage (two studies, of which one also tested a second behaviour), therapeutic touch versus none (one study), warming breasts before pumping versus not warming breasts (one study), combining hand expression with pumping versus pumping alone (one study) and a breast cleansing protocol versus no protocol (one study). There were insufficient comparable data on outcomes to undertake meta-analysis and data reported relates to evidence from single studies. Only one of the 17 studies examining maternal satisfaction/acceptability provided data in a way that could be analysed, reporting that mothers assigned to the pumping group had more agreement with the statement 'I don't want anyone to see me pumping' than mothers in the hand expression group and the statement 'I don't want anyone to see me hand expressing' (n = 68, mean difference (MD) -0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.25 to -0.15, P = 0.01), and that mothers found instructions for hand expression were clearer than for pumping (n = 68, MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75, P = 0.02). No evidence of a difference was found between methods related to adverse effects of milk contamination (one study, n = 28, risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27, P = 0.51), (one study, n = 142 milk samples, MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58, P = 0.30), (one study, n = 123 milk samples, MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.49, P = 0.61), (one study, n = 141 milk samples, MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.26, P = 0.59); or level of maternal breast or nipple pain or damage (one study, n = 68, MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.71, P = 0.96). For the secondary outcomes, greater volume was obtained when mothers with infants in a neonatal unit were provided with a relaxation tape or music-listening interventions to use while pumping, when the breasts was warmed before pumping or massaged while pumping. Initiation of milk pumping within 60 minutes of birth of a very low birthweight infant obtained higher mean milk quantity in the first week than the group who initiated pumping later. No evidence of difference in volume was found with simultaneous or sequential pumping or between pumps studied. Differences between methods was found for sodium, potassium, protein and fat constituents; no evidence of difference was found for energy content. No consistent effect was found related to prolactin change or effect on oxytocin release with pump type or method. Economic aspects were not reported. Most studies were classified as unclear or low risk of bias. Most studies did not provide any information regarding blinding of outcome assessment. Fifteen of the 25 studies that evaluated pumps or products had support from the manufacturers.

Authors' Conclusions

The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low-cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, listening to relaxation music, massage and warming of the breasts, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^115Lt3Yh]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Preterm newborn analgesia — study scope and core options are as follows: Recommendations are based on infants with an average gestational age of 30 weeks or greater and are not necessarily generalizable to < 27 weeks; one study in infants born at < 31 weeks raised concerns with prolonged sucrose exposure. Skin-to-skin contact provides effective pain reduction (IB). In very-low-birth-weight neonates (27–31 weeks gestation) undergoing venipuncture, 24% sucrose or water significantly reduced pain versus no intervention (IB). The recommended sucrose dosage is 0.1–0.4 mL of 24% sucrose solution, and some data support three doses (0.1 mL, 2 minutes apart given 2 minutes and immediately before heel lance and 2 minutes after lance) rather than a single dose (IB). Breastfeeding and human milk analgesia is less well established; a single study showed comparable effects to sucrose in infants aged 32–37 weeks, and if a mother wishes to breastfeed or provide human milk instead of other interventions, this should not be discouraged (IB). Scent of human milk may be considered with procedures and in conjunction with other techniques (IB), and skin-to-skin contact plus sucrose has not been formally evaluated but may provide pain reduction for preterm or low-birth-weight neonates (IV).

### REDUCTION OF POSTINTRAVITREAL INJECTION PAIN USING ICE: an open-label interventional randomized controlled trial [^111UP4gh]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Intravitreal injections of intraocular therapeutic agents are a common and effective treatment for various retinal pathologies. Patient discomfort related to injection is a potential barrier to treatment. Our aim in this study was to evaluate whether cooling the eye using topical ice compresses before intravitreal injection will reduce pain or bleeding.

Methods

This randomized controlled open-label study included 42 patients. All patients received a standard topical anesthesia protocol and then were randomly assigned to either receive a placement of ice packs (intervention group) or a room-temperature pack (control group) on the eyelid, 2 minutes before the intravitreal injection. Patients' discomfort, itching, burning and pain (using visual analog scale), and bleeding size (using photographs) were measured 1 and 10 minutes after the injection. Tolerability was calculated by averaging patients' discomfort, itching, burning, and pain scores.

Results

At 1 minute, pain (1.95 vs. 4.27, P = 0.01) and overall tolerability (1.66 vs. 2.98, P = 0.03) were significantly lower in patients receiving ice packs. At 10 minutes, pain (1.6 vs. 3.73, P = 0.02), burning (0.9 vs. 3.09, P = 0.007), discomfort (2.1 vs. 4.27, P = 0.008), and overall tolerability (1.23 vs. 2.87, P = 0.004) were all significantly lower in the ice group compared with the controls. Bleeding size (area or circumference) was not statistical different between groups.

Conclusion

Topical ice patch administered before intravitreal injection significantly decreased pain and overall tolerability. This simple and inexpensive method may be used to ameliorated pain and improve tolerability.

### Local cooling for relieving pain from perineal trauma sustained during childbirth [^116JVGwp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Perineal trauma is common during childbirth and may be painful. Contemporary maternity practice includes offering women numerous forms of pain relief, including the local application of cooling treatments. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review last updated in 2012.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of localised cooling treatments compared with no treatment, placebo, or other cooling treatments applied to the perineum for pain relief following perineal trauma sustained during childbirth.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 October 2019) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials (RCTs) that compared a localised cooling treatment applied to the perineum with no treatment, placebo, or another cooling treatment applied to relieve pain related to perineal trauma sustained during childbirth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were double checked for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs that enrolled 1233 women randomised to the use of one cooling treatment (ice, cold gel pad, cooling plus compression, cooling plus compression plus (being) horizontal) compared with another cooling treatment, no treatment, or placebo (water pack, compression). The included trials were at low or uncertain risk of bias overall, with the exception that the inability to blind participants and personnel to group allocation meant that we rated all trials at unclear or high risk for this domain. We undertook a number of comparisons to evaluate the different treatments. Cooling treatment (ice pack or cold gel pad) versus no treatment There was limited very low-certainty evidence that cooling treatment may reduce women's self-reported perineal pain within four to six hours (mean difference (MD) -4.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to -3.85 on a 10-point scale; 1 study, 100 participants) or between 24 and 48 hours of giving birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94; 1 study, 316 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about the various measures of wound healing, for example, wound edges gaping when inspected five days after giving birth (RR 2.56, 95% CI 0.58 to 11.33; 1 study, 315 participants). Women generally rated their satisfaction with perineal care similarly following cooling or no treatment. The potential exception was that there may be a trivially lower mean difference of -0.1 on a five-point scale of psychospiritual comfort with cooling treatment, that is unlikely to be of clinical importance. Cooling treatment (cold gel pad) + compression versus placebo (gel pad + compression) There was limited low-certainty evidence that there may be a trivial MD of -0.43 in pain on a 10-point scale at 24 to 48 hours after giving birth (95% CI -0.73 to -0.13; 1 study, 250 participants) when a cooling treatment plus compression from a well-secured perineal pad was compared with the placebo. Levels of perineal oedema may be similar for the two groups (low-certainty evidence) and perineal bruising was not observed. There was low-certainty evidence that women may rate their satisfaction as being slightly higher with perineal care in the cold gel pad and compression group (MD 0.88, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.38; 1 trial, 250 participants). Cooling treatment (ice pack) versus placebo (water pack) One study reported that no women reported pain after using an ice pack or a water pack when asked within 24 hours of giving birth. There was low-certainty evidence that oedema may be similar for the two groups when assessed at four to six hours (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.86; 1 study, 63 participants) or within 24 hours of giving birth (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.59). No women were observed to have perineal bruising at these times. The trialists reported that no women in either group experienced any adverse effects on wound healing. There was very low-certainty evidence that women may rate their views and experiences with the treatments similarly (for example, satisfied with treatment: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.08; 63 participants). Cooling treatment (ice pack) versus cooling treatment (cold gel pad) The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of using ice packs or cold gel pads on women's self-rated perineal pain, on perineal bruising, or on perineal oedema at four to six hours or within 24 hours of giving birth. Perineal oedema may persist 24 to 48 hours after giving birth in women using the ice packs (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.7; 2 trials, 264 participants; very low-certainty). The risk of gaping wound edges five days after giving birth may be decreased in women who had used ice packs (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.01; 215 participants; very low-certainty). However, this did not appear to persist to day 10 (RR 3.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 14.81; 214 participants). Women may rate their opinion of treatment less favourably following the use of ice packs five days after giving birth (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68; 1 study, 49 participants) and when assessed on day 10 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92; 1 study, 208 participants), both very low-certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited very low-certainty evidence that may support the use of cooling treatments, in the form or ice packs or cold gel pads, for the relief of perineal pain in the first two days following childbirth. It is likely that concurrent use of several treatments is required to adequately address this issue, including prescription and non-prescription analgesia. Studies included in this review involved the use of cooling treatments for 10 to 20 minutes, and although no adverse effects were noted, these findings came from studies of relatively small numbers of women, or were not reported at all. The continued lack of high-certainty evidence of the benefits of cooling treatments should be viewed with caution, and further well-designed trials should be conducted.

### Effect of gum chewing and cold therapy on postoperative cesarean women's self-assessed pain levels and narcotics use: a comparative study [^114N4TXa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Gum-Chewing following two hours of Cesarean minimized the pain score in the first 24 h, according to. Furthermore, documented that the nursing intervention program for women undergoing cesarean sections was successful in enhancing the psychological well-being of the women and mitigating their postoperative discomfort. In another study, and found that cryotherapy could only relieve post-gynecologic surgery discomfort for six and twelve hours, respectively.

Similarly, a study conducted in 2017 by who assessed postoperative pain in women having cesarean sections and found that this group experiences high intensity postoperative pain, highlighting the significance of pain assessment for the implementation of curative and preventive measures to minimize losses in women's recovery. Additionally, found that cold therapy helped patients who had low midline incisions for general surgery have less pain after surgery.

According to the results of the current study, both cold pack gel and gum chewing reduce dependence on narcotic use during the first 24 h following C/S. The results of this study also showed that, in comparison to a very tiny percentage in the control group, more than one quarter cold therapy group, less than one quarter Gum chewing group. This might be because women who have planned cesarean sections use fewer opioids because they experience less pain. This also indicates that, both cold pack gel and gum chewing were effective in reduce post-C/S pain.

These findings, In the same line according to, showed that the use of cold pack gel decreased patients' pain scores six and twelve hours following surgery, as well as their intake of narcotic medications. Additionally, gum chewing helps patients who have scheduled cesarean sections take less opioids and report less pain. Furthermore, found that chewing gum is an easy-to-use technique that can successfully speed up healing following cesarean delivery. Chewing gum has been linked to fewer discomforts and complication rates, according to.

Moreover, reported that the adjunctive cold gel pack was effective in lowering postoperative pain six hours following cesarean birth without raising any safety issues and lowering the total amount of opioids used. Furthermore, found that cryotherapy could decrease the total need for opioids and reduce postoperative discomfort from six hours to within twenty-four hours of the procedure. Additionally, found that employing 24-h ice pack compression reduces postoperative pain and morphine use following surgery till postoperative day 3.

### The effect of breast milk odor on infant pain and stress levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172GzZ2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Norouziasl et al. (2020) reviewed various pain management techniques, concluding that while breast milk odor can alleviate pain during medical procedures, the overall analgesic effect requires more comprehensive investigation. Hatfield et al. (2019) supported this by demonstrating that behavioral and environmental therapies, including oral sucrose and kangaroo care, significantly reduce pain responses in preterm infants. Lago et al. (2017) emphasized the effectiveness of non-pharmacological strategies, especially for needle-related pain, advocating for evidence-based guidelines. Similarly, Aguilar Cordero et al. (2015) found that approaches like sweet solutions and breastfeeding were beneficial for both preterm and full-term infants, while also calling for more extensive research to evaluate long-term effects. Shayani et al. (2023) highlighted that combined non-pharmacological interventions, such as massage and swaddling, effectively reduce pain and stress in infants, confirming their applicability in various healthcare settings. In a quasi-experimental study by Rashwan et al. 62 mechanically ventilated infants were randomly assigned to two groups: an experimental group that received a warm, maternally scented simulated hand (MSSH) during invasive procedures, and a control group. The findings indicated that infants wrapped in the MSSH experienced significantly lower levels of discomfort and pain compared to those receiving standard care. The study concluded that using a warm MSSH can enhance comfort and reduce pain and discomfort in premature infants, particularly when their mothers are not physically present. Tavlar compared the scent of breast milk to maternal heartbeat sounds and breastfeeding during heel prick procedures. The study found that newborns in the breast milk scent group exhibited high levels of stress, those in the maternal heartbeat sound group showed mild stress, and those in the breastfeeding group experienced no stress. Breast milk scent was not found to be an effective method for stress control.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^115LMj11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma and postpartum complications [^115jNKjG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Warm compress versus control (hands off or no warm compress)

Three studies investigated the effect of the use of a warm compress on the perineum versus control. For Albers, this involved a continuous warm compress held to the perineum and external genitalia between pushes, versus no touching of the perineum in the control group. For Terre‐Rull, with three arms, individuals in the intervention groups received a warm compress on the perineum that was either moist or dry. In the control group, no heat was used. In Dahlen 2007, a warm pack soaked in warm water was placed on the perineum during contractions, and usual care was applied in the control group.

Perineal massage versus control (hands off or no usual care)

Four studies investigated the effect of massage versus control.

Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care

One study investigated the effect of the use of Ritgen's manoeuvre, which involves lifting the fetal chin interiorly and extending the fetal neck, versus standard care with one hand on the perineum.

Primary delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder

One study investigated the effect of the primary delivery of the posterior shoulder versus the primary delivery of the anterior shoulder.

Perineal massage with enriched oil versus perineal massage with liquid wax

One study investigated the effect of massage to the perineum using a purified formula of almond oil with olive oil, rich with vitamin B1, B2, B6, E and fatty acid versus the use of a liquid wax.

Combined warm compress and perineal massage versus control

One study investigated the effect of the use of a warm compress and a massage versus routine care.

Vocalisation versus control

One study investigated the effect of vocalisation to maintain an open glottis during pushing and emitting sounds when exhaling, versus no vocalisation.

Combined warm compress and perineal massage versus perineal massage alone

One study investigated the effect of massage performed during contractions or pushes with a water‐soluble lubricant plus the application of a moist warm compress between contractions or pushes, versus massage during contractions or pushes with water‐soluble lubricant only.

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^114zHRVW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Breast engorgement is a painful condition affecting large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. It may lead to premature weaning, cracked nipples, mastitis and breast abscess. Various forms of treatment for engorgement have been studied but so far little evidence has been found on an effective intervention.

Objectives

This is an update of a systematic review first published by Snowden et al. in 2001 and subsequently published in 2010. The objective of this update is to seek new information on the best forms of treatment for breast engorgement in lactating women.

Search Methods

We identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015) and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. Where insufficient data were presented in trial reports, we attempted to contact study authors and obtain necessary information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In total, we included 13 studies with 919 women. In 10 studies individual women were the unit of analysis and in three studies, individual breasts were the unit of analysis. Four out of 13 studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest, two received charitable funding, and two were funded by government agencies. Trials examined interventions including non-medical treatments: cabbage leaves (three studies), acupuncture (two studies), ultrasound (one study), acupressure (one study), scraping therapy (Gua Sha) (one study), cold breast-packs and electromechanical massage (one study), and medical treatments: serrapeptase (one study), protease (one study) and subcutaneous oxytocin (one study). The studies were small and used different comparisons with only single studies contributing data to outcomes of this review. We were unable to pool results in meta-analysis and only seven studies provided outcome data that could be included in data and analysis. Non-medical No differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women) in terms of cessation of breastfeeding. However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), had less severe symptoms on day five (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99), and had a lower rate of pyrexia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) than women in the usual care group. In another study with 39 women comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were observed in breast pain (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.47; low-quality evidence) or breast engorgement (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between ultrasound and sham treatment in analgesic requirement (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45 women; low-quality evidence). A study comparing Gua-Sha therapy with hot packs and massage found a marked difference in breast engorgement (MD -2.42, 95% CI -2.98 to -1.86; one study; 54 women), breast pain (MD -2.01, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.42; one study; 54 women) and breast discomfort (MD -2.33, 95% CI -2.81 to -1.85; one study; 54 women) in favour of Gua-Sha therapy five minutes post-intervention, though both interventions significantly decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes post-treatment. Results from individual trials that could not be included in data analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20 minutes twice a day were found to be more effective than acupressure (P < 0.001). Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. In another study, women who received breast-shaped cold packs were more likely to experience a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation, make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in comparison to manual methods; however, the high level of attrition and alternating method of sequence generation place this study at high risk of bias. MedicalWomen treated with protease complex were less likely to have no improvement in pain (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; one study; 59 women) and swelling (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; one study; 59 women) on the fourth day of treatment and less likely to experience no overall change in their symptoms or worsening of symptoms (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56). It should be noted that it is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. Subcutaneous oxytocin provided no relief at all in symptoms at three days (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 14.44; one study; 45 women). Serrapeptase was found to produce some relief in breast pain, induration and swelling, when compared to placebo, with a fewer number of women experiencing slight to no improvement in overallbreast engorgement, swelling and breast pain. Overall, the risk of bias of studies in the review is high. The overall quality as assessed using the GRADE approach was found to be low due to limitations in study design and the small number of women in the included studies, with only single studies providing data for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Although some interventions such as hot/cold packs, Gua-Sha (scraping therapy), acupuncture, cabbage leaves and proteolytic enzymes may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement during lactation, there is insufficient evidence from published trials on any intervention to justify widespread implementation. More robust research is urgently needed on the treatment of breast engorgement.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^113Cwz1d]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — Vasospasm presenting as "Shooting or burning breast pain with blanching and other color changes (purple or red) of the nipple associated with pain" is managed with "Warmth (compresses, heat pads) following a breastfeed or whenever the mother experiences pain" and "Avoid cold on the breasts and nipples", with pharmacotherapy such as "Nifedipine 30–60 mg sustained release daily or immediate release 10–20 mg thrice a day for 2 weeks initially if pain persists. (L) Longer treatment may be necessary for some women".

### ABM clinical protocol # 3: supplementary feedings in the healthy term breastfed neonate, revised 2017 [^116hS1Uv]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #3 — sore nipples and supplementation in the healthy term breastfeeding dyad lists as a concern/inappropriate reason that sore nipples will improve if the mother takes a break from breastfeeding, and explains that mothers lose the opportunity to learn their infants' normal behavior and early feeding cues and that infants are at highest risk for receiving a supplement between 7 p.m. and 9 a.m. It states that sore nipples are not a function of length of time breastfeeding, that position, latch, and sometimes individual anatomic variation (e.g., ankyloglossia) are more important, and that there is no evidence that limiting time at the breast will prevent sore nipples. The nipple should not be rubbed or compressed during breastfeeding even if the feedings are frequent or "clustered". Stated risks of supplementation are that the problem with latch is not addressed, there is risk of decreasing breastfeeding duration or cessation of breastfeeding, and there is risk of breast engorgement.

### Breastfeeding for procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period [^113XCtct]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that breastfeeding newborn infants during painful procedures reduces pain. Mechanisms are considered to be multifactorial and include sucking, skin-to-skin contact, warmth, rocking, sound and smell of the mother, and possibly endogenous opiates present in the breast milk.

Objectives

To determine the effect of breastfeeding on procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) up to one year of age compared to no intervention, placebo, parental holding, skin-to-skin contact, expressed breast milk, formula milk, bottle feeding, sweet-tasting solutions (e.g. sucrose or glucose), distraction, or other interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 18 February 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs involving infants aged 28 days postnatal to 12 months and receiving breastfeeding while undergoing a painful procedure. Comparators included, but were not limited to, oral administration of water, sweet-tasting solutions, expressed breast or formula milk, no intervention, use of pacifiers, positioning, cuddling, distraction, topical anaesthetics, and skin-to-skin care. Procedures included, but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, venipuncture, intravenous line insertion, heel lance, and finger lance. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. The main outcome measures were behavioural or physiological indicators and composite pain scores, as well as other clinically important outcomes reported by the authors of included studies. We pooled data for the most comparable outcomes and where data from at least two studies could be included. We used mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), employing a random-effects model for continuous outcomes measured on the same scales. For continuous outcomes measured on different scales, we pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) and associated 95% CIs. For dichotomous outcomes, we planned to pool events between groups across studies using risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. However, as insufficient studies reported dichotomous outcomes, we did not pool such events. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies were conducted during early childhood immunisation. As the breastfeeding intervention cannot be blinded, we rated all studies as being at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. We assessed nine studies as being at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. In addition, we rated nine studies as high risk for blinding of outcome assessment. We scored risk of bias related to random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting as unclear for the majority of the studies due to lack of information. Our primary outcome was pain. Breastfeeding reduced behavioural pain responses (cry time and pain scores) during vaccination compared to no treatment, oral water, and other interventions such as cuddling, oral glucose, topical anaesthetic, massage, and vapocoolant. Breastfeeding did not consistently reduce changes in physiological indicators, such as heart rate. We pooled data for duration of cry from six studies (n = 547 infants). Breastfeeding compared to water or no treatment resulted in a 38-second reduction in cry time (MD -38, 95% CI -50 to -26; P < 0.00001). The quality of the evidence according to GRADE for this outcome was moderate, as most infants were 6 months or younger, and outcomes may be different for infants during their 12-month immunisation. We pooled data for pain scores from five studies (n = 310 infants). Breastfeeding was associated with a 1.7-point reduction in standardised pain scores (SMD -1.7, 95% CI -2.2 to -1.3); we considered this evidence to be of moderate quality as data were primarily from infants younger than 6 months of age. We could pool heart rate data following injections for only two studies (n = 186); we considered this evidence to be of low quality due to insufficient data. There were no differences between breastfeeding and control (MD -3.6, -23 to 16). Four of the 10 studies had more than two study arms. Breastfeeding was more effective in reducing crying duration or pain scores during vaccination compared to: 25% dextrose and topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA), vapocoolant, maternal cuddling, and massage. No included studies reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude, based on the 10 studies included in this review, that breastfeeding may help reduce pain during vaccination for infants beyond the neonatal period. Breastfeeding consistently reduced behavioural responses of cry duration and composite pain scores during and following vaccinations. However, there was no evidence that breastfeeding had an effect on physiological responses. No studies included in this review involved populations of hospitalised infants undergoing other skin-breaking procedures. Although it may be possible to extrapolate the review results to this population, further studies of efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability in this population are warranted.

### Effect of acupoint hot compress on postpartum urinary retention after vaginal delivery: a randomized clinical trial [^113dQaw7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The postpartum period, especially the first few weeks, is a challenging time for mothers to adjust to the situation of having newborns. The World Health Organization guidelines for postnatal care recommend that mothers and newborns receive care within 24 hours after birth. Moreover, patient self-care needs, even in the first few days after delivery, go beyond physical health and also extend to emotional well-being. The underlying mechanism of acupoint hot compress for individuals during the early postpartum period may be the promotion of local blood circulation, improvement of tissue metabolism and peripheral hemodynamics, inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity, and induction of parasympathetic nerve activity dominance.

The hot compress has proven to be an effective complementary treatment for myofascial pain syndrome in the upper trapezius muscleand has exhibited an extraordinary capability for regulating the pressure pain threshold and improving the quality of life. Warm compress bistage intervention has been found to substantially reduce the intensity of pain on the day after delivery. Acupoint hot compress, a combination of acupoints and natural physical agent heat, is more acceptable than other treatments both physically and mentally for patients and their families during puerperium because of its noninvasive feature. However, the effects of acupoint hot compress during the early postpartum period remain uncertain because of the lack of evidence-based support from clinical trials.

The main objective of this randomized clinical trial was to assess whether acupoint hot compress involving the abdominal, lumbosacral, and plantar regions could reduce the incidence of postpartum urinary retention, relieve postpartum uterine contraction pain, prevent emotional disorders, and promote lactation.

### Travel recommendations for nursing families | Infant and toddler nutrition… [^112zWwXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Traveling with a breastfeeding baby Breastfeeding can provide a source of comfort for babies whose normal routine is disrupted due to travel. In addition to offering ideal nutrition for your baby, breast milk keeps babies hydrated. Breastfed babies younger than 6 months do not need to drink water or any other liquids, even in hot weather.
- Before expressing milk, make sure to wash your hands with soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
- If you are traveling by car, plane, or other transportation, a manual or battery-powered breast pump may be the best option. Some pumps can also be powered with car adapters. Storing milk Check with your hotel or lodging accommodations in advance to request a compact refrigerator for your room if needed. Store expressed milk in milk storage bags or clean food-grade containers with tight-fitting lids made of glass or BPA-free plastic.

Store milk in the back of the refrigerator or freezer where the temperature is more likely to stay constant. For additional storage options and information on how to properly thaw milk, see Breast Milk Storage and Preparation. Transporting milk If you expect to have expressed milk with you during travel, carefully plan how to transport the milk. The type of transportation may influence the policies you need to follow. You can carry freshly expressed milk in an insulated cooler bag with frozen ice packs for up to 24 hours. After arriving at your destination, use the milk right away, store it in the refrigerator, or freeze it. If you carry frozen milk in a cooler with frozen gel packs or ice, check your milk when you get to your destination. If the milk has ice crystals, you can refreeze it. Previously frozen milk should be kept cold and used within 24 hours from when it thaws completely.

Thawing time will depend on the time spent traveling and the cooler temperature. If possible, check the milk after a few hours in the cooler to see if the milk has thawed. Passengers can carry all milk expression items with them through airport security checkpoints and onboard flights. These include:

- All expressed milk.
- Ice packs.
- Gel packs.
- Pumps and pump kits.
- Other items required to transport expressed milk. You do not have to be traveling with a baby to carry milk and supplies.

### Cold compared with room temperature compress on the repaired primiparous perineum following injury at normal vaginal delivery: a randomized controlled trial [^1116pFRK]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The perineum is typically injured at the first vaginal birth. The application of a cold compress to the perineal repair site can reduce pain; however, the effect usually dissipates after a couple of hours. Repeated applications may be needed for sustained analgesia. However, the medium-term effect of repeated applications of cold compress on the perineal repair site on the recovery of sexual function and perineal healing is not known.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate repeated applications of cold vs room temperature (placebo control) compress to the repaired primiparous perineum on pain upon movement.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a university hospital in Malaysia from May 2022 to February 2023. A total of 224 women with a repaired episiotomy or spontaneous second-degree tear sustained at normal delivery were randomized as follows: 113 to frozen gel pack and 111 to room temperature gel pack, as wound compress. The compress was applied to the perineal repair site at 3 timepoints: immediately after repair, and at 4 and 8 hours after delivery, for 20 minutes at each application. The primary outcomes were pain during movement at 12 and 24 hours after delivery, scored using the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. The secondary outcomes include duration of hospital stay; analgesic consumption; recovery and functional metrics of reestablishing flatus, mobilization, and urination, breastfeeding; maternal satisfaction with the allocated compress; and after hospital discharge for up to 6 weeks after birth through telephone interview, analgesic consumption, perineal pain, resumption of vaginal sex, and women's perception of perineal wound healing.

Results

The median (interquartile range) of pain at movement scores were 4 (4–5) vs 5 (4–5) (P = 0.018) at 12 hours and 2 (1–3) vs 2 (2–3) (P = 0.173) at 24 hours after birth for cold vs room temperature compress, respectively. Maternal satisfaction scores were 8 (7–9) vs 7 (6–8) (P = 0.119), oral analgesic for perineal pain while at the postnatal ward was taken by 94 of 113 (83.2%) vs 85 of 109 (78.0%) (relative risk, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.21), and time to the first satisfactory breastfeeding episode was 11.6 (7.9–15.5) vs 13.0 (8.0–20.7) hours (P = 0.303) for cold vs room temperature compress, respectively. At 2 weeks telephone follow-up, analgesic intake and perineal pain were not different. At 6 weeks, analgesic intake, perineal pain, resumption of vaginal sex, exclusive breastfeeding, and maternal perception of perineal healing were not different.

Conclusion

Intermittent cold compress in the first 8 hours to the repaired perineum reduces pain at 12 hours but the effect attenuates by 24 hours. Maternal satisfaction with their allocated compress was not different. There was no suggestion of harm or benefit on the other secondary outcomes.

### Does warming the breasts affect the amount of breastmilk production? [^117WcHPw]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Increasing the amount of breastmilk is vital for both the nursing mother and child. Warming up breasts before using electrical pumps to pump out breastmilk may help to increase the amount of breastmilk, especially in the mothers of babies who are being nursed in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Subjects and Methods

Thirty-nine mothers whose babies had been admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were analyzed. A breast compress that was warmed up in a microwave oven for 1 minute at 180 W was applied to one of the breasts for 20 minutes, and both breasts were sucked by an electrical breast pump for 15 minutes. The amount of breastmilk after each procedure was recorded.

Results

The amount of breastmilk that was obtained from warmed breasts was significantly higher than that obtained from nonwarmed breasts (maximum, 47.02 ± 23.01 mL vs. 33.15 ± 19.98 mL) (p = 0.000).

Conclusion

Warming up breasts by a breast compress is easy and affordable, and this procedure increases the amount of breastmilk, thus facilitating infant nutrition and recovery especially in the neonatal intensive care unit.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^117KQ4V7]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — maternal oversupply and persistent breast/nipple pain: Oversupply of milk can cause persistent breast and nipple pain. Mothers will typically complain of sharp breast pain or dull breast aching and breast tenderness when their breasts are quite full. Oversupply is very common in the first few weeks postpartum as the body adapts to the infant's milk supply needs. Milk expression should be minimized because it can lead to continued oversupply issues.

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^116TsR8q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

National surveys have shown that painful breasts are the second most common reason for giving up breastfeeding in the first two weeks after birth in the UK. One factor contributing to such pain can be breast engorgement. Views differ as to how engorgement arises, although restrictive feeding patterns in hospital are likely to have contributed in the past. These differing views are reflected in the range of solutions offered to treat engorgement in breastfeeding mothers and these treatments are assessed in this review.

Objectives

To determine the effects of any proposed intervention to relieve symptoms of breast engorgement among breastfeeding women.

Search Strategy

The register of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. CINAHL and MEDLINE were also searched. Date of last search: December 2000.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and 'quasi-randomised' controlled trials, with or without blinding, that assess the effectiveness of treatments for the alleviation of symptoms in breastfeeding women experiencing engorgement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer.

Main Results

Eight trials, involving 424 women, were included. Three different studies were identified which used cabbage leaves or cabbage leaf extracts;. no overall benefit was found. Ultrasound treatment and placebo were equally effective. Use of Danzen (an anti-inflammatory agent) significantly improved the total symptoms of engorgement when compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3–10.3) as did bromelain/trypsin complex (OR 8.02, 95% CI 2.8–23.3). Oxytocin and cold packs had no demonstrable effect on engorgement symptoms.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cabbage leaves and gel packs were equally effective in the treatment of engorgement. Since both cabbage extract and placebo cream were equally effective, the alleviation in symptoms may be brought about by other factors, such as breast massage. Ultrasound treatment is equally effective with or without the ultra-wave emitting crystal, therefore its effectiveness is more likely to be due to the effect of radiant heat or massage. Pharmacologically, oxytocin was not an effective engorgement treatment while Danzen and bromelain/trypsin complex significantly improved the symptoms of engorgement. Initial prevention of breast engorgement should remain the key priority.

Warmth and scent — Two studies evaluating the effects of warmth on infant pain associated with immunization found a significant analgesic effect when used as the sole intervention and when used in concert with administration of a sucrose solution. Infants received 2 minutes of radiant warmer exposure, which was shown to not effect infant core temperature, and this maneuver may be a safe and easy intervention if skin-to-skin contact or breastfeeding is not available (IB). The scent of human milk and various other substances such as lavender, vanilla, formula, and amniotic fluid has been evaluated as possible analgesics for painful procedures in preterm and full-term infants, with human milk consistently found to be effective at reducing pain (IB).

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^112yHDPv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breast engorgement is a painful and unpleasant condition affecting large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. During a time when mothers are coping with the demands of a new baby it may be particularly distressing. Breast engorgement may inhibit the development of successful breastfeeding, lead to early breastfeeding cessation, and is associated with more serious illness, including breast infection.

Objectives

To identify the best forms of treatment for women who experience breast engorgement.

Search Strategy

We identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials where treatments for breast engorgement were evaluated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion and carried out data extraction.

Main Results

We included eight studies with 744 women. Trials examined a range of different treatments for breast engorgement: acupuncture (two studies), cabbage leaves (two studies), cold gel packs (one study), pharmacological treatments (two studies) and ultrasound (one study). For several interventions (ultrasound, cabbage leaves, and oxytocin) there was no statistically significant evidence that interventions were associated with a more rapid resolution of symptoms; in these studies women tended to have improvements in pain and other symptoms over time whether or not they received active treatment. There was evidence from one study that, compared with women receiving routine care, women receiving acupuncture had greater improvements in symptoms in the days following treatment, although there was no evidence of a difference between groups by six days, and the study did not have sufficient power to detect meaningful differences for other outcomes (such as breast abscess). A study examining protease complex reported findings favouring intervention groups although it is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. A study looking at cold packs suggested that the application of cold does not cause harm, and may be associated with improvements in symptoms, although differences between control and intervention groups at baseline mean that results are difficult to interpret.

Authors' Conclusions

Allthough some interventions may be promising, there is not sufficient evidence from trials on any intervention to justify widespread implementation. More research is needed on treatments for this painful and distressing condition.

Breastfeeding-related mastitis — decrease inflammation and pain: Ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce edema and inflammation and provide symptomatic relief, and acetaminophen/paracetamol can provide analgesia; practical examples include ice applied every hour or more frequently if desired, ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, and acetaminophen/paracetamol 1,000 mg every 8 hours in the acute setting. Although heat will vasodilate and may worsen symptoms, it also may provide comfort for some patients, and the use of warm showers and antipyretics did not improve mastitis outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Sunflower or soy lecithin 5–10 g daily by mouth may be taken to reduce inflammation in ducts and emulsify milk. Levels of evidence: 1–3 with strength of recommendation C.

### ABM clinical protocol # 16: breastfeeding the hypotonic infant, revision 2016 [^114pW42k]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #16 — preventive measures to protect a milk supply in hypotonic infants state that if the infant cannot fully breastfeed or the mother is separated (e.g., neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission), lactation should be initiated and/or maintained through milk expression by hand or pump. Mothers should be encouraged to express milk shortly after birth, ideally within the first hour, and approximately every 3 hours thereafter; older recommendations suggested expressing within the first 6 hours of birth. The mother should aim to remove milk at least eight times in a 24 hour period. As milk transfer improves, expressing can be tailored to signs such as breast emptying by expression after each attempt at breast, and combining mechanical pumping with hand expression can increase both milk volumes and caloric content. For transition benchmarks, breastmilk production of 500 mL/day is commonly cited as the minimum volume enabling premature infants of less than 1,500 g to transition to successful, exclusive breastfeeding. Technique guidance includes that simultaneous expression of both breasts with a hospital-grade pump is more effective than single breast expression, hand expression while pumping improves expressed milk volume and milk caloric content in pump-dependent women, and hand expression, massage, and compression used with mechanical expression can sometimes serve to enhance breast emptying.

### Effect of acupoint hot compress on postpartum urinary retention after vaginal delivery: a randomized clinical trial [^115gAo8E]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Adverse Events

Adverse events were documented throughout the trial. On the basis of the potential association of an adverse event with the acupoint hot compress procedure, on-site specialists categorized the adverse events as either treatment related (including local skin allergy, pruritus, pain, scald, ulceration, subcutaneous hemorrhage, hematoma, and local infection) or nontreatment related within 2 hours of occurrence.

Statistical Analysis

According to the results of the pilot study, the incidence rate of postpartum urinary retention was 7.7% in the intervention group and 25.7% in the control group. Assuming a 1:1 ratio of the intervention group to the control group and using a 1-sided test, a significance level of α = .025 and a power (1-β) of 80% were established. We estimated that 1200 participants were required for the trial, assuming that 20% of participants might drop out of the study.

Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were described on the basis of the per-protocol population (n = 1085). Continuous variables were presented as a mean (SD) or median (IQR) according to the distribution of variables, and categorical variables were described as numbers and percentages.

For the primary outcome, the incidences of postpartum urinary retention in the intervention and control groups were compared using the Fisher exact test, and the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. For the secondary outcomes, the postpartum uterine contraction pain intensity levels at 6.5, 28.5, 52.5, and 76.5 hours after delivery in the 2 groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Depressive symptoms were compared using the Fisher exact test, and the RR and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated. Lactation initiation time was compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the breastfeeding milk volume as well as feeding mood and times assessed at 28.5, 52.5, and 76.5 hours after birth between the 2 groups. Newborn weight at 28.5, 52.5, and 76.5 hours after delivery were analyzed using an unpaired, 2-tailed t test. To consider the potential effects of spinal analgesia on the outcomes, we conducted a subgroup analysis.

Statistical analysis was based on per-protocol population and was performed by 2 independent analysts (Y.L. and M.T.) using R, version 4.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). A 2-sided P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
