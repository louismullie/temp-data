## Question

Are BV and trichomonas sexually transmitted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis are sexually transmitted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how major guidelines classify each condition and what they recommend for partner management. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence for sexual transmission. Next, I will examine how sexual activity influences risk and recurrence, especially for BV. Finally, I'll synthesize a clear clinical bottom line for classification and management, making sure my conclusions align with CDC, WHO, and IUSTI guidance [^11488KRC] [^112GEJDK] [^114kX2MY] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^116ecoQF].

> Let me first confirm definitions and the frame of reference, because I need to ensure I'm using the same terminology as the guidelines. Sexually transmitted infections are those with established person-to-person transmission via sexual contact and typically prompt partner evaluation and treatment in management algorithms, as codified in CDC STI Treatment Guidelines and WHO STI guidance, which explicitly list Trichomonas vaginalis among curable STIs worldwide [^11488KRC] [^112GTedp].

> I will now examine Trichomonas vaginalis. Wait, let me verify the official classification before jumping to conclusions. The CDC 2021 STI Treatment Guidelines, WHO 2024 recommendations, and IUSTI/WHO guidance clearly classify trichomoniasis as a sexually transmitted infection and recommend nitroimidazole therapy with concurrent partner treatment, which is a hallmark of STI control strategies [^11488KRC] [^115CqZg1] [^113o9tb4] [^112GEJDK] [^114kX2MY] [^112xUasi] [^115eerEw].

> Next, I should review transmission evidence for TV to ensure the classification is supported epidemiologically. Hold on, I should verify partner concordance and asymptomatic carriage. A prospective multicenter partner study found that approximately 72% of male partners of infected women were themselves infected, and the majority were asymptomatic, which strongly supports sexual transmission and silent reservoirs that sustain spread, findings that align with the high sensitivity of modern NAATs in men and women and with TV's global burden as a curable STI [^113uUFua] [^112NM79t] [^1159hSob] [^112GTedp].

> Now, let me consider bacterial vaginosis, and I should not conflate "sexually associated" with "sexually transmitted". The CDC 2021 BV guidance treats only the affected patient and does not recommend routine treatment of male partners, and IUSTI/WHO explicitly advises against offering treatment to male partners for BV, which argues against classifying BV as a classic STI in current practice, while WHO 2024 BV recommendations similarly focus on patient-directed regimens without partner therapy [^116ecoQF] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^114n4Gn7].

> But wait, I need to check the etiologic model for BV to see why guidelines draw this distinction. BV is best understood as a polymicrobial vaginal dysbiosis characterized by loss of Lactobacillus dominance and overgrowth of anaerobes rather than infection with a single transmissible pathogen, and critically, its exact etiology remains unknown, which undermines a strict STI classification model [^112iwPBi] [^113yDc2c] [^115kaB7N].

> I should double-check the role of sexual activity in BV, because sexual behavior may influence acquisition and recurrence even if BV is not designated an STI. Epidemiologic data link BV to new or multiple partners and show condom use is protective, molecular studies demonstrate exchange of BV-associated bacteria between partners, and extra-vaginal reservoirs may contribute to incident BV, yet BV also occurs in some virginal women and recurs frequently, pointing to multifactorial drivers including biofilm persistence and failure to restore Lactobacillus after antibiotics, with emerging but not yet guideline-standard evidence that treating male partners might improve cure in select contexts [^111G9r63] [^115BEA6z] [^1172dPuf] [^1118aqNd] [^115kaB7N].

> Let me now examine their interrelationship, because I need to ensure I'm not overlooking bidirectional effects. BV is associated with an increased risk of acquiring several STIs, and observational data show higher rates of TV and MG in women with BV, while mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest T. vaginalis can disrupt vaginal flora and may precipitate or coexist with BV, reinforcing that they are epidemiologically linked even though their etiologies and classifications differ [^1155Ubo4] [^112Ex7Rk] [^1158XGXj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without a clear clinical bottom line. I should confirm management implications alongside classification. Trichomonas vaginalis is unequivocally a sexually transmitted infection, and both patient and sexual partners should be treated with nitroimidazoles per CDC, WHO, and IUSTI guidance, whereas bacterial vaginosis is not classified as a true STI in current guidelines and routine treatment of male partners is not recommended, though sexual activity influences risk and recurrence and ongoing research may refine partner strategies in the future [^11488KRC] [^112GEJDK] [^112xUasi] [^116ecoQF] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^115kaB7N].

Trichomoniasis is a **sexually transmitted infection** caused by Trichomonas vaginalis [^115EDyn7] and is transmitted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex, with partners requiring treatment to prevent reinfection [^112xUasi]. Bacterial vaginosis is **not classified as an STI** [^114yUGwt] but is associated with sexual activity and can recur after sex with untreated partners [^111G9r63]; male partners are not treated, but female partners should be treated if symptomatic [^114Dz9ZQ]. Both conditions increase the risk of acquiring other STIs, including HIV, and are managed with metronidazole or tinidazole [^11488KRC] [^114kX2MY], with partner management differing between the two [^112xUasi].

---

## Trichomoniasis: a sexually transmitted infection

### Etiology and transmission

Trichomoniasis is caused by **Trichomonas vaginalis**, a flagellated protozoan parasite [^114Gj5f3] [^115EDyn7]. Transmission occurs primarily via vaginal intercourse; oral and anal sex can also spread the infection. Many infected individuals — especially men — are asymptomatic but remain infectious [^112NM79t] [^114yCFTN].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Women may present with **vaginal discharge, itching, irritation, dysuria, and dyspareunia** [^115EDyn7]; **men** are often asymptomatic but can develop urethritis, prostatitis, or epididymitis [^114yCFTN].

---

### Diagnosis

- **NAATs**: Highly sensitive and specific; recommended by CDC and WHO [^11488KRC] [^115eerEw].

- **Wet mount microscopy**: Rapid but less sensitive [^11488KRC] [^111ZyVe6].

- **Culture**: Previously gold standard; now less commonly used due to NAATs [^112NM79t].

---

### Treatment and partner management

- **First-line therapy**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^11488KRC] [^113GQ4Qd].

- **Alternative therapy**: Tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose [^115CqZg1].

- **Partner treatment**: Sexual partners must be treated to prevent reinfection [^112xUasi] [^113uUFua].

## Bacterial vaginosis: a sexually associated condition

### Etiology and transmission

Bacterial vaginosis reflects a **polymicrobial dysbiosis** with reduced lactobacilli and increased anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae [^112iwPBi] [^113yDc2c]. It is not classified as an STI but is associated with sexual activity — such as new or multiple partners and inconsistent condom use [^111G9r63]. Nonsexual contributors include douching, smoking, and hormonal changes [^114yUGwt].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Symptoms include a **thin, grayish-white discharge with a fishy odor, vaginal irritation, and itching** [^112iwPBi]; however, **asymptomatic cases** are common, especially in pregnant women [^114yUGwt].

---

### Diagnosis

Clinical diagnosis uses **Amsel criteria**, including characteristic discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, a positive whiff test, and clue cells [^112iwPBi]. Nugent scoring provides a Gram stain–based assessment of vaginal flora [^112iwPBi]. Molecular diagnostics are emerging but not yet standard [^116K2hdo].

---

### Treatment and partner management

- **First-line therapy**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^114kX2MY] [^116ecoQF].

- **Alternative therapy**: Clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^114kX2MY] [^114n4Gn7].

- **Partner treatment**: Male partners not treated; female partners treated if symptomatic [^114Dz9ZQ] [^116LmS3w].

---

## Comparative summary

| **Characteristic** | **Trichomoniasis** | **Bacterial vaginosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiology | Trichomonas vaginalis (protozoan) | Polymicrobial dysbiosis |
| Transmission | Sexually transmitted | Sexually associated |
| Classification | STI | Not an STI |
| Diagnosis | - NAATs <br/> - Wet mount <br/> - Culture | - Amsel criteria <br/> - Nugent scoring |
| Treatment | Metronidazole or tinidazole | Metronidazole or clindamycin |
| Partner management | Treat all partners | Treat symptomatic female partners only |

---

## Public health implications

Both conditions increase **susceptibility to other STIs**, including HIV [^112iwPBi] [^112GTedp]. They are also associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, and other adverse outcomes [^114rZJZp]. High recurrence rates — particularly for BV — complicate management [^114yUGwt] [^113yDc2c].

---

Trichomoniasis is a **sexually transmitted infection** requiring partner treatment, while bacterial vaginosis is a sexually associated condition not classified as an STI, with partner treatment only for symptomatic female partners. Both conditions increase the risk of other STIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, necessitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those that do, it is the symptoms themselves, including malodour and vaginal discharge, that cause significant distress to women and impact their quality of life and relationships. Evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli, and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp. and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). While the exact pathogens responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesized that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

### Is the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis a reliable predictor of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae in female ED patients [^113yFsaN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine if the presence of *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV) is associated with an increased risk of coinfection with *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT) and/or *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG) in female patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms consistent with a sexually transmitted disease (STD).

This was a retrospective observational study involving female patients tested for the presence of TV by wet mount preparation in the ED from January 1998 through January 2001. Only patients with complete results from the wet preparation for TV, DNA probe for CT, and culture for NG were included.

A total of 690 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 420 (61%) tested positive for TV by wet mount preparation, while 270 (39%) tested negative. Among the 420 TV-positive patients, 41 (9.8%) tested positive for NG, 35 (8.3%) for CT, and 16 (3.8%) for both. For the 270 TV-negative patients, 16 (5.9%) tested positive for NG, 91 (33.7%) for CT, and 16 (5.9%) for both. Chi-square testing revealed a strong negative association between the presence of TV and coinfection with CT and/or NG. The presence of TV made it 2.9 times less likely to have a coinfection with NG and/or CT.

In conclusion, the presence of TV in female patients presenting to the ED with symptoms consistent with an STD is not associated with an increased risk of coinfection with NG and/or CT.

### Correlation of leukorrhea and Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^1158WvBp]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) causing vaginitis. Microscopy has poor sensitivity but is used for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in resource-poor settings. We aimed to provide a more reliable diagnosis of trichomoniasis by investigating an association with leukorrhea. Women presenting for evaluation of vaginal discharge, STI exposure, or preventative gynecologic examination were evaluated for Trichomonas infection. Vaginal pH was determined and microscopy was performed by the provider, who recorded the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per epithelial cell and the presence of clue cells, yeast, and/or motile trichomonads.

Leukorrhea was defined as greater than one PMNL per epithelial cell. Culture and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were used to detect T. vaginalis. Patients were evaluated for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using NAATs and bacterial vaginosis using Gram stains. Two hundred ninety-four women were enrolled, and 16% were found to have Trichomonas (46/294). Trichomonas infection was more common in parous non-Hispanic, black women, who reported low rates of contraceptive use (33% versus 17%; P = 0.02) and a STI history (85% versus 55%; P = 0.002).

These women were more likely to report vaginal discharge (76% versus 59%; P = 0.02), have an elevated vaginal pH (87% versus 48%; P < 0.001), and gonorrhea infection (15% versus 4%; P = 0.002). Leukorrhea was associated with a four-fold increased risk of Trichomonas infection. Leukorrhea on microscopy was associated with Trichomonas vaginitis.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women. It is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in addition to adverse birth outcomes. While it is known that BV is a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown.

The purpose of this minireview is to provide an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings. This article is divided into two primary sections: traditional BV diagnostics and molecular diagnostics.

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**: These methods form the foundation of current diagnostic strategies.
- **Molecular diagnostics**: Molecular diagnostic assays, particularly 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are specifically highlighted, in addition to multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), given their increasing use in clinical practice and research studies regarding the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis.

We also provide a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and discuss future challenges in this field of research.

### The global epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic review [^1118aqNd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) enhances the acquisition and transmission of a range of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus. This has made it more important to uncover the reasons why some populations have very high BV prevalence and others do not. This systematic review describes the global epidemiology of BV. It summarizes data from peer-reviewed publications detailing the population prevalence of BV as diagnosed by a standardized and reproducible methodology — the Nugent scoring system.

BV variations between countries and between ethnic groups within countries are described. We evaluated 1,692 English and non-English language articles describing the prevalence of BV using MEDLINE and the Web of Science databases. A total of 86 articles met our inclusion criteria. BV prevalence was found to vary considerably between ethnic groups in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Although BV prevalence is, in general, highest in parts of Africa and lowest in much of Asia and Europe, some populations in Africa have very low BV prevalence, and some in Asia and Europe have high rates.

### Trichomonas vaginalis origins, molecular pathobiology and clinical considerations [^111MHk9s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to integrate a selection of the most recent data on Trichomonas vaginalis origins, molecular cell biology, and T. vaginalis interactions with the urogenital tract microbiota, with trichomoniasis symptoms and clinical management.

Recent findings in transcriptomics and proteomics datasets are accumulating, facilitating the identification and prioritization of key target genes to study T. vaginalis pathobiology. Proteins involved in host sensing and cytoskeletal plasticity during T. vaginalis amoeboid transformation were identified. T. vaginalis was shown to secrete exosomes and a macrophage migration inhibitory factor-like protein that both influence host-parasite interactions. T. vaginalis co-infections with Mycoplasma species and viruses were shown to modulate the inflammatory responses. Conversely, T. vaginalis interactions with various Lactobacillus species inhibit parasite interactions with human cells. T. vaginalis infections were also shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis. A broader range of health sequelae is also becoming apparent. Diagnostics for both women and men based on molecular approaches are being refined, particularly for men.

New developments in the molecular and cellular basis of T. vaginalis pathobiology, combined with data on the urogenital tract microbiota and immunology, have enriched our knowledge of human-microbe interactions. This will contribute to increasing our capacity to prevent and treat T. vaginalis and other sexually transmitted infections.

### Clinical validation of the Aptima bacterial vaginosis and Aptima vaginitis assays: results from a prospective multicenter clinical study [^115547Mo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

Infectious vaginitis due to bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis accounts for a significant proportion of all gynecologic visits in the United States. A prospective multicenter clinical study was conducted to validate the performance of two new in vitro diagnostic transcription-mediated amplification nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis. Patient- and clinician-collected vaginal-swab samples obtained from women with symptoms of vaginitis were tested with the Aptima BV and Aptima Candida/Trichomonas vaginitis (CV/TV) assays. The results were compared to Nugent scores (plus Amsel for intermediate Nugent) for BV, Candida cultures and DNA sequencing for VVC, and a composite of NAAT and culture for T. vaginalis.

The prevalences of infection were similar for clinician- and patient-collected samples: 49% for BV, 29% for VVC due to the Candida species group, 4% for VVC due to Candida glabrata, and 10% for T. vaginalis. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for the investigational tests in clinician-collected samples were 95.0% and 89.6%, respectively, for BV; 91.7% and 94.9% for the Candida species group; 84.7% and 99.1% for C. glabrata; and 96.5% and 95.1% for T. vaginalis. Sensitivities and specificities were similar in patient-collected samples. In a secondary analysis, clinicians' diagnoses, in-clinic assessments, and investigational-assay results were compared to gold standard reference methods. Overall, the investigational assays had higher sensitivity and specificity than clinicians.

### Interrelationships among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and the presence of yeasts [^1158XGXj]. Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Vaginal discharge of mixed etiology occurs frequently, with abnormal vaginal flora being the most common condition. The interrelationships among the disturbance of the vaginal ecology, the presence of yeasts, and infection with *Trichomonas vaginalis* and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were investigated among women presenting to a sexually transmitted diseases service. Analysis was done for 598 women.

Although the prevalence of HIV-1 infection increased linearly with increasing Nugent's score (bacterial vaginosis score of Gram stain), the prevalence of *T. vaginalis* increased suddenly from 12% in patients with a Nugent's score of ≤ 3 to 33% in patients with a score of 4, and remained at this level at higher scores. Yeast colonization and vulvovaginal candidiasis were inversely related to Nugent's scores. *T. vaginalis* might be responsible for the change in normal vaginal flora and may, therefore, be one of the causes of bacterial vaginosis. This could lead to more effective HIV-1 acquisition.

### Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114yUGwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In preparation for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2019 to examine recent literature addressing updates in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STIs. This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences, including an increased risk of acquisition of others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus-2. There is also a connection to adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, as well as increased cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, who are also the groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs).

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single-dose, point-of-care treatment strategy, which is novel to the U.S. but evidence-based and consistent with international guidelines. This approach aims to address existing deficiencies in the availability of inexpensive and accurate point-of-care diagnosis and to overcome substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow-up that are commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### The influence of ART on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis among HIV-infected women [^114DvLTn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Among women who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+), both prevalent and persistent infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common. TV has been shown to increase vaginal shedding of HIV, which may influence HIV sexual and perinatal transmission, making prevention important. In one cohort of HIV+ women in Kenya, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, mostly nevirapine-based, was associated with lower cure rates of TV for single-dose therapy. Our goal was to repeat this study in a US-based cohort of HIV+/TV+ women and compare outcomes to those with multidose therapy.

A secondary data analysis was performed on a multicentered cohort of HIV+/TV+ women who were randomized to single-dose (2 grams) or 7-day (500 mg twice daily) multidose metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. Test of cure visit, via culture, occurred 6–12 days after treatment completion. Information was collected on sex partner treatment and sexual exposures. Persistent TV infection rates were compared for women on ART at baseline versus not on ART.

Of the 226 women included, those on ART had more treatment failures than women not on ART (24/146 [16.4%] vs. 5/80 [6.3%]; p = 0.03). When stratified by treatment arm, more treatment failures were seen in the single-dose arm (17/73 [23.3%] vs. 3/39 [7.7%]; p = 0.05) than in the multidose arm (7/73 [9.6%] vs. 2/41 [4.8%]; p = 0.39).

ART usage was associated with a higher TV persistent infection rate among those receiving the single-dose treatment, but not the multidose, providing more evidence that multidose should be the preferred option for treatment.

Regarding medical management for Trichomonas vaginalis infection, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following options if adherence to multiple doses is a serious concern:

- **Single-dose therapies**:
	- Metronidazole 2 g PO as a single dose
	- Tinidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy)
	- Secnidazole 2 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy)
	- Ornidazole 1.5 g PO as a single dose (except during pregnancy), if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### WHO global research priorities for sexually transmitted infections [^112GTedp]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have a profound effect on sexual and reproductive health worldwide. More than one million STIs are acquired every day. In 2020, an estimated 374 million new infections occurred with one of four bacterial or parasitic STIs that can be cured with available antimicrobials: Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea), and Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis). Additionally, viral STIs that can be long-lasting (e.g. human papillomavirus [HPV]) or lifelong (e.g. herpes simplex virus) affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide at any point in time. The burden of STIs is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to genital symptoms, STIs can lead to multiple adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including cervical cancer, infertility, increased vulnerability to HIV, pregnancy complications, and congenital infections. Moreover, the psychological, social, and economic consequences of STIs can substantially affect quality of life.

Despite the need, the public health response to STIs has been poor in many parts of the world. As the WHO global strategy on STIs for 2016–21 came to a close, WHO issued a global progress report on the strategy, noting that STI control had shown little improvement. Long-standing challenges, such as the absence of available STI diagnostic tests in resource-limited settings, combined with newer threats, such as global shortages of benzathine penicillin for the treatment of syphilis, increasing gonococcal antimicrobials resistance.

### Bacterial vaginosis [^115kaB7N]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2025). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal microbiome disorder that is associated with preterm birth and spontaneous abortion, increased risk of HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections, and has negative effects on quality of life. BV affects one in four women globally, with the highest burden in resource-limited settings. Marked alterations in vaginal microbiome composition, in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and in the proteome and metabolome characterize BV and contribute to adverse sequelae. Despite its prevalence, the exact etiological agent of BV is unknown and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. These knowledge gaps impede diagnostic and management approaches, with recommended treatment strategies resulting in recurrence that exceeds 50% over 3–6 months.

- **Understanding and treatment**: New data on the sexual transmission of BV, including evidence that male-partner treatment improves cure, have enhanced our understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis and provide opportunities for developing optimal diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies. Other factors probably also contribute to the low efficacy of treatments, including biofilm and/or antimicrobial resistance, and failure to recolonize a favourable vaginal microbiome after treatment. The complex pathophysiology of BV highlights that individualized and multifaceted management approaches will be required to manage the refractory and adverse sequelae of BV.

### Improved detection by DNA amplification of Trichomonas vaginalis in males [^111QGnG3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection that is highly prevalent worldwide and has been linked to preterm birth and human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. In females, trichomoniasis causes vaginitis, while in males, it is frequently asymptomatic but can be a cause of urethritis. Control efforts have been hampered by the lack of a sensitive diagnostic technique for this infection in males.

Men attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic for a new complaint were screened for Trichomonas vaginalis by culture and by PCR analysis of urine and urethral-swab specimens. The prevalence of Trichomonas determined by culture was 5% (15 of 300 specimens), compared to 17% (52 of 300) determined by PCR. Urine specimens yielded a greater number of positive results by PCR than did urethral-swab specimens.

The sensitivity of PCR analysis of urine specimens in comparison to that of culture was 100%. The use of PCR techniques in urine specimen-based detection of T. vaginalis was highly sensitive and revealed a prevalence of infection more than three times that revealed by culture for men at high risk for STDs.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115BEA6z]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally, yet an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within 6 months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, which has been attributed to the possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners.

There is a robust body of evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity, and while the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed to women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure; thus, the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection is justified.

In this manuscript, we present the molecular and epidemiological evidence underlying the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted and summarize why research that continues to consider sexual partnerships is necessary. We also outline the significant barriers and challenges identified while undertaking partner treatment studies and discuss the factors that impact our ability to determine their effectiveness.

Ultimately, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is likely to be multifaceted.

### Severity of bacterial vaginosis and the risk of sexually transmitted infection [^112Ex7Rk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and incident sexually transmitted infection (STI) varies with more extreme BV scores.

We analyzed the data from 535 women who were enrolled in a randomized trial to promote dual method contraceptive use. Incident STI was defined as any case of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. BV was defined by Gram stain (Nugent score). STI risk was estimated with the use of proportional hazards regression.

Binary (0–6 vs 7–10) and 3-level (negative 0–3, intermediate 4–6, or BV 7–10) categorizations were not associated with time to STI; however, women with the highest Nugent scores (9–10) had a 2.1-fold increased risk of STI (95% confidence interval, 1.05–4.28) compared with women with normal flora.

Nugent score > 8 is associated with incident STI. More accurate classification of BV will allow clinicians to identify those women who are at greatest risk of STI.

### Association between male circumcision and women's biomedical health outcomes: a systematic review [^1154bcQK]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, high-risk HPV, trichomonas, non-specific genital ulcers, and vaginal discharge were the other low-consistency outcomes. Two patterns underlie this heterogeneity. For gonorrhoea and non-specific genital ulcers, the one data point showing a harmful association was from the same study, which had a participant pool of members of high-risk populations (recruited from sexually transmitted infection clinics). The data points showing harmful associations with trichomonas are from this study and another study with patients from sexually transmitted infection clinics. For bacterial vaginosis, of the two data points showing a (non-significant) harmful association, the observational point was one of the same two high-risk studies, and the RCT enrolled female partners of HIV-positive men. Without this RCT, evidence on bacterial vaginosis would be high consistency for a protective association. For high-risk HPV, the single study showing a (non-significant) harmful association was also an RCT enrolling partners of HIV-positive men. For vaginal discharge, the same was true for the data point showing a harmful association (prevalence ratio 1.13, no CI), whereas the other two points had prevalence ratio estimates of 0.99 and 1.01. We conclude that the protective effects of male circumcision for women against many sexually transmitted infections are not evident when male partners are HIV infected. In the case of women at high risk of sexually transmitted infections, the mechanisms that underlie protection in the general population would be expected to operate in the same manner.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^1159hSob]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is considered one of the most common curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating 156 million cases in 2016, a higher prevalence than syphilis. It is currently not a reportable disease, and the true estimation of disease prevalence is not currently known. Some contributing factors include a lack of routine testing, nonspecific symptomatology, and infected men being predominantly asymptomatic.

A large proportion of T. vaginalis infections are asymptomatic; however, symptoms can include urethral discharge primarily in males, and abnormal vaginal discharge, dysuria, itching, irritation, and abdominal pain in females. The consequences of untreated infection may include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and adverse pregnancy outcomes. T. vaginalis infection has also been shown to increase the risk of HIV by 50% via several mechanisms, including damage to the vaginal epithelial membrane by the protozoa.

- **CDC recommendations**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that women presenting with symptoms are tested for T. vaginalis, but do not recommend generalized screening of asymptomatic women. However, screening is recommended for women living in areas with a higher than average prevalence, those who report behaviors that may have resulted in STI exposure, or those who are HIV positive.

Coinfection of T. vaginalis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis in women has been previously reported, and symptoms can overlap between infections. Therefore, T. vaginalis infections may be missed and left untreated if N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis positivity is presumed to be the cause. In populations with high levels of STI exposure, proper diagnosis and differentiation between these infections are critical to avoid missed treatments and ensure comprehensive sexual health care.

### Molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: an update [^116K2hdo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women. BV has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV represents the acquisition of a diverse community of anaerobic and facultative bacteria and a reduction in lactobacilli.

It can be diagnosed using several tests ranging from clinical indicators, point-of-care tests, and molecular assays. Molecular technologies are objective, able to detect fastidious bacteria, enable quantitation, and are ideal for self-collected vaginal swabs. This paper reviews the currently available BV diagnostic tests in the United States.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^112NM79t]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Diagnosis has historically relied on either microscopic analysis or culture, the latter being the previous gold standard. However, these tests are not readily available for male diagnosis, generally only perform well for symptomatic women, and are not as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Men are largely asymptomatic but carry the organism and transmit it to their sexual partners.

This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the performance of the cobas TV/MG assay for detection of DNA compared with patient infection status (PIS) defined by a combination of commercially available NAATs and culture using urogenital specimens. A total of 2,064 subjects (984 men and 1,080 women, 940 [45.5%] symptomatic, 1,124 [54.5%] asymptomatic) were evaluable.

In women, sensitivity ranged from 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.8 to 99.9%) using vaginal samples to 94.7% (95% CI 90.2 to 97.2%) in PreservCyt samples. Specificity ranged from 98.9 to 96.8% (95% CI 95.4 to 97.8%). In men, the cobas TV/MG assay was 100% sensitive for the detection in both male urine samples and meatal swabs, with specificity of 98.4% in urine samples and 92.5% in meatal swabs.

The cobas TV/MG is a suitable diagnostic test for the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis, which could support public health efforts toward infection control and complement existing STI programs.

### Sexual risk factors and bacterial vaginosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111G9r63]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between sexual risk factors and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Forty-three studies reported new or multiple sexual partners and condom use relative to prevalent, incident, or reBV. The summary estimate of the relative risk for the association between BV and new or multiple male partners was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–1.8), between BV and any female partners was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–2.3), and between BV and condom use was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.8–0.9). This review is the first to summarize available observational data for BV. It shows that BV is significantly associated with sexual contact with new and multiple male and female partners and that decreasing the number of unprotected sexual encounters may reduce incident and reinfection. Investigation of sexual transmission of BV is limited by the absence of a clear microbiological etiology; however, we have shown that the epidemiological profile of BV is similar to that of established sexually transmitted infections.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112SQVmb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Our findings demonstrate the limited accuracy of clinical diagnosis as an approach for the management of vaginitis caused by bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, or T. vaginalis, compared with the vaginal assay panel among women with symptoms of vaginitis seen in clinical settings. Consistent with the results here, Schwebke et al. previously demonstrated that the vaginal panel assay had better sensitivity (using a laboratory reference standard) than clinical diagnosis for all three causes of vaginitis.

We observed that 65%, 44%, and 56% of individuals with vaginal assay-positive, clinical diagnosis-negative results for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis, respectively, went untreated. Conversely, those women who were negative for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis by assay testing were still treated according to clinical diagnosis 15%, 17%, and less than 1% of the time.

Previously, Hillier et al. demonstrated that almost half of the women with a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received at least one inappropriate treatment. Return visits based on persistent vaginitis symptoms were common in that study, occurring in 35%, 17%, and 42% of cases associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis, respectively.

We found a significant difference in the paired proportions between the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the vaginal panel assay. Although Amsel's criteria represent the primary in-

### An updated conceptual model on the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^1144WFg8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge. It is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The epidemiology of BV supports sexual transmission. However, its etiology remains unknown.

At the center of the debate is whether BV is caused by a primary pathogen or a polymicrobial consortium of microorganisms that are sexually transmitted. We previously published a conceptual model hypothesizing that BV is initiated by sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis. Critics of this model have stated that G. vaginalis is found in virginal women and in sexually active women with a normal vaginal microbiota. In addition, colonization does not always lead to BV. However, recent advances in BV pathogenesis research have determined the existence of 13 different species within the genus Gardnerella. It may be that healthy women are colonized by nonpathogenic Gardnerella species, whereas virulent strains are involved in BV development.

Based on our results from a recent prospective study, in addition to an extensive literature review, we present an updated conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV that centers on the roles of virulent strains of G. vaginalis, as well as Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae.

### Effects of bacterial vaginosis and other genital infections on the natural history of human papillomavirus infection in HIV-1-infected and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected women [^117SGcz3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Whether the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is affected by bacterial vaginosis (BV) or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection has not been adequately investigated in prospective studies.

- **Methods**: Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected (n = 1763) and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected (n = 493) women were assessed semiannually for BV (by Nugent's criteria), TV infection (by wet mount), type-specific HPV (by polymerase chain reaction with MY09/MY11/HMB01 HPV primers), and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) (by cytological examination). Sexual history was obtained from patient reports at each visit. Risk factors for prevalent and incident HPV infection and SIL were evaluated by use of multivariate models.

- **Results**: BV was associated with both prevalent and incident HPV infection but not with the duration of HPV infection or incidence of SIL. TV infection was associated with incident HPV infection and with decreased duration and lower prevalence of HPV infection. TV infection had no association with the development of SIL. Effects of BV and TV infection were similar in HIV-1-infected and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected women. HIV-1 infection and low CD4(+) lymphocyte count were strongly associated with HPV infection and the development of SIL.

- **Conclusions**: BV and TV infection may increase the risk of acquisition (or reactivation) of HPV infection, as is consistent with hypotheses that the local cervicovaginal milieu plays a role in susceptibility to HPV infection. The finding that BV did not affect the persistence of HPV infection and that TV infection may shorten the duration is noteworthy.

### Clinical and laboratory testing for Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^111ZyVe6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is highly prevalent in the United States and worldwide. Traditional clinical diagnostic methods fail to identify more than half of these infections, which, if left untreated, can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and an exacerbated risk of both acquisition and transmission of HIV. Women bear a disproportionate amount of the burden of these infections, and testing among populations at risk for this disease should be provided. Molecular technologies have expanded our capacity for laboratory-based detection of infection and can be used on samples already being collected for chlamydia/gonorrhea screening.

### Molecular diagnosis of vaginitis: Comparing quantitative PCR and microbiome profiling approaches to current microscopy scoring [^112PDTTu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is often diagnosed by microscopy and is typically limited to testing for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Approximately 10% of vaginal swabs are negative but designated as "altered flora" by the BV Nugent score, leaving clinicians unsure of how to treat patients. Accurate and comprehensive vaginitis diagnostics are needed to direct treatment and reduce the risks of recurrent or more severe infections.

Vaginal swabs were collected from 93 women (mean age, 23.53 years; range, 18 to 42 years) in a cross-sectional study. Microscopy results for BV and Candida were compared to those from two molecular approaches:

- **Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay**: A comprehensive qPCR assay tested for aerobic vaginitis (AV), Candida, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and BV (Applied Biosystems) with an accompanying BV interpretive algorithm (Coriell Life Sciences).
- **Microbiome profiling of the 16S rRNA gene**: This method utilized Illumina technology.

Microscopy plus the BV Nugent score had a 76% overall agreement with the qPCR plus BV interpretive algorithm method (24 positive, 47 negative). Of the nine samples designated as altered flora by Nugent, five were categorized as BV positive and four as BV negative by the qPCR method. Although BV negative, three out of four of the latter samples had positive AV targets, with one also testing positive for STI. Microscopic identification of Candida versus that by qPCR had a 94% agreement (9 positive, 78 negative).

The comprehensive qPCR assay revealed alternative etiologies summarized as follows: 38% BV, 10% AV, 5% Candida, 2% STI, and 10% mixed infections (positive targets in multiple panels).

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Recent advances have furthered understanding of their pathophysiology. Proper diagnosis, based on appropriate office and, in complicated cases, laboratory tests, is the key to the rational selection of therapy. For women who have routine, uncomplicated episodes of VVC or BV, a variety of effective treatment options exist. Recurrence remains a challenge for these conditions, but it can often be managed successfully.

### Management of women with cervicitis [^1168x6dP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In the past several years, the collective understanding of cervicitis has extended beyond the recognition of *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* as the prime etiologic suspects. *Trichomonas vaginalis* and herpes simplex virus cause cervicitis, and both *Mycoplasma genitalium* and bacterial vaginosis have emerged as new candidate etiologic agents or conditions. However, major gaps in our knowledge of this common condition remain. Putative etiologic agents have not been identified in many women with cervicitis. Moreover, cervicitis occurs in a relatively small proportion of women with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Finally, scant research has addressed the clinical response of nonchlamydial and nongonococcal cervicitis to antibiotic therapy, and there are no data on the benefit of sex partner treatment for such women. New research into the etiology, immunology, and natural history of this common condition is needed, especially in view of the well-established links between cervicitis and an increased risk of upper genital tract infection and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 acquisition.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^113kdF5a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

The prevalence of each sexually transmitted infection (STI) was categorized by consensus Nugent score (cNS). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) prevalence was relatively invariant across cNS categories. In contrast, the mean Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) prevalence in cNS categories 6–10 (3.06%) was approximately twice that of cNS categories 0–5 (1.4%). Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infection prevalence values were higher in all cNS categories compared to CT and NG. However, both STIs had similar comparative prevalence ratios to CT between cNS 6–10 and 0–5 (MG: 10.7% vs. 6.1%, 1.8-fold; TV: 14.5% vs. 7.0%, 2.1-fold).

A variety of factors including patient demographic status, STI infection status, age range, cNS, modified Amsel criteria status, and presence of vaginal symptoms were assessed in relation to the occurrence of patient-reported recurrent vaginitis or vaginosis in the past 12 months. Among these factors, only White Hispanic/Latina women showed a modest but significant elevated risk of vaginitis recurrence during this period (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.0619–1.3188, P = 0.0023).

### Findings associated with recurrence of bacterial vaginosis among adolescents attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics [^112X8hBK]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common infection and has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and acquisition of HIV. There are limited data on recurrent BV (reBV) in adolescents. A relationship between the frequency of BV recurrence and specific risk factors might shed light on the pathophysiology of BV and lead to targeted interventions.

- **Study design**: Record-based historical clinic study.
- **Setting**: Adolescent visits to two sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics between 1990 and 2002.
- **Participants**: 254 girls who had ≥ 2 episodes of BV and at least 3 clinical visits, matched on clinic attendance frequency to 254 girls with only 1 documented BV episode and 254 girls with no history of BV.
- **Main outcome measure**: Risk factor differences between groups.
- **Analysis**: Multinomial logistic regression with a robust estimator of the standard errors, accounting for repeated measures.

Results show that out of 5,977 adolescent girls who visited the clinics, 1,509 (25%) had at least one episode of BV; of those, 303 (19.9%) experienced 2 or more BV episodes. Girls with a history of 1 BV episode and girls with a history of 2 or more BV episodes were more likely to be infected with Trichomonas vaginalis [OR 1.77, 95% CI: 1.17–2.67; OR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.05–2.34], and be diagnosed with PID [OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.02–2.22; OR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.41–2.98] compared to girls with no BV history, respectively. Girls with a history of BV were also more likely to report active oral sex and lack of contraceptive use.

### Validity of the Papanicolaou smear in the diagnosis of Candida spp. Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis [^111FNs2x]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the validity of the Papanicolaou smear in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Candida spp., we assessed its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) in 824 symptomatic patients. We compared Pap smear diagnoses with those obtained by standard microscopic examination and Gram stain of the exudate.

- **Results**: The sensitivity of the Pap smear for Candida spp. was 31%, for bacterial vaginosis (BV) it was 57%, and for T. vaginalis, it was 51%. The specificity was 98.5% for Candida, 94% for BV, and 97% for T. vaginalis. The PPV was 85% for Candida, 70% for BV, and 57% for T. vaginalis. The NPV was 84% for Candida, 90% for BV, and 97% for T. vaginalis.

- **Conclusion**: The sensitivity of Pap smears for Candida spp. BV, and T. vaginalis is inadequate for screening. However, Pap smears that are positive for T. vaginalis could be used to complement the diagnosis.

### Global epidemiology and control of Trichomonas vaginalis [^114CsSwq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection. Despite a number of serious health consequences, including facilitation of HIV transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, it remains an under-recognized condition. This review aims to update the reader on the global epidemiology and control of T. vaginalis.

- **Recent findings**: The burden of T. vaginalis infection is found in resource-limited settings and high-risk groups in industrialized settings. Utilization of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics has enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology of T. vaginalis both at the population level and in sexual partners. High rates of asymptomatic infection in male partners of infected females and subsequent re-infection have significant implications for control programmes. Further studies investigating the role of T. vaginalis in facilitating HIV transmission have highlighted its significance and the need to develop and implement control interventions.

- **Summary**: Future research to develop cheap, point-of-care diagnostic tests will allow a greater understanding of T. vaginalis epidemiology. In addition, the effect of treatment on the outcome of pregnancy and HIV acquisition requires further study. This will, in turn, facilitate operational studies evaluating optimal control strategies and their impact on the complications of T. vaginalis.

### When is it a sexually transmitted infection? Intimate contact transmission of pathogens not traditionally defined as STIs [^111s7QoH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Several microorganisms, which are not traditionally considered sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are capable of sexual transmission and have the potential to cause global outbreaks. The aim of this review is to describe pathogens not traditionally defined as STIs, provide insight into potential outbreaks, and call for clinical vigilance among members of key populations.

- **Recent findings**: Recent findings emphasize that several pathogens, not traditionally classified as STIs, can be sexually transmissible. These include the mpox virus, enteric infections such as Shigella spp., dermatophytes such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, ectoparasites, and atypical bacterial genito-urinary infections such as Neisseria meningitidis. The internationally reported outbreaks and the reports on potential sexual transmission of these pathogens underline the emerging risks, highlighting the need for a broader STI definition and the importance of vigilant public health control strategies.

- **Summary**: These findings suggest that clinical practice should broaden STI testing and awareness to include pathogens not traditionally considered sexually transmissible, particularly among key populations. Clinicians must be vigilant for atypical presentations, ensuring comprehensive sexual healthcare and diagnostic testing. The development of targeted preventive efforts and continuous surveillance to detect and manage emerging sexually transmissible infections is paramount.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^1155Ubo4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Significant increases in rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV), *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG), and *Mycoplasma genitalium* (MG) are occurring in the United States. We present results of a U.S. study examining the intersection of STIs and vaginitis. Among 1,051 women diagnosed for the presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), 195 (18.5%) had one or more STIs, including 101 (9.6%) with TV, 24 (2.3%) with CT, 9 (0.8%) with NG, and 93 (8.8%) with MG.

STI prevalence in BV-positive women was 26.3% (136/518), significantly higher than the STI prevalence of 12.5% (59/474) in BV-negative women (P < 0.0002). Unlike infections with CT or NG, solo infections of MG or TV were significantly associated with a diagnosis of BV-positive/VVC-negative (OR 3.0751; 95% CI 1.5797–5.9858, P = 0.0113, and OR 2.873; 95% CI 1.5687–5.2619, P = 0.0017, respectively) and with mixed infections containing MG and TV (OR 3.4886; 95% CI 1.8901–6.439, P = 0.0042, and OR 3.1858; 95% CI 1.809–5.6103, P = 0.0014, respectively).

TV and MG infection rates were higher in all Nugent score (NS) categories than CT and NG infection rates; however, both STIs had similar comparative prevalence ratios to CT in NS 6–10 vs NS 0–5 (CT: 3.06% vs 1.4%, 2.2-fold; MG: 10.7% vs 6.1%, 1.8-fold; TV: 14.5% vs 7.0%, 2.1-fold). NG prevalence was relatively invariant by the NS category. These results highlight the complexity of associations of STIs with two major causes of vaginitis.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^1148douX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Diagnosis has historically relied on either microscopic analysis or culture, the latter being the previous gold standard. However, these tests are not readily available for male diagnosis, generally only perform well for symptomatic women, and are not as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Men are largely asymptomatic but carry the organism and transmit to their sexual partners.

This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the performance of the cobas T. vaginalis/Mycoplasma genitalium (TV/MG) assay for detection of T. vaginalis DNA compared with patient infection status (PIS) defined by a combination of commercially available NAATs and culture using urogenital specimens. A total of 2,064 subjects (984 men and 1,080 women, 940 [45.5%] symptomatic, 1,124 [54.5%] asymptomatic) were evaluable. In women, sensitivity ranged from 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.8 to 99.9%) using vaginal samples to 94.7% (95% CI 90.2 to 97.2%) in PreservCyt samples. Specificity ranged from 98.9 to 96.8% (95% CI 95.4 to 97.8%). In men, the cobas TV/MG assay was 100% sensitive for the detection of T. vaginalis in both male urine samples and meatal swabs, with specificity of 98.4% in urine samples and 92.5% in meatal swabs.

The cobas TV/MG is a suitable diagnostic test for the detection of T. vaginalis, which could support public health efforts toward infection control and complement existing STI programs.

### Vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk for incident bacterial vaginosis in a population of women who have sex with men [^1172dPuf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other sequelae. It is characterized by a shift in the vaginal bacterial biota from one composed largely of Lactobacillus species to a microbiota with diverse anaerobic and facultative bacteria, here designated BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). It remains unclear how BVAB are acquired in the vagina and from what source. There is ongoing debate as to whether BV is a sexually transmitted infection with acquisition of BVAB from sexual partners, reflects vaginal inoculation from endogenous reservoirs in women, both, or some other process.

A previous study in a cohort of women who have sex with women (WSW) demonstrated that colonization of extra-vaginal reservoirs with certain BVAB was associated with increased risk for incident BV. However, different sexual practices and exposures in women who have sex with men (WSM) could lead to different patterns of vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization that impact BV risk. We sought to examine the link between vaginal or extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk of incident BV in a second cohort focusing on WSM to assess generalizability of these findings.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to detect bacterial colonization in the mouth, anus, vagina, and external genitalia (labia) of women who did not have BV at the time of initial sampling; women were observed prospectively to assess the subsequent incidence of BV.

### Trichomonas vaginalis is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^1158oAgo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We assessed the association between the causative agents of vaginal discharge and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) among women attending a rural sexually transmitted disease clinic in South Africa; the role played by coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was studied. Vaginal and cervical specimens were obtained to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis. HIV-1 infection was established by use of serum antibody tests.

A total of 696 women with vaginal discharge were recruited, 119 of whom had clinical PID. Patients with trichomoniasis had a significantly higher risk of PID than did women without trichomoniasis (P = .03). PID was not associated with any of the other pathogens.

When the patients were stratified according to HIV-1 status, the risk of PID in HIV-1-infected patients with T. vaginalis increased significantly (P = .002); no association was found in patients without HIV-1. T. vaginalis infection of the lower genital tract is associated with a clinical diagnosis of PID in HIV-1-infected women.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis in men [^114yCFTN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men have traditionally been considered benign and, consequently, have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and an amplified risk of human immunodeficiency virus. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed; yet, the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by a lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from January 9, 2004, through September 24, 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts. This article describes advances in TV diagnostics, which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of reTV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^114U3yGt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are a leading cause of primary care visits for women. Individuals exhibiting symptoms often receive laboratory testing based on clinic-specific standards of care. Thus, women seen at a family practice clinic might only receive a vaginitis workup, whereas those seen at a sexually transmitted diseases clinic could be more likely to receive only sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.

The likelihood of STIs was assessed in women from whom samples were tested for vaginitis using a molecular diagnostic assay. Positivity rates for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis DNA, detected using the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay, were calculated. Concordance between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay for detection of T. vaginalis was determined.

Women with bacterial vaginosis alone or with concomitant Candida spp. infections had high rates of coinfection with sexually transmitted infections (24.4%–25.7%); samples from women who were negative for vaginitis had significantly lower positivity rates (7.9%; P < 0.001). Trichomonas vaginalis results were concordant between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay in 559 of 560 samples tested.

These data suggest, as have other studies, that women with vaginitis symptoms may be at risk for an STI. Molecular testing could provide broad diagnostic coverage for symptomatic women and improve patient management, regardless of the type of clinic in which patients are treated.

### Assessment of syndromic management of curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections among pregnant women: an observational cross-sectional study [^114rZJZp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections (STIs/RTIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and syphilis are significant causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) increases the odds of preterm birth four-fold and more than doubles the risk of premature rupture of membranes, as well as delivering a newborn who is low birthweight or small-for-gestational-age. Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) is associated with a three-fold increase in preterm birth. Trichomoniasis (Trichomonas vaginalis), the most prevalent curable STI globally, increases the odds of preterm delivery by 1.5 times. Bacterial vaginosis, the most common urogenital disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide, increases the odds of preterm delivery two-fold. Both bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis double the odds of delivering a low birthweight child. Syphilis (Treponema pallidum) is associated with four out of every ten spontaneous abortions and one-quarter of stillbirths. Pregnant women with curable STIs are at an elevated risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy, whereas HIV-infected pregnant women with curable STIs at delivery are at an increased risk of giving birth to an HIV-infected infant.

To reduce the burden of congenital syphilis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal screening of pregnant women at antenatal care (ANC) booking and the provision of 2.4 MU benzathine penicillin G to individuals who test positive.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: Implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113uUFua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from three public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

- **Results**: We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners (95% confidence interval, 66.0%-77.3%), of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI.

### The interplay of host immunity, environment and the risk of bacterial vaginosis and associated reproductive health outcomes [^1134oJFr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most common causes of vaginal symptoms in US women, but its causal mechanism has not yet been defined. BV is more prevalent in women who are immunosuppressed, and several risk factors for the development of BV are associated with lower quantities of immune mediators in vaginal fluid. In contrast, the poor reproductive health outcomes associated with BV, such as preterm birth and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 acquisition, are associated with increased levels of proinflammatory immune mediators in the genital tract. In this article, we discuss how variations in the host immune profile and environmental effects on host immunity may influence the risk of BV, as well as the risk of complications associated with BV.

### Reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis [^1151hDg8]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases.

We found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases.

Unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid.

In organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with Lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mRNA. However, a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. When the two bacteria were combined, Gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of Lactobacillus jensenii.

The loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.

### Identifying a consensus sample type to test for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus [^117HQSQo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global cause of acute illness. Early detection plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission and preventing complications. However, the accessibility of STI testing is limited by the lack of an overall preferred sample type. Through a prospective study in female sex workers (FSW), we compared the sensitivity of samples from different anatomical sites in detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, we documented the prevalence of each STI in this high-risk population.

- **Methods**: We selected 303 FSW and tested them for each STI using nucleic acid amplification testing on two vaginal and cervical swabs from different manufacturers, a cervical smear, and first-void urine. The sensitivity of each sample type was compared for each infectious agent to identify a consensus sample type.

- **Results**: Vaginal swabs were superior to all other sample types, with an overall sensitivity of 86%. The sensitivity was the lowest for first-void urine, detecting only 63% of positive cases. The prevalence was 3.3% (10/299) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 9.0% (27/299) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 7.4% (22/298) for Trichomonas vaginalis, 10.8% (32/296) for Mycoplasma genitalium, and 55.6% (158/284) for human papillomavirus.

- **Conclusions**: When testing for STIs, vaginal swabs are the sample of choice, and first-void urine should be avoided. Designating (self-sampled) vaginal swabs as a consensus sample type enables the harmonization of STI testing and extension.
