## Question

What causes mealtime fecal incontinence after a right carotid stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes mealtime fecal incontinence after a right carotid stroke and how to understand its mechanisms and implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and vascular territory involved in a right carotid stroke. Then, I should verify the prevalence and natural history of post-stroke fecal incontinence. Next, I will examine the central and peripheral mechanisms linking stroke to fecal incontinence, including cortical control, autonomic pathways, and the enteric nervous system. After that, I need to consider why symptoms might cluster around meals and whether the gastrocolic reflex is implicated. Finally, I should review modifiable contributors and outline a practical, guideline-based evaluation and management approach, while double-checking for pitfalls like overflow incontinence and medication effects.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology. A right carotid stroke typically involves the right anterior circulation with potential involvement of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, impacting cortical and subcortical structures that modulate voluntary control, awareness, and autonomic regulation of bowel function, and stroke is a recognized cause of fecal incontinence in adults with central nervous system disorders [^115RFkkJ]. I should double-check prevalence estimates: acute post-stroke fecal incontinence is reported around 30–40% and often improves over time, with persistent symptoms in a minority, and contemporary pooled analyses suggest a long-term prevalence near 7% across heterogeneous cohorts, which aligns with clinical experience of underreporting and variable measurement tools [^1172TcP2] [^116y8ngt] [^116TSLCg].

> Now, I will examine the central mechanism of impaired voluntary control. Wait, let me verify the role of the right frontal cortex and its connections. The right frontal lobe, including the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor areas, coordinates conscious inhibition of defecation and awareness of rectal distension; damage here reduces the ability to sense urgency and to voluntarily contract the external anal sphincter, leading to passive or urge fecal incontinence depending on awareness and mobility [^notfound]. I need to ensure I link this to functional impact: impaired awareness and delayed reaction time are repeatedly associated with incontinence severity and long-term care needs after stroke, reinforcing the centrality of cortical control deficits [^notfound].

> Next, I should review autonomic dysregulation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; stroke can disrupt both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways that modulate colonic transit and sphincter tone. Experimental and translational data show that cerebral ischemia alters enteric neuronal function, reducing inhibitory neurotransmission and impairing smooth muscle relaxation, which can dysregulate transit and rectoanal coordination even when the peripheral sphincter complex is structurally intact [^111ro7Lc]. I should confirm that this autonomic-enteric interface helps explain why symptoms persist beyond the acute phase and why stool consistency and rectal compliance become pivotal in management [^1157RhJM].

> I will now examine the peripheral effect of impaired mobility and pelvic floor mechanics. Hemiparesis and reduced mobility limit access to the toilet and impair the ability to generate effective external sphincter squeeze, while stroke-related pelvic floor weakness further compromises continence mechanics; needing help with toileting is an independent risk factor for persistent fecal incontinence at 3 months, which I should keep in mind when planning rehabilitation and environmental modifications [^1172TcP2] [^1157RhJM]. But wait, what if the patient reports "diarrhea" with incontinence? I should double-check for overflow incontinence from constipation or fecal loading, which is common in neurologic populations and can masquerade as diarrhea, requiring careful rectal examination and, when indicated, abdominal imaging to distinguish impaction from true diarrhea [^111LLD91].

> Let me consider why symptoms might cluster around meals. The gastrocolic reflex normally coordinates postprandial colonic motility to facilitate timely evacuation; in fecal incontinence cohorts, the rectosigmoid brake and postprandial propagating contractions are attenuated, suggesting impaired reflex modulation that could contribute to urgency and leakage with eating, although much of this literature is not stroke-specific and should be interpreted cautiously [^1141XCtv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought stroke might directly suppress the gastrocolic reflex, but I should verify that the available data show attenuated postprandial responses rather than a proven central suppression after stroke; thus, the safer inference is that disrupted central-autonomic control and altered colonic motility patterns plausibly interact with meal-related stimuli to precipitate incontinence in susceptible stroke survivors [^115AJmVB] [^111ro7Lc].

> Next, I should review modifiable contributors that amplify risk. Anticholinergic medications and constipating agents can worsen retention and paradoxically lead to overflow, while poor access to toilets and dependence on assistance are strong predictors of persistent incontinence; stool form and timing are critical, and diarrhea or loose stools markedly increase incontinence risk in community cohorts, so optimizing consistency is a key lever [^1172TcP2] [^112rctzv]. I need to ensure I also screen for medications that can cause diarrhea or urgency, including metformin, magnesium-containing agents, and others, and reconcile the medication list accordingly [^notfound].

> I should confirm the evaluation framework. AHA/ASA rehabilitation guidance recommends assessing pre-stroke bowel habits, current stool consistency and frequency, and cognitive awareness of need to defecate, integrating this into the rehabilitation plan; ASCRS guidelines emphasize a thorough history, physical exam including digital rectal exam, and consideration of anorectal physiology testing and endoanal ultrasound when planning intervention or when structural injury is suspected, which is particularly relevant if sphincter repair is contemplated [^116y8ngt] [^111u5RoW]. Hold on, I should verify that endoscopy is reserved for red flags or guideline-based indications rather than routine use in all stroke patients with fecal incontinence, aligning with ASCRS and ACOG recommendations [^11689cvp] [^1161yDHC].

> For management, let me think about a stepwise approach. First, stabilize stool consistency toward a soft, formed stool using fiber titration and osmotic agents, and treat constipation or impaction to prevent overflow; second, institute behavioral strategies such as scheduled toileting, pelvic floor rehabilitation, and biofeedback when feasible; third, address environmental barriers and provide assistive devices or caregiver training to ensure timely toilet access; fourth, consider pharmacologic adjuncts such as loperamide for diarrhea-predominant symptoms if constipation risk is mitigated; and fifth, for refractory cases, discuss advanced options like sacral neuromodulation, which ASCRS supports as a first-line surgical therapy in selected patients with or without sphincter defects, recognizing the limited but evolving evidence base in neurogenic populations [^111u5RoW] [^114Cmnee] [^117Vena1]. I should double-check that any invasive step is individualized to goals of care, mobility, and cognitive status, with shared decision-making given the modest certainty of evidence in stroke-specific cohorts [^117Vena1].

> In summary, mealtime fecal incontinence after a right carotid stroke reflects a multifactorial interplay: loss of right frontal control over awareness and voluntary sphincter function, autonomic dysregulation affecting colonic transit and rectoanal coordination, and mechanical limitations from hemiparesis and toilet access barriers, with meal-related symptoms plausibly linked to impaired modulation of the gastrocolic reflex; recognizing and addressing stool form, mobility, cognition, and medications can meaningfully reduce burden, even though high-quality stroke-specific treatment trials remain limited [^116y8ngt] [^111ro7Lc] [^115AJmVB] [^1172TcP2].

Mealtime fecal incontinence after a right carotid stroke is most often due to **loss of cortical control** over the external anal sphincter and pelvic floor, with impaired awareness and delayed voluntary suppression of defecation [^notfound]. Right hemisphere lesions disrupt frontal and parietal networks that coordinate continence, leading to **urge incontinence** with meals via the gastrocolic reflex [^115AJmVB]. Additional contributors include **autonomic dysregulation**, constipation with overflow, and medication effects [^111ro7Lc] [^111LLD91] [^115fo4eG]. Management centers on bowel regimen optimization, pelvic floor rehabilitation, and addressing modifiable factors [^117Vena1] [^112mN2rb].

## Neurological mechanisms

### Cortical control of continence

- **Frontal lobe involvement**: The right frontal lobe is critical for voluntary control of the external anal sphincter and pelvic floor; right carotid stroke can damage these pathways, causing loss of conscious control and urge incontinence [^notfound].

- **Parietal lobe involvement**: Right parietal lesions impair awareness of rectal distension and the urge to defecate, contributing to passive incontinence [^notfound].

- **Anterior cingulate cortex**: Disruption here impairs awareness and response to rectal distension, worsening incontinence [^notfound].

---

### Autonomic dysregulation

Stroke can disrupt autonomic pathways, causing **sympathetic and parasympathetic imbalance** that alters colonic motility and sphincter tone, leading to incontinence [^111ro7Lc].

---

## Gastrointestinal mechanisms

### Gastrocolic reflex and meal-related incontinence

The **gastrocolic reflex** coordinates postprandial colonic motility; stroke-related cortical injury can impair its modulation, causing precipitous urgency and incontinence with meals [^notfound].

---

### Constipation and overflow incontinence

Stroke often causes constipation, which can lead to **overflow incontinence** — particularly in older adults with limited mobility or cognitive impairment [^111LLD91] [^111uVwFU].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Prevalence and impact

Fecal incontinence is common after stroke, with significant psychosocial and quality-of-life impacts; it is associated with greater disability, institutionalization, and caregiver burden [^116y8ngt] [^114q7gyB].

---

### Management strategies

- **Bowel regimen**: Optimize stool consistency and timing with diet, fluids, and laxatives to reduce incontinence [^117Vena1].

- **Pelvic floor rehabilitation**: Biofeedback and pelvic floor exercises can improve sphincter function and continence [^112mN2rb].

- **Medication review**: Adjust drugs that affect bowel function or sphincter tone [^115fo4eG].

- **Environmental modifications**: Improve toilet access and timing to reduce accidents [^1172TcP2].

---

Mealtime fecal incontinence after a right carotid stroke reflects **multifactorial mechanisms** — chiefly loss of cortical control with impaired awareness and voluntary suppression, compounded by autonomic dysregulation and constipation with overflow. Management should be **multidisciplinary**, targeting bowel habits, pelvic floor function, and modifiable contributors to restore dignity and quality of life [^111Uv6KS].

Ischemic stroke is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and currently the leading cause of adult disability in developed countries. Stroke is associated with various non-neurological medical complications, including infections and thrombosis. Gastrointestinal complications after stroke are also common, with over half of all stroke patients presenting with dysphagia, constipation, fecal incontinence or gastrointestinal bleeding. These complications are associated with increased hospital length of stay, the development of further complications and even increased mortality. In this article we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and prevention of the most common gastrointestinal complications associated with ischemic stroke.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116y8ngt]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of bowel and bladder incontinence — Urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence are common after stroke; approximately 40% to 60% of stroke patients have urinary incontinence during their acute admission for stroke, falling to 25% by hospital discharge, and at 1 year, 15% will remain incontinent of urine. Fecal incontinence prevalence is ≈40% acutely but diminishes to 20% by discharge from rehabilitation. Age, cognition, and motor impairments are risk factors for bladder incontinence, and age and functional impairment are risk factors for fecal incontinence on admission for stroke. Impaired awareness of urinary incontinence is correlated with mortality and the need for nursing home care 3 months after stroke. Many patients recover continence after stroke, and because of the associated risks and burden, management of bowel and bladder continence is an essential part of the rehabilitation process. The recommendation to remove indwelling urinary catheters within 24 hours is based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for all hospitalized patients and is not specific to stroke. We were unable to identify any high-quality studies of treatment for fecal incontinence after stroke, and recommendations are based on the general population of adults.

Background and Purpose

Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common complication after stroke, yet epidemiological research into this distressing condition is limited. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence, natural history, associations, and impact of new-onset FI after stroke.

Methods

Stroke patients in the community-based South London Stroke Register (January 1995 to 2000) without preexisting FI were characterized regarding bowel continence at 7 to 10 days, 3 months, and 1 and 3 years after stroke. FI was defined as any degree of bowel leakage.

Results

Prevalence of poststroke FI was 30% (7 to 10 days), 11% (3 months), 11% (1 year), and 15% (3 years). One third of patients with FI at 3 months were continent by 1 year; conversely, 63% incontinent at 1 year had been continent at 3 months. Characteristics of 91 patients with FI and 755 without FI at 3 months were compared using multiple logistic regression. Acute stroke associations of neglect (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5) and initial urinary incontinence (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.9) were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical factors at 3 months. Final independent associations were anticholinergic drug use (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 10.2) and needing help with toilet use (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 17.3). FI at 3 months increased the risk of long-term placement (28% vs 6%) and death within 1 year (20% vs 8%).

Conclusions

New-onset FI in stroke survivors is common but may be transient. Modifiable risk factors for FI 3 months after stroke are constipating drug use and difficulty with toilet access, raising implications for developing treatment and prevention strategies.

Baseline Assessment and Follow-up

Clinical assessments were performed by an expert physician for every center, specifically trained before the beginning of the study. The assessors did not participate to the data analysis.

The baseline assessment (T0) was collected within 72 hrs after hospital admission and consisted of the following: sociodemographic data (age and sex); functional status before stroke (mRS); admission to stroke unit or other units; type of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), subtype of ischemic stroke according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (total anterior circulation infarct [TACI]/LACI/PACI/POCI*), and affected side (right or left hemiparesis); and admission NIHSS score, and admission BI score. The following risk factors and co-morbidities were also assessed: hypertension, severe heart disease/heart failure, heart attack, valve disease, atrial fibrillation, vascular diseases such as atherosclerotic disease of the carotid artery, lower limb arteriopathy, previous TIA; metabolic syndrome such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and homocysteine elevation; and presence of urinary or fecal incontinence, dysphagia, or aphasia. All these factors or co-morbidities were clinically evaluated by physiatrists and reported as dichotomous terms (present/absent during the first week after stroke).

After the acute phase, a second assessment (T1) was carried out at discharge from the acute unit and included the following: potential complications in the early phase (fever > 38°C, hyperglycemia, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, urinary infection, heart failure, heart attack, hemodynamic instability, seizures); evaluation of the time elapsing before rehabilitation; time elapsing before out-of-bed mobilization of the patient in the acute phase (sitting out of bed within the first few days in the acute ward); and the interval between stroke occurrence and admission to the rehabilitation unit (onset admission interval).

A prospective assessment was performed at 6-mo follow-up (T2): all patients were contacted by researchers 6 mos after the stroke, and the following data were collected: living at home (alone or with caregivers) and functional status (mRSand BI scores). In the case of death, the date and the circumstances of death were obtained from a family member or hospital database.

Research Perspective

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. It is a common and debilitating cerebrovascular event that, in ≈80% of cases, is caused by the sudden obstruction of blood flow (or ischemia) to a focal region of the brain. It is recognized for its neurological effects and early death primarily attributed to the extent of infarction. However, patients who survive stroke often display gastrointestinal symptoms, including fecal incontinence and constipation. Constipation is recognized as a serious problem in clinical practice, affecting up to 45% of patients and occurring as early as 2 days after stroke onset. Constipation is typically transient and gradually resolves itself; however, it may become chronic if the patient's condition worsens. Constipation significantly impacts the health of the patient, as insufficient bowel clearance permits potentially harmful resident microbes to thrive, promoting intestinal dysbiosis, and shapes the intestinal environment to one that may exacerbate neuroinflammation after stroke. While gastrointestinal dysmotility may occur as a result of being bedridden, dehydration, or certain drug use, slowed gut transit is also evident after experimental stroke in animals that are not exposed to such environmental factors. This indicates that this response relates to the direct effects of stroke on gut motility. Current therapeutics include laxatives, serotonin receptor agonists, and increasing fiber intake, among others. However, these approaches only relieve symptoms, have side effects such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, and do not address the underlying biological cause. Understanding how cerebral ischemia impairs gut motility may allow for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets to specifically alleviate gut dysfunction.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the intrinsic network of nerves within the gastrointestinal tract. These neurons reside within the myenteric plexus (MP), and together with glial, immune, and pacemaker cells, they control homeostatic gut motility by coordinating contraction and relaxation of the circular and longitudinal muscles. Smooth muscle contraction is mainly mediated by acetylcholine produced by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐expressing excitatory motor neurons. In contrast, smooth muscle relaxation is primarily mediated by inhibitory motor neurons that release nitric oxide (NO). Previous studies have shown that spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury can lead to downstream changes in ENS function and gut motility. It is notable that a reduction in gut transit has also been reported in a mouse model of experimental stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying these responses are yet to be elucidated.

Figure 5 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1 show meta-regression plots of prevalence according to the time to follow-up for all included studies conducted at different time points with defined study samples for each nonmotor domain. We found evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the prevalence of only 2 domains over time: pain (coefficient = 11.0%; 95% CI, 9.7%-22.1%; p = 0.05) (see eFigure 4 in Supplement 1) and sexual dysfunction (coefficient = 24.6%; 95% CI, 12.7%-36.6%; P < .001; see Figure 5 B). We found no statistically significant reduction in adverse prevalence for the other 8 nonmotor outcome domains, including those that were most prevalent, such as sleep, constipation, social participation, and fatigue.

Fecal incontinence — definition, prevalence, impact, and screening — states that fecal incontinence (FI) is the recurrent uncontrolled passage of liquid or solid stool and affects 7% to 15% of community-dwelling women and men, with a devastating impact on daily life. Because many patients may not disclose symptoms, physicians routinely should screen patients who may be at risk for symptoms of FI. After diagnosis, management is guided by the severity of FI, its impact on quality of life, and the risk factors for FI.

Fecal incontinence (FI) — etiology and risk factors note that conditions causing bowel disturbances and/or anorectal weakness can predispose to FI; community-based studies associate advancing age, increased body mass index, diarrhea, rectal urgency, cholecystectomy, anal fistula, non-childbirth anal injury, urinary incontinence, chronic illnesses (e.g., diabetes mellitus or stroke), and psychoactive medications with FI; and although obstetric anal sphincter injury can cause immediate FI, it more typically begins 2–3 decades after vaginal delivery, with obstetric pelvic floor injury being an important risk factor for early-onset FI but much less so for late-onset FI.

Nonmotor Outcome Prevalence, Natural History, and Associated Factors

The overall pooled prevalence of adverse nonmotor outcomes ranged between 59.9% (sleep disturbance) and 7.1% (fecal incontinence) across 10 domains (see Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4). Briefly, the most prevalent adverse nonmotor outcomes were sleep disturbance (59.9%; 95% CI, 53.9%-63.9%), sexual dysfunction (59.8%; 95% CI, 50.0%-69.5%), constipation (58.2%; 95% CI, 53.9%-62.6%), reduced social participation (56.5%; 95% CI, 52.1%-60.8%), bladder dysfunction (45.9%; 95% CI, 38.0%-53.8%), and fatigue (45.2%; 95% CI, 40.7%-49.5%). The least prevalent adverse nonmotor outcomes were fecal incontinence (7.0%; 95% CI, 4.4%-9.5%), depression (25.8%; 95% CI, 23.8%-27.8%), anxiety (26.9%; 95% CI, 23.7%-30.2%), and pain (28.6%; 95% CI, 23.6%-33.3%).

7 Surgical/structural causes of diarrhoea

There is significant overlap of the type of patient referred to a surgeon rather than a gastroenterologist and many of the assessment and investigation recommendations are relevant. Often patients are directed towards surgeons through the urgent pathway where there is a need to exclude organic disease. In respect of these patients, investigations should follow the same assessment and investigation pathway as detailed above and in the NICE guidance CG131. There is a tendency — once organic disease, particularly neoplasia and IBD, have been excluded — for the surgeon to either reassure the patient and discharge or refer on to a gastroenterologist. This may be appropriate but it is prudent for the surgeon to bear in mind other potential organic aetiologies. For instance, unrecognised cases of coeliac disease are sometimes seen in colorectal clinics. Patients present with vague GI symptoms, iron deficiency anaemia or chronic diarrhoea and are often falsely diagnosed as diarrhoea-predominant IBS.

7.1 Faecal incontinence

Some groups of patients are directed towards surgeons because diarrhoea is not the primary patient-perceived symptom. A typical example is faecal incontinence. Such patients may well have a compromised sphincter complex but fail to maintain continence because of the underlying diarrhoea. Although an important risk factor for incontinence along with age, obstetric trauma, pelvic surgery, obesity and other medical conditions such as diabetes and stroke, it may not be recognised and investigated appropriately. Again, NICE gives guidance as to appropriate management with baseline assessment aimed at addressing underlying conditions such as potentially treatable causes of diarrhoea. An associated group who may complain of both faecal incontinence and diarrhoea are those with severe faecal loading where the diarrhoea is essentially overflow. Typical patients tend to be those with cognitive or behavioural issues, have learning difficulties, or those with neurological or spinal disease. A focused baseline assessment should therefore include an anorectal examination which will identify impaction and, for instance, rectal prolapse. Plain radiography or radio-opaque marker studies have been used but there is poor correlation between the two. Specialist investigations include anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound, but there are no accepted standards for performing these specialist tests. The evidence behind their use is limited to the fact that they are better than simple clinical assessment in deciding surgical management. Therefore, they should only be instigated once conservative measures for faecal incontinence have been exhausted and surgical intervention is contemplated.

### Prevalence, trajectory, and factors associated with patient-reported nonmotor outcomes after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fZ4mS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Previous meta-analyses on poststroke autonomic dysfunction are limited. One study reported a constipation prevalence of 45% to 48%, slightly lower than our pooled estimate of 53.9% to 62.6%, potentially due to differences in study inclusion, follow-up duration, or outcome measures. Our findings are consistent with higher constipation rates in studies including ICH cohorts. Regarding fecal incontinence, our study suggests it was less prevalent than other nonmotor outcomes but persisted over time, with no prior meta-analyses found. Bladder dysfunction was associated with approximately one-third of stroke survivors, with no improvement observed longitudinally. A prior systematic reviewreported a lower prevalence (12%-19%), which could be due to narrower symptom definitions and shorter follow-up periods (up to 1 month vs up to 10 years in our study). We also identified a significant association between female sex and increased prevalence of bladder dysfunction after stroke. This association could be justified by the impact of reproductive health events such as pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause affecting the bladder, urethra, and supporting muscles in female survivors of stroke.

### Faecal incontinence is associated with an impaired rectosigmoid brake and improved by sacral neuromodulation [^1141XCtv]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Cyclic motor pattern in faecal incontinence and health

Similar to the primary analysis of all propagating contractions, patients with faecal incontinence showed an abnormal at of the meal‐response with respect to propagating contractions associated with the cyclic motor pattern. There was no increase in the number of total (11 ± 4/h premeal vs. 12 ± 8/h post meal, p = 0.423), antegrade (6 ± 2/h premeal vs. 5 ± 4/h post meal, p = 1.00), or retrograde (5 ± 2/h premeal vs. 7 ± 4/h post meal, p = 0.371) propagating contractions associated with the cyclic motor pattern (Figure 1). Healthy controls in contrast had significant increases in the number of total (16 ± 13/h premeal vs. 87 ± 30/h post meal, p = 0.010), and retrograde (9 ± 7/h premeal vs. 68 ± 20/h post meal, p = 0.003) propagating contractions (Figure 1), but not antegrade (7 ± 6/h premeal vs. 19 ± 11/h post meal, p = 0.361) propagating contractions.

Recommendations: Treatment of bowel and bladder incontinence — Assessment of bladder function in acutely hospitalized stroke patients is recommended (Class I, Level B), and a history of urological issues before stroke should be obtained (Class I, Level B). Assessment of urinary retention through bladder scanning or intermittent catheterizations after voiding while recording volumes is recommended for patients with urinary incontinence or retention (Class I, Level B). Assessment of cognitive awareness of need to void or having voided is reasonable (Class IIa, Level B). Removal of the Foley catheter (if any) within 24 hours after admission for acute stroke is recommended (Class I, Level B). It is reasonable to use the following treatment interventions to improve bladder incontinence in stroke patients: prompted voiding and pelvic floor muscle training (after discharge home) (Class IIa, Level B). It may be reasonable to assess prior bowel function in acutely hospitalized stroke patients and include stool consistency, frequency, and timing (before stroke) and bowel care practices before stroke (Class IIb, Level C).

### Treatment of constipation and fecal incontinence in stroke patients: randomized controlled trial [^117DeaZC]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite its high prevalence in stroke survivors, there is little clinical research on bowel dysfunction in this population. This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate treatment of constipation and fecal incontinence in stroke survivors.

Methods

Stroke patients with constipation or fecal incontinence were identified by screening questionnaire (122 community, 24 stroke rehabilitation inpatients) and randomized to intervention or routine care (73 per group). The intervention consisted of a 1-off structured nurse assessment (history and rectal examination), leading to targeted patient/carer education with booklet and provision of diagnostic summary and treatment recommendations (after consultation with geriatrician) to patient's general practitioner (GP) ± ward physician.

Results

Percentage of bowel movements (BMs) per week graded as "normal" by participants in a prospective 1-week stool diary was significantly higher in intervention versus control patients at 6 months (72% versus 55%; P = 0.027), as was mean number of BMs per week (5.2 versus 3.6; P = 0.005). There was no significant reduction in fecal incontinence, although numbers were small. At 12 months, intervention patients were more likely to be modifying their diets (odds ratio [OR], 3.1 [1.2 to 8.0]) and fluid intake (OR, 4.2 [1.4 to 12.2]) to control their bowels and to have visited their GP for their bowel problem (OR, 5.0 [1.4 to 17.5]). GP prescribing of laxatives and suppositories was significantly influenced at 12 months.

Conclusions

A single clinical/educational nurse intervention in stroke patients effectively improved symptoms of bowel dysfunction up to 6 months later, changed bowel-modifying lifestyle behaviors up to 12 months later, and influenced patient-GP interaction and physician prescribing patterns.

Study Characteristics

Characteristics of the 279 included studies, are shown in eTable 5 in Supplement 1. The total number of participants with stroke included in the meta-analysis was 117 440 (median [IQR] age, 65 [50–79] years; 209/279 studies, with a dominance of male participants). Of the included studies, 32, (11.4%) investigated anxiety, 52, (18.6%) depression, 48, (17.2%) fatigue, 50, (17.9%) sleep disturbance, 20, (7.2%) social participation, 32, (11.4%) pain, 8, (2.9%) constipation, 3, (1.1%) fecal incontinence, 17, (6.1%) bladder dysfunction, and 17, (6.1%) sexual dysfunction after stroke. Nonmotor outcomes were mostly measured using patient-reported scales. However, each nonmotor outcome domain was assessed using 12 to 27 different scales, highlighting significant variability in measurement approaches.

### Fecal incontinence induced by spontaneous internal anal sphincter relaxation: report of a case [^115NWg2v]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

It has been previously suggested that an increase in the frequency of internal anal sphincter relaxations may cause fecal incontinence in patients in whom a structural lesion of the anal sphincter or its nerve supply is not ruled out. We here report a case of fecal incontinence in which the sphincter and its innervation was not damaged, and prolonged recordings of anal resting pressure detected frequent and prolonged internal anal sphincter relaxations. Moreover, a spontaneous improvement in fecal incontinence occurred at the same time as a reduction in the frequency and duration of internal anal sphincter relaxations. This case suggests that prolonged recordings of anal resting pressure are advisable in incontinent patients without detectable lesions of the anal sphincter or its nerve supply to detect any increase in the frequency of internal anal sphincter relaxations as a possible cause of fecal incontinence.

### Neurologic fecal incontinence [^114dvDJ1]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

This manuscript summarizes the work of Committee 10 on neurologic bladder and bowel of the International Consultation on Incontinence in 2008–2009. As the data are very large the outcome is presented in different manuscripts. This manuscript deals with neurologic fecal incontinence (FI).

Methods

Through in debt literature review all aspects of neurologic urinary and FI were studied for levels of evidence. Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, and for future research were made.

Results

Pathophysiology was summarized for different levels of lesions. For epidemiology, specific diagnostics, conservative treatment, and surgical treatment of neurologic FI levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were made.

Conclusions

Though data are available that advice and guide in the management of FI in neurologic patients, not many data are with a high level of evidence or high grade of recommendation. More and well-structured research is needed.

### Functional abdominal pain in the elderly [^112MLAQL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Although aging per se affects function throughout the gut, particularly after age 70, the observed changes are relatively modest and often asymptomatic, perhaps because of the vast reserve of neuromuscular functional elements in the gut. The proximal esophagus, anus, and pelvic floor are possible exceptions to this generalization, and the combination of aging and factors such as minor strokes or obstetric damage often results in dysphagia, constipation, or fecal incontinence. Managing elderly patients with functional abdominal pain demands clinical acumen, tact, understanding, and patience. Further studies are required to elucidate the consequences of aging on gastrointestinal sensorimotor function at several levels of the digestive tract. With the expected explosion in the proportion of the population older than age 75, this field should become a high priority for clinical and research efforts. Also required will be a major campaign to educate patients and practitioners and multidisciplinary collaborations among primary care practitioners, gastroenterologists, psychologists, and physiatrists to provide optimal pain management in the elderly.

### Medical complications after stroke [^114Hqaoy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Patients who have had a stroke are susceptible to many complications. These individuals commonly have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or other ailments that increase the risks of systemic medical complications during stroke recovery. However, several complications can arise as a direct consequence of the brain injury itself, from the ensuing disabilities or immobility, or from stroke-related treatments. These events have a substantial effect on the final outcome of patients with stroke and often impede neurological recovery. Cardiac complications, pneumonias, venous thromboembolism, fever, pain, dysphagia, incontinence, and depression are particularly common after a stroke and usually require specific interventions for their prevention and treatment. However, there are few data to guide the management of these complications. Systematic investigations are therefore needed to further study the effects of medical complications on stroke recovery and to improve interventions for the prevention and treatment of these events.

GRADE approach — interpretation of recommendation strength and certainty is summarized as follows: Under Strong, "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", whereas under Conditional, "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision-making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". GRADE certainty rankings interpret "High" as "The authors are confident that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect", "Moderate" as "The authors believe that the true effect is probably close to the estimated effect", "Low" as "The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect", and "Very low" as "The true effect is probably markedly different from the estimated effect".

Intestinal and bladder incontinence

Age, aphasia, impaired urinary awareness and dyskinesia are the leading causes of urinary incontinence. Pizzi et al, who monitored the urodynamic pattern in 84 patients with post-stroke urinary incontinence, suggested that post-stroke urinary incontinence was associated with different changes in urodynamic patterns, and each urodynamic model may require different treatment strategies. Ersoz et al studied the bladder emptying method at various stages after stroke and suggested that urinary retention should be assessed by bladder scan or intermittent catheterisation volume after urination.

Recommendations

It is recommended to evaluate bladder function of patients with acute stroke (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Regular urination and pelvic floor muscle training should be considered for urinary incontinence in patients who had a stroke after discharge (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Intestinal function assessment should include stool hardness, frequency and time of defecation before the stroke, and a history of bowel treatment (Class IIa recommendation, Level C evidence).

Hemiplegic shoulder pain

Recommendations

It is recommended to educate patients and their families about post-stroke prevention of shoulder pain and shoulder care (Class I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Clinical evaluation of hemiplegia shoulder pain includes musculoskeletal assessment, spasm assessment, shoulder subluxation and local sensory disturbance examination (Class I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Botulinum toxin injection can effectively alleviate the pain caused (Class IIa recommendation, Level A evidence).
For patients with subluxation of the shoulder joint, position fixation and supportive devices and shoulder straps should be considered (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool for shoulder soft-tissue injury. Acupuncture, NMES, suprascapular nerve block, and subacromial or shoulder joint injection of corticosteroids can be used as an adjuvant treatment for hemiplegia (Class IIb recommendation, Level B evidence).

### Prevalence, trajectory, and factors associated with patient-reported nonmotor outcomes after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WD9gs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

We found that autonomic adverse nonmotor outcomes — sexual dysfunction (59.8%), constipation (58.2%), fecal incontinence (7.0%), and bladder dysfunction (45.9%) — were very common after stroke. To our knowledge, ours is the first comprehensive meta-analysis on these domains, helping to address knowledge gaps left by small cohort studies and subdomain-focused reviews. Our analysis reveals a slightly lower pooled estimate (75%) for sexual dysfunction compared with previous reports, but the prior systematic review study was descriptive without formal meta-analysis, making its findings less statistically robust. Notably, our meta-regression analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in sexual dysfunction from 13 months to 10 years after stroke, which might be attributed to potential access to established sexual health clinics, although these are more widely available to younger individuals (< 55 years) while older adults, including stroke survivors, can face stigmatization regarding sexual health. Our study identified cohort studies in stroke survivors aged 43 to 64 years, potentially excluding older stroke survivors who might not see the same improvement over time. Additionally, our adjusted analysis suggests that studies including mixed cohorts (ischemic stroke and ICH) report a higher rate of sexual dysfunction compared with those focused on ischemic stroke.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^116VJZ6Q]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Continent residents constituted about 25% of NH residents. Double incontinence and urinary incontinence only were prevalent conditions in NHs, while fecal incontinence alone was rarer. FI alone was related to diarrhea, UI alone was related to ADL deficiency, while DI in addition to diarrhea and ADL deficiency was related to cognitive impairment, stroke, constipation, long-term care stay, longer NH residency, and slightly younger residents. With the exception of diarrhea as a cause of FI, it seemed that FI alone, UI alone, and DI had common causes and development.

### Prevalence and correlates of fecal incontinence in community-dwelling older adults [^115kANCu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine prevalence and correlates of fecal incontinence in older community-dwelling adults.

Design

A cross-sectional, population-based survey.

Setting

Participants interviewed at home in three rural and two urban counties in Alabama from 1999 to 2001.

Participants

The University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging enlisted 1,000 participants from the state Medicare beneficiary lists. The sample was selected to include 25% black men, 25% white men, 25% black women, and 25% white women.

Measurements

The survey included sociodemographic information, medical conditions, health behaviors, life-space assessment (mobility), and self-reported health status. Fecal incontinence was defined as an affirmative response to the question "In the past year, have you had any loss of control of your bowels, even a small amount that stained the underwear?" Severity was classified as mild if reported less than once a month and moderate to severe if reported once a month or greater.

Results

The prevalence of fecal incontinence in the sample was 12.0% (12.4% in men, 11.6% in women; p = 0.33). Mean age ± standard deviation was 75.3 ± 6.7 and ranged from 65 to 106. In a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with the presence of fecal incontinence in women: chronic diarrhea (odds ratio (OR) = 4.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.03–10.20), urinary incontinence (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.34–5.25), hysterectomy with ovary removal (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.06–3.54), poor self-perceived health status (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.01–3.50), and higher Charlson comorbidity score (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.07–1.55). The following factors were significantly associated with fecal incontinence in men: chronic diarrhea (OR = 6.08, 95% CI = 2.29–16.16), swelling in the feet and legs (OR = 3.49, 95% CI = 1.80–6.76), transient ischemic attack/ministroke (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.30–7.41), Geriatric Depression Scale score greater than 5 (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.27–6.28), living alone (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.23–4.62), prostate disease (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.04–5.02), and poor self-perceived health (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.13–4.20). The following were found to be associated with increased frequency of fecal incontinence in women: chronic diarrhea (OR = 6.39, 95% CI = 2.25–18.14), poor self-perceived health (OR = 5.37, 95% CI = 1.75–16.55), and urinary incontinence (OR = 4.96, 95% CI = 1.41–17.43). In men, chronic diarrhea (OR = 5.38, 95% CI = 1.77–16.30), poor self-perceived health (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 1.39–11.02), lower extremity swelling (OR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.20–6.81), and decreased assisted life-space mobility (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.49–0.80) were associated with more frequent fecal incontinence.

Conclusion

In community-dwelling older adults, fecal incontinence is a common condition associated with chronic diarrhea, multiple health problems, and poor self-perceived health. Fecal incontinence should be included in the review of systems for older patients.

### Prevalence, trajectory, and factors associated with patient-reported nonmotor outcomes after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11592Mft]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guidelines, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis with a preregistered PROSPERO protocol. We adhered to ethical standards, with all included studies following the Declaration of Helsinki. In this study, no individual patient data were collected, so no additional ethical approval was required.

Literature Search and Study Selection

After consulting with a librarian, we searched PubMed, Embase, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, conference abstracts for English articles describing the prevalence of each nonmotor outcome (anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social participation, pain, bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction [constipation and fecal incontinence], and sexual dysfunction) defined by patient-reported measures after acute ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), time to follow-up, and associated clinical and sociodemographic factors from January 1, 1999, to June 30, 2023. For full search terms and mesh search words please see eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

Selection Criteria

Two investigators (H.O. and T.E.) independently screened the literature eligibility, resolving discrepancies with senior authors (R.J.S. and D.J.W.) via consensus as required. When data were missing, we contacted study authors for raw data; 2 studies with unresolved queries more than 8 weeks after initial contact with the corresponding author were excluded.

We included peer-reviewed, English-language studies involving adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with ischemic stroke or ICH, reporting nonmotor outcomes at least 30 days after stroke. We included cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies, excluding those with transient ischemic attacks, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, pediatric stroke, and case series under 10 patients; see eTable 2 in Supplement 1 for exclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Using a predesigned Excel version 16.89.1 (Microsoft) spreadsheet, we extracted the following information from eligible studies: study characteristics (name, authors, year, sample size, design, follow-up time, stroke type, nonmotor outcome domain, outcome measure, and follow-up method), participants' characteristics (sex and age), main outcomes (nonmotor outcomes 30 days after stroke), and analysis plan (statistical models and covariates).

### Prevalence of and factors associated with fecal incontinence in a large community study of older individuals [^115XcLji]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we describe the prevalence of fecal incontinence by race, age, sex, the presence of major chronic conditions of stroke and diabetes, and the use of certain psychoactive medications.

Methods

Study subjects are participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a study of older Chicago residents of a geographically defined area. In the period 1993–1996, interviewers conducted a door-to-door census that identified 6,099 individuals who participated in in-home interviews. The interviews included a wide range of questions regarding demographics, medical history, and medication use. The question used to determine the presence of fecal incontinence was: "In the past few months have you ever lost control of your bowels when you didn't want to?"

Results

Fecal incontinence was seen in 585 of 6,099 survey responders yielding an overall prevalence of 9.6%. The prevalence of fecal incontinence was strongly associated with age across all demographic groups. We did not observe significant differences in the prevalence for males and females once we adjusted for age. However, the increase in prevalence with age was significantly greater among Blacks than Whites. The use of psychoactive medications was found to be associated with significantly higher odds of fecal incontinence. Diabetes and stroke were associated with a higher prevalence of fecal incontinence.

Conclusions

These cross-sectional analyses offer promising evidence that this common condition is correlated with the presence of certain conditions (e.g., stroke and diabetes) and use of certain psychoactive medications.

### Fecal incontinence: evaluation and treatment [^111Uv6KS]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence affects men and women of all ages, leading to personal disability and high financial costs. The evaluation of the patient should clarify the pathophysiology of the symptoms and provide guidance in choosing the appropriate treatment. A comprehensive history and physical examination including endoscopic assessment is able to identify the cause of most cases of fecal incontinence. If necessary, functional methods can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Patient selection for suitable treatment is most important and should be based on clinical and physiologic findings. Conservative dietary or medical treatment is often effective, when the symptoms are mild. Biofeedback therapy is effective in most patients. It has no side effects and is well tolerated. Structural damage to the anus may be repaired by surgery, like sphincter repair, the best treatment of selective sphincter defects. Neoanal sphincters and artificial sphincters are the last possibility after failed surgery and before colostomy. They are less attractive because of technical difficulties and low success rate. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment has the potential to improve the outcome for patients with fecal incontinence.

### Epidemiology of fecal incontinence [^116RGArW]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Nursing home residence is by far the most prominent association with fecal incontinence, with a prevalence approaching 50%. In one major survey, urinary incontinence was the greatest risk factor for developing fecal incontinence, and fecal incontinence was the greatest risk factor for developing urinary incontinence. Immobility, dementia, and the use of physical restraints were also important risk factors. Specific diseases associated with fecal incontinence include diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. The surgical procedures lateral internal sphincterotomy for anal fissure, fistulotomy, and ileal pouch reconstruction can result in fecal incontinence. Children who are born with congenital abnormalities, such as imperforate anus, often experience soiling for many years. Future studies to determine the prevalence and etiology of fecal and urinary incontinence will need to first define these conditions and eliminate referral bias. Epidemiologic investigations of both disorders should be performed jointly because the conditions are so often comorbid.

### Conservative, physical and surgical interventions for managing faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases [^117Vena1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003, 2006 and 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative, physical and surgical interventions for managing FI and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 March 2023), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, quasi-randomised (where allocation is not strictly random), cross-over and cluster-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative, physical or surgical intervention against placebo, usual care or no intervention for the management of FI and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in eligible trials using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of prespecified outcome measures. We produced summary of findings tables for our main outcome measures and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with 1598 participants. The studies were generally at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel to the intervention. Half of the included studies were also at high risk of bias in terms of selective reporting. Outcomes were often reported heterogeneously across studies, making it difficult to pool data. We did not find enough evidence to be able to analyse the effects of interventions on individual central neurological diseases. Additionally, very few studies reported on the primary outcomes of self-reported improvement in FI or constipation, or Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score. Conservative interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Thirteen studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included assessment-based nursing, holistic nursing, probiotics, psyllium, faecal microbiota transplantation, and a stepwise protocol of increasingly invasive evacuation methods. Conservative interventions may result in a large improvement in faecal incontinence (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.47 to -0.23; 3 studies; n = 410; low-certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD ≥ 0.80 as a large effect. It was not possible to pool all data from studies that assessed improvement in constipation, but the evidence suggested that conservative interventions may improve constipation symptoms (data not pooled; 8 studies; n = 612; low-certainty evidence). Conservative interventions may lead to a reduction in mean time taken on bowel care (data not pooled; 5 studies; n = 526; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain about the effects of conservative interventions on condition-specific quality of life and adverse events. Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score was not reported. Physical therapy compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo Twelve studies assessed this comparison. The interventions included massage therapy, standing, osteopathic manipulative treatment, electrical stimulation, transanal irrigation, and conventional physical therapy with visceral mobilisation. Physical therapies may make little to no difference to self-reported faecal continence assessed using the St Mark's Faecal Incontinence Score, where the minimally important difference is five, or the Cleveland Constipation Score (MD -2.60, 95% CI -4.91 to -0.29; 3 studies; n = 155; low-certainty evidence). Physical therapies may result in a moderate improvement in constipation symptoms (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.14; 9 studies; n = 431; low-certainty evidence). We interpreted SMD ≥ 0.5 as a moderate effect. However, physical therapies may make little to no difference in Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score as the minimally important difference for this tool is 3 (MD -1.94, 95% CI -3.36 to -0.51; 7 studies; n = 358; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of physical therapies on the time spent on bowel care, condition-specific quality of life and adverse effects (all very low-certainty evidence). Surgical interventions compared with usual care, no active treatment or placebo No studies were found for surgical interventions that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains little research on this common and, for patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. Understanding whether there is a clinically-meaningful difference from the results of available trials is largely hampered by the lack of uniform outcome measures. This is due to an absence of core outcome sets, and development of these needs to be a research priority to allow studies to be compared directly. Some studies used validated constipation, incontinence or condition-specific measures; however, others used unvalidated analogue scales to report effectiveness. Some studies did not use any patient-reported outcomes and focused on physiological outcome measures, which is of relatively limited significance in terms of clinical implementation. There was evidence in favour of some conservative interventions, but these findings need to be confirmed by larger, well-designed controlled trials, which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life.

### Prevalence, trajectory, and factors associated with patient-reported nonmotor outcomes after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147GyrY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Stroke outcomes are commonly assessed using the modified Rankin Score, which focuses on motor function and walking ability but neglects nonmotor outcomes. This approach limits comprehensive understanding of recovery and quality of life after stroke. Nonmotor outcomes include neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders), autonomic dysfunction (sexual dysfunction, constipation, bladder issues, and fecal incontinence), sensory problems (pain), and reduced social participation. Over 50% of stroke survivors report these as significant long-term unmet needs. Despite guidelines suggesting integration of nonmotor outcomes into stroke care, data on their prevalence across multiple domains and natural progression over time are limited and inconsistent, with variation across studies. Effective clinical care requires a better understanding of these outcomes and their associated factors, which currently include factors such as age, sex, and stroke subtype, although findings are often contradictory. Comprehensive data on these nonmotor domains are needed to optimize patient-centered stroke care and address unmet needs.

To synthesize current published data on nonmotor outcomes after stroke and identify remaining knowledge gaps, we did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of various adverse nonmotor outcomes after stroke, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social participation, pain, bowel dysfunction (constipation and fecal incontinence), bladder dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Additionally, we recorded the prevalence of each adverse nonmotor outcome at different time points to estimate their natural history over time. We also identified study-level factors associated with risk for each adverse nonmotor outcome.

### Prevalence, trajectory, and factors associated with patient-reported nonmotor outcomes after stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Mnhxo]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has important strengths. We provided comprehensive data on poststroke nonmotor outcomes, detailing prevalence, natural history, and factors associated with risk across multiple domains and follow-up time points up to 10 years. This allowed us to investigate how adverse nonmotor outcomes might change over time. To our knowledge, we provided the first meta-analyses for key domains, including social participation, sexual dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction.

Our study also has several limitations. First, 12 studies, in our analysis lacked stroke subtype definitions, although excluding them did not significantly alter our prevalence estimates. Second, only 6 studies, focused on ICH cohorts. Third, diverse assessment measures, with 96 distinct patient-reported scales used across 10 nonmotor outcomes, contributed to variability in estimated prevalence. Another limitation of this study is the high heterogeneity observed across all nonmotor outcome domains, which may affect the reliability of our findings, particularly given our reliance on patient-reported measures for these symptoms. Sensitivity analysis showed that assessment measures were significantly associated with nonmotor outcome domains, accounting for 24% to 45% of the heterogeneity in constipation, and sexual dysfunction domains. Most studies conducted only a single follow-up time point, potentially affecting our pooled estimates of how the prevalence of adverse nonmotor outcomes change between 30 days to 10 years.

### Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases [^1156Rcfv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

Objectives

To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of pre-specified outcome measures.

Main Results

Twenty trials involving 902 people were included. Oral medications There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) -2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.3 to -1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92). Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review. Rectal stimulants One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol-based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil-based (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository. Physical interventions There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score). One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25). There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method. Other interventions In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one-off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool. Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke.

Authors' Conclusions

There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other. There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulk-forming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase-anticholinergic drug combination (neostigmine-glycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone). However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger well-designed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^115nhvBu]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare characteristics of both continent and incontinent residents in Nursing Homes (NHs) and to explore what predicts continence and severity of incontinence.

Methods

A population-based cross-sectional study was performed in nursing homes in one Norwegian municipality. Registered nurses filled in a questionnaire on behalf of the patients.

Results

We found that 25.4% of the NH residents were continent, 31.8% had urinary incontinence alone, 2.6% had fecal incontinence alone and 40.2% had double incontinence. Continent residents were characterized by being in short-term care, shorter stay in NH, less cognitive and physical impairment, less Parkinson's disease, stroke, constipation, and less diarrhea and more independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Residents with fecal incontinence alone were characterized by more diarrhea, less cognitive impairment and less dependency in ADL such as feeding and grooming. Residents with urinary incontinence alone were characterized by having some degree of ADL dependency, less diarrhea, and less diabetes. Residents with double incontinence were characterized by being in long-term care, a longer length of stay in NH, cognitive impairment, stroke, constipation, diarrhea, and dependency in ADL. Severity of incontinence was associated with dependency in ADL and cognitive impairment, diarrhea, length of stay in NH and lower age.

Conclusions

About 25% of NH residents were continent. Double incontinence and urinary incontinence only were prevalent conditions in NHs, while FI alone was rarer. With the exception of diarrhea as a cause of FI, it appears that FI alone, UI alone, and DI may have common causes and development. Neurourol. Urodynam. 34:362–367, 2015. © 2014 The Authors.

### Dysbiosis of gut microbiota with reduced trimethylamine-N-oxide level in patients with large-artery atherosclerotic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111VAcCa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Research Participants and Sample Collection

We recruited large‐artery atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and TIA patients for study and asymptomatic persons undergoing physical examinations as controls. We did not use an age‐ and sex‐matching strategy in our selection of controls and patients but set the age range from 18 to 80 years. The participants in the patient group were consecutively recruited from the Department of Neurology, and the control group was recruited from the Health Examination Center of Nanfang Hospital (a teaching hospital affiliated with Southern Medical University in southern China). From February 2014 to February 2015, patients initially diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and considered to have large‐artery atherosclerosis, by Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, or TIA were consecutively recruited. The following inclusion criteria were used: proven stroke or TIA due to cerebral infarction (according to standard clinical criteria with supporting brain imaging consisting of either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography) and large‐artery atherosclerosis stroke subtype according to the TOAST classification system. Patients aged < 18 years or with radiological evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, a clear cause of stroke or TIA unrelated to atherosclerosis (eg, cervical artery dissection, perivascular procedural stroke, cardioembolism stroke, or the other TOAST subtypes), severe comorbid illness or an unstable medical condition (eg, congestive cardiac failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, or severe liver dysfunction), or consumption of probiotics or antibiotics within 1 month before admission were excluded. Color Doppler flow imaging showed that 62 patients with significant hemodynamic stenosis (7 considered to have carotid occlusion), 148 patients with no significant hemodynamic stenosis but with minor plaques, and 85 patients with significant carotid plaques were included. The first fasting blood samples were drawn from all participants within 24 hours after admission, and their first available fecal samples within 48 hours after admission were collected. The control group consisted of asymptomatic participants (not in any acute disease state by the report of physical examination and self‐report). Control participants did not use any type of antibiotics or probiotics within 1 month before admission or suffer from previous or current cerebrovascular diseases. All control participants completed color Doppler flow imaging, transcranial Doppler sonography, and echocardiography to determine their cardiovascular conditions. The asymptomatic control group was further divided into 3 subgroups based on the color Doppler flow imaging analyses. The AS group contained participants with obvious carotid plaques, the IMT group consisted of participants with increased intima–media thickness of the carotid arterial wall, and the remaining participants exhibited healthy carotid arteries and were defined as the non‐AS group.

Fecal incontinence (FI) — evaluation and assessment (GRADE): A history should be obtained to help determine the cause of incontinence and should include specific risk factors for incontinence and characterize the duration and severity of symptoms (Strong Expert opinion). Measures that assess the nature and severity of incontinence and the impact of incontinence on quality of life should be used as a part of the assessment of FI (Conditional Low). A physical examination is an essential component of the evaluation of patients with FI (Strong Expert opinion). Anorectal physiology testing (manometry, anorectal sensation, volume tolerance, and compliance) can be considered to help define the elements of dysfunction and guide management (Conditional Very low). Endoanal ultrasound may be useful to evaluate sphincter anatomy when planning a sphincter repair (Conditional Very low). Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing is not routinely recommended. Endoscopy should be performed according to established screening guidelines and in patients presenting with symptoms that warrant further evaluation (ie, changes in bowel habits; bleeding).

### Faecal incontinence is associated with an impaired rectosigmoid brake and improved by sacral neuromodulation [^114iSDc7]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Differences in colonic motility between patients with faecal incontinence and controls

Patients with faecal incontinence had an impaired meal response with respect to the number of total (mean 17 ± 6/h premeal vs. 22 ± 9/h post‐meal, p = 0.438), antegrade (10 ± 3/h premeal vs 5 ± 2/h post meal, p = 0.916) and retrograde (8 ± 3/h premeal vs. 17 ± 9/h post‐meal, p = 0.281) propagating contractions (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As previously documented, healthy controls showed significant increases in the number of total (21 ± 14/h premeal vs. 70 ± 12/h post meal, p < 0.001), antegrade (8 ± 6/h premeal vs. 18 ± 6/h post meal, p = 0.014), and retrograde (13 ± 7/h premeal vs. 52 ± 8/h post meal, p < 0.001) propagating contractions (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Particularly, the magnitude of the delta in retrograde propagating contractions was significantly greater in controls compared to faecal incontinence patients (delta in mean retrograde contractions: 39 vs. 9, p = 0.027; Figures 2 and 3).

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of aripiprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), blood glucose fluctuation, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), hiccups, pathological gambling, and fecal incontinence.

### Isolated urinary, fecal, and double incontinence: prevalence and degree of soiling in stroke survivors [^114q7gyB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of isolated urinary and fecal incontinence and double incontinence in community-living stroke survivors and to assess the degree of soiling.

Design

Community-based postal survey.

Setting

Leicestershire, United Kingdom.

Participants

Sixty-four thousand seven hundred forty-nine community-dwelling residents (aged ≥ 40) were randomly selected from the Leicestershire Health Authority register. Residents living in institutional settings were excluded.

Measurements

Respondents were asked about previous stroke, urinary and bowel symptoms, and general health and demographic details including age, sex, and ethnicity. Urinary incontinence was defined as leakage several times a month or more often. Major fecal incontinence was defined as soiling of underwear, outer clothing, furnishings, or bedding several times a month or more often.

Results

A 65% response rate to the postal survey was obtained, with the return of 39,519 eligible questionnaires; 4% (n = 1,483) reported stroke. Five percent of stroke survivors reported major fecal incontinence, with 4.3% reporting fecal and urinary incontinence and 0.8% reporting isolated fecal incontinence. Major fecal incontinence was four and a half times as prevalent in stroke survivors as in the nonstroke population, and stroke survivors were also twice as likely to report soiling of furnishings or bedding. Functional limitations influence the presence of fecal incontinence in the stroke and nonstroke population.

Conclusion

Fecal incontinence is common in stroke survivors, and the degree of soiling can be considerable. Future research needs to explore the effect fecal incontinence can have on the lives of stroke survivors and on how it can best be managed in those living in the community.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of fecal incontinence [^1157RhJM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Fecal incontinence — risk factors and multifactorial causes: Maintaining continence depends on the complex interplay of multiple factors, including anal sphincter and pelvic floor musculature, rectal reservoir function (eg, capacity and compliance), stool consistency, and neurologic function (eg, colonic transit and motility, mental cognition, and sensorimotor function). Although conditions that alter these factors may result in FI, the cause of FI may be multifactorial, and the relative contribution of each factor may be difficult to ascertain. Independent risk factors for FI identified in population-based studies include older age, smoking, obesity, limited physical activity, white race, neurologic disease, diabetes mellitus, frequent and loose stools, and having multiple chronic comorbidities. FI is more prevalent among those with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or concomitant constipation.

### Finding a needle in the common carotid artery 3 years after ingestion [^115MdFsK]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A woman presented with an ischemic stroke involving the right middle cerebral artery. Investigations revealed a foreign body in the cervical area. It was identified as a metal needle, perforating the posterior pharyngeal wall and migrating into the right common carotid artery (CCA). Three years previously, this patient had complained of odynophagia, brought on by needle ingestion. Three days before her stroke, she had hematemesis, caused by migration of the needle into the CCA. The stroke was caused by migration of the thrombus. This type of event is rarely encountered in Europe. Early recognition could avoid dangerous vascular complications.

### Contemporary evaluation and treatment of poststroke lower urinary tract dysfunction [^116Y88NS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke is an extremely common clinical entity, and poststroke incontinence is a major cause of morbidity for stroke survivors. Although patients can experience a wide variety of lower urinary tract symptoms, detrusor overactivity is among the most common clinical findings following stroke. All forms of lower urinary tract symptoms can negatively impact physical and psychosocial function for affected patients and their caregivers and loved ones. Careful evaluation is critical for successful management. Treatment is tailored to the goals and needs of each individual patient. Improvements in continence status can help to enhance overall and health-related quality of life.

### Abnormal colonic motility: a possible association with urge fecal incontinence [^116peABM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fecal incontinence is a distressing condition affecting up to 7% of the population. Severe urgency is a symptom associated with hypersensitivity of the rectum, a common finding in both fecal incontinence and irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patients with fecal incontinence, urgency, and rectal hypersensitivity have abnormal hindgut motility, suggestive of a more generalized motility problem.

Methods

Eleven females with urgency-associated incontinence and without anal sphincter injury were compared with 5 controls. After full clinical, ultrasonographic, and physiological assessment, patients underwent prolonged colonic manometry studies. Motility patterns were recorded and, in particular, the response to a standard gastrocolic reflex was noted.

Results

Rectal sensation values in patients were as follows: first sensation, 22 (range, 5–58) mls; desire to defecate, 31 (range, 13–166) mls; and maximum tolerated volume, 64 (range, 21–254) mls. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher numbers of 1) low amplitude waves (> 5 mmHg) in both the sigmoid colon (101 vs 46.5; p = 0.028) and the descending colon (101.5 vs 41; p = 0.036) in the hour before the meal stimulus, and 2) high amplitude waves (> 50 mmHg) in the sigmoid colon (2 vs 0; p = 0.006) in the fasting state.

Conclusion

Patients with fecal incontinence associated with severe urgency may have rectal hypersensitivity and a more global colonic motility problem similar to irritable bowel syndrome.

### Functional nonretentive fecal incontinence in children: a frustrating and long-lasting clinical entity [^113AHCYu]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence is defined as the passage of stools in an inappropriate place at least once per month, for a minimum period of 2 months. This frustrating symptom is a source of considerable distress and embarrassment for the child and the family. According to the Rome III criteria fecal incontinence can be subdivided into constipation-associated fecal incontinence and functional nonretentive fecal incontinence. This short review mainly addresses functional nonretentive fecal incontinence in children. Definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, and recent updates on treatment and long-term follow-up of fecal incontinence are discussed.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^112ZviKN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Symptom severity and quality of life in fecal incontinence are assessed primarily by frequency using daily diaries; a 50% reduction in the number of episodes or days with FI is considered the primary end point in clinical trials. Severity can be evaluated with questionnaire instruments such as the Wexner and Modified Manchester Health Questionnaires, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Score, and the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. All of the available instruments incorporate the frequency and type of leakage, some also incorporate the volume of leakage and rectal urgency, and severity is correlated strongly with its impact on quality of life.

### Prevalence and correlates of fecal incontinence among nursing home residents: a population-based cross-sectional study [^111uVwFU]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The number of nursing home residents has risen worldwide in recent decades. Medical advances and improvements in public health have led to an increase in life expectancy, however often with accompanying morbidities. Life expectancy will continue to increase in the next 30 years. It is expected that the nursing home population will therefore grow in the future. A nursing home is a place of residence for people with health problems and significant deficiencies in activities of daily living (ADL). In Norway, the municipalities have a statutory obligation to provide nursing home services to those who need it. Consequently, all nursing homes are accounted for and subject to governmental control. Most Norwegian nursing homes are owned and run by the municipality, and financed by taxes and resident payment. However, there are also some private non-profit and for-profit providers. The nursing homes have nurses on duty 24-hours a day and the staff comprises some registered nurses, but mostly licensed practical nurses, while some are unskilled. Most nursing home residents in Norway are long-term care residents, but the number of short-term care residents is increasing. Laws and regulations are providing a framework for how nursing homes in Norway are managed and organized, and secure a relatively homogenous public service across the country. Nursing home residents and nursing home institutions worldwide have gone through a great change during the past decades, with increasingly frail residents with multiple comorbidities. However, many fecal incontinence studies are from the 80s and 90s, but there are some studies from the past decade. Previous studies have demonstrated the complexity of fecal incontinence among frail older residents. In this group, fecal incontinence may be an indicator of generalized bowel dysfunction rather than an isolated anal sphincter problem as it may be in a younger population. Bowel-symptoms such as constipation and diarrhea are related to fecal incontinence as well as laxative use, but in this group there is also a strong relationship to reduced mobility, decline in cognitive function, in addition to diseases like diabetes, cerebral stroke, Parkinson's disease, depression and urinary incontinence.

### Survey of anal sphincter dysfunction using anal manometry in patients with fecal incontinence: a possible guide to therapy [^113yfmc6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The burden of fecal incontinence (FI) is prevalent worldwide
There is a lack of data regarding the frequency of specific type of sphincter involvement in FI
According to the majority of practical guidelines FI is characterized only clinically; i.e. passive incontinence, urge incontinence and fecal soilage
A recent National Institute of Health consensus meeting for guiding future research in FI to overcome the barriers in diagnosis and treatment of FI, mentioned the need to further develop this classification
There is a lack of research in development of pharmacological agents that augment internal anal sphincter tone as there is a scarcity of data about the prevalence of internal anal sphincter dysfunction in patients with FI

What the new findings are:

In patients with FI, internal anal sphincter dysfunction is the most common finding, alone or in combination with external anal sphincter dysfunction
A novel classification of FI based on the precise characterization of sphincteric involvement or lack of this involvement is critical in selecting targeted therapy for FI with long-term outcomes that are free of side effects
Future studies using pharmacological agents to target internal anal sphincter dysfunction by increasing the tone will be of clinical importance

### Clinical significance of small bowel manometry patterns suggestive of intestinal obstruction [^117KS2Xh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Two small bowel manometry patterns, the minute rhythm and the prolonged simultaneous contractions patterns, have historically been considered suggestive of mechanical intestinal obstruction.
We have found that currently, the most frequent origin of these patterns is intestinal neuropathy, while a previously undetected mechanical obstruction is rare.
Colonic fecal retention may also generate occlusive patterns in the small bowel, since in some patients with pooling of solid stools in the colon, manometry normalized after colonic cleansing.

### ACG clinical guidelines: management of benign anorectal disorders [^112DvQR8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) — clinical characterization tools and symptom features state that pictorial representations of stool form (e.g. Bristol Stool Form Scale) and bowel diaries are efficient and reliable methods to characterize bowel habits and are better predictors of colonic transit than self-reported stool frequency; awareness of the desire to defecate before an incontinent episode may provide pathophysiologic clues, with urge incontinence involving the desire to defecate but inability to reach the toilet, passive incontinence involving lack of awareness before the episode, urge incontinence associated with reduced squeeze pressures and/or squeeze duration and/or reduced rectal capacity with rectal hypersensitivity, passive incontinence associated with lower resting pressures, and nocturnal incontinence occurring uncommonly and most frequently in diabetes mellitus and scleroderma.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^112rctzv]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for fecal incontinence include anorectal dysfunctions and bowel disturbances, typically diarrhea, and in community surveys bowel disturbances (particularly diarrhea), rectal urgency, and burden of chronic illness are by far the most important independent risk factors for FI in older women. In a community-based cohort of 176 women with and 176 without FI, independent risk factors included diarrhea (OR 53; 95% CI 6.1–471), cholecystectomy (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.2–15), current smoking (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–15), history of rectocele (OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.3–19), stress urinary incontinence (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.4–6.5), and higher body mass index per unit increase (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.004–1.1). Additional conditions associated with FI include advanced age, disease burden, anal sphincter trauma, decreased physical activity, and diseases causing anorectal inflammation, peripheral neuropathy, iatrogenic anal sphincter injury, or neurologic disorders.

### Pontine stroke and bladder dysfunction [^113GsELH]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 54-year-old hypertensive woman who presented with sudden onset left hemiparesis with facial asymmetry and inability to pass urine. Her bladder was distended and she had to be catheterised. MRI of her brain showed a large infarct in the right pontine region. Antiplatelet therapy was instituted and the patient showed good recovery and was able to walk with support after a fortnight at the time of discharge. She was discharged with a catheter in situ. After 6months, she could walk with the support of a stick, but had increased frequency and urgency of micturition along with nocturia. Urodynamic study revealed detrusor hyper-reflexia, possibly due to involvement of the pontine micturition centre.

### Postprandial recurrent hemiplegia [^112nLq6s]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postprandial hemodynamic disturbances have been previously described. We report a case of postprandial transient ischemic attacks.

Materials and Methods

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, apparent diffusion coefficient), MR angiography, and Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission computed tomography-CT before and after acetazolamide challenge were performed in a patient with recurrent spells of hemiplegia following fatty meals.

Results

No recent infarction was observed on apparent diffusion coefficient maps. MR angiography showed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and severe atherosclerosis of the cervical arteries. Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated hypoperfusion in the left middle cerebral artery territory at baseline and absence of cerebrovascular reactivity.

Discussion and Conclusion

This case report supports the hypothesis of a modulation of the cerebral blood flow by fatty acids and highlights the potential impact of dietetic education in patients with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement on evaluation of obstructed defecation [^111zBr9a]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Colonic transit marker patterns — interpretation: 5 or fewer markers remaining indicates grossly normal colonic transit; rings scattered about the colon suggest hypomotility or colonic inertia; rings gathered in the rectosigmoid indicate functional outlet obstruction, consistent with the statement that when accumulation is mostly in the rectosigmoid the etiology is more likely outlet obstruction.

### Fecal incontinence: community prevalence and associated factors – A systematic review [^112jPGuF]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence is a chronic and debilitating condition with significant health burden. Despite its clinical relevance, the prevalence of fecal incontinence remains inconsistently described.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the prevalence of and factors associated with fecal incontinence among community-dwelling adults.

Data Sources

A search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed.

Study Selection

Studies that reported the prevalence of fecal incontinence and/or associated factors in a community-based (ie, unselected) adult population were included. Two independent assessors reviewed eligible articles.

Main Outcome Measures

Relevant data were extracted from each study and presented in descriptive form. The main outcome measures included the prevalence of fecal incontinence (adjusted and/or unadjusted), stratified for age and sex if reported; factors associated (and not associated) with fecal incontinence; and study quality, assessed using predefined criteria.

Results

Of 3523 citations identified, 38 studies were included for review. The reported median prevalence of fecal incontinence was 7.7% (range, 2.0%-20.7%). Fecal incontinence equally affected both men (median, 8.1%; range, 2.3%-16.1%) and women (median, 8.9%; range, 2.0%-20.7%) and increased with age (15–34 years, 5.7%; > 90 years, 15.9%). The study populations and diagnostic criteria used were heterogeneous, precluding any meaningful pooling of prevalence estimates. Study quality assessment revealed 6 high-quality studies, of which only 3 were performed in a representative sample. The median prevalence of fecal incontinence was higher in these studies at 11.2% (range, 8.3%-13.2%). The factors most commonly reported to be associated with fecal incontinence included increasing age, diarrhea, and urinary incontinence.

Limitations

Heterogeneity of studies precluded meaningful pooling or meta-analysis of data.

Conclusions

Fecal incontinence is a prevalent condition of equal sex distribution, affecting ≈1 in 8 community adults, and has identifiable associated factors. The paucity of high-quality prevalence studies emphasizes the need for future population-based studies that use standardized diagnostic criteria for fecal incontinence.

### End stage clinical features and cause of death of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and young-onset Alzheimer's disease [^111ZEjLL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Study sample

Out of 89 patients, 41 patients were not deceased and therefore not eligible. Of the 48 remaining patients, 18 were excluded due to the presence of language variant of FTD (n = 11), missing documentation in the last six months before death (n = 1), the frontal variant of AD (n = 2), or a mixture of dementia (n = 4). Ultimately, the total sample size included 30 patients; n = 18 for yoAD, n = 12 for bvFTD.

Qualitative results from literature, diagnostic criteria, and patient files

Qualitative research from the literature review, diagnostic criteria, and patient files led to the following outcome measures; somatic events were categorized in ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, deep vein thrombosis, renal impairment, pulmonary embolism, hematological complications, transient ischemic attack, transient loss of consciousness by unknown cause and ileus. In addition, clinical features in the end stage were divided into the following (sub)themes: somatic features including incontinence, decrease of eating, weight gain or weight loss, cachexia, autonomic disorders (including constipation, thin defecation, undigested stool, epiphoria, saliva flood, changed pain perception), reversed day-night rhythm, infections, pain, pressure ulcers, intertrigo, fever, nausea/vomiting, bedridden and dental issues; neurological features including language disorder divided in mutism/no mutism, hypersomnia, hypertonia, hyperextension of the neck, contractures, impaired trunk balance, apraxia, nystagmus, dysphagia, parkinsonism, epilepsy, myoclonus and fasciculation, gait disorders (including balance disorder due to impaired proprioception, hypokinetic rigid, paretic hypotonic, spastic, vestibular, functional, ataxia, apraxia, hanging crooked with the upper body to one side while walking). Gait disorders were assessed by a geriatric physician and physiotherapist with expertise in dementia. Psychiatric features included bradyphrenia, restlessness, suspicion, euphoria, persistent calling, wander, urge for walking, echolalia, grimaces, disinhibition, apathy, compulsive behavior, hyperorality, euphoria, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and agitation/ aggression.

Missing features

Features including weight loss, weight gain, cachexia, parkinsonism, and trunk balance could not be fully retrieved from all the patient files throughout the last six months (≥ 30% missing values) and were therefore excluded.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with carotid artery stenosis, AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend to ensure shared decision-making with patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis > 70% to determine the optimal treatment approach, either carotid revascularization or medical management, to reduce the risk of stroke.

### Simultaneous treatment of ischaemic bowel and ischaemic stroke with intravenous thrombolysis therapy [^116QFcR1]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Novel treatment of simultaneous mesenteric and cerebral ischaemia with systemic thrombolysis. A 75-year-old man presented to the acute stroke team with aphasia, right-sided weakness and distressed with a pain he was unable to localise. He was treated with intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator for a left middle cerebral artery stroke. Decompensation on the ward during thrombolysis with worsening abdominal distension and pain, hypotension and tachycardia prompted a CT angiogram scan, which displayed proximal inferior mesenteric artery occlusion. Thrombolysis treatment resulted in excellent improvement of both his dysphasia and weakness from the left cerebral ischaemic stroke and reperfusion of the ischaemic bowel, without surgical intervention.

### Stroke in an adult with HIV infection due to carotid artery stenosis successfully treated with steroids: HIV-associated arteritis? [^115bVzzf]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old Caucasian man with a 17-year history of HIV infection developed sudden right-sided hemiplegia, with the arm more affected than the leg, and aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hemodynamic watershed stroke between the anterior and middle cerebral artery territories and an ischemic stroke within the left posterior middle cerebral artery territory. Color-coded Duplex sonography and Doppler sonography revealed hypoechogenic stenosis of the left common carotid artery, the left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery and right internal carotid artery. An extensive diagnostic workup led us to hypothesize that HIV-associated arteritis was the cause of the stroke, and following intravenous steroid therapy, the carotid artery stenoses vanished.

### Subacute stroke: bladder and bowel dysfunctions and possible associated factors [^1178CkQG]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Bladder and bowel poststroke dysfunctions negatively impact patients' health. Stroke-related characteristics associated to these dysfunctions are poorly known. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of new-onset poststroke bladder and bowel dysfunctions, characterize their associated factors, and describe the dysfunctions' clinical approach.

Materials and Methods

Cross-sectional study including 157 patients admitted to a single hospital's stroke unit with a first-ever stroke, during 3months. An 18-item questionnaire was applied to assess dysfunctions pre and poststroke. The McNemar test was used to compare pre and poststroke prevalence. A logistic regression was used to estimate associations (OR, 95% CI) between individual characteristics and new-onset dysfunctions.

Results

We had 113 (72%) respondents. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of bladder and bowel dysfunctions poststroke (p < 0.001). Higher stroke severity was significantly associated with both new-onset poststroke bladder and bowel dysfunctions (OR = 15.00, 95% CI [4.92,45.76] and OR = 5.87,95%CI [2.14,16.12], respectively). Total anterior circulation strokes, cardioembolic strokes, and lower functionality at discharge were also significantly associated with both dysfunctions. Thirteen patients (11.5%) reported that health professionals addressed these dysfunctions.

Conclusions

Poststroke bladder and bowel dysfunctions are highly prevalent. Being aware of their epidemiology helps draw attention to patients at higher risk of developing these dysfunctions, enhancing the rehabilitation process. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPoststroke bladder and bowel dysfunctions are highly prevalent and under-recognised consequences of stroke. Being aware of their epidemiology and associated factors may help identify patients at higher risk of developing these dysfunctions. It is necessary to raise clinical awareness to ensure a more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic approach, enhancing patients' rehabilitation process, quality of life and lowering collateral societal burden.
