## Question

How should metastatic lung cancer with an EGFR L858R mutation and PDLI 75% be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation and high PD‑L1 expression (TPS 75%), including first‑line therapy selection and subsequent treatment sequencing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether PD‑L1 75% changes the first‑line choice in the presence of an activating EGFR mutation. Then, I should verify current guideline‑concordant first‑line options and the preferred agent. Next, I will review why immunotherapy is not recommended up front in EGFR‑mutated NSCLC despite high PD‑L1, and consider safety issues with sequencing. After that, I need to outline evidence‑based options at progression, including T790M testing and chemotherapy or amivantamab‑based approaches. Finally, I should confirm dosing details and special situations like CNS disease and performance status considerations, making sure each step aligns with high‑quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and its implications: metastatic NSCLC with a classical sensitizing EGFR mutation (L858R) is the prototypical scenario where EGFR TKI therapy is prioritized, and although PD‑L1 75% would ordinarily suggest strong consideration for PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade in EGFR‑wild‑type disease, the presence of a driver alteration generally dictates a targeted therapy approach first, particularly given established efficacy and CNS activity of third‑generation TKIs like osimertinib [^112rwqGo] [^113obBVR].

> Wait, let me verify whether high PD‑L1 could still justify ICI monotherapy here; hold on, I should not jump to conclusions because labels and guidelines are explicit about exclusions. The ASCO 2025 driver‑alterations guideline states that single‑agent immune checkpoint inhibitors should not be used as first‑line therapy in patients with any activating EGFR alteration, regardless of PD‑L1 level, reinforcing that high PD‑L1 does not supersede driver‑directed therapy in this context [^115x5QBj]. Consistently, FDA labeling for atezolizumab first‑line monotherapy is restricted to metastatic NSCLC with high PD‑L1 and no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, underscoring that immunotherapy monotherapy is intended for non‑driver tumors [^1169JvDq]. Broader non‑driver guidelines recommending ICI‑based regimens similarly apply when no actionable driver is present, not when EGFR is sensitizing [^114F72Dr].

> I will now examine the recommended first‑line therapy for EGFR‑mutated metastatic NSCLC and which agent is preferred. ESMO 2023 designates osimertinib as the preferred first‑line therapy for classical sensitizing EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R), particularly given its CNS penetration and superior disease control compared to earlier‑generation TKIs, and ASCO 2025 aligns with this preference, so osimertinib is the default first choice here [^112rwqGo]. Let me think about the evidence base supporting this preference; although the pivotal trial details are not restated here, the guideline endorsements integrate the FLAURA results, which demonstrated superiority of osimertinib over first‑generation TKIs in the frontline setting [^112rwqGo] [^112bcJjz].

> Next, I should review acceptable alternatives if osimertinib is unavailable or contraindicated; I need to ensure I cover both single‑agent and combination strategies. ESMO 2023 lists erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib as first‑line single‑agent options, and also considers gefitinib plus carboplatin‑pemetrexed, or adding anti‑angiogenic therapy to erlotinib (erlotinib‑bevacizumab or erlotinib‑ramucirumab), acknowledging trade‑offs in toxicity, cost, and logistics, whereas FDA labels confirm first‑line indications for gefitinib, erlotinib, and dacomitinib in L858R‑positive metastatic NSCLC [^114MFRZQ] [^113mHZCo] [^112QNW4g] [^1118ypPb] [^111HDuDB]. Hold on, I should verify that combination choices are individualized; yes, guideline language emphasizes patient‑specific considerations, and single‑agent TKIs remain standard in many settings due to tolerability and convenience [^117Sr6wL] [^114MFRZQ].

> But wait, what if we considered immunotherapy up front because PD‑L1 is 75%? Hmm, wait a minute, the aggregate data show limited benefit of PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors in EGFR‑mutated disease relative to TKIs, and randomized trials such as CheckMate 722 did not demonstrate a PFS advantage for nivolumab plus chemotherapy after TKI failure, highlighting the modest activity of ICIs in this genomic subset and the primacy of targeted therapy sequencing; further, sequential exposure to PD‑(L)1 blockade and osimertinib is associated with a high rate of severe immune‑related adverse events, which argues against front‑loading ICIs in EGFR‑mutated patients who will need TKIs soon after [^111WgZsH] [^115UobqQ]. I should double‑check the broader first‑line ICI evidence: trials like KEYNOTE‑024 firmly support pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD‑L1 ≥ 50% only when no EGFR/ALK aberrations are present, which does not apply here [^112gHw4K] [^1169JvDq].

> Next, I should review the post‑progression strategy because planning the sequence matters. If the patient starts on a first‑ or second‑generation TKI and then progresses, I need to check for the EGFR T790M resistance mutation via plasma and/or tissue; if T790M is detected, switch to osimertinib, while if T790M is absent, proceed with platinum‑based chemotherapy, recognizing that guideline updates also allow consideration of amivantamab in appropriate contexts for L858R/exon 19 del disease after TKI failure [^1134GR7i] [^111gXfCy] [^112bQKE5]. If the patient starts with osimertinib and then progresses, I should confirm that platinum‑based chemotherapy with or without amivantamab is recommended, and consider clinical trial options and biomarker‑directed strategies if new targetable resistance mechanisms emerge; immunotherapy may be considered later only if targeted options are exhausted, with clear counseling about limited efficacy in EGFR‑mutated tumors and safety concerns with TKI/ICI sequencing [^111gXfCy] [^115x5QBj].

> Let me consider special situations so I don't miss nuances. For CNS metastases, I need to ensure we prioritize osimertinib because of its intracranial activity and favorable CNS outcomes, which is one reason it is preferred first‑line in classical EGFR mutations; for performance status and comorbidities, I should remember afatinib and dacomitinib can have more pronounced rash and diarrhea, which may influence selection if osimertinib cannot be used; and while PD‑L1 75% might suggest sensitivity to immunotherapy in other settings, I should confirm again that PD‑L1 is not a decision‑maker in EGFR‑mutated first‑line disease per guidelines [^112rwqGo] [^114MFRZQ] [^115x5QBj].

> Bottom line, I should state the recommendation clearly and verify dosing. First‑line therapy should be osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, given its guideline‑preferred status for L858R‑positive metastatic NSCLC and CNS activity; if osimertinib is unavailable or contraindicated, consider a labeled alternative EGFR TKI such as afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib, or gefitinib plus carboplatin‑pemetrexed, selected based on patient comorbidity and toxicity profiles; and I need to ensure careful sequencing if any prior PD‑(L)1 therapy was given because starting osimertinib soon after PD‑(L)1 carries a higher risk of severe immune‑related adverse events, which warrants appropriate washout and vigilance [^112rwqGo] [^114MFRZQ] [^114g2T5Z] [^112QNW4g] [^1118ypPb] [^111HDuDB] [^115UobqQ].

---

For metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation and PD-L1 75%, **osimertinib is the preferred first-line therapy** [^112rwqGo] because it provides superior efficacy, CNS activity [^112rwqGo], and a favorable safety profile [^114MFRZQ]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors should not be used first-line in **EGFR-mutant NSCLC**, regardless of PD-L1 level, due to low efficacy and high toxicity [^115x5QBj] [^1169JvDq]. If progression occurs, test for T790M [^112bQKE5] and use osimertinib if positive [^1134GR7i]; if negative, use platinum-based chemotherapy with or without amivantamab [^111gXfCy]. Immunotherapy may be considered only after chemotherapy failure and with caution due to limited benefit and increased immune-related adverse events [^111WgZsH] [^116at4oR].

---

## First-line therapy recommendations

### EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)

Osimertinib is the **preferred first-line EGFR TKI** for L858R-mutant NSCLC [^112rwqGo] due to superior efficacy, robust CNS penetration, and a favorable safety profile [^114MFRZQ]. Alternative TKIs — erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib — remain options [^111LLvxM] [^1118ypPb] [^112QNW4g] but are generally less effective and more toxic than osimertinib [^114MFRZQ].

---

### Role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)

Single-agent ICIs (e.g. pembrolizumab, atezolizumab) are **not recommended as first-line therapy** in EGFR-mutant NSCLC [^115x5QBj], regardless of PD-L1 expression [^1169JvDq], owing to low efficacy and higher toxicity [^116at4oR]. EGFR-mutant NSCLC typically has low tumor mutational burden and limited immune infiltration, leading to poor ICI responses [^116QBovp].

---

## Management of disease progression

### Progression on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs

Upon progression on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs, **test for T790M** [^112bQKE5]; if positive, switch to osimertinib [^1134GR7i]. If T790M is negative, proceed with platinum-based chemotherapy [^1134GR7i].

---

### Progression on osimertinib

Upon progression on osimertinib, **platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended** [^111gXfCy]. In selected patients, adding amivantamab to chemotherapy may be considered [^111gXfCy].

---

## Role of PD-L1 expression in treatment selection

High PD-L1 expression (≥ 50%) alone does not justify first-line ICI use in EGFR-mutant NSCLC given limited efficacy and increased toxicity [^115x5QBj] [^1169JvDq]. Treatment selection should be **driven primarily by EGFR mutation status** rather than PD-L1 expression [^113obBVR].

---

## Safety considerations

Sequential use of EGFR TKIs and ICIs increases the risk [^115UobqQ] of severe immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis and hepatitis. Close monitoring is required, with prompt recognition and management of **immune-related toxicities**.

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment line** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line | Osimertinib | Superior efficacy, CNS penetration, favorable safety [^112rwqGo] [^114MFRZQ] |
| Second-line (T790M-positive) | Osimertinib | Effective against T790M resistance [^1134GR7i] |
| Second-line (T790M-negative) | Platinum-based chemotherapy | Standard of care [^1134GR7i] |
| Progression on osimertinib | Platinum-based chemotherapy ± amivantamab | Recommended by guidelines [^111gXfCy] |
| ICIs | Not recommended first-line | Limited efficacy, high toxicity [^115x5QBj] [^1169JvDq] |

---

## Conclusion

For metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation and PD-L1 75%, **osimertinib is the preferred first-line therapy** [^112rwqGo]. ICIs are not recommended as first-line therapy due to limited efficacy and high toxicity [^115x5QBj]. Upon progression, test for T790M; if positive, use osimertinib; if negative, use platinum-based chemotherapy with or without amivantamab [^111gXfCy].

### Real-world treatment and outcomes for EGFR WT advanced/metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: Pooled analysis from project LUMINATE-101 [^117Du4aa]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in North America. In early 2022, 654,620 individuals with a history of lung cancer were recorded in the United States, with a further 238,340 new diagnoses and 127,070 deaths predicted in 2023. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of lung cancer (84%), and non-squamous histology is the most common among NSCLC cases (70%-75%). Most NSCLC cases are advanced or metastatic at diagnosis (an estimated 71% in 2020), which negatively impacts prognosis. However, recent advances in early diagnosis and targeted therapies have begun to improve patient survival, with the 2-year relative survival rate having increased in both men and women with NSCLC from 32% and 25% in 1975–1976 to 54% and 43% in 2017–2018, respectively.

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) represent one of the most frequent "actionable" alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Typified by high response rates to targeted therapies, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now established as first-line treatment options and have transformed the treatment paradigm for NSCLC. With the recent breakthrough designation and approval of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib, available systemic and local treatment options have expanded, requiring new clinical algorithms that take into account individual patient molecular and clinical profiles.

In this International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer-commissioned consensus statement, key pathologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations, such as the optimal choice of EGFR TKI and management of brain metastasis, are discussed. In addition, recommendations are made for clinical guidelines and research priorities, such as the role of repeat biopsies and use of circulating free DNA for molecular studies. With the rapid pace of progress in treating EGFR-mutant NSCLC, this statement provides a state-of-the-art review of the contemporary issues in managing this unique subgroup of patients.

### Tecentriq [^1169JvDq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tecentriq, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage II to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose tumors have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumor cells, as determined by an FDA-approved test [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **First-line treatment**: Tecentriq, as a single agent, is indicated for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 stained ≥ 50% of tumor cells [TC ≥ 50%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering ≥ 10% of the tumor area [IC ≥ 10%]), as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Combination therapy**: Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, is indicated for adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Additionally, Tecentriq, in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

- **Post-chemotherapy treatment**: Tecentriq, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC harboring these aberrations.

Methods

Eligible patients were age 18 years and older with histologically confirmed stage IV or reEGFR mutation-positive (i.e. exon 19 deletion, L858R, T790M, L861Q, exon 20 insertion, G719X, S768I, other) NSCLC, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1. Additionally, patients had disease progression on previous first-line or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy and had no evidence of EGFR T790M mutation, or disease progression on first- or second-line osimertinib regardless of EGFR T790M status following a protocol amendment during the enrollment period.

Tumor tissue sample availability (fresh or archival within 6 months before the first dose of the study drug) was required at enrollment; an optional tumor biopsy was recommended but not required at disease progression. Patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC after disease progression on first-line first- or second-generation TKI were eligible only if they also had disease progression on second-line osimertinib. Presence of treated or asymptomatic brain metastases or a history of smoking was allowed. Patients with known ALK translocations or any previous systemic therapy other than the above-listed EGFR TKIs were excluded.

### Clinical activity of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade in never, light, and heavy smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50 [^116vuGLW]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 50%. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) also predicts response to ICIs but is often not available in real time for decision making in the first-line setting. Smoking exposure can be a proxy for TMB in NSCLC. The impact of smoking status on the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% has not been well defined.

- **Patients and methods**: To investigate the relationship between smoking and the activity of ICIs in NSCLC, we retrospectively studied 315 patients with NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% at five USA academic medical centers. Objective response rates (ORRs), progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) were compared between never (10 pack-years) smokers. A subset of patients underwent next-generation sequencing to estimate TMB.

- **Results**: We identified 36 (11%) never, 42 (13%) light, and 237 (75%) heavy smokers with NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% treated with ICIs. Objective responses were observed in 27%, 40%, and 40% of never, light, and heavy smokers, respectively (P = 0.180 never versus heavy; P = 1.000 light versus heavy). Median PFS and median DOR were numerically shorter in never and light smokers compared with heavy smokers (PFS 3.0 versus 4.0 versus 5.4 months; median DOR 6.9 versus 10.8 versus 17.8 months), but were not statistically different [PFS: hazard ratio (HR) 1.37, P = 0.135].

### Single or combined immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^115DMuJH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have changed the first-line treatment of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single-agent pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD-L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic antibody) in first-line NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression.

The combination of first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%.

Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics.

### Development and validation of a supervised deep learning algorithm for automated whole-slide programmed death-ligand 1 tumour proportion score assessment in non-small cell lung cancer [^117LAKF1]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

The 5-year survival rate of patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor. Coupled with two million new patients annually, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Immune checkpoint therapy (immunotherapy), targeting the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, has significantly improved survival rates for NSCLC patients. However, response to treatment varies greatly among NSCLC patients. Consequently, immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression is currently used as a biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy.

Pathologists measure PD-L1 expression by estimating the percentage of tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 positivity, known as the tumor proportion score (TPS; see also Formula 1 in Data S1). The TPS is a continuous score ranging between 0% and 100%. Patients are further divided into three classes, which are outlined in Figure 1. These classes determine different treatment options, provided no targetable mutation (EGFR) or fusion (ALK; ROS1) is detected.

- **Categories of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, measured as the tumor proportion score (TPS) (Formula 1 in Data S1)**: Blue staining: hematoxylin. Brown staining: PD-L1.
	- A. TPS of 50–100%.
	- B. TPS of 1–49%.
	- C. TPS of < 1%.

Unfortunately, this PD-L1 expression scoring system has been shown to be imperfect. The study by Cooper et al. demonstrated problematic interobserver and intraobserver discordance, with disagreement between pathologists in 15.8% of cases around the 1% cutoff point (κ coefficient).

### Outcomes with durvalumab by tumour PD-L1 expression in unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer in the PACIFIC trial [^112Buuhd]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

In the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab significantly improved progression-free and overall survival (PFS/OS) compared to placebo, with manageable safety, in patients with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without progression after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We report exploratory analyses of outcomes by tumour cell (TC) programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to intravenous durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or placebo for up to 12 months. The stratification was based on age, sex, and smoking history, but not PD-L1 status. Where available, pre-CRT samples were tested for PD-L1 expression (using immunohistochemistry) and scored at pre-specified (25%) and post hoc (1%) TC cut-offs. Treatment-effect hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from unstratified Cox proportional hazards models, with Kaplan-Meier-estimated medians.

- **Results**: A total of 713 patients were randomly assigned, with 709 receiving at least one dose of the study treatment: durvalumab (n = 473) or placebo (n = 236). Out of these, 451 (63%) were PD-L1-assessable. The distribution was as follows: 35% had TC ≥ 25%, 65% had TC < 25%, 67% had TC ≥ 1%, 33% had TC < 1%, and 32% had TC 1%-24%. As of 31 January 2019, the median follow-up was 33.3 months. Durvalumab improved PFS compared to placebo (data cut-off for primary analysis was 13 February 2017) across all subgroups:

- **TC ≥ 25%**: HR 0.41 (95% CI 0.26–0.65; 17.8 versus 3.7 months)
- **TC < 25%**: HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.43–0.82; 16.9 versus 6.9 months)
- **TC ≥ 1%**: HR 0.46 (95% CI 0.33–0.64; 17.8 versus 5.6 months)
- **TC < 1%**: HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.48–1.11; 10.7 versus 5.6 months)
- **TC 1%-24%**: HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.30–0.80; not reached)

The findings suggest a consistent benefit of durvalumab across various PD-L1 expression levels in this patient population.

### Surgical results of the lung cancer mutation consortium 3 trial: A phase II multicenter single-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with stages IB-select IIIB resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^112v8agB]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab as a neoadjuvant treatment based on the major pathologic response (MPR), defined as 10% or less viable tumor tissue scored by the designated institutional pathologist using standardized criteria, an endpoint previously reported to associate with overall survival (OS). Secondary efficacy objectives included safety per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0, radiologic response (RECIST v1.1), pathologic complete response in the primary tumor, pathologic response according to tumor PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutation burden. Exploratory efficacy objectives included disease-free survival (DFS) and OS, as well as multiple exploratory biomarker objectives designed to identify predictors of response to atezolizumab. These will be the subject of future reports.

The sample size was based on the primary objective of determining the MPR rate of 15%. The primary endpoint was assessed by a statistical test of a single proportion of responders against the simple alternative of a 5% response. The design provided a 95% statistical power to detect a difference of 10% at a significance level of 0.05 (one-sided test). To achieve this, approximately 180 patients were required for the study. If there were at least 17 patients with a primary tumor demonstrating MPR, the statistical test would reject the null hypothesis of a 5% response rate in favor of a higher response rate. Two interim analyses were performed: a safety analysis after 30 patients and a futility analysis after 90 patients were accrued.

### Association of high tumor mutation burden in non-small cell lung cancers with increased immune infiltration and improved clinical outcomes of PD-L1 blockade across PD-L1 expression levels [^116QBovp]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Data from the pooled cohort of 1,552 patients with non–small cell lung cancer treated with programmed death ligand–1 blockade were analyzed. The data sets were sourced from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Stand Up To Cancer/Mark Foundation. HR indicates hazard ratio; NR, not reached.

- **Characteristics of patients**: Patients with non–small cell lung cancer treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in the pooled cohort, from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Stand Up To Cancer/Mark Foundation data sets, were categorized according to TMB status. Abbreviations: NA, not applicable; PD-1, programmed cell death–1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TMB, tumor mutation burden.

Previous studies have shown that gradually increasing TMB levels are associated with progressively improving clinical outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) across different tumor types, suggesting a more continuous association of TMB with ICI efficacy. ORR, PFS, and OS progressively improved with increasing TMB percentile cutoffs (eFigures 15A, 15B, and 15C in the Supplement). As this improvement in outcomes could be influenced by TMB outliers, the response rate and the HRs for PFS and OS in each TMB decile were examined independently, relative to the lowest decile as reference. Only patients with a TMB at the uppermost percentiles had improved ORR, PFS, and OS after receiving immunotherapy.

### Five-year outcomes with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥ 50 [^115cyC6c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The long-term efficacy of pembrolizumab was further demonstrated by analysis of outcomes in the 39 patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab: 82.1% of patients were alive at data cutoff, and 46.2% were alive without PD or subsequent therapy. These data support the duration of treatment of up to 2 years with pembrolizumab.

Analysis of outcomes for patients on a second course of pembrolizumab showed such treatment was not only feasible but also associated with antitumor activity. Of the 12 patients who subsequently progressed and received a second course of pembrolizumab, two-thirds were alive at data cutoff. Notably, five of 12 were alive without PD. These data support pembrolizumab re-treatment upon PD.

Pembrolizumab was well-tolerated and was associated with a lower incidence of treatment-related AEs (any-grade and grade 3–5 toxicities) than platinum-based chemotherapy in the as-treated population and patients who completed 35 cycles. We did not identify new safety signals with long-term follow-up, and there was no evidence of increasing toxicity during long-term follow-up. Additionally, analysis of patients who discontinued pembrolizumab treatment because of treatment-related AEs revealed a median OS of 35.9 months, demonstrating favorable outcomes could occur in patients with early discontinuation because of AEs. Among patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, treatment-related AEs were similar to those observed in the trial overall, with a similar incidence of grade 3 and 4 events and no deaths. Together with improvements in efficacy outcomes, the lower incidence of adverse events supports the sustainable safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab.

### AENEAS: A randomized phase III trial of aumolertinib versus gefitinib as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations [^112bcJjz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are one of the most common oncogenic driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was initially approved based on the clinical efficacy demonstrated by the AURA program for the treatment of NSCLC patients with an EGFR T790M mutation. It was subsequently approved for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations.

- **In the pivotal FLAURA study**: Treatment with osimertinib resulted in a 54% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI. However, the toxicities of rash and diarrhea are strongly associated with inhibition of wild-type EGFR. There is a need for additional third-generation EGFR inhibitors that both offer effective first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC and are well-tolerated.

Aumolertinib (proposed international nonproprietary name; formerly almonertinib; HS-10296) is a novel, irreversible, third-generation EGFR TKI developed by Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China. Aumolertinib demonstrated higher selectivity against both EGFR-sensitizing and T790M mutations with less inhibition against wild-type EGFR than osimertinib. In March 2020, aumolertinib was approved in China based on APOLLO (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier) for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and an EGFR T790M mutation.

### Best first-line therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status [^117LBEfX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these individuals, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, with performance status (PS) being the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas those with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for individuals with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, individuals with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from important clinical trials due to poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. This knowledge gap is significant, as this group represents a substantial proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.

- **Objectives**: To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.

- **Search methods**: We utilized standard, extensive Cochrane search methods, with the latest search conducted on 17 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without an angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens specifically designed for individuals with PS 2 only, or studies including a subgroup of these individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included other relevant endpoints.

### Efficacy and safety of first line treatments for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutated, non-small cell lung cancer: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1152fV8E]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations. Firstly, unavoidable confounding factors remain in this inherently observational network meta-analysis based on data entirely from clinical trials. For example, because most treatments were compared indirectly and most direct evidence was from one trial in the present network, estimates should be interpreted with care for their reliance on previous distributions and assumptions of transitivity and consistency, even though only randomized controlled trials were included and assumptions were investigated. Methodological heterogeneity across studies was anticipated in this network meta-analysis; thus, the same model selection (fixed effects model) was applied in both pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, obtaining the highest generalizability in the pooled estimates.

Secondly, the present study also had potential publication and selection bias. For example, phase II clinical trials commonly present unclear randomization sequence generations in small sample sizes. We did not use funnel plots to assess the publication bias and small study effects given the small number of trials included in each comparison. Therefore, sensitivity analysis including only phase III trials was conducted, and relatively robust results were ensured.

Thirdly, data on overall survival might cause heterogeneity when taken as an endpoint to evaluate each individual treatment's realistic effect. This heterogeneity could be possible for two reasons. Although we initially searched for the most updated overall survival ha

### Comparative efficacy and safety of second-line treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113HrkXv]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not distinguish between the different types of data; namely, we considered the 11 trials (11%) only identified through a conference abstract as the same level of evidence as published trials in the quantitative analysis. However, when available, results obtained from the different reports were very similar.

Second, we could not formally assess the assumption of transitivity because, for most treatment comparisons, there are very few trials included. However, we observed small differences in terms of tumor histology and ethnicity, which are unlikely to violate the transitivity assumption. These differences might explain the small inconsistencies found for ObR and PFS. Nevertheless, our subgroup analyses did not reveal any important differences in the relative effects when these populations were analyzed separately (Additional file 1: Appendix Figure S5).

Third, for safety assessment, we focused on the number of SAEs because this allows a reproducible global assessment of severe toxicity. This outcome was actually the most frequently reported (52 of 102 trials, 51%), contrary to the number of grade 3–4 SAEs, which were only reported in 30 trials (29%). Reporting of specific adverse events is very heterogeneous across trials and did not allow the synthesis of evidence for each specific adverse event. Additionally, because of the lack of reporting of the number of SAEs across trials, we could not even infer the effect of these treatments.

Fourth, providing a broad panorama of all available evidence by considering trials pe

### American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update on chemotherapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer [^1135wYNX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide updated recommendations for the treatment of patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer. A literature search identified relevant randomized trials published since 2002. The scope of the guideline was narrowed to chemotherapy and biologic therapy. An update committee reviewed the literature and made updated recommendations. One hundred sixty-two publications met the inclusion criteria. Recommendations were based on treatment strategies that improve overall survival. Treatments that improve only progression-free survival prompted scrutiny of toxicity and quality of life.

- **First-line therapy**: For patients with a performance status of 0 or 1, a platinum-based two-drug combination of cytotoxic drugs is recommended. Nonplatinum cytotoxic doublets are acceptable for patients with contraindications to platinum therapy. For patients with a performance status of 2, a single cytotoxic drug is sufficient. Stop first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy at disease progression or after four cycles in patients who are not responding to treatment. Stop two-drug cytotoxic chemotherapy at six cycles even in patients who are responding to therapy.

- **EGFR mutation status**: The first-line use of gefitinib may be recommended for patients with a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. For negative or unknown EGFR mutation status, cytotoxic chemotherapy is preferred.

- **Additional treatments**: Bevacizumab is recommended with carboplatin-paclitaxel, except for patients with certain clinical characteristics. Cetuximab is recommended with cisplatin-vinorelbine for patients with EGFR-positive tumors.

Regarding the medical management of non-small cell lung cancer, and more specifically, the management of metastatic disease with genotype-driven therapy in the presence of an EGFR mutation, ASCO's 2025 guidelines suggest offering afatinib (Strong, Low), osimertinib, or standard treatment according to non-driver alteration recommendations as first-line therapy for patients with other activating EGFR alterations, such as G719X, L861Q, and S768I.

### Surgical results of the lung cancer mutation consortium 3 trial: A phase II multicenter single-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with stages IB-select IIIB resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^114wE26S]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Surgery is considered the primary curative therapy for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are medically fit for pulmonary resection. However, 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with resectable, locally advanced NSCLC (stage IB to IIIB disease) is only 26% to 68%. Patients who progress after resection typically develop distant metastatic disease. During the past 35 years, multiple clinical trials have shown that the addition of either adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy to surgical resection in patients with locally advanced NSCLC is feasible and increases the 5-year OS. Unfortunately, the absolute OS benefit with this approach is only approximately 5%, and patients experience significant toxicity. Although neoadjuvant therapy plus resection of locally advanced NSCLC has never been proven superior to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, it is widely used for locally advanced NSCLC. It has the potential advantages of early control of micrometastatic disease and is associated with better overall drug delivery because patients who start adjuvant therapy receive approximately 55% of the planned total dose. The neoadjuvant approach facilitates assessment of treatment safety and efficacy through serial scans before resection and pathologic evaluation of the degree of treatment response. It also enables pre- and post-treatment biomarker studies.

Multimodality treatment using platinum-based chemotherapy and either surgery or radiation for locally advanced NSCLC has remained at a therapeutic plateau for over 2 decades.

### Systemic therapy for locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: A review [^113obBVR]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Until the last decade, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was less than 5%. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease.

- **Observations**: Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict responses to treatment (e.g. EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin.

### Tarceva [^111HDuDB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Tarceva is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test. This treatment is applicable for first-line, maintenance, or second or greater line treatment after progression following at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. It is also used for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine.

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and efficacy of Tarceva have not been established in patients with NSCLC whose tumors have other EGFR mutations. Additionally, Tarceva is not recommended for use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

### Clinical outcomes of first-line therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review of trials published between 2010 and 2020 [^115KNkeU]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze the evolution of clinical outcomes derived from clinical trials on first-line therapies for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published between 2010 and 2020, focusing on how these outcomes impact survival rates and management of patients.

A systematic review of phase III and pivotal phase II clinical trials was conducted by a structured search on Medline and Embase. A comprehensive set of variables was collected to assess their influence on survival rates. We also estimated the clinical benefit by applying the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 and extracted the authors' conclusions.

Sixty-six studies involving 34,951 patients were included. Best survival outcomes were found for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival medians: 19.4 and 10.2 months) and for those expressing molecular targets (OS and progression-free survival medians: 23.8 and 11.0 months). No significant influence on survival rates was observed for industry funding and disease stage (IIIB/IV vs. IV). ESMO-MCBS v1.1 was applied in 45 positive studies and resulted in a meaningful clinical benefit score in 37.8%. Quality of life (QoL) was reported in 57.6% of the original publications and showed statistical significance favoring the experimental arm in 33.3%. Positive authors' conclusions (75.7% of trials) were based on OS and/or QoL in 34% and on surrogate endpoints in 66%.

Extended survival times and a steady improvement in QoL have been observed. However, there were more than twice as many studies reporting positive authors' conclusions based on surrogate endpoints compared to OS or QoL.

### Aeneas: A randomized phase III trial of aumolertinib versus gefitinib as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations [^112vdXdT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

In this article, we describe a randomized, phase III trial assessing aumolertinib as an intervention in the context of first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, using gefitinib as an active comparator. First-generation EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib, were traditionally considered the standard of care for disseminated and re-EGFR-mutated NSCLC until the approval of osimertinib by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2018 for first-line use, as demonstrated by the FLAURA trial. Subsequently, in December 2020, osimertinib was also approved for use as an adjuvant therapy for resected NSCLC, based on the results of the ADAURA trial.

Inherent to this robust progress is the observation that a longer duration of therapy magnifies the importance of tolerability, toxicity, and the cost of component therapy. Given the approval of only one third-generation EGFR inhibitor, there is a standing need for another highly efficacious and well-tolerated agent to diversify the treatment armamentarium.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of second-line treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115VF1FT]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. Furthermore, it is the fifth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in developed countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases. Most patients in Western populations present with wild-type or unknown status for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and do not have anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangements. Many patients receive a diagnosis at an advanced stage of disease and qualify for palliative systemic therapy.

Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2 and disease progression after first-line chemotherapy receive second-line treatments. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guidelines, updated in August 2015, recommend two cytotoxic drugs: docetaxel and pemetrexed (the latter only for non-squamous cell carcinoma). Additionally, two EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib, are recommended. However, several new treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including a combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. More than 40 treatments have been assessed in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

Conventional meta-analyses have only partially captured the available evidence for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Specifically, 29 systematic reviews published between 2009 and 2015 failed to incorporate the comprehensive range of evidence available at the time.

### Durvalumab as third-line or later treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ATLANTIC): an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study [^116at4oR]. The Lancet Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new standard of care for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR tyrosine kinase or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genetic aberrations (EGFR-/ALK-), but clinical benefit in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements (EGFR+/ALK+) has not been shown. We assessed the effect of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) treatment in three cohorts of patients with NSCLC defined by EGFR/ALK status and tumour expression of PD-L1.

- **Methods**: ATLANTIC is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial at 139 study centers in Asia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients had advanced NSCLC with disease progression following at least two previous systemic regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy (and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy if indicated); were aged 18 years or older; had a WHO performance status score of 0 or 1; and measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Key exclusion criteria included mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC histology; previous exposure to any anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody; and any previous grade 3 or worse immune-related adverse event while receiving any immunotherapy agent. Patients in cohort 1 had EGFR+/ALK+ NSCLC with at least 25%, or less than 25%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression. Patients in cohorts 2 and 3 had EGFR-/ALK- NSCLC; cohort 2 included patients with at least 25%, or less than 25%, of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression, and cohort 3 included patients with at least 90% of tumour cells with PD-L1 expression.

Regarding the medical management of non-small cell lung cancer, specifically in the context of metastatic disease, the first-line therapy recommendations from the ESMO 2025 guidelines are as follows. For patients with metastatic non-small cell cancer without driver alterations, a performance status of 0–1, and PD-L1 ≥ 50%, the guidelines recommend offering the following options (in addition to immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy), provided there are no contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and regardless of histology:

- **Nivolumab plus ipilimumab**: With 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.
- **Durvalumab plus tremelimumab**: With platinum-based chemotherapy, including 5 cycles of tremelimumab.
- **Tislelizumab plus pemetrexed**: With platinum-based chemotherapy.

### Pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [^117DZW4F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer enrolled in a phase 1 study. We also sought to define and validate an expression level of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) that is associated with the likelihood of clinical benefit.

- **Methods**: We assigned 495 patients receiving pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) to either a training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). We assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor samples using immunohistochemical analysis, with results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every 9 weeks by central review.

- **Results**: Common side effects attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 19.4%, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of progression-free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50% in the validation group, the response rate was 45.2%. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50%, median progression-free survival was 6.3 months; median overall survival was 12.0 months.

### EGFR exon 19 deletion is associated with favorable overall survival after first-line gefitinib therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients [^114j9hTi]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the impact of EGFR exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation in exon 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite both being common mutations, the difference in sensitivity among EGFR mutation subtypes remains debated.

The outcomes for 60 EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC patients, who received first-line gefitinib therapy (250 mg/d), were retrospectively analyzed based on EGFR mutation subtypes. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients were 11 and 26 months, respectively.

- **Results**: Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with exon 19 deletion (n = 28) showed significantly longer median PFS (20 vs. 8 months, P = 0.004) and OS (36 vs. 22 months, P = 0.001) compared to those with L858R mutation (n = 25) and uncommon or dual mutations (n = 7). Multivariate analysis indicated that exon 19 deletion (P = 0.007) was an independent prognostic factor for favorable PFS. Male sex (P = 0.049) was independently associated with poor PFS. Similarly, exon 19 deletion was independently linked to favorable OS (P < 0.0001), while male sex (P = 0.004) and primary metastatic disease (P = 0.032) were independent predictors of poor OS.

- **Conclusions**: EGFR exon 19 deletion was associated with favorable PFS and OS in patients receiving first-line gefitinib treatment. The EGFR mutation subtype should be considered in therapeutic decision-making.

### Iressa [^113nCKsF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Iressa for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R substitution mutations was demonstrated in a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical study (Study 1). A total of 106 treatment-naive patients with metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC received Iressa at a dose of 250 mg once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was the objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as evaluated by both a blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigators. Duration of response (DOR) was an additional outcome measure. Eligible patients were required to have a deletion in EGFR exon 19, L858R, L861Q, or a G719X substitution mutation, and no T790M or S768I mutation or exon 20 insertion in tumor specimens as prospectively determined by a clinical trial assay. Tumor samples from 87 patients were tested retrospectively using the therascreen® EGFR RGQ PCR Kit.

- **Study population characteristics**: The median age was 65 years, with 25% of patients aged 75 years or older, and 49% aged less than 65 years. All patients were white, with 71% female and 64% being never smokers. The World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) was 0 in 45% of patients, PS 1 in 48%, and PS 2 in 7%, with 97% having adenocarcinoma histology. Sixty patients had exon 19 deletions (65%), 29 patients had L858R substitution (31%), while two patients each had tumors harboring L861Q or G719X substitution mutation.

### Tarceva [^111LLvxM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Tarceva as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in Europe.

One hundred seventy-four (174) White patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg once daily until disease progression (n = 86) or four cycles of a standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n = 88). Standard chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, and carboplatin plus docetaxel.

The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by the investigator. Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1 vs. 2). EGFR mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trials assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 134 patients (69 patients from the erlotinib arm and 65 patients from the chemotherapy arm) were tested retrospectively by the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, cobas® EGFR Mutation Test.

### How to integrate current knowledge in selecting patients for first line in NSCLC [^114FBBtv]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of all lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer mortality. The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy using platinum-containing doublets has reached a therapeutic plateau with a median survival of approximately 1 year. The development of more effective strategies in the first-line setting remains challenging. In selected chemotherapy-naïve, advanced, non-squamous patients, the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy was shown to produce better outcomes than chemotherapy alone.

- **The potential benefit of maintenance/sequential treatment**: After initial platinum-based chemotherapy, this should be discussed in detail with each patient.
- **Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation determination**: This should be carried out in subgroups of patients characterized by a high prevalence of sensitizing mutations. When a mutation is present, first-line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be considered.
- **A phase I study using an oral ALK inhibitor**: This has produced promising results in NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements, indicating that ALK represents a new therapeutic target in a molecularly defined subset of NSCLC.

Ongoing studies in first-line therapy are focusing on targeted therapies and patient selection.

### Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy for stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer with mutations beyond EGFR 19del, L858R, and ALK rearrangement [^112sceNG]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (neoICT) is not currently recommended for patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic driver mutations, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). This study aimed to compare the pathologic response and survival outcomes between neoICT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neoChT) in patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC harboring driver mutations beyond EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del), exon 21 L858R, and ALK rearrangement.

- **Methods**: Patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC harboring driver mutations (EGFR 20ins/EGFR G719X/KRAS/BRAF/c-MET/HER-2/ROS1/RET/PIK3CA) who underwent neoICT or neoChT followed by curative-intent resection were retrospectively enrolled between November 2019 and August 2023. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors influencing survival outcomes after propensity score matching (2:1).

- **Results**: A total of 52 and 24 patients received neoICT and neoChT, respectively. Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations were detected in 67.1% (51 of 76) of patients. The major pathologic response (MPR) rates were 53.8% and 4.2%, respectively. NeoICT conferred better RFS than neoChT [2-year RFS rate: 79.5% vs. 49.9%; log-rank P = 0.012]. After matching, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that neoICT was associated with improved RFS compared with neoChT (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-).

### Five-year outcomes with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and programmed death ligand-1 tumor proportion score ≥ 1% in the KEYNOTE-042 study [^113DwC2f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The KEYNOTE-042 study design, identified on ClinicalTrials.gov, has been described previously. The study protocol (MK-3475–042, available online) received approval from institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at participating institutions.

Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pembrolizumab at 200 mg once every three weeks intravenously or carboplatin with an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg/mL/min. The latter group also received the investigator's choice of paclitaxel at 200 mg/m² once every three weeks for six cycles, or pemetrexed at 500 mg/m², followed by optional pemetrexed at the same dosage every three weeks for nonsquamous NSCLC. Treatment continued for up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab (approximately 2 years), or until confirmed complete response (CR) per RECIST v1.1, disease progression (PD), intolerable toxicity, investigator's decision, or patient withdrawal.

Patients assigned to pembrolizumab were eligible for a second course of pembrolizumab (up to 17 cycles) upon PD as assessed by investigators, if they had stopped initial treatment following a confirmed CR or completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab while in stable disease (SD) or better, and had not received any anticancer treatment since the last pembrolizumab dose.

- **End points**: The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), defined as time from random assignment to death from any cause, in PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, ≥ 20%, and ≥ 1%. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from random assignment to documented PD or death due to any cause, and objective response rate, being the proportion of patients with radiologically confirmed CR or partial response (PR), both assessed per RECIST v1.

### Comprehensive characterization of PD-L1 expression and immunotherapy-related genomic biomarkers in early- versus advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^117NHKba]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a key biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). With the successful application of perioperative immunotherapy, understanding PD-L1-associated clinical and molecular characteristics in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is essential.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 3185 NSCLC patients undergoing targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations between PD-L1 expression and molecular profiles were compared across early- (I-III) and advanced-stage (IV) cohorts.

- **Results**: In early-stage NSCLC (n = 974), high PD-L1 expression was less common than in advanced-stage patients (lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD]: 7.52% vs. 15.98%, p < 0.001; lung squamous cell carcinoma [LUSC]: 18.33% vs. 20.84%, p = 0.058). For LUAD, high PD-L1 expression was more frequent in older patients, males and smokers. Additionally, LUSC overall showed a higher rate of high PD-L1 expression than LUAD. In LUAD, early-stage patients had a lower proportion of tumor mutation burden-high (TMB-H) compared to advanced-stage patients (p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed in LUSC (p = 0.597). Early-stage patients also had a lower proportion of immunotherapy resistance genes than advanced-stage (LUAD: 31.15% vs. 48.50%, p = 0.014; LUSC: 13.64% vs. 45.24%, p = 0.0067). Moreover, among LUAD patients with high PD-L1 expression and all LUSC patients, early-stage patients exhibited more significantly different genetic features compared to advanced-stage patients.

### Systemic treatment for advanced (stage IIIb/IV) non-small cell lung cancer: More treatment options; more things to consider. Introduction [^114nuveQ]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer and a highly lethal disease, with improvements in survival rates dependent on advances in early detection and improved systemic therapies applied to surgery and/or irradiation in early-stage disease. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents around 80% of all lung cancers, and unfortunately, at diagnosis, most patients have advanced unresectable disease with a very poor prognosis. Indeed, 30%-40% of patients treated with first-line therapy will subsequently be candidates for second-line treatment.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved second-line treatments are docetaxel (a taxane), pemetrexed (a folate antimetabolite), and erlotinib (an epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]). Gefitinib, another EGFR TKI, currently has only limited use in North America and is not available in Europe. These and other new molecular-target-specific agents may have the potential to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity to normal cells.

Overexpression of EGFR is reported to occur in 40%-80% of NSCLC cases, and EGFR mutations are associated with a significantly higher response rate and longer duration of response following treatment with EGFR TKIs. Another option is antiangiogenesis: the growth and persistence of solid tumors and their metastases are angiogenesis dependent, and so antiangiogenic therapies have been developed, such as the use of TKIs that block the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs have antiangiogenic activity.

### Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-001): 3-year results from an open-label, phase 1 study [^112Z6KKM]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has shown antitumor activity and is a first-line and second-line treatment option for patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-expressing advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We report updated 3-year safety and efficacy outcomes from the phase 1 study, KEYNOTE-001.

- **Methods**: KEYNOTE-001 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 1 study of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks) in treatment-naive or previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with measurable disease at baseline. Two cohorts were randomly assigned to a pembrolizumab dose using a computer-generated randomization schedule at cohort-dependent ratios, and a further four cohorts were assigned to a pembrolizumab dose without randomization. We present 3-year outcomes for the full analysis set of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, pooled for all pembrolizumab doses. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with an objective response, analyzed here as investigator-assessed response according to immune-related response criteria. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival, duration of response, and progression-free survival. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827, and is ongoing.

- **Findings**: Between May 8, 2012, and July 13, 2014, 550 patients (101 treatment-naive and 449 previously treated) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 34.5 months.

### Updated analysis of KEYNOTE-024: Pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater [^112gHw4K]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

In the randomized, open-label, phase III KEYNOTE-024 study, pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a programmed death ligand 1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater and without EGFR/ALK aberrations. We report an updated OS and tolerability analysis, including analyses adjusting for potential bias introduced by crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab.

Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab upon meeting eligibility criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival; OS was an important secondary endpoint. Crossover adjustment analysis was done using the following three methods: simplified two-stage method, rank-preserving structural failure time, and inverse probability of censoring weighting.

Three hundred and five patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 154; chemotherapy, n = 151). At data cutoff (July 10, 2017; median follow-up, 25.2 months), 73 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 96 in the chemotherapy arm had died. Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86).

### Erlotinib [^112rpgst]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – First-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutations**: The safety and efficacy of erlotinib as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in Europe.

One hundred seventy-four (174) White patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg once daily until disease progression (n = 86) or four cycles of a standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n = 88). Standard chemotherapy regimens included cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, and carboplatin plus docetaxel. The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator.

Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1 vs. 2). EGFR mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trials assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 134 patients (69 patients from the erlotinib arm and 65 patients from the chemotherapy arm) were tested retrospectively by the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, cobas® EGFR Mutation Test.

### Nivolumab plus chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after disease progression on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Final results of CheckMate 722 [^111WgZsH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Tumor progression or response was assessed via computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary endpoints included 9- and 12-month PFS rates, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 as reviewed by BICR. Exploratory endpoints comprised PFS and OS subgroup analyses by baseline tumor PD-L1 status, PFS2 (PFS after the subsequent line of therapy), safety and tolerability in all treated patients, and patient-reported outcomes assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Post hoc analyses included PFS and OS by sensitizing/nonsensitizing mutation, by the number of previous EGFR TKI lines, as well as by baseline patient and disease characteristics.

EGFR mutations were determined through local laboratory testing. Patients could have multiple EGFR tumor mutations. For subtype analyses, the classic sensitizing EGFR mutations consisted of exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations. All other EGFR mutations were classified as nonsensitizing, including L861Q, exon 20 insertion, G719X, and S768I. Although the T790M mutation is known to be sensitive to osimertinib, patients were eligible for enrollment only following a protocol amendment in November 2018. Those with T790M-mutant tumors without another sensitizing mutation were categorized in the nonsensitizing mutation subgroup in the final EGFR mutation subanalyses. T790M-negative status was confirmed by a central or local laboratory.

### Anti-TIGIT inhibitors plus PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors versus PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^11631uD7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

- **Primary outcomes**: Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death from any cause (time to death) or the study end date if the participant was alive. We will compare the one-, two-, and five-year OS between groups to assess both short- and long-term survival outcomes. Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to objective disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first [Eisenhauer 2009]. Similarly, we will evaluate this outcome at one, two, and five years. Toxicity is graded by severity using the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, including the percentage of treatment-related deaths (NCI-CTCAE 2017), as well as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) after treatment or any follow-up time, if separate data are available.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment based on the immunotherapy RECIST (iRECIST) criteria at one, two, and five years [Seymour 2017]. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is measured by a validated scale or disease-specific scale (e.g. EORTC QLQ-C30) after treatment or during any follow-up time at one, two, and five years.

### Severe immune-related adverse events are common with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade and osimertinib [^115UobqQ]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

We identified 126 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR-TKI between March 2011 and September 2018 at MSKCC, inclusive of 180 distinct sequential drug exposures. Seventy-four (59%) patients received nivolumab, 27 (21%) pembrolizumab, 17 (14%) atezolizumab, and 8 (6%) durvalumab. Among our cohort, during their disease course, 104 patients (83%) received erlotinib, 58 patients (46%) received osimertinib, 23 (18%) received afatinib, and 2 (2%) received gefitinib.

- **Severe irAEs with PD-(L)1 inhibitors and osimertinib**: Forty-one patients were treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib, and 29 patients were treated with sequential osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1. This includes 9 patients who received osimertinib both before and after PD-(L)1 inhibition, who were counted in both groups due to distinct sequences of exposure and periods of irAE assessment. The clinical characteristics of these patients were typical of those with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
