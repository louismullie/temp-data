## Question

How to rule out pheochromocytoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to ruling out pheochromocytoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and when to test. Then, I should verify the optimal biochemical test and preanalytical precautions. Next, I will interpret results and decide when to repeat, suppress, or image. After that, I need to check imaging indications and modalities. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, including adrenal incidentalomas and patients with extra-adrenal malignancy. Finally, I should confirm what constitutes a safe rule-out and outline documentation and follow-up, including genetic counseling where appropriate [^111AXFyp] [^1164qtEo] [^112GfhZt].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios that warrant biochemical testing, because pretest probability drives the value of a negative result. I need to ensure I include paroxysmal or labile hypertension, spells with headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, hypertension refractory to usual therapy, and adrenal incidentalomas, especially with attenuation ≥ 10 HU on unenhanced CT, as well as patients with hereditary syndromes or a prior history of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma [^111AXFyp] [^115usEYn] [^115ismee] [^112GfhZt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms alone; I should double-check that no single sign or symptom reliably rules in or out disease, so clinical gestalt cannot replace biochemistry. Systematic reviews show that while the classic triad increases suspicion, no individual feature has sufficient diagnostic value, reinforcing the need for metanephrine-based testing rather than relying on phenotype alone [^112ZRMkE] [^115FQFvN] [^115XcqCT].

> Next, I should review the first-line biochemical test. Plasma free metanephrines offer the highest sensitivity (about 96–100%) and are preferred when available, particularly for incidentalomas and asymptomatic presentations; urinary fractionated metanephrines are acceptable alternatives with slightly lower sensitivity but still excellent performance, and both markedly outperform older assays like VMA or total metanephrines [^117RCsyJ] [^1164qtEo] [^116Ppq5d].

> Wait, let me verify preanalytical pitfalls that can create false positives, because I need to ensure the sample is valid before interpreting results. Blood should be drawn after 30 minutes supine rest in a fasting state, and I should avoid sympathomimetics, tricyclics, MAOIs, and serotonergic agents when possible; if the patient cannot stop interfering drugs, I should document them and interpret results cautiously, and consider repeating under optimal conditions or using suppression strategies if results are borderline [^116Ppq5d] [^1154zX2C].

> I will now examine how to interpret results. A normal plasma free metanephrine panel essentially rules out pheochromocytoma in most settings given the very high sensitivity; however, I should confirm that borderline elevations, especially of normetanephrine, are common with poor preanalytics or in older adults, and that repeating the test or using age-adjusted interpretation can reduce false positives without sacrificing sensitivity [^117RCsyJ] [^116aDev4] [^11667N4Z].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a negative biochemical test alone might be enough to stop in all cases; but hold on, I should verify exceptions. In patients with very high pretest probability, such as strong spells with classic features or a suspicious adrenal mass, I need to ensure that sampling was optimal and consider repeating the test or proceeding to confirmatory strategies if clinical suspicion remains high despite a single negative result [^111AXFyp] [^116Ppq5d].

> Let me consider confirmatory steps when results are mildly elevated or preanalytics were suboptimal. I should confirm that repeating plasma metanephrines under strict preanalytic conditions is reasonable, and if still equivocal, a clonidine suppression test can help distinguish true from false positives; I need to ensure I avoid outdated or risky tests like the glucagon stimulation test, which has poor sensitivity and potential hypertensive risk and should not be used for routine exclusion [^114sashY] [^1139cSmr].

> Next, I should review when to image, because imaging before biochemistry risks incidentalomas and unnecessary procedures. Imaging is indicated only after biochemical confirmation of catecholamine excess; CT of the abdomen and pelvis is typically first-line for localization, with MRI preferred when radiation is a concern or in pregnancy, and functional imaging reserved for specific scenarios such as extra-adrenal or metastatic disease or when anatomic imaging is inconclusive [^114jVRgb] [^11724eYE] [^116vKZvC].

> But wait, what if the adrenal mass has imaging features that make pheochromocytoma unlikely. I should double-check unenhanced CT attenuation; if the lesion is a homogeneous lipid-rich adenoma with HU less than 10 and there are no symptoms of catecholamine excess, routine biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma can reasonably be omitted, as the negative predictive value for pheochromocytoma approaches 100% in this context [^114GDsKi] [^115o4vkV] [^111JE2GW].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy and an indeterminate adrenal mass, I should obtain plasma or urinary metanephrines to exclude pheochromocytoma before any biopsy, because biopsy of a catecholamine-secreting tumor can precipitate a hypertensive crisis; similarly, in pregnancy, plasma metanephrines are preferred and imaging should avoid radiation when possible [^116Ee181] [^112pJtyN] [^116P3wA2].

> Let me reconsider what constitutes a safe rule-out. A normal plasma free metanephrine panel, collected under proper preanalytic conditions, effectively rules out pheochromocytoma in most patients; if clinical suspicion remains high or results were borderline, repeating the test or using confirmatory strategies is prudent, and in truly low-risk adrenal incidentalomas with HU less than 10 and no symptoms, foregoing biochemistry is reasonable [^117RCsyJ] [^112GfhZt] [^114GDsKi].

> I should confirm documentation and follow-up. I need to record the pretest probability, the specific assay used, preanalytic conditions, and how results change management; if biochemistry is normal and suspicion is low, I can return to routine care, but if suspicion persists, I should arrange follow-up and consider repeating testing or referral to an endocrine center, and I should discuss genetic counseling for all patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma given the substantial hereditary fraction [^112FMK1k] [^111yR9cn] [^115rUmaV].

> Finally, let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Assess pretest probability from symptoms, hypertension pattern, and imaging; if probability is low and the adrenal incidentaloma has HU less than 10 with no adrenergic symptoms, no testing is needed; if probability is not low, obtain plasma free metanephrines with strict preanalytics; interpret results in context, repeat or suppress if borderline; image only if biochemistry is positive; and tailor imaging modality to clinical context and patient factors, documenting each step and counseling on genetics when disease is confirmed [^111AXFyp] [^1164qtEo] [^112GfhZt].

To rule out pheochromocytoma, **plasma free metanephrines** are the first-line test due to their high sensitivity (96–100%) [^117RCsyJ] and ability to exclude disease when results are normal [^116F1C42]. If plasma testing is unavailable, **24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines** are an acceptable alternative [^1164qtEo] [^113FFGxB]. Imaging is reserved for patients with **biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess** [^114jVRgb] to localize the tumor [^11724eYE]. Clinical features alone cannot reliably exclude pheochromocytoma [^112ZRMkE], so biochemical testing is essential in all patients with suggestive symptoms or adrenal incidentalomas [^111AXFyp] [^113t9cgr].

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Pheochromocytoma presents with a wide range of symptoms due to catecholamine excess, including:

- **Hypertension**: Sustained or paroxysmal, often refractory to standard therapy [^115usEYn].
- **Classic triad**: Episodic headache, sweating, and palpitations [^112mLC5T].
- **Other symptoms**: Anxiety, tremor, pallor, nausea, weight loss, and orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].

However, **clinical features alone cannot reliably exclude pheochromocytoma**, as symptoms are nonspecific and may be absent or mild, particularly in asymptomatic or incidental cases [^112ZRMkE] [^111JE2GW].

---

## Biochemical testing

Biochemical confirmation of catecholamine excess is the cornerstone of diagnosis [^116Ppq5d]. The **two main approaches** are plasma free metanephrines and urinary fractionated metanephrines [^1164qtEo].

Key characteristics of plasma and urinary metanephrine testing:

| **Aspect** | **Plasma free metanephrines** | **Urinary fractionated metanephrines** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 96–100% [^117RCsyJ] [^116F1C42] | 92–100% [^notfound] |
| Specificity | 85–100% [^116F1C42] | 85–98% [^notfound] |
| Advantages | High sensitivity allows confident exclusion of pheochromocytoma when results are normal [^117RCsyJ]; rapid results; convenient for patients [^notfound] | Useful when plasma testing is unavailable; less affected by acute stress or posture [^116Ppq5d] |
| Limitations | False positives can occur, particularly in older adults or those with chronic illness; strict preanalytical conditions are required (supine rest, fasting, avoidance of sympathomimetic drugs) [^113bRX7S] [^116Y8efZ] [^116Ppq5d] [^112fx3bw] [^1154zX2C] | Requires accurate 24-hour urine collection; false positives can occur with certain medications or dietary factors [^115TjeAx] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is reserved for patients with **biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess** to localize the tumor [^114jVRgb]. Commonly used modalities include:

- **CT scan**: First-line imaging for adrenal localization [^112fx3bw].
- **MRI**: Preferred for pediatric patients, pregnant women, or when radiation exposure must be minimized [^112fx3bw].
- **MIBG scintigraphy**: Useful for detecting extra-adrenal or metastatic disease, particularly in paragangliomas or recurrent cases [^116vKZvC] [^112fx3bw].

---

## Special considerations

Certain clinical scenarios require **specific approaches**:

- **Adrenal incidentalomas**: Biochemical testing is recommended for all incidentalomas, regardless of symptoms, to exclude pheochromocytoma [^113t9cgr] [^111AXFyp].
- **Patients with extra-adrenal malignancy**: Biochemical testing is recommended even if the adrenal mass is likely metastatic, as pheochromocytoma can mimic metastasis [^116Ee181] [^113W3r4L].
- **Pregnancy**: Plasma free metanephrines are preferred due to their high sensitivity and safety profile [^notfound].

---

## Summary of approach to rule out pheochromocytoma

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical suspicion based on symptoms, hypertension, or adrenal incidentaloma [^115usEYn] |
| 2 | Biochemical testing with plasma free metanephrines (preferred) or urinary fractionated metanephrines [^117RCsyJ] |
| 3 | If biochemical tests are normal, pheochromocytoma is excluded [^117RCsyJ] |
| 4 | If biochemical tests are positive, proceed to imaging (CT/MRI) to localize tumor [^114jVRgb] |
| 5 | Consider additional functional imaging (MIBG) if extra-adrenal or metastatic disease is suspected [^116vKZvC] |

---

Biochemical testing with plasma free metanephrines is the **most reliable way to rule out pheochromocytoma**, given its high sensitivity and specificity [^117RCsyJ]. Imaging is reserved for patients with biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess [^114jVRgb]. Clinical features alone cannot reliably exclude pheochromocytoma, making biochemical testing essential in all suspected cases [^112ZRMkE].

Conclusions

Bottom line

By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, in order to specify the value of clinical findings-alone or in combination- in favor or against the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma more accurately, to help us distinguish patients who require more evaluation, from those who require no further testing. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging.

Why is this question important?

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor with an annual incidence of 1–4/10 6 population. It is popular for causing hypertension; however, It is an uncommon cause of hypertension, estimated to occur in approximately 0.1 to 1% of hypertensive patients. It is suggested that most doctors meet only one patient with pheochromocytoma in their working lifetime and a large general hospital admits-on average- one such patient annually. Despite the low frequency, pheochromocytoma is fascinating and challenging to clinicians because it has lethal potential if untreated, and possible long term cure -in the majority- if diagnosed and treated surgically. Clinical awareness of this tumor should be stressed because 1) Surgical removal is curative in more than 90% of patients (The 5-year patient survival after removal of benign pheochromocytoma has been ranged from 84 to 96%), 2) Tumor excision has significant effect on hypertension, the most important cause of pheochromocytoma related mortality and morbidity. In the follow up of surgeries, it has been shown that about 60% of patients became normotensive. In patients with persistent hypertension after surgery, the mean arterial pressure decreased significantly and was controlled better with anti-hypertensive drugs; hypertensive crises disappeared after surgery; and hypertension-related complications regressed significantly, 3) Biochemical testing and imaging together have high accuracy in detection of the disease 4) Some drugs and in particular, anesthetic agents may potentiate the life-threatening effects on the heart and circulation of catecholamines secreted by this tumor, and 5) If it is left untreated, fatal complications often ensue, most of which are related to hypertension (In a series of autopsy from the Mayo Clinic that spanned 50 years, 75% of the cases were undiagnosed during life, although they were symptomatic). Thus, early clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is imperative, to allow clinicians to efficiently complete further investigations and initiate appropriate treatment with the goal of minimizing morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Literature search

We reviewed Medline database from 1960 to February 2014 by the structured search strategy including both text word and MeSH term of the following keywords: pheochromocytoma, diagnosis, physical examination, medical history taking, sensitivity and specificity, reproducibility of results, observer variation and predictive value of tests; We limited the results to English language and humans 1. The results were reviewed by two of the authors for relevance and quality. The aim was looking for original articles which reported the sensitivity and/or specificity of symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. Then, the results were discussed and the papers which the authors had disagreement, were given to the third author for decision about inclusion. We chose the papers which their method for disease-confirmation was based on histopathology and the data was extracted before diagnosis of the disease (in order to resolve recall bias). We excluded papers which studied a specific subtype of pheochromocytoma (e.g. malignant or familial), or just syndromes that pheochromocytoma was a part of them (e.g. MEN, Von Hippel Lindau disease). Also, we excluded the studies on only specific age/gender. Moreover, we reviewed the papers studying the value of biochemical testing in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (we thought that these studies more possibly have specificity of symptoms beside their sensitivity, because of having control group); if they had clinical data of the patients, and if they had no clinical relevant data, we sent an email to the authors and asked for their clinical data if available. On the other hand, we tracked the references of review articles to find more original articles. In addition to electronic search, we did hand-searching using endocrinology textbooks.

Definitions

We defined hypertension as blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg. As this definition was accepted in the fifth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) in 1993, we sent emails to the authors of articles published before this time with no definition for hypertension in the article and asked if their definition was the same, and if we got no response, we ommited the article from analysis. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic (20 mmHg) or diastolic (10 mmHg) blood pressure within 3 min of standing. Finally, because the definitions were different among the studies which checked this sign, we separately discussed the articles in the result section.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^113tBGtE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

An adjustment for age in interpretation of results of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements may significantly improve the high false positive rate seen with this test when aiming to exclude sporadic pheochromocytoma. This improvement in specificity may result in savings in expenditures related to confirmatory imaging. Additional research is needed to investigate the generalizability of these findings in other clinical centres.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Adrenal mass biopsy and metastasis evaluation states that a history of a primary cancer outside of the adrenal gland raises the question of metastatic disease to the adrenals; it is very important that PCC is ruled out prior to considering diagnostic biopsy of the adrenal mass; an image-guided needle biopsy can be considered only if clinical suspicion for PCC is low, plasma or urine fractionated metanephrines (with or without catecholamines) are normal, and the results will impact disease management; false-negative biopsies are possible; therefore, proceeding directly to surgery should be considered in some cases; if the tumor is determined to be a metastasis from another site, treatment should be according to the appropriate NCCN disease-specific treatment guideline; if biopsy reveals adrenocortical tissue, then functional evaluation should proceed as described.

Based on our definition of heterogeneity, all of our data in groups were heterogenous (except negative LR of hypertension with I 2 of 43.2%); so we did meta-analysis with random effect. Number of studies which had reported sensitivity of signs/symptoms, pooled sensitivity with method of random effect and its 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table 3.

Based on funnel plot and Egger test, paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias.

As we mentioned before, seven of the articles had control group, and therefore could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Seven of the symptoms were evaluated in these articles: palpitation, diaphoresis, classic triad, hypertension, weakness/fatigue, anxiety and flushing. We draw the 2 × 2 table for each of the symptoms/signs and meta-analyzed the LRs with meta-disc software (Table 5).

### Pheochromocytoma: recommendations for clinical practice from the first international symposium. October 2005 [^114yodJd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

The First International Symposium on Pheochromocytoma, held in October 2005, included discussions about developments concerning these rare catecholamine-producing tumors. Recommendations were made during the symposium for biochemical diagnosis, localization, genetics, and treatment. Measurement of plasma or urinary fractionated metanephrines, the most accurate screening approach, was recommended as the first-line test for diagnosis; reference intervals should favor sensitivity over specificity. Localization studies should only follow reasonable clinical evidence of a tumor. Preoperative pharmacologic blockade of circulatory responses to catecholamines is mandatory. Because approximately a quarter of tumors develop secondary to germ-line mutations in any one of five genes, mutation testing should be considered; however, it is not currently cost effective to test every gene in every patient. Consideration of tumor location, presence of multiple tumors, presence of metastases, and type of catecholamine produced is useful in deciding which genes to test. Inadequate methods to distinguish malignant from benign tumors and a lack of effective treatments for malignancy are important problems requiring further resolution.

Abbreviations: a OH othostatic hypotension, SBP systolic blood pressure, DBP diastolic blood pressure

Based on funnel plot and Egger test, paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias.

As we mentioned before, seven of the articles had control group, and therefore could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Seven of the symptoms were evaluated in these articles: palpitation, diaphoresis, classic triad, hypertension, weakness/fatigue, anxiety and flushing. We draw the 2 × 2 table for each of the symptoms/signs and meta-analyzed the LRs with meta-disc software (Table 5).

Pooled estimation of LR for symptoms and signs of pheochromocytoma

a In all but classic triad, the control group was highly suspected but ruled out pheochromocytoma. In the classic triad, the control groups were patients with hypertension

b These symptoms were evaluated in Stein's article. 16

c The definition of orthostatic hypotension in Plouin study was falling SBP > 10 mmHg, and the control group was patients with essential hypertension

Limitations

The limitations of our study were looking for English articles only, and using only PubMed for our search. For compensation of this limitation, we used reference tracking for expanding the results. This was done till we reached the point that the articles we were finding became duplicated. Also we looked at articles which aimed to diagnose pheochromocytoma biochemically (we hoped to find control groups and therefore could calculate LR).

The other problem was verification bias. Patients with known signs/symptoms are usually referred for evaluation of pheochromocytoma. Patients with less common presentations are less evaluated and this overestimates sensitivity and underestimates specificity of the findings. Because most of the studies were done in referral centers, the verification bias would further increases. Doing the studies in tertiary referral centers also cause spectrum bias, because the prevalence of pheochromocytoma defers from the general population in this setting. In some of the studies found, the prevalence of pheochromocytoma in the population studied was reported. This, has a range of 1.5–6.7% (compared to prevalence of 1–4 × 10 −6 in the general population).

An important point is the paucity of studies about value of clinical presentation regarding pheochromocytoma. Because of heterogeneity of most of the clinical studies and wide confidence interval of results, additional studies are recommended to narrow the confidence intervals and increase the precision of the results.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^115XcqCT]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

By drawing the Funnel plot for each sign/symptom and doing Egger test for assessing publication bias, paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on our definition. So, these items reasonably should be excluded from our final report.

At last, when we look at the table of LRs, it seems that no single sign or symptom alone is helpful in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Rather, the combination (such as the classic triad) can be probably important for this aim. Despite flushing and pallor had significant positive LRs and headache had significant negative LR, these were evaluated in only one study and additional studies should be done for more accuracy. Studying the triad in hypertensive patients decrease the spectrum bias and approximates the LRs to reality in clinical setting. According to Plouin's study (11 pheochromocytoma in 2585 hypertensive patients), the probability of pheochromocytoma in hypertensive patients with classic triad becomes 2.6%, compared with 0.4% in hypertensive patients. By experts' consensus, this number could be high enough for continuation of evaluating the disease. On the other hand, the probability of pheochromocytoma in hypertensive patients without classic triad becomes 0.05% (compared with 0.4% in patients with classic triad). So it seems reasonable to clinically rule out the disease by this data.

Scenario resolution

Case 1: As the essential hypertension is most commonly seen in middle aged population, the presence of paroxysmal hypertension in a young patient leads us to pathological conditions such as pheochromocytoma. The presence of classic triad of headache, palpitation and sweating raises the clinical suspicion 6 times. The other symptoms (dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea) are not independent. So we cannot simply multiply them to calculate the final LR. By considering the value of signs and symptoms, we decided to move forward in our evaluation. The level of urine catecholamines was increased. Imaging showed a 3 cm mass in left adrenal gland. The patient was referred to surgeon for left adrenalectomy. The pathologist reported chromaffin cells and the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was proved. The attacks of the patient subsided after surgery and the blood pressure became stable during 2 years of follow up.
Case 2: The patient was a known hypertensive patient from 5 years ago on anti-hypertensive drugs. Symptoms of emergent hypertension were asked from the patient (chest pain, blurred vision, hematuria, and headache) and a complete physical exam was done. Then, he was given oral anti-hypertensive drugs and observed for 4 h. He was discharged from the Emergency department and was recommended to visit his family physician. The absence of classic triad and other parts of the history made pheochromocytoma less probable.

### Isolated adrenal mass in patients with a history of cancer: remember pheochromocytoma [^113W3r4L]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In a patient with a history of cancer, an isolated adrenal mass is usually thought to be a metastasis. Although a biochemical work-up to rule out pheochromocytoma is recommended, some question its practicality. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of functional adrenal lesions in patients with a history of cancer and examine predictive factors for the type of lesion.

Methods

At a single institution, 33 patients with an isolated adrenal mass and a history of cancer underwent surgical treatment. Patients' records were retrospectively analyzed for type of adrenal lesion and other diagnostic parameters.

Results

There were 20 males and 13 females with a mean age of 58 ± 2 years. Of these, 20 (61%) had adrenal metastases, 8 (24%) had pheochromocytomas, and 5 (15%) had adrenal adenomas. Usual diagnostic criteria, including presenting symptoms, primary tumor, and other demographic characteristics, did not consistently predict the pathology of the lesion.

Conclusions

Nearly 1 in 4 resected adrenal masses in patients with a history of cancer were pheochromocytomas. The high incidence of pheochromocytoma in this series supports a thorough work-up, irrespective of previous cancer. Therefore, remember one thing in patients with an isolated adrenal mass and a history of cancer: pheochromocytoma.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^11667N4Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

If algorithm "B" (biochemical testing using the age-adjusted metanephrine score) would be used in 100,000 subjects with hypertension, 499/500 patients with pheochromocytoma (99.8%) would be expected to be detected and 98592/99,500 individuals without pheochromocytoma would be reassured with a negative test result (overall specificity of 99.1%). In algorithm "B", 3,485 individuals would undergo CT scanning and 2,100 individuals would undergo I-123 or I-131 MIBG imaging. The cost of imaging for algorithm "B" would be approximately 9.0 million dollars. Thus, use of the age-adjusted plasma metanephrine score for biochemical testing for sporadic pheochromocytoma in a hypothetical population of 100,000 tertiary care hypertensive patients could result in a cost savings of 36.7 million dollars with equal detection of pheochromocytoma cases, relative to using the same biochemical testing but interpreting fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements in a traditional fashion.

Discussion

The main purpose of this article was defining sensitivity and – if possible- LR of signs and symptoms in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We used the search strategy of "Rational Clinical Examination" for collecting articles in Medline from 1960 to 2014; and used reference tracking of review articles to find more relevant original articles. In addition to electronic search, we did hand-searching using endocrinology textbooks. The result of this search strategy was 37 articles. From 6 of these articles, we could fill the 2 × 2 table of LRs.

For evaluating the possibility of doing meta-analysis for our data, first we calculated heterogeneity of different symptoms, which all were heterogeneous according to definition of heterogeneity based on I 2 (except negative LR of hypertension with I 2 of 43.2%). Because of heterogeneity of data, we used random effect model for meta-analysis. For evaluating publication bias we used Egger test, which the P -value < 0.05 was considered significant and so the data was considered to have publication bias. This was true for 4 of the symptoms: paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing and weakness.

Result

The initial search strategy yielded 4118 results. And the result of our hand-searching was 13. Based on titles, 238 articles were selected. From the articles which had studied biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and we had sent emails to authors for clinical data, one article was received (ref 23). From these 238 articles, 31 were inappropriate type by abstract, 119 original and 88 review articles were extracted. After getting full-text for checking relevancy and quality analysis, and also considering inclusion and exclusion criteria for original articles, 29 were selected for data extraction. By reference-tracking, 12 more original articles were found. Totally 42 articles were considered for analysis. Based on our definition for hypertension, 4 articles were excluded because they were done before 1993, and the definition of hypertension was not specified, and there was no answer to our email for definition. All –but one- of the studies were based on medical records of the patients; the study of W. Lai et al. was based on questionnaire from the patients after diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which could make recall bias; so, this study was excluded from data analysis. Finally, 37 articles were analyzed (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Systematic review flow diagram

The characteristics of the articles are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Seven of these articles had control groups; five of which the control groups were the patients with suspected but excluded pheochromocytoma surgically or by follow-up, and in two others, the control group was hypertensive patients. In addition, in these two articles, the total population was hypertensive patients not the general population. So, data analysis of these two was done separately from the other five.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^113bRX7S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia, which can secrete excessive catecholamines. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma may include hypertension, pain (including headache, flank pain, abdominal pain, or chest pain), hyperhidrosis, anxiety or panic attacks, cardiac arrythmias, or sudden death. A pheochromocytoma may also be detected as an asymptomatic incidental adrenal mass seen on abdominal imaging. Metabolites of norepinephrine and epinephrine, specifically normetanephrine and metanephrine, may be measured in the plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, as described by Lenders et al. Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines has been called "the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma" and some investigators have recommended that such measurements "should be the test of first choice". In a recent systematic review of the world literature, we have observed that measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements have a high sensitivity ranging of 96 to100% and a variable specificity ranging from 82% to 100%. The specificity of fractionated plasma metanephrines in excluding pheochromocytoma appears lowest in populations without known genetic predisposition to disease (those in whom sporadic disease is sought), with a false positive rate of up to 18% in such patients. We have previously observed that the normetanephrine fraction is elevated in the majority of false positive test results and that false positives are associated with increasing age. Indeed, investigators from the National Institute of Health have agreed that, "measurements of plasma normetanephrine and metanephrine provide a highly sensitive test for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, but false positive results remain a problem". False positive biochemical test results may result in needless imaging procedures and generate excessive healthcare expenditures in detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma.

### Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma: which test is best? [^117RCsyJ]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends on biochemical evidence of catecholamine production by the tumor. However, the best test to establish the diagnosis has not been determined.

Objective

To determine the biochemical test or combination of tests that provides the best method for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter cohort study of patients tested for pheochromocytoma at 4 referral centers between 1994 and 2001. The analysis included 214 patients in whom the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed and 644 patients who were determined to not have the tumor.

Main Outcome Measures

Test sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, and positive and negative predictive values at different pretest prevalences using plasma free metanephrines, plasma catecholamines, urinary catecholamines, urinary total and fractionated metanephrines, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid.

Results

Sensitivities of plasma free metanephrines (99% [95% confidence interval, 96%-100%]) and urinary fractionated metanephrines (97% [95% CI, 92%-99%]) were higher than those for plasma catecholamines (84% [95% CI, 78%-89%]), urinary catecholamines (86% [95% CI, 80%-91%]), urinary total metanephrines (77% [95% CI, 68%-85%]), and urinary vanillylmandelic acid (64% [95% CI, 55%-71%]). Specificity was highest for urinary vanillylmandelic acid (95% [95% CI, 93%-97%]) and urinary total metanephrines (93% [95% CI, 89%-97%]); intermediate for plasma free metanephrines (89% [95% CI, 87%-92%]), urinary catecholamines (88% [95% CI, 85%-91%]), and plasma catecholamines (81% [95% CI, 78%-84%]); and lowest for urinary fractionated metanephrines (69% [95% CI, 64%-72%]). Sensitivity and specificity values at different upper reference limits were highest for plasma free metanephrines using receiver operating characteristic curves. Combining different tests did not improve the diagnostic yield beyond that of a single test of plasma free metanephrines.

Conclusion

Plasma free metanephrines provide the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma and should be the test of first choice for diagnosis of the tumor.

### Pheochromocytoma: state-of-the-art and future prospects [^114WfujX]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

This review provides current understanding of the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma and the wide range of associated clinical manifestations that have led to earlier recognition of the disease. In addition, it reviews optimal screening methods and localization techniques that have enhanced the clinician's ability to make the diagnosis with greater certainty. This article will also discuss alternative antihypertensive regimens and innovative anesthetic and surgical procedures that have made successful management more promising than ever before. Areas requiring further development include additional clinical experience with the measurement of plasma metanephrines that have been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of sporadic and familial pheochromocytoma, optimizing cost effectiveness of diagnostic imaging, improving the ability to predict and treat malignant pheochromocytoma, and elucidating not only the surgical approach but, perhaps with rapid advances in molecular genetics, ways of preventing familial pheochromocytoma.

### A systematic review of the literature examining the diagnostic efficacy of measurement of fractionated plasma free metanephrines in the biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma [^116F1C42]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements are commonly used in biochemical testing in search of pheochromocytoma. METHODS: We aimed to critically appraise the diagnostic efficacy of fractionated plasma free metanephrine measurements in detecting pheochromocytoma. Nine electronic databases, meeting abstracts, and the Science Citation Index were searched and supplemented with previously unpublished data. Methodologic and reporting quality was independently assessed by two endocrinologists using a checklist developed by the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Studies Accuracy Group and data were independently abstracted. RESULTS: Limitations in methodologic quality were noted in all studies. In all subjects (including those with genetic predisposition): the sensitivities for detection of pheochromocytoma were 96%-100% (95% CI ranged from 82% to 100%), whereas the specificities were 85%-100% (95% CI ranged from 78% to 100%). Statistical heterogeneity was noted upon pooling positive likelihood ratios when those with predisposition to disease were included (p < 0.001). However, upon pooling the positive or negative likelihood ratios for patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma (n = 191) or those at risk for sporadic pheochromocytoma (n = 718), no statistical heterogeneity was noted (p = 0.4). For sporadic subjects, the pooled positive likelihood ratio was 5.77 (95% CI = 4.90, 6.81) and the pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.02 (95% CI = 0.01, 0.07). CONCLUSION: Negative plasma fractionated free metanephrine measurements are effective in ruling out pheochromocytoma. However, a positive test result only moderately increases suspicion of disease, particularly when screening for sporadic pheochromocytoma.

### Personalized management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^115d9T3C]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the above, the Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Score (PASS) and Grading of Adrenal Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (GAPP) score are the only globally used risk-stratification systems based on histological features (the GAPP score also includes PGLs and additionally involves the catecholamine phenotype). A PASS score of 4 or higher indicates potential malignant behavior with a high sensitivity of close to 100%, but with a lower specificity (75% and 76%, respectively, in 2 studies). Thus, although metastatic behavior cannot be reliably predicted with a PASS score of 4 or higher, the "rule-out" of malignant behavior with a PASS score of < 4 or a GAPP score of < 3 seems to be fairly reliable. It also seems reasonable to include all aforementioned risk factors together with the PASS/GAPP score for a more accurate risk assessment. However, until this has been proven in larger patient cohorts, regular follow-up of all patients remains mandatory.

Current studies based on large patient cohorts report that 10% to 15% of PCCs and a significantly higher proportion of PGLs (35%-40%) develop metastases. However, currently there is no highly effective medical therapy available. The median overall survival of patients with metastatic PPGLs has recently been reported to be 7 years. In a large meta-analysis, 5- and 10-year mortality rates for patients with metastatic PPGLs were 37% (7 studies, n = 738) and 29% (2 studies, n = 55), respectively. The overall mortality rate in patients with metastatic PGLs was 46%, whereas overall mortality rate in patients with metastatic PCCs was 53%. In patients with metastatic skull base and neck PGLs, the overall mortality rate ranged from 34% to 56%.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^112mLC5T]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Although about 4% of adrenal masses incidentally found are known to be pheochromocytoma, this tumor is popular for its catecholamine secretion, and symptoms the catecholamines produce. The most catecholamines secreted are epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. Figure 1 illustrates the catecholamine metabolism in normal human cells. Normal adrenal glands contain mostly epinephrine. Most pheochromocytomas secrete predominantly norepinephrine; and about 15% secrete predominantly epinephrine. Dopamine β-hydroxylase, responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine, may be missing in immature tumors; Thus, the presence of a tumor secreting predominantly dopamine indicates a higher probability of malignancy. Pheochromocytoma has been called the "Great Mimic" since its manifestations can resemble so many other conditions, which may confuse clinicians. The clinical presentation varies, ranging from an adrenal incidentaloma to hypertensive crises with associated cerebrovascular or cardiac complications. The vast majority of symptoms and signs are attributable to the excess of catecholamines released by tumors continuously or paroxysmally. The most leading catecholamine-related sign for clinicians to suspect pheochromocytoma is hypertension. Related to hypertension, four patterns of blood pressure are seen. Sustained hypertension, paroxysmal hypertension, sustained hypertension with paroxysms, and normotension. This variation is somehow related to the catecholamine predominantly secreted by the tumor. The catecholamines exhibit different effects on different catecholamine receptors; typically, norepinephrine-mediated stimulation of α-receptors leads to vasoconstriction whereas epinephrine stimulates β 2 -receptors, causing vasodilatation. Subjects with predominantly norepinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma (noradrenergic phenotype) develop sustained hypertension more frequently than subjects with predominantly epinephrine-producing pheochromocytomas (adrenergic phenotype) who present more often with paroxysmal symptoms. Dopamine-producing tumors often present with normotension. Paroxysmal release of catecholamines constitutes the characteristic classic triad of episodic headache, sweating, and palpitations which is known as "an attack". In some patients, a particular stimulus triggers an attack. Anesthesia and tumor manipulation are the most well-known triggers for catecholaminergic crisis; positional change, exercise, and various medications (e.g. TCAs, opiates, metoclopramide and radiographic contrast agents) are other possible precipitating factors. In others, no clearly defined precipitating event can be found, and the episodes occur in a random pattern.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^117XLJzX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

We agree with observation by Eisenhofer and colleagues that when it comes to measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma, "false-positive results remain a problem", particularly when attempting to exclude sporadic disease. Originally, it was the hope was that measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines could result in cost savings because of avoidance of multiple biochemical tests. However, investigators from the National Institute of Health have recommended that clonidine-suppression tests need to be done in order to distinguish true positives from false positives. An alternative to clonidine-suppression testing may be measurement of 24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines in patients with mild to moderate elevations of the normetanephrine fraction (for normetanephrine values approximately one to two times the upper limit of the normal range). In our study, we have provided a unique alternative approach for improving specificity of interpretation of measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines. By adjusting the metanephrine score for age, we have shown that it may be possible to improve specificity of interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrines, with no loss of sensitivity in detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma, and potential savings in imaging expenditures.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116aDev4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma by measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines is limited by false positive rates of up to 18% in people without known genetic predisposition to the disease. The plasma normetanephrine fraction is responsible for most false positives and plasma normetanephrine increases with age. The objective of this study was to determine if we could improve the specificity of fractionated plasma measurements, by statistically adjusting for age. METHODS: An age-adjusted metanephrine score was derived using logistic regression from 343 subjects (including 33 people with pheochromocytoma) who underwent fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements as part of investigations for suspected pheochromocytoma at Mayo Clinic Rochester (derivation set). The performance of the age-adjusted score was validated in a dataset of 158 subjects (including patients 23 with pheochromocytoma) that underwent measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines at Mayo Clinic the following year (validation dataset). None of the participants in the validation dataset had known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was the same as that of traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements, yielding a sensitivity of 100% (23/23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 85.7%, 100%). However, the false positive rate with traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements was 16.3% (22/135, 95% CI, 11.0%, 23.4%) and that of the age-adjusted score was significantly lower at 3.0% (4/135, 95% CI, 1.2%, 7.4%) (p < 0.001 using McNemar's test). CONCLUSION: An adjustment for age in the interpretation of results of fractionated plasma metanephrines may significantly decrease false positives when using this test to exclude sporadic pheochromocytoma. Such improvements in false positive rate may result in savings of expenditures related to confirmatory imaging.

### Low sensitivity of glucagon provocative testing for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma [^1139cSmr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Pheochromocytomas can usually be confirmed or excluded using currently available biochemical tests of catecholamine excess. Follow-up tests are, nevertheless, often required to distinguish false-positive from true-positive results. The glucagon stimulation test represents one such test; its diagnostic utility is, however, unclear.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic power of the glucagon test to exclude or confirm pheochromocytoma.

Design, Setting, and Subjects

Glucagon stimulation tests were carried out at three specialist referral centers in 64 patients with pheochromocytoma, 38 patients in whom the tumor was excluded, and in a reference group of 36 healthy volunteers.

Main Outcome Measures

Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were measured before and after glucagon administration. Several absolute and relative test criteria were used for calculating diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Expression of the glucagon receptor was examined in pheochromocytoma tumor tissue from a subset of patients.

Results

Larger than 3-fold increases in plasma norepinephrine after glucagon strongly predicted the presence of a pheochromocytoma (100% specificity and positive predictive value). However, irrespective of the various criteria examined, glucagon-provoked increases in plasma catecholamines revealed the presence of the tumor in less than 50% of affected patients. Diagnostic sensitivity was particularly low in patients with pheochromocytomas due to von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Tumors from these patients showed no significant expression of the glucagon receptor.

Conclusion

The glucagon stimulation test offers insufficient diagnostic sensitivity for reliable exclusion or confirmation of pheochromocytoma. Because of this and the risk of hypertensive complications, the test should be abandoned in routine clinical practice.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of subjects without pheochromocytoma from the derivation set

Findings in the validation set

In the validation set of 158 subjects, 23 patients had histologically-proven sporadic pheochromocytoma (17 adrenal, 6 extra-adrenal, 8 malignant). Of the patients with pheochromocytoma, none were known to be genetically predisposed to pheochromocytoma and 14/23 were women (61%). The mean age of subjects with pheochromocytoma was 50 years (SD 16 years, range 16 to 83 years), whereas the mean age of subjects without pheochromocytoma was 55 years (SD 16 years, range 7 to 86 years). Of the 135 subjects without pheochromocytoma, 83 (62%) were women. Reasons for measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines in the subjects without pheochromocytoma were as follows: hypertension (55, 41%), spells with or without hypertension (44, 33%), an incidentally discovered adrenal mass (20, 15%), and previously surgically cured pheochromocytoma (16, 12%).

In the validation set, the sensitivity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was the same as the traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements at 100% (23/23, 95% CI, 85.7%, 100%). The specificity of the traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements was 83.7% (113/135 patients, 95% CI, 76.6%, 89.0%) and the specificity of the age-adjusted plasma metanephrine score was 97.0% (131/135 patients, 95% CI, 92.6%, 98.8%). Thus, the false positive rate with traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements was 16.3% (22/135, 95% CI, 11.0%, 23.4%) and with the age-adjusted score it was significantly lower at 3.0% (4/135, 95% CI, 1.2%, 7.4%) (Figure 1) (p < 0.001 using McNemar's test).

Economic evaluation (decision analysis)

We investigated whether use of an age-adjusted fractionated plasma metanephrine measurement could result in cost savings in imaging expenditures, compared to use of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements interpreted in a conventional fashion, for detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma in a hypothetical tertiary care hypertensive population. We thus performed a decision analysis, with resource implications defined by costs of confirmatory imaging (CT and MRI), interpreted from a third party payer perspective. In the decision analysis, we compared algorithm "A" in which biochemical testing consisted of measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines with these measurements interpreted relative to the 95% reference range (defined by a normetanephrine fraction above 0.9 nmol/L or a metanephrine fraction above 0.5 nmol/L) to algorithm "B", in which fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements were interpreted by using the age-adjusted metanephrine score. The sensitivity and specificity of biochemical tests was based on data from the validation set. In each algorithm, all patients with positive biochemical testing would undergo confirmatory imaging. The imaging protocol for patients with positive biochemical tests in either strategies began with computerized tomography ([CT] with and without intravenous contrast) of the abdomen, then if negative, I-131 or I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (efficacy for I-131 and costs for I-123 shown). The horizon (endpoint) of the analyses was positive diagnosis or exclusion of pheochromocytoma, for hypothetical hypertensive patients subjected to each strategy. The outcome of the analyses was the number of patients with pheochromocytoma expected to be detected by each strategy. The costs of false positive biochemical tests were reflected only in the costs of subsequent imaging and not in potential costs of needless surgery or its possible complications.

The diagnostic efficacy of imaging studies was based on respective estimates from the literature: The sensitivity of CT imaging of the abdomen was assumed to be 98% with a specificity of 70%. The sensitivity of MIBG in detecting benign sporadic pheochromocytoma was assumed to be 87.4% with a specificity of 98.9%.

All costs were reported in 2002 US dollars. Costs of imaging investigations were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Business Office. For the purpose of the decision analysis model, the prevalence of pheochromocytoma in the hypertensive population that would typically be screened was assumed to be 0.5%.

### Ordering pattern and performance of biochemical tests for diagnosing pheochromocytoma between 2000 and 2008 [^111HMvU2]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine what tests are ordered by physicians for pheochromocytoma diagnosis and how those tests perform in modern clinical practice.

Methods

In this case series, electronic medical records of patients seen between January 2000 and July 2008 at a large academic hospital in Los Angeles, California, were queried, and patients older than 15 years who underwent any 1 of 5 tests for pheochromocytoma (measurement of plasma catecholamines, plasma fractionated metanephrines, urinary catecholamines, urinary metanephrines, or urinary vanillylmandelic acid) were identified. Because testing was performed in various reference laboratories, test results were classified into 1 of 3 categories: (a) markedly elevated, (b) moderately elevated, or (c) normal. Patient demographics, clinical history, test results, imaging study findings, and pathology records were reviewed.

Results

A total of 3980 tests were ordered for 1898 patients. Pretest probability was 2.2% (based on 681 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was confirmed or excluded), and hypertension was the most common indication for testing. The number of patients tested and the number of tests ordered increased over the years. The ordering pattern stabilized since 2006 when urinary metanephrines, urinary catecholamines, and plasma metanephrines were ordered more frequently. Sensitivity was highest for urinary metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid, specificity was highest for vanillylmandelic acid and urinary catecholamines, and positive likelihood ratio was highest for vanillylmandelic acid. Positive predictive value for markedly elevated test results was 39% to 83%, while that for moderately elevated test results was only 2% to 14%.

Conclusions

Ordering pattern and test performance differ significantly from those recommended and reported by large centers. The best testing strategy should incorporate local experience. Categorizing test results as markedly elevated, moderately elevated, and normal is important for result interpretation.

### Pheochromocytoma: a changing perspective and current concepts [^1126YQc4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The two 'rules' of the modern era PPGL are: early detection and precise personalization, as established in the guidelines of the Working Group on Endocrine Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension. The precision of genetic testing is crucial for accurately establishing tumor behavior patterns in individuals. Personalization is also essential, including evaluating a patient's symptoms based on the likelihood of PPGL, establishing personalized cutoffs, and tailoring imaging. These improvements have led to earlier detection and more favorable outcomes in both survival and QOL. Multidisciplinary approaches and education for physicians are also vital for effective management. The future of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up should target the hereditary nature of PPGL for maximal clinical outcomes.

Legend – Pmet(s), fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements; traditional fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements are considered positive if the metanephrine fraction is greater than or equal to 0.5 nmol/L or the normetanephrine fraction is greater than or equal to 0.9 nmol/L; an age-adjusted metanephrine score is positive if it is greater than -1.4752. The difference between false positive rates is statistically significant with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test.

Imaging cost implications of screening strategies for pheochromocytoma

In the decision analysis, biochemical testing by measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines (traditional versus age-adjusted interpretation) was followed by CT imaging for all positive biochemical tests and if CT imaging was negative, then MIBG (I-123 or I-131) would be performed (Figure 2). For the purpose of the economic evaluation, in all three screening strategies, a 0.5% prevalence of pheochromocytoma was assumed in a target hypertensive population, so 500 patients with pheochromocytoma would be expected in a sample of 100,000 hypertensive subjects (Figure 2). Mayo Clinic Rochester charges for diagnostic studies were used: CT scan of the abdomen (with and without contrast) $1460, I-123 MIBG scan (with and without spect) $1875.

Figure 2
Decision analysis: Testing algorithm for pheochromocytoma in 100,000 hypothetical hypertensive subjects (including 500 individuals with pheochromocytoma)

If 100,000 subjects with hypertension would be screened using algorithm "A" (beginning with biochemical testing by measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines, traditional interpretation), 499/500 patients with pheochromocytoma (overall sensitivity 99.8%) would be expected to be detected (1 patient expected to have false negative CT and MIBG imaging); furthermore 94,510/99,500 of subjects without pheochromocytoma would be reassured with a negative diagnosis (overall specificity 95.0%). In algorithm "A", 16,718 individuals would undergo CT scanning and 11,363 individuals would undergo I-123 or I-131 MIBG imaging. The total cost of imaging for algorithm "A" would be estimated to be 45.7 million dollars.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112fx3bw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate clinical practice guidelines for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL).

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), seven experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force reviewed primary evidence and commissioned two additional systematic reviews.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, and Americal Association for Clinical Chemistry reviewed drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that initial biochemical testing for PPGLs should include measurements of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines. Consideration should be given to preanalytical factors leading to false-positive or false-negative results. All positive results require follow-up. Computed tomography is suggested for initial imaging, but magnetic resonance is a better option in patients with metastatic disease or when radiation exposure must be limited. (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy is a useful imaging modality for metastatic PPGLs. We recommend consideration of genetic testing in all patients, with testing by accredited laboratories. Patients with paraganglioma should be tested for SDHx mutations, and those with metastatic disease for SDHB mutations. All patients with functional PPGLs should undergo preoperative blockade to prevent perioperative complications. Preparation should include a high-sodium diet and fluid intake to prevent postoperative hypotension. We recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy for most pheochromocytomas with open resection for most paragangliomas. Partial adrenalectomy is an option for selected patients. Lifelong follow-up is suggested to detect recurrent or metastatic disease. We suggest personalized management with evaluation and treatment by multidisciplinary teams with appropriate expertise to ensure favorable outcomes.

### Is biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma in adrenal incidentalomas expressing low unenhanced attenuation on computed tomography necessary? [^114GDsKi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Pheochromocytomas are characterized by a high attenuation value on unenhanced computed tomography (CT). It is not known whether pheochromocytoma could be ruled out as a cause of adrenal incidentalomas on the basis of unenhanced attenuation values only.

Design

We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of routine biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma in a series of adrenal incidentalomas in relationship to the unenhanced attenuation values on CT.

Methods

An unenhanced CT was available in 174 of 184 patients with 214 adrenal incidentalomas. All patients were screened for pheochromocytoma with 24-h urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines and for hypercortisolism (1 mg dexamethasone test and ACTH). Hypertensive patients were screened for aldosterone overproduction (aldosterone to renin ratio and 24 h urinary aldosterone). The results were compared between incidentalomas with high [≥ 10 Hounsfield units (HU)] and low (< 10 HU) unenhanced attenuation values.

Results

One hundred forty-six incidentalomas in 115 patients had an unenhanced HU less than 10. None of these patients had elevated 24-h fractionated urinary metanephrines or normetanephrines suggesting pheochromocytoma. Sixty-eight incidentalomas in 59 patients had an unenhanced HU of 10 or greater, and nine (15.2%) of these patients had surgically and histologically verified pheochromocytoma. Incidentalomas with a HU of 10 or greater were significantly larger (2.6 ± 1.5 vs. 2.3 ± 1.2 cm; P < 0.001), more often functional (27.9 vs. 8.9%, P < 0.001), and more often operated (44.1 vs. 10.2%; P < 0.001) than those with a Hounsfield unit less than 10.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that routine biochemical screening of pheochromocytoma in small homogenous adrenal incidentalomas characterized by an unenhanced Hounsfield unit value less than 10 HU may not be necessary.

### Response to letter to the editor: "Approach to the patient: perioperative management of the patient with pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma" [^113rgYG6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, a small PPGL size or the absence of symptoms does not reliably predict a low perioperative risk. We do agree that the controversy with respect to the clinical value of presurgical treatment with α-adrenoreceptor blockers in modern-day medicine could be resolved only by a well-designed placebo-controlled trial. Until then, we recommend following the Endocrine Society's guideline that all patients with a PPGL, regardless of blood pressure and tumor size, should undergo preoperative evaluation of cardiac function and blood pressure and receive presurgical treatment with α-adrenoreceptor blockers.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^112JoRNy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The formula for adjustment of age was applied to fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements in the second dataset (validation dataset) for testing of sensitivity and specificity in a population in whom sporadic pheochromocytoma was sought. In the validation set, individuals with known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma were excluded. Sensitivities were calculated by division of subjects with true positive test results by all the subjects with pheochromocytoma, and specificities were calculated by division of subjects with true negative test results divided by all subjects without pheochromocytoma. For sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Wilson's method (except the Score Method was used for calculation of 95% CI of likelihood ratios when a zero cell was noted). The specificity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score were compared (at the same level of sensitivity) to traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements using McNemar's test.

### Approach to the patient with adrenal hemorrhage [^116Y8efZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with APS, adrenal insufficiency should be ruled out in the presence of abdominal pain, excessive fatigue, weight loss, or electrolyte disturbance (hyponatremia and/or hyperkalemia).

If an underlying adrenal tumor is suspected, hormonal assessment for a functional tumor can be challenging in hospitalized patients as the overnight dexamethasone suppression test can be falsely positive and the androgens may be low. Importantly, the levels of metanephrines and normetanephrines in hospitalized patients without pheochromocytoma may be indistinguishable from those seen in pheochromocytoma. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on the clinical picture, such as presence of Cushing syndrome, hirsutism, or features of pheochromocytoma. Unless the clinical course indicates urgent adrenalectomy, the hormonal workup is best undertaken in an outpatient setting.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116coEKQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Is calculation of an age-adjusted metanephrine score practical for use in daily clinical practice? In this day of palm pilots and desktop computers, we believe that it may be feasible for clinicians to enter the formula for age-adjustment into standard desktop spreadsheet software (such as Excel, Microsoft) and perform such adjustments in the clinic. Alternatively, laboratories can provide age adjusted values to physicians when reporting test results. Thus, we do believe that calculation of an age-adjusted score is feasible to assist physicians in interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements. Indeed, such calculations may be less cumbersome and may generate fewer healthcare expenditures than alternative procedures such as supplemental clonidine-suppression testing or collection of 24-hour urinary measures.

Our observations should, however, be validated in another population outside of Mayo Clinic. Of particular note, our findings are applicable only to the screening of pheochromocytoma in low risk subjects who do not have known genetic predisposition to disease. In high risk, genetically predisposed individuals, mild elevations of normetanephrine or metanephrine measurements may be clinically significant and should prompt imaging.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^116DDfzi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma by measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines is limited by false positive rates of up to 18% in people without known genetic predisposition to the disease. The plasma normetanephrine fraction is responsible for most false positives and plasma normetanephrine increases with age. The objective of this study was to determine if we could improve the specificity of fractionated plasma measurements, by statistically adjusting for age.

Methods

An age-adjusted metanephrine score was derived using logistic regression from 343 subjects (including 33 people with pheochromocytoma) who underwent fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements as part of investigations for suspected pheochromocytoma at Mayo Clinic Rochester (derivation set). The performance of the age-adjusted score was validated in a dataset of 158 subjects (including patients 23 with pheochromocytoma) that underwent measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines at Mayo Clinic the following year (validation dataset). None of the participants in the validation dataset had known genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma.

Results

The sensitivity of the age-adjusted metanephrine score was the same as that of traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements, yielding a sensitivity of 100% (23/23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 85.7%, 100%). However, the false positive rate with traditional interpretation of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements was 16.3% (22/135, 95% CI, 11.0%, 23.4%) and that of the age-adjusted score was significantly lower at 3.0% (4/135, 95% CI, 1.2%, 7.4%) (p < 0.001 using McNemar's test).

Conclusion

An adjustment for age in the interpretation of results of fractionated plasma metanephrines may significantly decrease false positives when using this test to exclude sporadic pheochromocytoma. Such improvements in false positive rate may result in savings of expenditures related to confirmatory imaging.

Follow-Up

For asymptomatic RET mutation carriers, yearly follow-up for PCCs including clinical investigation and biochemical testing should start between 11 and 16 years of age — depending on the specific RET mutation (high or moderate risk for PCCs) (caveat: always consider the risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism) (Table 9). Patients with a history of a RET -related PCC should undergo a lifelong follow-up including yearly clinical investigation and biochemical testing, at least initially; for patients with high and moderate risk for PCCs (depending on the specific RET mutation), follow-up may include abdominal/pelvic MRI every 5 years (Table 10). This is particularly important for centers where measurements of plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines are not available.

Table 10.
Follow-up of cluster 2 mutation carriers with a history of a PCC

Table 9.
Follow-up of asymptomatic cluster 2-mutation carriers

Despite a rather low metastatic risk of NF1 -related PCCs, most recently published guidelines nevertheless recommend the initiation of a biochemical screening of asymptomatic NF1 mutation carriers every 3 years from the age of 10 to 14 years (Table 9). This is supported by the high proportion (> 80%) of asymptomatic patients with an NF1-related PCC. As there is a high number of asymptomatic patients, it also seems reasonable to include patients with a history of an NF1 -related PCC into a structured lifelong follow-up, with yearly clinical and biochemical evaluation and abdominal/pelvic MRI every 5 years (Table 10). By analogy to RET- and NF1 -mutation carriers with a history of a PCC, the authors suggest a similar follow-up for patients with a history of a TMEM127 - or MAX -related PCC, with yearly clinical and biochemical evaluation and abdominal/pelvic MRI once every 5 years (Table 10).

For each patient with first diagnosis of a cluster 2-related PCC ≥ 5 cm, a chest CT would be reasonable to rule out metastatic disease; however, this is unnecessary in the routine follow-up of these mutation carriers due to their low metastatic risk and almost exclusively adrenal location (PCCs) of cluster 2–related disease.

### American association of clinical endocrinology disease state clinical review on the evaluation and management of adrenocortical carcinoma in an adult: a practical approach [^111hng7Q]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) — adrenal biopsy considerations: In a patient with an indeterminate adrenal mass (HU > 10), after excluding pheochromocytoma and ACC with hormonal work-up, biopsy of the adrenal mass may be considered in those with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy or high suspicion for adrenal metastasis (bilateral enlarging indeterminate lesions) if necessary for treatment decisions; incidental adrenal masses are more likely metastatic in patients with active malignancy than with remote malignancy history (47% versus 26%). Biopsy of an adrenal lesion suspicious for ACC is not recommended, as neither fine-needle aspiration (FNA) nor core biopsy can reliably distinguish adrenal adenoma from ACC, though CT-guided FNA is a useful tool when detecting an infectious or metastatic lesion would modify therapy or prognosis. Needle-track metastases have been reported from ACC and other adrenal metastases, but there is no evidence that ACC biopsies are more prone to needle-track spread than other cancers. Prior to any FNA, pheochromocytoma should be ruled out with biochemical testing because the procedure could induce hypertensive crisis or sudden death.

### International symposium on pheochromocytoma: an event of dedicated healthcare professionals and researchers striving for better patient outcomes [^1143CsYN]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are defined as neuroendocrine tumors that produce catecholamines. Many recent advances in their management, localization, treatment, as well as surveillance have significantly improved outcomes for patients with PPGLs or carriers of pathogenic genetic variants linked to the development of these tumors. At present, those advances mainly include the molecular stratification of PPGLs into seven clusters, the 2017 WHO revised definition of these tumors, the presence of specific clinical features pointing toward PPGL, the use of plasma metanephrines and 3-methoxytyramine with specific reference limits to assess the likelihood of having a PPGL (e.g. patients at high and low risk) including age-specific reference limits, nuclear medicine guidelines outlining cluster- and metastatic disease-specific functional (here mainly positron emission tomography and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy) imaging in the precise diagnostic localization of PPGLs, the guidelines for using radio- vs chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease, and the international consensus on initial screening and follow-up of asymptomatic germline SDHx pathogenic variant carriers. Furthermore, new collaborative efforts particularly based on multi-institutional and worldwide initiatives are now considered key forces in improving our understanding and knowledge about these tumors and future successful treatments or even preventative interventions.

### The mount sinai clinical pathway for the management of pheochromocytoma [^112V2Eqx]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Pheochromocytomas are complex tumors that require a comprehensive and systematic management plan orchestrated by a multidisciplinary team.

Methods

To achieve these ends, The Mount Sinai Adrenal Center hosted an interdisciplinary retreat where experts in adrenal disorders assembled with the aim of developing a clinical pathway for the management of pheochromocytomas.

Results

The result was a consensus for the diagnosis, perioperative management, and postoperative management of pheochromocytomas, with specific recommendations from our team of adrenal experts, as well as a review of the current literature.

Conclusion

Our clinical pathway can be applied by other institutions directly or may serve as a guide for institution-specific management.

Adrenal Incidentaloma

Although patients who are diagnosed with an adrenal incidentaloma have per its definition no symptoms or signs of catecholamine excess, that does not mean that the tumor is nonfunctional. Therefore, after a careful medical history and physical examination, in most patients, some symptoms and/or signs of catecholamine excess can be detected. Nevertheless, regardless of any clinical suspicion for PPGL, proper biochemical diagnosis to rule in or out the presence of PPGL, preferably by plasma metanephrines, remains mandatory. However, an exception should be made for incidentalomas with a low tissue density on unenhanced CT (Fig. 1). In general, PCCs display a density of ≥ 10 HU on unenhanced CT. Conversely, it is extremely rare that an adrenal incidentaloma with a low density of < 10 HU is a PCC and virtually this low density excludes this tumor in nearly all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma. Three recent analyses have confirmed these data. One study showed a negative predictive value of nearly 100% for a PCC if the adrenal mass had a density of < 10 HU. This suggests that in patients with an adrenal incidentaloma with a density of < 10 HU, biochemical testing for PCC is not needed and work-up for this tumor is to be stopped here. An adrenal lesion that enhances stronger than 130 HU on CT after contrast is most likely a PCC and requires appropriate biochemical evaluation. On the other hand, contrast washout is often unreliable for the distinction between PCC and adrenal adenoma, since like in lipid-rich adenomas, a high (> 60% absolute, > 40% relative) washout is observed in one third of PCCs (Fig. 1). In addition, there may be other features including calcification, cysts, necrosis, or hemorrhage that have been reported in patients with a PCC but these features per se lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy to play a decisive role in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal mass.

If an adrenal incidentaloma is detected on MRI, loss of adrenal signal intensity on opposed-phase gradient-echo images (chemical shift) has a high accuracy of 90% to 95% for lipid-rich adenoma and virtually excludes a PCC. Once an adrenal incidentaloma is detected on contrast-enhanced CT, additional MRI has no incremental diagnostic value in most patients.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1164qtEo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, more specifically with respect to metanephrine assays, ES 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain plasma free metanephrines or urinary fractionated metanephrines as part of the initial biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

### Biochemical diagnosis, localization and management of pheochromocytoma: focus on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 in relation to other hereditary syndromes and sporadic forms of the tumour [^111ujtbS]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A or 2B develop pheochromocytoma. These tumours are almost exclusively benign and localized in the adrenal glands. About one-third are bilateral at initial diagnosis. Amongst patients with pheochromocytoma, those with MEN 2A have subtler symptoms compared to those with sporadic disease. Since pheochromocytomas in patients with MEN 2 often secrete catecholamines episodically (but metabolize them continuously to metanephrines), the first choice for biochemical diagnosis is the measurement of free metanephrines in plasma, with urinary fractionated metanephrines being the second choice. In patients with pheochromocytomas that produce exclusively normetanephrine, MEN 2 can be excluded. In patients with biochemically proven MEN 2-related pheochromocytoma, anatomical imaging of the adrenals (with either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance) should be obtained next. Functional imaging with specific ligands (e.g. scintigraphy with [(123)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine or, if available, positron emission tomography with [(18)F]-fluorodopamine, [(18)F]-dihydroxyphenylalanine, [(11)C]-adrenaline or [(11)C]-hydroxyephedrine) may then be particularly useful in patients with distorted anatomy from previous surgery, in cases of equivocal biochemical data despite high clinical suspicion for a tumour, to rule out multifocal disease, or where there is suspicion of metastatic disease (e.g. tumours larger than 5 cm). Laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice and subtotal (cortical-sparing) adrenalectomy is the procedure of choice in bilateral pheochromocytomas.

### Diagnosis and localization of pheochromocytoma [^115uHPyM]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

This Hypertension Grand Rounds shows how applying new clinical laboratory techniques helped to diagnose pheochromocytoma in a difficult case. In the setting of long-standing, sustained hypertension, the patient had a hypertensive paroxysm during anesthesia induction for surgery, leading to suspicion of a pheochromocytoma. Conventional testing, including CT scanning and fractionated urinary metanephrine test, was not diagnostic. The patient had another hypertensive paroxysm during subsequent anesthesia induction, requiring intensive care. Consistently elevated plasma levels of free normetanephrine provided the first and only biochemical evidence for a pheochromocytoma in this case. 6-[18F]Fluorodopamine positron emission tomography and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy subsequently agreed on the existence of a small left adrenal mass, which when removed surgically proved to be a pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively, plasma levels of normetanephrine normalized, and there were no further hypertensive paroxysms, although the patient remained hypertensive. This case illustrates the superiority of plasma levels of free (unconjugated) metanephrines, compared with other biochemical tests, to detect pheochromocytoma. It also confirms that functional imaging by 6-[18F]fluorodopamine or 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning can localize pheochromocytoma in difficult cases in which other imaging tests are not diagnostic.

### Is biochemical assessment of pheochromocytoma necessary in adrenal incidentalomas with magnetic resonance imaging features not suggestive of pheochromocytoma? [^116gqNmK]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, it is unclear whether pheochromocytomas can be ruled out based on low intensity on T2-weighted sequences and signal loss on out-of-phase magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Hence, in this study, we investigated whether biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma in patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) showing MRI features not suggesting pheochromocytoma would prove beneficial.

Methods

We performed MRI for 300 AIs in 278 consecutive patients. All patients were screened for pheochromocytoma with plasma metanephrine and normetanephrine. Patients with high plasma levels of metanephrine and/or normetanephrine were also assessed for pheochromocytoma by urinary metanephrines.

Results

Hyperintensity was detected on T2-weighted MRI sequences in 28 (9.3%) of the 300 AIs. Among these 28 incidentalomas, pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in 13 (46.4%) of the cases by histopathologic analysis. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI was significantly higher in pheochromocytomas compared to the remaining AIs (P < .001). All 13 pheochromocytomas were characterized by hyperintensity on T2-weighted sequences and the absence of signal loss on out-of-phase MRI sequences. Pheochromocytoma was not detected in any of the 272 AIs that appeared hypointense or isointense on T2-weighted MRI sequences or in the 250 cases with signal loss on out-of-phase sequences.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that AIs that appear hypointense or isointense on T2-weighted MRI sequences and those with signal loss on out-of-phase sequences may not require routine biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma. Further studies including a higher number of pheochromocytomas are required to confirm our results.

### Nonclassic presentation of pheochromocytoma: difficulties in diagnosis and management of the normotensive patient [^116EskzV]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an unusual presentation of pheochromocytoma along with challenges in diagnosis and management.

Methods

We report a clinical case history and describe diagnostic methods and pitfalls. The preoperative medical preparation in a normotensive patient is described.

Results

A 33-year-old man fell off a ladder, resulting in C6 paraplegia. After C7-T1 laminectomy, he was transferred to a rehabilitation center where he reported lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain during therapy sessions. A left adrenal mass was incidentally discovered during the workup to rule out a pulmonary embolism. He reported no history of hypertension, and no elevated blood pressure readings had been documented. Magnetic resonance imaging of the adrenal glands showed a well-defined left adrenal mass measuring 3.9 x 3.2 x 3.3 cm, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Twenty-four hour urinary catecholamine concentrations were unremarkable; urinary metanephrines were markedly elevated. During hospital admission, blood pressure was in the low to normotensive range, requiring a cautious approach to alpha-adrenergic blockade and surgical preparation. He under-went uneventful laparoscopic left adrenalectomy; surgical pathology was consistent with pheochromocytoma.

Conclusions

This case illustrates a nonclassic presentation of pheochromocytoma and demonstrates that urinary catecholamines alone are not sufficient for a biochemical diagnosis of large pheochromocytomas. Preoperative preparation in normotensive patients can be achieved with alpha-adrenergic blockade, hydration, and liberal salt intake.

### Biochemical assessment of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^116Ppq5d]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) require prompt consideration and efficient diagnosis and treatment to minimize associated morbidity and mortality. Once considered, appropriate biochemical testing is key to diagnosis. Advances in understanding catecholamine metabolism have clarified why measurements of the O-methylated catecholamine metabolites rather than the catecholamines themselves are important for effective diagnosis. These metabolites, normetanephrine and metanephrine, produced respectively from norepinephrine and epinephrine, can be measured in plasma or urine, with choice according to available methods or presentation of patients. For patients with signs and symptoms of catecholamine excess, either test will invariably establish the diagnosis, whereas the plasma test provides higher sensitivity than urinary metanephrines for patients screened due to an incidentaloma or genetic predisposition, particularly for small tumors or in patients with an asymptomatic presentation. Additional measurements of plasma methoxytyramine can be important for some tumors, such as paragangliomas, and for surveillance of patients at risk of metastatic disease. Avoidance of false-positive test results is best achieved by plasma measurements with appropriate reference intervals and preanalytical precautions, including sampling blood in the fully supine position. Follow-up of positive results, including optimization of preanalytics for repeat tests or whether to proceed directly to anatomic imaging or confirmatory clonidine tests, depends on the test results, which can also suggest likely size, adrenal vs extra-adrenal location, underlying biology, or even metastatic involvement of a suspected tumor. Modern biochemical testing now makes diagnosis of PPGL relatively simple. Integration of artificial intelligence into the process should make it possible to fine-tune these advances.

### The utility of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy in patients with pheochromocytoma [^11563yJf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (MIBG) can be used to image pheochromocytomas. While cross-sectional imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually localize the tumor, MIBG is often obtained to rule out multifocal and metastatic disease, and to corroborate anatomic imaging with functional data. We questioned the utility of MIBG in the diagnosis and management of pheochromocytoma.

Methods

All patients who received MIBG at one academic center from 1999 to 2004 were identified. For the subset of patients who received MIBG in the work-up of possible pheochromocytoma, the following data were reviewed: demographics, symptoms, results of biochemical and imaging studies, histopathological diagnosis, and management.

Results

A total of 60 patients received MIBG, including 27 patients for the evaluation of a possible pheochromocytoma. Biochemical testing was performed in all patients. Fourteen patients received MIBG despite normal biochemistry and an absence of risk factors such as a hereditary syndrome or prior history of pheochromocytoma. None of these 14 low-risk patients with negative biochemistry had a final diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. In the ten patients with pheochromocytoma, all tumors were localized by CT and/or MRI. Importantly, MIBG did not identify any foci of disease not seen on cross sectional imaging, and MIBG did not alter the surgical management of any patient in this series.

Conclusions

In patients with clinical findings suggestive of pheochromocytoma, biochemical testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis, and cross-sectional imaging is sufficient for tumor localization. In the absence of hereditary disease or a past history of pheochromocytoma, MIBG does not alter the treatment plan and therefore should not be routinely performed. Instead, MIBG should be used selectively, such as for the rare patient with a biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and no tumor seen on exhaustive anatomical imaging.

Evaluation for pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas — biochemical testing and medication review: A patient with possible PCCs should be evaluated with fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines in 24-hour urine or free metanephrines in plasma. Elevated levels of metanephrines or normetanephrines are suggestive of PCC or PGL, and in general, adrenal PCCs more commonly secrete metanephrines and PGLs secrete normetanephrines, with a few exceptions. Concurrent medications should be reviewed before testing for those that interfere with plasma or blood metanephrine/normetanephrine evaluation, including acetaminophen, certain beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treatment-NCI… [^112uTt2m]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

The following types of treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to remove pheochromocytoma is usually an adrenalectomy. During this surgery, the tissues and lymph nodes inside the abdomen will be checked and if the tumor has spread, these tissues may also be removed. Drugs may be given before, during, and after surgery to keep blood pressure and heart rate normal. Embolization therapy Embolization therapy is a treatment to block the artery leading to the adrenal gland. Blocking the flow of blood to the adrenal glands helps kill cancer cells growing there. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors block signals needed for tumors to grow. Sunitinib, axitinib, and cabozantinib have been used as palliative therapy for metastatic and recurrent pheochromocytoma.
- Surgery to completely remove the cancer, including tumors that have spread to distant parts of the body.
- Palliative therapy, to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life, including:

- Surgery to remove as much cancer as possible.
- Combination chemotherapy.
- Radiation therapy with 131I-MIBG.
- External radiation therapy to areas where cancer has spread and cannot be removed by surgery.
- Embolization.
- Ablation therapy using radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation for tumors in the liver or bone.
- Targeted therapy. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. General information about clinical trials is also available.

Recurrent Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Treatment of recurrent pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma may include:

- Surgery to completely remove the cancer.
- When surgery to remove the cancer is not possible, palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life may include:

- Combination chemotherapy.
- Targeted therapy.
- Radiation therapy using 131I-MIBG.
- External radiation therapy to areas where cancer has spread and cannot be removed by surgery.
- Ablation therapy using radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation.

### Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treatment (PDQ ®) [^112hqhWZ]. NCI (2010). Low credibility.

Risk Factors No known environmental, dietary, or lifestyle risk factors have been linked to the development of pheochromocytoma. Genetic counseling and testing It has been proposed that all patients diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma should consider genetic testing because the incidence of a hereditary syndrome in apparently sporadic cases is as high as 25%. Early identification of a hereditary syndrome allows for early screening for other associated tumors and identification of family members who are at risk. In addition, some patients with a hereditary syndrome are more likely to develop multifocal, malignant, or recurrent disease. Knowledge of the specific genetic variant permits increased vigilance during preoperative localization or postoperative surveillance of such patients. Genetic testing can be considered when a patient has the following features:

- Patient is between the ages of 40 and 50 years.
- Patients has a history of a unilateral pheochromocytoma.
- Patient does not have a personal or family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. If a germline variant is identified, predictive genetic testing may be offered to asymptomatic at-risk family members. For more information, see Genetics of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Neoplasias. Genetic testing is not recommended in patients who are older than 50 years. Phenoxybenzamine is an effective treatment for catecholamine excess and metyrosine can be added if needed. Approximately 15% to 25% of patients with recurrent disease experience distant metastasis. The 5-year overall survival rates in those with metastatic disease range from 50% to 70%. Carriers of SDHB pathogenic variants have an increased risk of developing metastatic disease of approximately 25% to 50%.

The most commonly associated gene with metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is SDHB.

### Childhood pheochromocytoma&paraganglioma treatment… [^1141TDwn]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

General Information About Childhood Pheochromocytoma and ParagangliomaGo to Health Professional Version. Having any of the following inherited syndromes or gene changes increases risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: A very small amount of radioactive octreotide is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
- Children with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
- **Four types of standard treatment are used**:

- Surgery
- Chemotherapy.

Four types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. For several days before surgery, your child may need to take blood pressure medicine to lower the risk of complications during and after surgery. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.
- Angiogenesis inhibitor drugs prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow.

Sunitinib is an angiogenesis inhibitor used to treat pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Before surgery, drug therapy with alpha-blockers to control blood pressure and beta-blockers to control heart rate are given. If both adrenal glands are removed, life-long hormone therapy to replace hormones made by the adrenal glands is needed after surgery. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.
