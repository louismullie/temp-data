## Question

64 y/o male patient who's father had renal cancer of unknown type. How frequently would you screen this patient for same?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often and with what modality to screen a 64-year-old man who has a single first-degree relative (father) with renal cell carcinoma of unknown type. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this family history alone meets criteria for genetic evaluation. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine screening in average-risk populations. Next, I will consider whether a single first-degree relative meaningfully increases RCC risk and how that translates into surveillance. After that, I need to check what to do if genetic testing is pursued and positive. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation on whether to screen, with what modality, and how often, while aligning with evidence and guideline strength.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. A single first-degree relative with RCC places the patient in a modestly elevated risk group, but not in a high-risk hereditary category by itself; NCCN reserves genetic evaluation for those with bilateral/multifocal tumors, early-onset RCC, or multiple affected relatives, and a large Swedish registry shows that one affected first-degree relative roughly doubles RCC risk, which is notable but still not the threshold for syndrome-based surveillance without a confirmed germline variant [^113MoJVf] [^113C7Bz7].

> Wait, let me verify the general-population stance before jumping to screening. The EAU explicitly recommends against routine screening for primary RCC in any population, reflecting the lack of proven benefit and potential harms, and NCCN's screening algorithms are reserved for individuals with confirmed hereditary RCC syndromes or those meeting specific high-risk criteria, not for average-risk adults with a single affected relative [^111bWGvH] [^111msRVM].

> Hold on, I should verify the genetic testing pathway. If the patient desires further risk stratification, referral to a cancer genetics professional is reasonable to review family history and consider testing, but testing is not mandated by a single first-degree case alone; if a pathogenic germline variant is identified, then syndrome-specific surveillance would begin, including earlier initiation (often 10 years before the youngest affected family member) and MRI-based imaging tailored to the syndrome, with annual imaging for aggressive syndromes like HLRCC and less frequent intervals for others such as TSC or BHD [^113MoJVf] [^112mcUnX] [^112sZVhZ].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating surveillance after treatment with population screening. The CUA and AUA surveillance schedules after nephrectomy are for recurrence risk, not for screening unaffected individuals with a family history; using those intervals here would be a mistake, so I should not apply postoperative schedules to this scenario [^114GFYeS] [^1138fBHB].

> Let me consider the practical clinical approach. Given his age of 64 and a single affected first-degree relative, the most evidence-aligned course is no routine imaging surveillance; instead, emphasize general risk-factor modification and symptom awareness, and reserve genetic counseling/testing for scenarios such as additional affected relatives, personal early-onset/multifocal/bilateral disease, or suggestive extrarenal features, with any subsequent imaging dictated by a confirmed hereditary syndrome rather than family history alone [^111bWGvH] [^111msRVM] [^111wGBsw].

> But wait, what if the patient strongly prefers imaging despite average risk? I should double-check that shared decision-making is appropriate; while guidelines do not endorse routine screening here, a one-time baseline renal ultrasound could be discussed as a compromise that balances modest risk elevation with the lack of evidence for improved outcomes, with clear counseling that this is off-guideline and that repeating imaging without a syndrome diagnosis is not recommended [^111bWGvH] [^111xtj22].

> In summary, I should confirm that no authoritative guideline supports routine RCC screening for a 64-year-old with only one affected first-degree relative; the appropriate action is no scheduled imaging surveillance, consideration of genetic counseling if additional risk features emerge, and syndrome-specific MRI-based surveillance only if a pathogenic germline variant is identified, which would then dictate modality and interval based on the specific syndrome [^111bWGvH] [^111msRVM] [^112sZVhZ].

---

For a 64-year-old man with a father who had renal cancer of unknown type, **routine screening is not recommended** because a single first-degree relative with RCC does not meet criteria for hereditary RCC screening [^111msRVM] [^111bWGvH]. If there are **additional risk factors** (e.g. bilateral/multifocal tumors, early-onset RCC in family, or other syndromic features), refer for genetic counseling and consider targeted imaging only if a hereditary syndrome is confirmed [^113MoJVf] [^115V6iNp]. Otherwise, manage with standard risk counseling and no routine imaging [^111bWGvH].

---

## Risk assessment

- **Family history**: A single first-degree relative with RCC modestly increases risk but does not meet hereditary RCC criteria [^113C7Bz7].
- **Hereditary RCC syndromes**: Typically present with bilateral/multifocal tumors, early onset, or other syndromic features [^1154YKnQ].
- **Current risk**: At age 64, baseline RCC risk is ~0.5–1% over 10 years; one affected first-degree relative roughly doubles this, but it remains below typical screening thresholds [^113C7Bz7].

---

## Current guidelines

- **NCCN**: Genetic evaluation is indicated for ≥ 2 first- or second-degree relatives with RCC, or ≥ 1 first-degree relative with a known hereditary RCC syndrome; not for a single first-degree relative without syndromic features [^111msRVM].
- **EAU**: Do not screen asymptomatic individuals for RCC, including those with a single first-degree relative [^111bWGvH].
- **AUA**: Genetic counseling is indicated for early-onset RCC, bilateral/multifocal tumors, or suggestive family history; not for a single first-degree relative without other features [^notfound].

---

## Recommended screening approach

Given a single first-degree relative and no other risk factors, **routine screening is not recommended**. Provide counseling on modifiable risks (smoking, obesity, hypertension) and maintain a low threshold for evaluating symptoms (hematuria, flank pain, weight loss) [^111bWGvH].

---

## Circumstances warranting genetic evaluation

Genetic evaluation is warranted if any of the following are present:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Multiple relatives | ≥ 2 first- or second-degree relatives with RCC [^111msRVM] |
| Early-onset RCC | Diagnosis ≤ 46 years in the patient or family [^113MoJVf] |
| Bilateral/multifocal tumors | Personal or family history [^111msRVM] |
| Syndromic features | Skin lesions, lung cysts, uterine fibroids, or other suggestive findings [^117Q6KcS] |

---

If any are present, **refer for genetic counseling** and consider targeted imaging only if a hereditary syndrome is confirmed [^115V6iNp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine screening is **not indicated** for a 64-year-old man with a single first-degree relative with RCC of unknown type. Provide risk counseling, address modifiable factors, and evaluate symptoms promptly. Consider genetic evaluation only if additional risk factors are present or if a hereditary syndrome is suspected [^111msRVM].

Up to 5% of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) can be associated with a known hereditary RCC syndrome. In addition to the well-characterized RCC syndromes, there are also emerging syndromes associated with increased RCC risk. In the last few years, consensus guidelines have outlined recommendations for who should be referred for genetic evaluation, and what screening should be done for early detection of RCC. Although much progress has been made, work is still needed-guidelines are still mostly based on expert opinion and the role of emerging genetic associations will need to be clarified.

### Current evidence on screening for renal cancer [^111xtj22]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is increasing worldwide. A high proportion of individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but RCC has a high mortality rate. These facts suggest that RCC meets some of the criteria for screening, and a new analysis shows that screening for RCC could potentially be cost-effective. Targeted screening of high-risk individuals is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy to maximize the benefits and reduce the harms of screening. However, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness of screening remains uncertain. The optimal screening modality and target population is also unclear, and uncertainties exist regarding the specification and implementation of a screening programme. Before moving to a fully powered trial of screening, future work should focus on the following: developing and validating accurate risk prediction models; developing non-invasive methods of early RCC detection; establishing the feasibility, public acceptability and potential uptake of screening; establishing the prevalence of RCC and stage distribution of RCC detected by screening; and evaluating the potential harms of screening, including the impact on quality of life, overdiagnosis and over-treatment.

### Advances in the genetics of familial renal cancer [^113MyaDZ]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

We discuss recent advances in the diagnosis and management of renal cell cancer (RCC) given the enhanced molecular genetics knowledge in this area. A number of hereditary renal cancer syndromes have been described, including von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis/RCC syndrome, and hereditary papillary renal cancer. Early molecular diagnosis now facilitates the management and prevention of RCC in families. Recommendations for screening in families are discussed.

### Diseases of hereditary renal cell cancers [^1164Qj5P]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes lead to hereditary renal cell carcinoma (HRCC) diseases, characterized by a high risk of RCC and extrarenal manifestations. Patients of young age, those with a family history of RCC, and/or those with a personal and family history of HRCC-related extrarenal manifestations should be referred for germline testing. Identification of a germline mutation will allow for testing of family members at risk, as well as personalized surveillance programs to detect the early onset of HRCC-related lesions. The latter allows for more targeted and therefore more effective therapy and better preservation of renal parenchyma.

### Genetic predisposition to renal cell carcinoma: implications for counseling, testing, screening, and management [^117PtQwG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In many individuals with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a hereditary cause may have contributed to cancer development. Various risk factors can be suggestive of a genetic contribution, including early disease onset, multifocal or bilateral tumors, family history of RCC, and personal/family history of other benign or malignant tumors. Genetic counseling and understanding of the entire family tree are the first steps in evaluation and will determine if the patient should proceed with testing. Methods of testing have changed to next-generation sequencing, which allows multiple genes to be evaluated together. The results of testing have significant implications for the individual and his or her family members. Screening of the kidney and at-risk organs ensues, with most algorithms focused on early diagnosis and intervention to limit morbidity and mortality of disease manifestations. A comprehensive clinical program that can offer multidisciplinary care is useful for several complex cancer syndromes. Management of localized and advanced hereditary kidney cancers may differ from the sporadic forms of RCC. Knowledge of the genetics can have significant management implications and if necessary genetic evaluation can be expedited to allow treatment decisions.

### Early-onset renal cell carcinoma inharmatoma tumour syndrome [^117GYdkN]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Lowering the age of kidney cancer screening has been suggested by multiple reports. Cumulative cancer risks were reported following a review of 210 patients who met the accepted diagnostic criteria for CS (90% from published medical literature and 10% from Mayo Clinic records). Based on these results, screening for kidney cancer was recommended to begin at 33 years of age to capture 95% of cases, or at 28 years of age (the youngest reported case) to capture 100% of cases. Lowering the age of surveillance to 30 years of age for CS–RCC has been suggested in more recent reports as well. A study at the Institut Bergonié Genetic Laboratory (Bordeaux, France) identified 146 individuals with deleterious germline PTEN pathogenic variants and detailed phenotypic information. Two women and one man (2% of participants) developed RCC. From this, the French Cowden Disease Network proposed to begin kidney cancer screening via renal ultrasounds and/or renal MRI at 30 years of age, continued annually if there was a family history of kidney cancer or every two years in the absence of a family history.

Diagnostic aspects of BHD syndrome

The first set of Recommendations (R1 to R9a see Table 1) were related to the diagnosis of BHD syndrome. Previously various clinical diagnostic criteria for BHD syndrome have been suggested, though in general, these have been derived or adapted from those of the European BHD Consensus group (EBHDC). However since the EBHDC report there have been major changes in genetic testing which is increasingly being used as a first-line diagnostic test for BHD syndrome and access to genetic testing is no longer restricted to clinical genetics specialists. This is highly relevant to BHD syndrome as this condition may present to a wide range of clinical specialities, and it can mimic other disorders. Therefore, it is important to recognise in which clinical scenarios a diagnosis of BHD syndrome should be considered. In defining the clinical indicators of a possible diagnosis of BHD syndrome, a balance has to be made between high sensitivity/low specificity and low sensitivity/high specificity criteria in order to avoid over-investigation or under-diagnosis. Additionally, there are clinical scenarios in which the frequency of an underlying diagnosis of BHD syndrome is low, but, because of the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), it is important to exclude it if possible. Recommendation 1 identified clinical presentations in which a diagnosis of BHD syndrome should be considered. Consideration of a diagnosis of BHD syndrome does not necessarily mean that genetic testing should be instigated. For example, in many countries a 49 year old man with unifocal unilateral clear cell RCC would be ineligible for routine genetic testing for hereditary kidney cancer predisposition, but the act of considering BHD syndrome might lead to the detection of a suggestive family history, lower zone cystic lung disease and/or FF/TD that then leads to genetic testing for BHD syndrome (R3). Recommendation 6 provides criteria for genetic testing for BHD syndrome.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^111oCjmq]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Follow-up after intervention — proposed guidelines for renal cancer attempt to provide a risk-based approach to surveillance and monitoring, yet few high-quality studies currently exist to help formulate surveillance regimens and many of the Panel's recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion; any cancer surveillance regimen is described as a balancing act including the likelihood of recurrence at various sites, temporal considerations, potential benefits and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on timing of detection, improvements in diagnostic and initial interventions, patient characteristics, and the burden and cost of monitoring; as electronic medical records and quality and safety initiatives increase, tracking outcomes will become increasingly codified and more usable for research purposes, and these data can inform the proper sequencing, timing, duration, and type of follow-up to improve outcomes with the most parsimonious monitoring.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and surveillance of BAP1 tumour predisposition syndrome [^115YRuZe]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Renal tumours

Randomised control trials of renal surveillance in BAP1 carriers have not been undertaken. Most studies have identified the frequency of renal cancer in germline BAP1 carriers, and in many studies the type of renal cancers have not been histopathologically verified. There have been reports of both multifocal and bilateral RCC in BAP1 carriers, and the average age of onset is around 10 years younger than in sporadic RCC.

However, multiple studies have shown that somatic loss of BAP1 in renal cell carcinoma is associated with a more aggressive clinical behaviour and worse prognosis.

In addition, a single small study of six tumours from two patients demonstrated an increased growth rate of tumours in BAP1 carriers. The age at which renal cancer is diagnosed is lower in individuals with a pathogenic variant in BAP1 with a range of between 32–80 years.

Ultrasound scans are low-cost and easily available. However, whilst 77% of RCC < 30 mm are in general hyperechoic and detectable by ultrasound, a proportion are not detected. The detection of isoechoic or hypoechoic tumours is more challenging, and whilst there are currently no data available regarding whether BAP1 tumours are hyperechoic, MRI could be considered as the preferred surveillance modality. This would be consistent with the recommendation for patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) who are at risk of more aggressive renal tumours.

Consensus was reached that annual renal imaging should be offered to all BAP1 carriers, and that the preferred modality of imaging would be MRI. However, USS could be used as an alternative should MRI not be available. Given the reported age of onset of renal cancer in BAP1 carriers, starting from age 30 years reached consensus. It was recognised, as for the other tumours that long term data collection is required to evaluate the long-term benefit of surveillance.

Other recommendations for BAP1 carriers

Whilst not specifically discussed as part of the Delphi process, the core group considered that BAP1 carriers should be given appropriate lifestyle advice, including but not limited to avoiding occupations with asbestos exposure, being aware of residential exposure during renovations, non-smoking and limiting UV exposure.

Professional society guidance — overuse reduction in average-risk women is reflected by positions that the American Academy of Family Physicians advised against screening women younger than 21 years, women who have had hysterectomy for noncancerous conditions, and low-risk women older than 65 years; it also recommended not using HPV testing alone or in combination with cytology in women younger than 30 years; the ACOG recommended against annual screening of low-risk women aged 30 to 65 years; and the American Society of Nephrology suggested that routine screening for cancer, including cervical cancer, not be performed in patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving dialysis and have limited life expectancy, with studies noting that physicians are willing to screen less frequently than every year and that women accept less screening if recommended by their clinicians.

### Defining early-onset kidney cancer: implications for germline and somatic mutation testing and clinical management [^111jTovx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Approximately 5% to 8% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is hereditary. No guidelines exist for patient selection for RCC germline mutation testing. We evaluate how age of onset could indicate the need for germline mutation testing for detection of inherited forms of kidney cancer.

Patients and Methods

We analyzed the age distribution of RCC cases in the SEER-17 program and in our institutional hereditary kidney cancer population. The age distributions were compared by sex, race, histology, and hereditary cancer syndrome. Models were established to evaluate the specific age thresholds for genetic testing.

Results

The median age of patients with RCC in SEER-17 was 64 years, with the distribution closely approaching normalcy. Statistical differences were observed by race, sex, and subtype (P < .05). The bottom decile cutoff was ≤ 46 years of age and slightly differed by sex, race, and histology. The mean and median ages at presentation of 608 patients with hereditary kidney cancer were 39.3 years and 37 years, respectively. Although age varied by specific syndrome, 70% of these cases were found to lie at or below the bottom age decile. Modeling age-based genetic testing thresholds demonstrated that the 10th percentile maximized sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusion

Early age of onset might be a sign of hereditary RCC. Even in the absence of clinical manifestations and personal/family history, an age of onset of 46 years or younger should trigger consideration for genetic counseling/germline mutation testing and may serve as a useful cutoff when establishing genetic testing guidelines.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114e4VAA]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society early prostate cancer detection — screening discussion eligibility and timing are as follows: The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy should have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened for prostate cancer, and prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years; men at higher risk, including African American men and men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, should receive this information beginning at age 45 years; and men at appreciably higher risk (multiple family members diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years) should receive this information beginning at age 40 years. Asymptomatic men who have less than a 10-year life expectancy based on age and health status should not be offered prostate cancer screening, and at age 75 years, only about half of men have a life expectancy of 10 years or more. For example, men with New York Heart Association Class 4 congestive heart failure, moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, moderate-to-severe dementia, or life-limiting cancer would not be expected to benefit from screening; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, and it is important to consider overall health status — not age alone — when making decisions about screening.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^112EY2hj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) — diagnostic workup states that a central renal mass may suggest urothelial carcinoma; if so, urine cytology, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous mass biopsy should be considered. Most bone and brain metastases are symptomatic at diagnosis; therefore, a bone scan is not routinely performed unless the patient has an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or bone pain, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be performed if clinical signs, presentation, and symptoms suggest brain metastases. The recommended abdominal imaging studies provide high diagnostic accuracy; therefore, a needle biopsy is not always necessary before surgery, especially when imaging is consistent with RCC, although needle biopsy may be considered to establish the diagnosis and to guide active surveillance strategies. Biopsy should be performed prior to or at the time of radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy to confirm diagnosis and to guide surveillance strategies, and should also be considered if a central lesion or homogeneous infiltration of renal parenchyma is observed on scans to rule out urothelial carcinoma or lymphoma, respectively. The value of PET in RCC remains to be determined, and currently PET or PET/CT is not an imaging tool that is recommended to diagnose kidney cancer or to follow for evidence of relapse after nephrectomy. If patients present with multiple renal masses, are ≤ 46 years of age at diagnosis, or have a family history of RCC, they should consider genetic evaluation.

Hereditary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)–genetic counseling triggers and age thresholds are described: Patients presenting with bilateral or multifocal RCC should also be considered for genetic counseling, as should those with uncommon but characteristic tumor histologies such as hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe tumors suggestive of BHD. Other pathologic findings that should prompt consideration for genetic counseling include histology suggesting HLRCC/fumarate hydratase deficiency or SDH deficient RCC, or AML in the setting of one or more additional TS complex criteria. Since sporadic RCC typically presents at a more advanced age than hereditary RCC, patients presenting at a young age should also be considered for genetic evaluation, with SEER data showing that the median age of onset of sporadic RCC was 64 years compared to 37 for those with hereditary disease, and it was recommended that patients diagnosed at the age of 46 years or younger should be strongly considered for genetic counseling/testing.

Renal mass — counseling and multidisciplinary care states that in patients with a solid or Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic renal mass, a urologist should lead the counseling process and should consider all management strategies, with a multidisciplinary team included when necessary (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should provide counseling that includes current perspectives about tumor biology and a patient-specific risk assessment inclusive of sex, tumor size/complexity, histology (when obtained), and imaging characteristics, and for cT1a tumors the low oncologic risk of many small renal masses should be reviewed (Clinical Principle). During counseling, clinicians must review the most common and serious urologic and non-urologic morbidities of each treatment pathway and the importance of the patient age, comorbidities/frailty, and life expectancy (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should review the importance of renal functional recovery related to renal mass management, including the risks of progressive CKD, potential short- or long-term need for renal replacement therapy, and long-term overall survival considerations (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should consider referral to nephrology for patients at high risk of CKD progression, including those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2 or whenever eGFR is expected to be less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2 after intervention, and also for confirmed proteinuria or diabetics with preexisting CKD (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should recommend genetic counseling for any of the following: all patients ≤ 46 years of age with renal malignancy, those with multifocal or bilateral renal masses, or whenever the personal or family history suggests a familial renal neoplastic syndrome.

### Renal neoplasms in young adults [^114u2gsR]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is usually diagnosed in older adults (the median age of diagnosis is 64 years). Although less common in patients younger than 45 years, RCCs in young adults differ in clinical manifestation, pathologic diagnosis, and prognosis. RCCs in young adults are typically smaller, are more organ confined, and manifest at lower stages of disease. The proportion of clear cell RCC is lower in young adults, while the prevalence of familial renal neoplastic syndromes is much higher, and genetic testing is routinely recommended. In such syndromic manifestations, benign-appearing renal cysts can harbor malignancy. Radiologists need to be familiar with the differences of RCCs in young adults and apply an altered approach to diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. For sporadic renal neoplasms, biopsy and active surveillance are less often used in young adults than in older adults. RCCs in young adults are overall associated with better disease-specific survival after surgical treatment, and minimally invasive nephron-sparing treatment options are preferred. However, surveillance schedules, need for biopsy, decision for an initial period of active surveillance, type of surgery (enucleation or wide-margin partial nephrectomy), and utilization of ablative therapy depend on the presence and type of underlying familial renal neoplastic syndrome. In this pictorial review, syndromic, nonsyndromic, and newer RCC entities that are common in young adults are presented. Their associated unique epidemiology, characteristic imaging and pathologic traits, and key aspects of surveillance and management of renal neoplasms in young adults are discussed. The vital role of the informed radiologist in the multidisciplinary management of RCCs in young adults is highlighted. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022.

### Early-onset renal cell carcinoma inharmatoma tumour syndrome [^111dLGFC]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Surveillance recommendations in other hereditary syndromes at risk of kidney cancer (e.g. von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease) are determined by assessing age-specific tumour risk, youngest reported age of onset, expected growth rate, and rate of tumour progressions affecting clinical treatment. Often, there are no international consensus guidelines for the management of hereditary syndromes. For example, in VHL disease, guidelines from various organizations, such as the NCI, VHL Alliance, and Danish VHL recommend screening for RCC with abdominal CT/MRI to begin at 15–18 years of age. This is based on multiple reports of RCC occurring as young as 16 years of age, and initiating screening 1 year earlier. Similar recommendations are made for hereditary papillary RCC Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, and hereditary paragangliomas–pheochromocytomas syndromes. Based on these reports in hereditary-RCC syndromes and our current findings, we propose a reassessment of the abdominal surveillance in patients with PHTS.

At present, clinical parameters have not been defined to establish which individuals with CS are at increased risk of developing kidney cancer, and diagnostic criteria pose a problem with identifying atypical cases of PHTS. Current surveillance guidelines outline screening for CS–RCC at 40 years of age via renal ultrasound every 1–2 years, despite reports of earlier onset. In addition, based on an estimated 34% increased lifetime risk of developing CS–RCC, it was suggested biannual renal imaging via ultrasound or MRI should be used. As the hypovascular nature of papillary and solid histology RCC tumours are difficult to detect via renal ultrasound, CT or MRI as an alternative imaging modality may have higher sensitivity for small lesions and variable tumours. In our second case, a series of CT or MRI of abdomen or kidneys showed the RCC developed and grew fairly rapidly into a size requiring surgery within less than 1 year. Although there was one report of RCC in a child of 11 years of age, no other children have been reported, and our series of multiple adults presenting in their twenties provides evidence to lower the current age of renal screening. We suggest the frequency should be at least biannual, beginning at 20 years of age, until additional paediatric cases support further lowering the age of renal screening.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and surveillance of BAP1 tumour predisposition syndrome [^111aDUwE]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

BAP1 germline testing indications

As for many other cancer predisposition genes, existing BAP1 testing criteria have generally been based on personal history of BAP1 -TPDS associated tumours or a personal and family history of BAP1 -TPDS associated tumours. More recent guidelines have suggested the addition of young age of onset of a BAP1 -associated tumour. Whilst in general, thresholds for genetic testing are decreasing due to diminishing costs and labour of genetic testing, most European countries apply a threshold at which genetic testing can be offered. In the UK and other European countries this has historically been set at approximately 10%, with the exception of genes where there are therapeutic implications for cancer management and/or clear risk reducing interventions, where lower thresholds may be considered.

The implementation of next generation sequencing gene panels, facilitating testing for specific indications have resulted in much broader eligibility criteria e.g. panels for inherited renal cancer or familial melanoma. Increasing implementation of large solid tumour panel tests and paired whole genome sequencing means that BAP1 testing may also be undertaken in patients with cancer outside the known spectrum of BAP1 -TPDS. At present, disease causing BAP1 variants are not on the list of ACMG actionable secondary findings due to concerns around penetrance and management of carriers in the context of identification in unrelated conditions.

As described in the prevalence section, the detection rate for a germline BAP1 pathogenic variant is higher where there is a personal or family history of other BAP1 -associated tumours and lower for isolated cases. The group felt that targeted germline testing of BAP1 was most relevant in the situation of a strong personal or family history of BAP1 -associated tumours, whereas in the case of an isolated BAP1 -related tumour without other suggestive features, where the detection rate is lower, testing may be indicated based on country specific guidelines or may be more appropriate in the setting of a larger panel.

Due to the high somatic rate of BAP1 variants, it was felt that reflex BAP1 germline testing was not appropriate and the decision to proceed to germline testing should only be undertaken in the context of a BAP1 -associated tumour with additional supportive information e.g. IHC loss, age of onset and personal /family history. This is consistent with the paper by Kuzbari et al. suggesting that if a threshold of 10% for detection of germline variants following somatic variant detection is recommended, BAP1 germline testing should not be undertaken.

### Management of renal cell carcinoma in young patients and patients with hereditary syndromes [^113uS2g2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Individuals that present with renal cell carcinoma at an early age deserve special attention because they are more likely to harbor an inherited predisposition and may require unique treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of characterized hereditary syndromes, many of which may predispose to kidney cancer. Although hereditary kidney cancer accounts for only 5–8% of kidney cancers, it should be considered in anyone with an early age of onset. These uncommon presentations should prompt consideration for genetic evaluation for germline alterations or somatic alterations associated with translocations. Treatment of kidney cancer in young individuals must also consider the late risks of nephron loss, the uncertainty with long-term follow-up after ablation, and the need for years of surveillance not only for the treated tumor but for de novo lesions in a patient with a greater risk of multifocality.

Summary

Early age of onset should raise concern for a hereditary renal cell carcinoma syndrome and should prompt consideration for genetic counseling to review personal and family history and determine if testing is indicated. Despite advancements in this field, significant work remains to fully delineate the management strategies for young individuals with and without hereditary cancer syndromes.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging — patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

Suggested Guidelines for BAP1 Genetic Screening

The group supported BAP1 screening of patients with MM occurring in the setting of a high-risk family history of MM, UM, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma and/or a high family incidence of multiple cancers and patients with MM carrying melanocytic BAP1 -mutated atypical intradermal tumors known as MBAITs.
Because of economic concerns, the group was divided on the issue of screening for BAP1 germline mutations in all sporadic cases of MM in the absence of MBAITS, UM, etc. or in the absence of a suggestive family history. Ideally, all patients with MM should be screened for BAP1 germline mutations when the resources are available.
The group supported screening for BAP1 germline mutations in families with high-risk features, such as three or more cases of any of the following cancers within two generations: MM, UM, renal cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.
With regard to when to test, the group was supportive of "early"-age screening for BAP1 germline mutations. The exact "early" age of testing for BAP1 mutations was controversial. It was noted that the earliest melanoma detected in a BAP1 -mutated germline carrier so far has been at the age of 19 years (this individual was cured by resection). In other cancer syndromes, such as the Lynch syndrome, it is generally advised to initiate screening 10 years before the earliest detected cancer. Thus, it was proposed that children may benefit from genetic testing, as those who are found to have inherited BAP1 mutations may benefit from screening for melanoma.
In summary, the group was in support of medical screening for at-risk people who are carriers of BAP1 germline mutations as follows: (1) annual dermatological screening for early detection of melanoma at age 18 or younger; (2) annual eye examination/ophthalmoscopy for UM at age 18 or younger; and (3) skin and eye examinations every 6 months after age of 30, when the frequency of cancer among carriers of germline BAP1 mutations starts to increase.
Genetic counseling should be offered to all individuals tested for BAP1.
Those with BAP1 germline mutations should be encouraged to participate in studies to improve early detection of MM (e.g. the planned biomarker studies). The group identified this population as a high-risk cohort in which early detection was greatly needed, and because of the high incidence of MM, the clinical effectiveness of novel MM therapies may be easier to demonstrate.
Insurance does not cover next-generation sequencing for MM. The group identified this issue as an important barrier to furthering the field and the availability of for MM is an unmet need that will require further research and funding support.

### Renal cell carcinoma: diagnosis and management [^113YUWcG]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Kidney cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the United States with 90% being attributed to renal cell carcinoma. Men, especially black men, are more likely to be affected than women. Renal masses, either cystic or solid, are best detected with contrast-enhanced, triple-phase computed tomography. Renal tumors are often detected incidentally during a computed tomography scan of the abdomen or chest that was ordered for unrelated symptoms. Hematuria serves as a warning sign that necessitates further evaluation and imaging leading to a diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options include active surveillance, ablation, nephron-sparing tumor excision, nephrectomy, and systemic treatment. Predictors of a poor prognosis include poor functional status and metastasis. In recent years new therapies have improved the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease. The family physician should be aware of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, tobacco use, exposure to trichloroethylene, familial syndromes) and lifestyle and dietary modifications that may reduce risk.

### Frequency of pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes in 1336 renal cell carcinoma cases [^115kembN]. Human Molecular Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

There are a number of limitations to our study. Although participants were recruited from a large number of individual centres and were not selected for any specific characteristics, all were fit to undergo surgery. In addition, there was no centralized review of histopathology, some clinical data were not available for all participants and data on the presence of syndromic RCC extra-renal manifestations and family history were not collected.

Our findings have implications for the application of genetic testing for germline variants in individuals with RCC. Though most centres offer testing to patients with features of an inherited cancer syndrome, there is less consensus for testing isolated non-syndromic cases. Within the UK, testing is offered to patients < 40 years of age (or < 50 years of age for pRCC), but internationally, it has been suggested that an age cut-off < 46 years (equivalent to the 10th percentile) would maximize the sensitivity and specificity and an age cut-off of 50 has also been recommended. However, in our cohort, only 23.3% (14/60) of those with an RCC-CSG variant, were aged < 46 years. Although there was a trend for a younger age at diagnosis in the genes most frequently tested in clinical practice (VHL, SDHB, FH and FLCN; mean: 38 years), mutations in less penetrant genes were detected, on average, in older patients (e.g. CHEK2 and SDHA; mean: 65.5 years). This makes it difficult to define an age cut-off that would efficiently enable the identification of all cases with an RCC-CSG variant without testing the majority of the cohort. In addition, we did not find statistically significant associations in our series with tumour stage or histology (e.g. ccRCC or non-clear cell). In rare cases, characteristic histopathological features may suggest an underlying inherited disorder (e.g. SDH-deficient RCC, hybrid chromophobe-oncocytic and BHD syndrome), but, in general, in the absence of family history or multicentric disease, age at diagnosis seems to be the most practical approach (with 70% general consensus) for stratifying genetic testing. Based on our results, testing a further 106 participants presenting between 45 and 50 years of age would enable detection of an extra 5 participants (Supplementary Material, Table S4). Therefore, we suggest that genetic testing should be extended to < 50 years of age and that the small clinical gene panels currently used in the UK to be expanded to include CHEK2, SDHA, SDHC and SDHD. These additional CSGs also predispose to other tumour types and surveillance recommendations are available for gene carriers. In addition, for SDHA, SDHC and SDHD, functional investigations (e.g. SDHB / SDHA immunohistochemistry and metabolomics) are available that can aid SDH x variant interpretation. The associated cancer risks with MITF variants (observed in 10 participants) are not well defined and hence we suggest that further evidence is required before incorporating MITF into RCC panels.

MPRT has often been taken as a clinical indicator of a possible underlying hereditary cancer predisposition and the literature review confirmed the greater frequency (14.9% (430/2879)) of patients with a family history of cancer or a diagnosis of a hereditary RCC-associated syndrome in MPRT compared to an unselected series of patients with RCC (~5%). However, a potential limitation of analysing cases reported in the literature is preferential reporting of patient series for specific cancer syndromes (e.g. VHL disease). A wide variety of inherited disorders can predispose to RCC (and often other tumour types), and these are summarised in Table 1. The frequency of an inherited RCC predisposition disorder among a cohort with MPRT will depend on multiple factors including the frequency of the inherited disorder, the risk of RCC and MPRT in the disorder and the ease with which it can be diagnosed, for example if there is a readily apparent or distinctive phenotype or because genetic testing for the disorder is widely utilised.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: an online survey [^1167CVda]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Odds (OR ± 95% confidence intervals) of intending to take up screening with each of the five screening modalities, adjusting for participant characteristics, the burden/inconvenience and worry associated with each test, and clustering of response by participant. *significantly lower than urine test (p < 0.05)

Participants with higher BMI and higher general cancer worry were more likely to report intention to attend screening (Fig. 3). Being more worried about the screening tests or associating more burden and inconvenience were associated with decreased odds of intending to take up screening overall in the study population. There was, however, an interaction between general cancer worry and worry about the screening tests, with worry about screening tests associated with reduced odds of intending to attend only in those with low cancer worry (cancer worry scale ≤ 5) (OR 0.67 (0.48–0.94)) and not in than those with high cancer worry (OR 0.98 (0.69–1.40)). There was no evidence of an interaction (p > 0.05) for the other potential interactions assessed. Although not statistically significant as a result of the small numbers with a family history of kidney cancer, having a family history of kidney was also associated with an increased odds of intending to take up screening (OR 4.70 (0.41–53.7), with 27 of the 29 participants with a family history of kidney cancer likely to take up all four screening tests. These findings were similar when each screening option was considered separately (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table 2 and Additional file 4: Supplementary Fig. 1a-e). Notably all those with a family history of kidney cancer reported they would take up screening with an ultrasound scan, 28 out of 29 would take up screening with urine or blood testing, and 27 out of 29 would take up low-dose CT scanning.

### Genetic kidney cancer syndromes [^1175Z3zD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have yielded clues regarding the molecular pathogenesis of sporadic RCC. The discovery of germline mutations in chromatin-modulating enzymes also defined a new hereditary RCC syndrome. Although histologically distinct RCC subtypes exist, emerging themes shared between hereditary and sporadic RCC include dysregulation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein/hypoxia inducible factor axis, defective ciliogenesis, and aberrant tumor metabolism. This article describes the most common hereditary RCC syndromes and associated extrarenal manifestations. Recent evidence supports developing screening guidelines for early-onset RCC to identify persons with germline mutations in the absence of secondary clinical manifestations.

### Genetic disorders and renal cell carcinoma [^115KaNyn]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The study of hereditary RCC syndromes continues to provide significant insight into the pathways that are involved in renal cell tumorigenesis. The clinician should maintain a high level of suspicion for genetic disorders when patients present with early-onset or mult-focal RCC. Recognition of familial syndromes will facilitate the institution of parenchymal sparing measures, as well as appropriate screening and intervention for associated nonrenal manifestations.

### Early-onset renal cell carcinoma inharmatoma tumour syndrome [^112iCwJa]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most well-characterized prospective cohort study from the Cleveland Clinic identified 9/219 patients with a germline PTEN pathogenic variant and a history of RCC. Average age at diagnosis was 45.4 years of age, with a median age of 49 years and a 2:1 female-to-male ratio, demographics differing from the reported SEER data for kidney, and renal pelvis cancer (2004–2008) where mean age is 64 and an inverted 2:1 male-to-female ratio. Lifetime risk for developing RCC was estimated to be > 30-fold higher. Compared to many other hereditary kidney cancer syndromes, there are many different histologic subtypes present in CS–RCC, whereas the most common type of RCC in the general population (clear cell) is the least common in CS.

Here, we report two cases of early-onset CS–RCC, adding to the mounting evidence of early-onset RCC to consider improving guidelines for clinical diagnosis and time at initiation of renal surveillance.

### Assessment of risk of hereditary predisposition in patients with melanoma and / or mesothelioma and renal neoplasia [^113gxwVH]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for evaluation of hereditary RCC predisposition syndromes recommend testing for all individuals who meet the following criteria: RCC at less than or equal to age 46 years, bilateral/multifocal tumors, first-degree or second-degree relatives with RCC or with a known pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in cancer susceptibility genes and specific histologic features associated with certain renal neoplasia. Four of 5 patients in our study met these criteria and our results support the continued use of these guidelines. However, given the association of hereditary predisposition syndromes in patients with melanoma and/or mesothelioma with renal neoplasia, universal screening may be warranted in this patient population with a panel that includes BAP1, MITF, and FLCN.

Hereditary and familial RCC — proportion, syndromes, and management guidance are provided: Family history is associated with an increased risk of RCC and a number of familial RCC syndromes are now well-established, accounting for approximately 4–6% of cases of RCC overall; these syndromes include von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC), Birt Hogg-Dube (BHD), hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC), succinate dehydrogenase deficiency RCC, tuberous sclerosis, BAP-1 tumor predisposition syndrome, and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (Cowden syndrome); RCC in these syndromes tends to be earlier in onset and multifocal and management should prioritize nephron-sparing approaches, including tumor enucleation when feasible to optimize preservation of parenchymal mass; for most of these syndromes, tumors can be observed if less than 3 cm as the risk of metastases remains low in this setting; HLRCC and succinate dehydrogenase deficiency RCC are the exception as tumors in these syndromes are often very aggressive and a proactive approach to evaluation and management should be pursued; genetic counseling should also be recommended for patients suspected of having familial RCC.

### Painful pink papules and nodules presenting in a blaskoid distribution [^112DETuw]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the recommended monitoring for this syndrome?
A. Yearly abdominal magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) and skin exams
B. Yearly renal ultrasounds and FH genetic testing in first- and second-degree relatives
C. Yearly abdominal computed tomographies (CTs)
D. Annual blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) and urinalysis (UA)
E. No screening necessary

Answers:

A. Yearly abdominal MRIs and skin exams – Correct. Approximately 10% to 15% of HLRCC cases are associated with type II papillary renal cell carcinoma. Because the case presented herein with cutaneous mosaicism has a germline FH mutation, she has the same risk of developing type II papillary renal cell carcinoma as an individual with HLRCC who presents without cutaneous mosaicism. Current guidelines recommend annual contrast-enhanced MRI of the kidneys. All patients should be followed by a dermatologist for annual skin exams, as leiomyomas can turn into leiomyosarcoma in approximately 1% of cases.
B. Yearly renal ultrasounds and FH genetic testing in first- and second-degree relatives – Incorrect. Contrast-enhanced MRIs are more sensitive than renal ultrasounds for type II papillary renal cell carcinoma screening. FH genetic testing in first- and second-degree relatives may be considered so appropriate screenings can be implemented to monitor for associated malignancies.
C. Yearly abdominal CTs – Incorrect. Current guidelines recommend annual contrast-enhanced MRI of kidneys to screen for type II papillary renal cell carcinoma.
D. Annual BUN/Cr and UA – Incorrect. Current guidelines recommend annual contrast-enhanced MRI to screen for type II papillary renal cell carcinoma.
E. No screening necessary – Incorrect. Individuals with HLRCC are at high risk of developing renal cell carcinoma, so annual screenings with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the kidneys are recommended.

### Frequency of pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes in 1336 renal cell carcinoma cases [^116rPAX3]. Human Molecular Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Detection of a germline P/LP in RCC-CSG variants can enable RCC prevention strategies (e.g. renal cancer surveillance, cascade testing and awareness of non-RCC tumour risks). In some cases, it may also suggest genotype-driven therapies as exhibited with foretinib for RCC patients carrying germline MET variants. As the importance of knowledge of germline findings to determine management increases and the cost of genomic analysis falls, the indications for germline and somatic sequencing in RCC should be extended and play a large part in routine clinical care. However, the selection of genes that should be tested requires careful consideration of diagnostic yields, VUS likelihood and the clinical utility (e.g. availability of management guidelines) of diagnostic findings.

### Family history and risk of renal cell carcinoma: a national multiregister case-control study [^113C7Bz7]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our purpose was to investigate the association between family history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and RCC risk.

Materials and Methods

RCC cases diagnosed in Sweden between 2005 and 2014 and 10 matched controls were identified using the Renal Cell Cancer Database Sweden, with linkage to the Multigeneration Register and the Swedish Cancer Registry. The association between a family history of RCC and RCC was investigated, overall and by sex and age groups.

Results

Among 9416 RCC cases, 294 (3.1%) had 1 or more parent or sibling (first-degree relative [FDR]) with RCC. Median age at diagnosis for cases with an affected FDR was 65 years (IQR 59–71) and 68 years (IQR 60–75) for all cases. The proportion of women was significantly higher among familial RCC compared to sporadic RCC (44.6% vs 38.5%, P = .035). RCC was twice as likely with 1 or more FDR with RCC (OR 1.9; CI 1.65–2.16). Stratified analysis showed an OR of 2.4 for women (CI 1.93–2.92) and 1.6 for men (CI 1.35–1.93). Two or more FDRs was associated with a sixfold increased risk (95% CI 2.37–15.5). Familial RCC was strongly associated with bilateral and multifocal tumors (OR 5.5; CI 2.36–13.0, OR 3.5; CI 1.89–6.49).

Conclusions

In this Swedish data set, 3.1% of RCC patients have 1 or more FDR diagnosed with RCC. There was no statistical difference in median age between sporadic RCC and familial RCC. Having 1 or more FDR with RCC approximately doubles the risk of RCC with a higher risk increase for women than for men. People with 2 FDRs with RCC constitute a small high-risk group that may benefit from screening.

### Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome: a family affair [^116NABgp]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 49-year-old woman with cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, flank pain and a family history of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome sought genetic testing. She was found to harbour a fumarate hydratase (FH) genetic mutation and a previously undetected renal tumour. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy, and remains well at follow-up. HLRCC syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disease, with patients at increased risk for cutaneous leiomyomas, early-onset uterine leiomyomas and aggressive renal carcinoma. Although the syndrome may manifest life-threatening complications, outcomes may be improved by preventative family screening and surveillance, compelling early diagnosis.

Guidelines

J. All renal transplant recipients should have regular ultrasonography of their native kidneys (when applicable) for screening of renal cell carcinomas, which are observed at much higher incidence in both dialysed and transplant patients. K. Guidelines published for screening and prevention of solid organ cancers in the general population should be strictly applied to transplant recipients, who are in general at higher cancer risk, but would benefit equally or even greater. L. All male renal transplant recipients aged 50 and over should have a yearly prostate specific antigen (PSA) test prior to a regular digital rectal examination. M. All female renal transplant recipients should have a yearly cervical (PAP) smear together with regular pelvic examination and regular mammography, according to national recommendations where available. N. All renal transplant recipients should undergo a faecal occult-blood testing as a screening for colorectal cancer and other (pre-malignant) lesions, according to national recommendations where available. O. In all these conditions, it is recommended to reduce immunosuppression whenever possible.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and surveillance of BAP1 tumour predisposition syndrome [^113723cA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Predictive genetic testing (i.e.g.enetic testing for a known familial variant) should only be offered if the familial variant in BAP1 is likely pathogenic or pathogenic according to ACMG/ACP guidelines. Offering predictive testing was felt to be appropriate in late teens when surveillance may start (see next section). There may be situations where testing family members for a variant of unknown significance (VUS) is helpful for the purpose of segregation studies if this helps in the evaluation of the pathogenicity of the variant. Also, when awaiting the outcome of functional testing in a research setting for a VUS, it may be appropriate to consider dermatologic and ophthalmic screening in first degree relatives, but this may be best decided in the context of specialist MDT discussion.

Cancer risks and surveillance for BAP1 -associated cancer

The malignancy risk associated with germline BAP1 pathogenic variants is unclear due to limited data on long term follow up of individuals ascertained via cascade testing following a diagnostic test in an affected individual. Due to ascertainment bias, the current estimates of risk are likely to be overestimated. A summary of published studies are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

The largest reported study of BAP1 -TPDS carriers (n = 181 families) suggests that lifetime cancer risks were reported to be different for truncating compared to missense variants. The frequency of cancers reported in probands with truncating and missense variants for uveal melanoma was 36% (36/141) and 23% (9/40), for melanoma 23% (33/141) and 45% (18/40), for malignant mesothelioma 25% (35/141) and 15% (6/40), and for renal cell cancer 6% (8/141) and 10% (4/40). The frequency of cancers described for the non-probands were lower suggesting ascertainment bias. The age of onset of the cancers is younger than in the general population with an estimated worse survival of cases of uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Conversely, there is some evidence that individuals with mesothelioma and BAP1 GPV have a better survival.

### Public attitudes towards screening for kidney cancer: an online survey [^115nUmcF]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Internationally, there is great interest in evaluating the potential for a screening programme for kidney cancer. Half of all patients with kidney cancer have asymptomatic disease and up to a quarter of individuals have evidence of metastases at diagnosis. Survival is strongly related to stage at diagnosis. A screening programme, potentially in a selected higher risk population, may down-stage the disease, reduce the prevalence of metastatic tumours at diagnosis, improve survival and decrease the expenditure related to systemic therapies.

The two currently available potential screening modalities are ultrasound and CT scan. Our group reported a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis of ultrasound scan-based screening. This suggested that screening may have acceptable cost-effectiveness in men aged 50–60y (£18–22k/QALY) and in women aged 60 if the prevalence of kidney cancer is at least 0.2%. When combined with other CT scan-based screening programmes, such as current lung cancer screening pilots, additional screening for kidney cancer by CT scan has the potential to provide health and economic benefits. Research into new urinary (i.e. perilipin 1 and aquaporin 2) and blood based markers (i.e. KIM-1) is also on-going and these may provide additional options for screening in the future.

Whichever screening modality is used, the benefits will only be realised if sufficient numbers of the target population undergo screening. This requires consideration of the views of the population on the acceptability and potential engagement with future programmes. To our knowledge, no studies have addressed these issues for kidney cancer. We aimed to explore the attitudes of the public towards potential future screening programmes for kidney cancer with different tests and to understand the individual and system-level factors influencing intention to take up screening.

### Imaging surveillance for children with predisposition to renal tumors [^1146PjKt]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Effective surveillance is necessary for early detection of tumors in children with cancer predisposition syndromes. Instituting a surveillance regimen in children comes with practical challenges that include determining imaging modality and timing, and considering cost efficiency, accessibility, and the significant consequences of false-positive and false-negative results. To address these challenges, the American Association for Cancer Research has recently published consensus recommendations that focus on surveillance of cancer predisposition syndromes in children. This review condenses the imaging surveillance recommendations for syndromes that carry a predisposition to renal tumors in childhood, and includes summaries of the predisposition syndromes and discussion of considerations of available imaging modalities.

### Frequency of pathogenic germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes in 1336 renal cell carcinoma cases [^115cQJAn]. Human Molecular Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurs in a number of cancer predisposition syndromes, but the genetic architecture of susceptibility to RCC is not well defined. We investigated the frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes (CSGs) within a large series of unselected RCC participants. Whole-genome sequencing data on 1336 RCC participants and 5834 controls recruited to the UK 100 000 Genomes Project, a nationwide multicentre study, was analyzed to identify rare P/LP short variants (single nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions ranging from 1 to 50 base pairs) and structural variants in 121 CSGs. Among 1336 RCC participants [mean: 61.3 years (± 12 SD), range: 13–88 years; 64% male], 85 participants [6.4%; 95% CI (5.1, 7.8)] had one or more P/LP germline variant in a wider range of CSGs than previously recognized. A further 64 intragenic variants in CSGs previously associated with RCC were classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) (24 'hot VUSs') and were considered to be of potential clinical relevance as further evaluation might results in their reclassification. Most patients with P variants in well-established CSGs known to predispose to renal cell carcinoma (RCC-CSGs) were aged < 50 years. Burden test analysis for filtered variants in CSGs demonstrated a significant excess of CHEK2 variants in European RCC participants compared with the healthy European controls (P = 0.0019). Approximately, 6% of the patients with RCC unselected for family history have a germline variant requiring additional follow-up analysis. To improve diagnostic yield, we suggest expanding the panel of RCC-CSGs tested to include CHEK2 and all SDH x subunits and raising the eligibility criteria for age-based testing.

### Family history of cancer and renal cell cancer risk in caucasians and African Americans [^1174PKwV]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Of 1918 eligible cases identified, 171 died before contact or interview, 92 could not be located with the available contact information, 21 moved out of the area, and the physicians of 63 cases refused permission to contact their patients. Among the remaining 1571 cases we sought to enrol, 221 declined participation and 133 were not interviewed because of serious illness, impairment, or failure to respond to multiple attempts to contact. Thus, 1217 cases (77.5% of those we attempted to recruit) participated in the study. Of 2718 presumed eligible controls, 41 died before contact or interview, 345 could not be located with the available contact information, and 63 had moved out of the region. Among the 2269 controls we attempted to recruit, 677 declined to participate and 357 were not interviewed because of serious illness, impairment, or failure to respond to multiple attempts to contact. Thus, 1235 eligible controls (54.4% of those we attempted to recruit) participated. Institutional review board approvals were obtained from all participating study centres and informed written consent was obtained from all participants.

Trained interviewers were administered an in-home, computer-assisted personal interview, in which detailed information was collected on demographics, smoking history, medical and medication history, diet, occupation, and family history of cancer. Information on family history of cancer was collected for all first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, and offspring), including cancer site and age at diagnosis. For analytical purposes, a set of sample weights were developed to reduce the potential for bias arising from differential sampling rates for controls and cases, from survey non-response, and from deficiencies in the coverage of the population at risk by the files of the DMV and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to select controls. For controls, their sample weights also include a poststratification adjustment so that the weighted distribution of controls across the matching variables matches the weighted distribution of cases in an exact manner. In addition to being consistent with the objectives of frequency matching, this poststratification adjustment reduces the variability of the weights compared with not using this adjustment.

### Hereditary kidney cancer syndromes-NCI… [^116oiaLv]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Having certain hereditary syndromes can increase the risk of kidney cancer. Most of the time, kidney cancer risk is not passed down from parent to child. Kidney cancer that affects multiple generations of a family is called hereditary kidney cancer. Hereditary kidney cancer accounts for only 5%‒8% of all kidney cancers. It is usually linked to a hereditary cancer syndrome. A hereditary cancer syndrome is a disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing a certain type or types of cancer. What is genetic counseling and who should receive it. Key Points
- Genetic counseling is a communication process between a specially trained health professional and a person concerned about the genetic risk of disease.
- Whether a person should get tested for hereditary kidney cancer depends on certain factors.

Genetic counseling is a communication process between a specially trained health professional and a person concerned about the genetic risk of disease. It is not always easy to determine whether a condition in a family is inherited. Genetic counselors and other specially trained health professionals can help patients understand their personal and family medical history, their options for genetic testing, and the risks and benefits of learning genetic information. If a patient chooses to get genetic testing, it may be done using a sample of blood, saliva, or skin. Genetic test results can reveal information about other family members and can create tension in the family. Genetic counselors can help people cope with their genetic testing results, including how to discuss the results with family members. Whether a person should get tested for hereditary kidney cancer depends on certain factors.

Certain clues in the medical history or family history may lead health professionals to think that a person may have a hereditary syndrome. With kidney cancer, people who have one or more of the following criteria may be referred for genetic counseling and testing: Families with these hereditary syndromes are watched closely for signs of disease in the kidneys and in other organs. Most kidney tumors that occur can be removed by surgery, but they may recur. Other treatment options may be available. To learn more about screening and treatment options for each hereditary syndrome, see the health professional summaries on Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer, Von Hippel-Lindau Disease, Birt-Hogg-Dubé Syndrome, and Hereditary Papillary Renal Carcinoma.

Because the place where the cancer started is not known, many tests and procedures may be done to search for the primary cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used: Physical exam and health history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Urinalysis: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria. The amplified DNA copies help tell whether a specific mRNA is being made by a gene. RT–PCR can be used to check the activation of certain genes that may indicate the presence of cancer cells. This test may be used to look for certain changes in a gene or chromosome, which may help diagnose cancer.

Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of tumor tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Changes in certain chromosomes are linked to certain types of cancer. Light and electron microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. For example, a colonoscopy may be done. Tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body.

Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. The blood may be checked for the levels of CA-125, CgA, alpha-fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotropin, or prostate-specific antigen. Sometimes, none of the tests can find the primary cancer site. In these cases, treatment may be based on what the doctor thinks is the most likely type of cancer.
