## Question

is a firboscan a controlled attenuation parameter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a FibroScan is the same as a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what FibroScan actually is and what it measures. Then, I should verify what CAP is and how it is generated. Next, I will check whether CAP is inherent to FibroScan or an add-on. After that, I need to distinguish the device (FibroScan) from the parameter (CAP). Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note practical implications for clinical use.

> Let me first confirm the device: FibroScan is a vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) platform that noninvasively measures liver stiffness in kilopascals (kPa) to estimate fibrosis, and it is the most validated elastography technology in clinical practice, widely used at the point of care [^111XUbDZ] [^116WDA49].

> Now, I need to verify what CAP is: CAP is a separate, quantitative measure of hepatic steatosis derived from the same radiofrequency signals used for stiffness measurement, expressed in decibels per meter (dB/m), and it estimates ultrasound attenuation which increases with liver fat content. Importantly, CAP is obtained simultaneously with liver stiffness during the same VCTE examination on FibroScan devices [^114ZaDUv] [^111XUbDZ] [^116n6gHi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: CAP is not the device itself. It is a parameter calculated by the FibroScan system from the acquired ultrasound signals, and its availability depends on the specific software and probe configuration on the FibroScan platform, which is why CAP is often described as an add-on feature rather than the core function of FibroScan [^111fUrGq] [^111FUiwN].

> I should double-check the relationship to avoid confusion: FibroScan is the hardware/software platform that performs VCTE and can, when configured appropriately, output both liver stiffness (for fibrosis) and CAP (for steatosis). Thus, CAP is a measurement generated by FibroScan, not synonymous with the device itself, and its performance is influenced by factors such as BMI, probe selection, and measurement quality criteria [^114ZaDUv] [^116WDA49].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly: No, FibroScan is not a controlled attenuation parameter. FibroScan is the transient elastography device that can measure liver stiffness and, when equipped with CAP functionality, can also provide CAP as a quantitative estimate of hepatic steatosis during the same session [^111XUbDZ] [^114ZaDUv].

> But wait, what if the user is asking practically how to interpret results? I need to ensure clinical context: CAP values typically range from about 100 to 400 dB/m, with commonly used thresholds around 248–288 dB/m to detect significant steatosis depending on etiology and population, yet CAP has limited accuracy for precise grading compared with MRI-PDFF, so results should be interpreted alongside stiffness and clinical factors and, when possible, after fasting to minimize postprandial effects on reliability [^114ZaDUv] [^115xKUdj] [^117KazWB].

---

FibroScan is not the same as CAP; **FibroScan is the device** (vibration-controlled transient elastography) that measures liver stiffness, while **CAP is a parameter** measured by FibroScan to quantify hepatic steatosis [^113G2yAo]. CAP is derived from the same ultrasound signals used for stiffness and is reported in dB/m, but it is a distinct measure of liver fat, not the device itself [^116n6gHi]. CAP is recommended by AASLD for noninvasive steatosis assessment, but it is not the same as FibroScan [^115ssxmX].

---

## Definition and purpose of FibroScan

FibroScan is a **non-invasive medical device** that uses vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) to assess liver stiffness, providing a quantitative measure of hepatic fibrosis [^111XUbDZ]. It is widely used in clinical practice to evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis in various chronic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis B and C, and alcoholic liver disease [^111XUbDZ]. FibroScan provides results in kilopascals (kPa), with higher values indicating greater liver stiffness and, consequently, more severe fibrosis [^114awYJp].

---

## Definition and purpose of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)

CAP is a **parameter measured by FibroScan** that quantifies the attenuation of ultrasound signals as they pass through liver tissue, correlating with the amount of hepatic steatosis (fat accumulation) [^112T2S7p]. CAP values are expressed in decibels per meter (dB/m) and provide a non-invasive assessment of liver fat content. CAP is derived from the same ultrasound signals used to measure liver stiffness, allowing simultaneous assessment of both fibrosis and steatosis during a single examination [^117PxUnt].

---

## Technical differences between FibroScan and CAP

| **Aspect** | **Fibroscan** | **Cap** |
|-|-|-|
| Measurement | Liver stiffness (fibrosis) | Liver fat content (steatosis) |
| Unit | Kilopascals (kPa) | Decibels per meter (dB/m) |
| Principle | Shear wave velocity | Ultrasound attenuation |
| Clinical use | Assess fibrosis severity | Quantify hepatic steatosis |

---

## Clinical applications and limitations

FibroScan is primarily used to assess the severity of liver fibrosis, providing valuable information for disease staging and monitoring progression or regression of fibrosis [^111XUbDZ]. CAP, on the other hand, is used to **quantify hepatic steatosis**, aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of fatty liver diseases such as NAFLD [^115xKUdj]. Both FibroScan and CAP have limitations, including variability in measurements due to patient factors (e.g. obesity, ascites) and operator dependence [^116WDA49]. CAP measurements can be influenced by factors such as body mass index (BMI), liver stiffness, and recent food intake, which may affect accuracy and reliability [^114ZaDUv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) provides guidelines on the use of FibroScan and CAP in clinical practice. According to the AASLD, **CAP is recommended** for non-invasive assessment of hepatic steatosis in adult patients with chronic liver disease, particularly in the context of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and other chronic liver conditions [^115ssxmX] [^1113cBeP]. The guidelines emphasize the importance of considering patient-specific factors and clinical context when interpreting CAP measurements [^114ZaDUv].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, FibroScan and CAP are **distinct but complementary** tools in liver disease assessment. FibroScan measures liver stiffness to assess fibrosis, while CAP quantifies liver fat content to evaluate steatosis. CAP is a parameter measured by FibroScan, not the device itself, and both are recommended by clinical guidelines for non-invasive liver disease assessment [^1113cBeP] [^113G2yAo].

### Prospective evaluation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by elastographic methods of liver steatosis and fibrosis; controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurements [^111Ktnys]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To examine the temporal changes of both controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM), assessed by Fibroscan, in a large sample of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Methods

In this prospective, observational study, we consecutively enrolled 507 adult individuals with Fibroscan-defined NAFLD who were followed for a mean period of 21.2 ± 11.7 months.

Results

During the follow-up period, 84 patients (16.5%) had a progression of CAP of at least 20% with a median time of 39.93 months, while 201 (39.6%) patients had a progression of LSM of at least 20% with median time of 30.46 months. There were significant differences in the proportion of LSM progression across body mass index (BMI) categories, with obese patients having the highest risk of progression over the follow-up (hazard ratio 1.66; 95%CI 1.23–2.25). Multivariable regression analysis showed that BMI and serum creatinine levels were the strongest predictors for CAP progression in the whole population, while HOMA-estimated insulin resistance was an independent predictor of LSM progression over time in the subgroup of obese patients.

Conclusion

This prospective study shows for the first time that the progression risk of both liver steatosis and fibrosis, detected non-invasively by Fibroscan, is relevant and shares essentially the same metabolic risk factors that are associated with NAFLD progression detected by other invasive methods.

### Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) for the diagnosis of steatosis: a prospective study of 5323 examinations [^114dP37n]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) evaluated with transient elastography (FibroScan®) is a recent method for non-invasive assessment of steatosis. Its usefulness in clinical practice is unknown. We prospectively investigated the determinants of CAP failure and the relationships between CAP and clinical or biological parameters in a large cohort of consecutive patients.

Methods

All CAP examinations performed in adult patients with suspected chronic liver disease were included. CAP failure was defined as zero valid shot. The following factors were analyzed for their influence on CAP value and the relationships between CAP and clinico-biological parameters: age, gender, body mass index, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, alcohol use, liver stiffness measurement, indication, and different biological parameters.

Results

CAP failure occurred in 7.7% of 5323 examinations. By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with CAP measurement failure were female gender, BMI, and metabolic syndrome. By multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with elevated CAP were BMI [25–30]kg/m², BMI > 30kg/m², metabolic syndrome, alcohol > 14 drink/week and liver stiffness > 6kPa. CAP increased with the number of parameters of metabolic syndrome, BMI, waist circumference, the presence of diabetes or hypertension, and the cause of the disease. In the 440 patients with liver biopsy, for the diagnosis of steatosis > 10%, steatosis > 33%, and steatosis > 66%, AUROCs of CAP were 0.79 (95% CI 0.74–0.84, p < 0.001), 0.84 (95% CI 0.80–0.88, p < 0.001), 0.84 (95% CI 0.80–0.88, p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

CAP provides an immediate assessment of steatosis simultaneously with liver stiffness measurement. The strong association of CAP with the metabolic syndrome and alcohol use could be of interest for the follow-up of NAFLD or alcoholic patients.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — In patients with steatosis on imaging, abnormal liver chemistries signal a higher likelihood for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis of NASH; in addition, Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (FibroScan device, Echosens, Paris, France) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and may be a useful non-invasive tool to determine who might have more advanced fibrosis, with controlled attenuation parameter measurement potentially incorporated to quantify steatosis although the role of these non-invasive techniques is still emerging.

### Prevalence of fatty liver disease and fibrosis detected by transient elastography in adults in the United States, 2017–2018 [^111EFXUw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fatty liver disease is a clinicopathologic spectrum that encompasses simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Transient elastography has evolved as an accurate technique and noninvasive tool for assessing hepatic fibrosis in clinical practice. 1 The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score has been added to elastography, which computes ultrasound attenuation related to hepatic steatosis and improves the measurement of hepatic steatosis. 1, 2 Given the unmet need to reckon the current burden of disease, it is essential to estimate the recent prevalence of fatty liver disease and fibrosis assessed by transient elastography in the United States. We investigated the sex-, race/ethnicity-, and body mass index-based prevalence of fatty liver disease and hepatic fibrosis by CAP-enhanced transient elastography in the United States.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis in children: the clinical value of controlled attenuation parameter [^111FUiwN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

CAP was obtained by using the FibroScan 502 Touch device with the 3.5 MHz M probe or 2.5 MHz XL probes. CAP is a method for noninvasively quantifying the fat in the liver. The device estimates liver stiffness in kiloPascal (kPa) and liver steatosis in decibel/meter (dB/m). The principles of CAP have been described elsewhere. CAP estimates the attenuation of the ultrasound waves at the central frequency of the probe of the Fibroscan device, and is guided by vibration-controlled transient elastography, ensuring that the operator automatically obtains the attenuation value of the liver. CAP was computed only when the associated LSM was valid and using the same signals as the one used to measure liver stiffness. As reported in the literature, only LSMs with 10 validated measurements and an interquartile range/median (IQR/M) < 30% for values higher than 7.1 kPa were considered reliable. There are no recommendations for successful CAP measurement. Examinations with no successful measurements after 10 attempts were deemed failures. Following a fast of at least 6 h, measurements were performed with the M probe when the skin to liver capsule distance, estimated with US, was ≤ 25 mm, otherwise the XL probe was used. In subjects with a thoracic perimeter less than 75 cm CAP measurements were not performed because the CAP is not available yet on the 5 MHz S probe, which is specifically designed for the assessment of these subjects. In each patient, the LSMs and CAP measurements were performed by the same physician who had performed the US exam.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter compared with ultrasound for detecting hepatic steatosis in children with severe obesity [^113S1AZf]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) on FibroScan ® in detecting and grading steatosis in a screening setting and perform a head-to-head comparison with conventional B-mode ultrasound.

Methods

Sixty children with severe obesity (median BMI z-score 3.37; median age 13.7 years) were evaluated. All underwent CAP and US using a standardized scoring system. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy proton density fat fraction (MRS-PDFF) was used as a reference standard.

Results

Steatosis was present in 36/60 (60%) children. The areas under the ROC (AUROC) of CAP for the detection of grade ≥ S1, ≥ S2, and ≥ S3 steatosis were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67–0.89), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65–0.87), and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66–0.88), respectively. The AUROC of US for the detection of grade ≥ S1 steatosis was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55–0.80) and not significantly different from that of CAP (p = 0.09). For detecting ≥ S1 steatosis, using the optimal cutoffs, CAP (277 dB/m) and US (US steatosis score ≥ 2) had a sensitivity of 75% and 61% and a specificity of 75% and 71%, respectively. When using echogenicity of liver parenchyma as only the scoring item, US had a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 46% to detect ≥ S1 steatosis. The difference in specificity of CAP and US when using only echogenicity of liver parenchyma of 29% was significant (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

The overall performance of CAP is not significantly better than that of US in detecting steatosis in children with obesity, provided that the standardized scoring of US features is applied. When US is based on liver echogenicity only, CAP outperforms US in screening for any steatosis (≥ S1).

Key Points

- The areas under the ROC curves of CAP and ultrasound (US) for detecting grade ≥ S1 steatosis were 0.80 and 0.68, respectively, and were not significantly different (p = 0.09).

- For detecting grade ≥ S1 steatosis in severely obese children, CAP had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 75% at its optimal cutoff value of 277 dB/m.

- For detecting grade ≥ S1 steatosis in clinical practice, both CAP and US can be used, provided that the standardized scoring of US images is used.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^115JZmhU]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Steatosis assessment technical remarks — In adult patients with CLD, controlled attenuated parameter (CAP) and MRI can reliably quantify steatosis, MRI-PDFF and MRS correlate well with histology and can be used as reference standards, available evidence is insufficient to determine which noninvasive tests or algorithms should be used to assess steatosis, caution is necessary when using NILDA after bariatric surgery because many indices include BMI, and populations such as chronic HCV genotype 3 have not been well studied.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis in children: the clinical value of controlled attenuation parameter [^1141SHpr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the clinical validity of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in a series of overweight or obese children by using the imperfect gold standard methodology.

Methods

Consecutive children referred to our institution for auxological evaluation or obesity or minor elective surgery were prospectively enrolled. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were recorded. Ultrasound (US) assessment of steatosis was carried out using ultrasound systems. CAP was obtained with the FibroScan 502 Touch device (Echosens, Paris, France). Pearson's or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used to test the association between two study variables. Optimal cutoff of CAP for detecting steatosis was 249 dB/m. The diagnostic performance of dichotomized CAP, US, body mass indexes (BMI), fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI) was analyzed using the imperfect gold standard methodology.

Results

Three hundred five pediatric patients were enrolled. The data of both US and CAP were available for 289 children. Steatosis was detected in 50/289 (17.3%) children by US and in 77/289 (26.6%) by CAP. A moderate to good correlation was detected between CAP and BMI (r = 0.53), FLI (r = 0.55) and HSI (r = 0.56). In obese children a moderate to good correlation between CAP and insulin levels (r = 0.54) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.54) was also found. Dichotomized CAP showed a performance of 0.70 (sensitivity, 0.72 [0.64–0.79]; specificity, 0.98 [0.97–0.98], which was better than that of US (performance, 0.37; sensitivity, 0.46 [0.42–0.50]; specificity, 0.91 [0.89–0.92]), BMI (performance, 0.22; sensitivity, 0.75 [0.73–0.77]; specificity, 0.57 [0.55–0.60]) and FLI or HSI.

Conclusions

For the evaluation of liver steatosis in children CAP performs better than US, which is the most widely used imaging technique for screening patients with a suspicion of liver steatosis. A cutoff value of CAP of 249 dB/m rules in liver steatosis with a very high specificity.

### Fetuin-A: a relevant novel serum biomarker for non-invasive diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a retrospective case-control study [^1166vKrg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine how fetuin-A contributes to diagnosing and assessing MASLD severity.

Methods

Fifty MASLD patients and fifty healthy control participants were involved in this retrospective case-control research. Abdominal ultrasonography, fibroscan with controlled attenuated parameter scan (CAP scan), laboratory investigation (including fetuin-A assessment), clinical examination, and history-taking were performed on every case.

Results

Fetuin-A level was considerably higher in the Cases group (1154.85 ± 629.89) than in the Control group (505.29 ± 150.4) (p < 0.001). Fetuin-A had significant validity in the prediction of MASLD at a cut-off > 702.5 with 82% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and 86% overall accuracy.

Conclusion

One possible marker for MASLD diagnosis could be fetuin-A. Furthermore, a substantial association between such marker and the severity of the disease as it revealed a significant correlation with ultrasound grading and fibroscan with controlled attenuated parameters.

### The correlation between obesity-related diseases and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in women in the pre-operative evaluation for bariatric surgery assessed by transient hepatic elastography [^114EEdpt]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common, severe disease in obese patients. However, NAFLD is usually underestimated by ultrasonography. Liver biopsy is not routinely done in bariatric surgery or during the follow-up. This study therefore examined the correlation between metabolic syndrome and NAFLD in morbidly obese patients based on an assessment using transient hepatic elastography (THE).

Material and Methods

This study involved 50 female patients in the pre-operative phase for bariatric surgery. Before surgery, we collected clinical, laboratory, and anthropometric variables. THE measurements were obtained using a FibroScan® device (Echosens, Paris, France), and steatosis was quantified using Controlled Attenuation Parameter software (CAP). Statistical analyses were done using linear correlation and the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

The mean of THE and CAP values were 7.56 ± 4.78 kPa and 279.94 ± 45.69 dB/m, respectively, and there was a significant linear correlation between the two measurements (r = 0.651; p < 0.001). The numbers of metabolic syndrome parameters did not influence the THE (p = 0.436) or CAP (p = 0.422) values. HbA1c and HOMA-IR showed a strong linear correlation with CAP (r = 0.643, p = 0.013 and r = 0.668, p = 0.009, respectively) and a tendency to some linear correlation with THE (r = 0.500, p = 0.05 and r = 0.500, p = 0.002, respectively).

Conclusion

Morbidly obese women submitted to FibroScan® presented a high prevalence of severe steatosis and advanced fibrosis in our sample. Insulin resistance parameters were correlated with steatosis, but less with fibrosis.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^113as1gf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of fibrosis (general principles), AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend to use imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment, specifically transient elastography-measured controlled attenuation parameter and MRI-PDFF or MRS over blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment tests where available in the assessment of hepatic steatosis in adult patients.

### Prevalence and predictive factors of moderate / severe liver steatosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infected patients evaluated with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) [^115Nn37Q]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2018). Low credibility.

A novel controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) using FibroScan ® has been developed for assessment of liver steatosis. The aim was to evaluate the frequency and associated factors for moderate/severe steatosis evaluated by CAP in CHC patients submitted to transient elastography (TE) by FibroScan ®. CHC patients underwent TE with CAP evaluation. The classification of steatosis was defined as: CAP < 222 dB/m = S0; CAP ≥ 222 dB/m and < 233dB/m = S1; ≥ 233 dB/m < 290dB/m = S2 and ≥ 290 dB/m = S3. The prevalence of moderate/severe steatosis (CAP ≥ S2) and the related independent factors were identified by a logistic regression analysis. A significance level of 5% was adopted. 1104 CHC patients, 85% genotype-1 were included (mean age 55 ± 11 years; 46% male, mean BMI 25 ± 4 Kg/m²). Systemic arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalences were 39% and 17%, respectively. Liver stiffness measurement ≥ 9.5 kPa was observed in 39% of patients and steatosis was identified in 50% (S1 = 7%, S2 = 28% and S3 = 15%). The variables independently associated with moderate/severe steatosis were: male gender (OR = 1.35; p = 0.037; 95% CI:1.01–1.81); systemic arterial hypertension (OR = 1.57; p = 0.002; 95% CI:1.17–2.10) and BMI (OR = 1.17; P < .01;95% CI:1.12–1.22). In conclusion, when CAP was adopted as a tool to detect steatosis, genotype 1 CHC patients presented a high prevalence of moderate/advanced steatosis. In these patients, liver steatosis was associated mostly to metabolic factors (arterial hypertension and high BMI).

### Hepatic steatosis estimated by VCTE-derived CAP scores was associated with lower risks of liver-related events and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic liver diseases [^114acSCh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The controlled attenuated parameter (CAP) score derived from vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE, i.e. FibroScan) is a well-validated marker of hepatic steatosis. It is unclear whether CAP scores are associated with risks of liver-related outcomes or all-cause mortality.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we identified 7,587 United States veterans (2,689 with cured hepatitis C [hepatitis C virus], 1,523 with alcohol-associated liver disease, and 3,375 with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD]) who underwent VCTE between May 2015 and December 2021. We followed patients for new hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death from the VCTE date until January 1, 2022. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression was used to assess for the associations between CAP measurements and clinical outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, liver disease etiology, liver stiffness measurements, and Fibrosis-4 score, and was reported separately by disease etiology and advanced fibrosis status.

Results

Over a median follow-up time of ∼1.9 years, hepatic steatosis (grades 1–3 vs 0) was associated with a lower risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57–0.85). Among patients with MASLD, hepatic steatosis was associated with a lower risk of decompensation (aHR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32–0.90) and death (aHR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37–0.73). These associations persisted in subgroup analyses of patients with advanced fibrosis and without cirrhosis.

Discussion

Among patients who underwent VCTE in clinical practice, the presence of substantial hepatic steatosis estimated by the CAP score was associated with lower all-cause mortality among all patients and lower risk of decompensation and death among those with MASLD.

### NAFLD in type 1 diabetes: overrated or underappreciated? [^11144D3J]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP TM)

CAP is an ultrasound-based technique available on the Fibroscan ® device which allows evaluation of liver fat content. The CAP measures the attenuation of the ultrasound beam while traversing the liver. The results are given in decibels per metre and range from 100 to 400 dB/m. As mentioned above, the Fibroscan ® features an M and XL probe (and an S probe in a paediatric population) to evaluate both liver stiffness and CAP, with the choice of the probe based on the skin-to-liver capsule distance. There are, however, no specific technical parameters recommended by the producers to ensure reliable measurements of CAP. As a consequence, most authors copied the quality criteria recommended for liver stiffness evaluation, which incorporates 10 valid measurements with an IQR/median < 30%. A recent study established that this quality cut-off is accurate in predicting steatosis. A systematic review from 2019 reported that CAP could be a noninvasive substitute for liver biopsy with excellent sensitivity (87%) for mild steatosis but decreasing sensitivity for moderate (85%) and severe (76%) sensitivity, probably partly due to the technical difficulties to obtain valid measures in more obese patients. This partially explains why the inter-observer reproducibility is good (overall concordance correlation coefficient: 0.82, > 95% reliability), but lower with the use of the XL probe compared to the M probe. A meta-analysis including data of 3830 patients with different aetiologies of liver disease concluded that CAP provides an adequate measure of hepatic steatosis but that the CAP value should be corrected for the presence of NAFLD (−10 dB/m), the presence of diabetes (−10 dB/m), and body mass index (BMI; −4.4 dB/m per unit above/below 25 kg/m² over the range of 20 to 30 kg/m²). A more recent analysis of 2,979 patients with NAFLD reported a similar loss of accuracy with increasing grades of steatosis. Furthermore, this meta-analysis compared CAP with MRI and concluded that MRI was significantly more accurate to diagnose steatosis. A large individual patient data meta-analysis evaluated the use of the XL probe, which is predominantly used in NAFLD patients due to the link with obesity, and concluded that CAP can help in diagnosing steatosis, but cannot adequately grade steatosis. A Canadian meta-analysis compared all meta-analyses and proposed the following cut-off values: 248 dB/m, 268 dB/m, and 280 dB/m, corrected by BMI and presence of co-morbidities, to respectively diagnose S ⩾ 1, S ⩾ 2, and S3. Since the XL probe is a more recent tool as compared to the M probe, the question arises whether the same cut-offs can be used for both probes. Preliminary evidence suggests small differences, and maybe universal cut-offs can be used. There are no studies exploring cohort-specific cut-offs in T1D to the best of our knowledge. One study explored fibrosis in T1D with Fibroscan ® but did not evaluate CAP.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend to use imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment, specifically transient elastography-measured controlled attenuation parameter and MRI-PDFF or MRS over blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment tests where available in the assessment of hepatic steatosis in adult patients.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112642DW]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, many studies have also reported that CAP and LSM values might be affected by confounding factors. Hence, we compared the mean cut-off values between different subgroups. We found that there were significant differences in CAP values among different BMI populations. For diagnosing S ≥ S1, ≥ S2 and = S3, the mean CAP cut-off values for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² were 30·7, 28·2, and 27·9 dB/m higher than for BMI < 30 kg/m², respectively. Interestingly, this had also been confirmed in previous studies. One study found that high BMI was significantly related to an increase in CAP. Another study recalculated the CAP values according to variable BMI, suggesting that when BMI is within 20–25kg/m 2, for every unit below 25 kg/m 2, 4·4 dB/m is added; and when BMI is within 25–30 kg/m 2, 4·4 dB/m is subtracted for every unit above 25 kg/m 2. Besides, among different probes and different regions, the CAP values of XL probes and EUR-USA were slightly higher than those of M probes and Asian. Although these differences were not statistically significant, considering the higher prevalence of obesity in the EUR-USA populations and the higher use of the XL probe in the population with obesity, it may exacerbate the overestimation of steatosis in patients with obesity in clinical diagnosis. Therefore, setting higher diagnostic cut-offs for patients with obesity than the routine is needed, but unfortunately, there are no specific diagnostic criteria for this population, or, as mentioned earlier, modifying CAP value for patients with obesity before referring to the regular diagnostic cut-offs (Figure 2).

### Assessment of hepatic steatosis by controlled attenuation parameter using the M and XL probes: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112xRbKm]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Diagnostic tools for liver disease can now include estimation of the grade of hepatic steatosis (S0 to S3). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a non-invasive method for assessing hepatic steatosis that has become available for patients who are obese (FibroScan XL probe), but a consensus has not yet been reached regarding cutoffs and its diagnostic performance. We aimed to assess diagnostic properties and identify relevant covariates with use of an individual patient data meta-analysis.

Methods

We did an individual patient data meta-analysis, in which we searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published from database inception until April 30, 2019. Studies reporting original biopsy-controlled data of CAP for non-invasive grading of steatosis were eligible. Probe recommendation was based on automated selection, manual assessment of skin-to-liver-capsule distance, and a body-mass index (BMI) criterion. Receiver operating characteristic methods and mixed models were used to assess diagnostic properties and covariates. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were analysed separately because they are the predominant patient group when using the XL probe. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018099284.

Findings

16 studies reported histology-controlled CAP including the XL probe, and individual data from 13 papers and 2346 patients were included. Patients with a mean age of 46·5 years (SD 14·5) were recruited from 20 centres in nine countries. 2283 patients had data for BMI; 673 (29%) were normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m²), 530 (23%) were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 to < 30 kg/m²), and 1080 (47%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). 1277 (54%) patients had NAFLD, 474 (20%) had viral hepatitis, 285 (12%) had alcohol-associated liver disease, and 310 (13%) had other liver disease aetiologies. The XL probe was recommended in 1050 patients, 930 (89%) of whom had NAFLD; among the patients with NAFLD, the areas under the curve were 0·819 (95% CI 0·769–0·869) for S0 versus S1 to S3 and 0·754 (0·720–0·787) for S0 to S1 versus S2 to S3. CAP values were independently affected by aetiology, diabetes, BMI, aspartate aminotransferase, and sex. Optimal cutoffs differed substantially across aetiologies. Risk of bias according to QUADAS-2 was low.

Interpretation

CAP cutoffs varied according to cause, and can effectively recognise significant steatosis in patients with viral hepatitis. CAP cannot grade steatosis in patients with NAFLD adequately, but its value in a NAFLD screening setting needs to be studied, ideally with methods beyond the traditional histological reference standard.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Krton]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

14 studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of CAP for detecting S ≥ S1. The mean cut-off value and range was 268.5 (233·5–304) dB/m. The summary SE and SP of 14 studies were 0·84 (95% CI: 0·83–0·86, Figure S2a) and 0·86 (95%: 0·81–0·90, Figure S2b), respectively. The pooled PLR, NLR and DOR were 4·72 (95%: 3·10–7·17, Figure S2c), 0·16 (95% CI: 0·11–0·22, Figure S2d) and 32·97 (95% CI: 17·40–62·48, Figure S2e), respectively. Finally, the summary AUROC was 0·924 (SE = 0·019, Figure S2f). Similarly, 26 and 25 studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of CAP for detecting S ≥ S2 and = S3 (Figure S3a-f, S4a-f), respectively. For the accuracy of LSM in detecting F ≥ F1, ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and = F4, we pooled 16, 44, 59, and 32 studies, respectively (Figure S5a-f, S6a-f, S7a-f, S8a-f). The detailed summarized diagnostic index data are shown in Table 1, corresponding heterogeneity is shown in Table S4, and the mean cut-off values are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

### Diagnostic accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as a non-invasive test for steatosis in suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Qpqyw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound remains the first-line assessment for screening NAFLD patients in clinical practice, but its efficacy is limited by its impreciseness observed during follow-up. Computerized tomography (CT) scan also has shown limited benefit in the diagnosis and follow-up of NAFLD patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based-techniques are sensitive approaches for the detection of steatosis due to their specific signal intensity for triglyceride, but they are not suitable for routine usage owing to the high cost, limited availability, and limited comparability between different MRI techniques. Thus, non-invasive imaging techniques that can accurately discriminate different stages of hepatic steatosis are highly desirable.

Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) commonly delivered by the FibroScan device (Echosens, Paris, France) measures the velocity of the shear wave that is converted to stiffness using the Young's module. It has been recognized as a rapid and non-invasive technique in the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel physical parameter based on the properties of ultrasonic signals acquired by the FbroScan. CAP measures ultrasound attenuation at the central frequency of the VCTE at M or regular probe, but its accuracy may be affected by variations in cut-off values of different steatosis grades and different covariates.

In this study, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of CAP in distinguishing different stages of hepatic steatosis in liver-biopsy proven NAFLD patients, and assessed the possible contributing factors affecting CAP values.

### Utility of transient elastography (fibroscan) and impact of bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in morbidly obese patients [^113Gx5q1]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel, noninvasive technique for assessing hepatic steatosis. However, its role in morbidly obese individuals is unclear. The effect of bariatric surgery on inflammation and fibrosis needs to be explored.

Objectives

To assess the utility of CAP for assessment of hepatic steatosis in morbidly obese individuals and evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.

Setting

A tertiary care academic hospital.

Methods

Baseline details of anthropometric data, laboratory parameters, FibroScan (XL probe), and liver biopsy were collected. Follow-up liver biopsy was done at 1 year.

Results

Of the 124 patients screened, 76 patients were included; mean body mass index was 45.2 ± 7.1 kg/m². FibroScan success rate was 87.9%. The median liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and CAP were 7.0 (5.0–9.5) kPa and 326.5 (301–360.5) dB/m, respectively. On liver histopathology, severe steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were present in 5.3% and 15.8%; significant fibrosis (≥ stage 2) and cirrhosis in 39.5% and 2.6%, respectively. Area under receiver operator characteristic curve of LSM for prediction of significant fibrosis (F2–4 versus F0–1) and advanced fibrosis (F3–4 versus F0–2) was .65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: .52-.77) and .83 (95% CI: .72-.94), respectively. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve of CAP for differentiating moderate hepatic steatosis (S2–3 versus S0–1) and severe hepatic steatosis (S3 versus S0–2) was .74 (95% CI: .62-.86) and .82 (95% CI: .73-.91), respectively. At 1-year follow-up, 32 patients underwent liver biopsy. In these patients, there was significant improvement in hepatic steatosis (P = 0.001), lobular inflammation (P = 0.033), ballooning (P < .001), and fibrosis (P = 0.003). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was resolved in 3 of 4 (75%) patients. LSM and CAP significantly declined.

Conclusions

LSM and CAP are feasible and accurate at diagnosing advanced fibrosis and severe hepatic steatosis in morbidly obese individuals. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvement in LSM, CAP, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis.

### Simple proxies of insulin resistance identify obese metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease subjects with advanced liver disease [^1127TKCn]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Insulin resistance (IR) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD), which can progress to liver fibrosis. We examined the relationship of different IR scores with markers of MAFLD severity in obese individuals.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective observational study, 346 non-diabetic, overweight/obese individuals with newly diagnosed MAFLD (age 50.2 ± 13.3 years, 34% females, BMI 30.8 ± 4.4 kg/m²) underwent liver stiffness (LS) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurements by Fibroscan® to assess liver fibrosis and steatosis. Biochemical data were collected to calculate surrogate markers of IR (Homoeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index [HOMA-IR], triglyceride-glucose index, triglyceride by HDL ratio), liver fibrosis (Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases fibrosis score, fibrosis-4 score, Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index) and steatosis (fatty liver index, hepatic steatosis index).

Results

All three IR scores were associated with CAP, while only HOMA-IR positively correlated with LS (r = 0.275, p < 0.0001), independent of age and sex, BMI, transaminases, and fibrosis markers. Insulin-resistant individuals (HOMA-IR > 2.5, n = 165) had higher liver enzymes, CAP and LS, with a 4-fold increased risk of severe liver disease (LS > 9.7 kPa, OR 4.42[1.95–10.01], p = 0.0002). Among HOMA-IR components, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) was independently associated with LS (r = 0.270, p < 0.0001). ROC AUC for HOMA-IR and FPI to predict severe liver disease were virtually identical (0.748 and 0.758, respectively).

Conclusions

HOMA-IR is independently associated with non-invasive markers of MAFLD severity in overweight/obese individuals. This relationship is largely mediated by hyperinsulinemia, regardless of BMI. Measuring insulin levels in MAFLD individuals might be useful to identify those at risk of liver fibrosis.

### Impaired glucagon suppression accompanied by liver fat accumulation mediated worse blood glucose control in T2D patients [^114GW2Hh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is prevalent in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and exacerbates hyperglycemia, but its impact on postprandial glucagon suppression remains unclear.

Objective

To investigate the association between hepatic steatosis and impaired glucagon suppression during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), and to evaluate the mediating role of glucagon dysregulation in linking liver fat to glycemic control.

Design and Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 604 patients with T2D underwent liver fat quantification via FibroScan Pro®-controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver ultrasound. Postprandial glucagon suppression was assessed during 180-minute OGTT (0-, 30-, 60-, 120-, 180-min), with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in 287 participants. Glucagon suppression was calculated for early (0–30 min), late (30–180 min), and overall (0–180 min) phases. Multivariable regression and mediation analyses tested associations between CAP, glucagon dynamics, and CGM-derived glycemic profiles.

Results

T2D patients with MASLD (CAP ≥ 238 dB/m, n = 414) exhibited significantly impaired glucagon suppression compared to non-MASLD controls (n = 190) across all phases (all P < 0.05). Each 1-SD CAP increase independently predicted attenuated dose-dependent suppression in all phases (standardized β = 0.183–0.303, P < 0.001). Males showed greater suppression impairment than females and stronger CAP-associated dysregulation. Mediation analysis revealed that glucagon suppression mediated 14.9–33.9% of the adverse effects of liver fat on hyperglycemia.

Conclusion

Liver fat accumulation in T2D is strongly associated with defective postprandial glucagon suppression, particularly in males, which mediates nearly one-third of its detrimental impact on glycemic control. Targeting hepatic steatosis and glucagon signaling may offer novel therapeutic strategies for T2D management.

### Serum levels of soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in type 2 diabetes are associated with severity of liver fibrosis evaluated by transient elastography (fibroScan) and the FAST (fibroScan-AST) score, a novel index of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with significant fibrosis [^112a8s4V]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the relationship in people with type 2 diabetes between serum soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (sDDP-4) and degree of liver fibrosis assessed as the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and FAST (FibroScan-AST) score, both of which were measured by transient elastography (FibroScan).

Subjects and Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we examined 115 patients with type 2 diabetes. With transient elastography (FibroScan), we assessed the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) as measures of hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis, respectively. We calculated the FAST score, which identifies progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), from CAP, LSM, and the serum aspartate aminotransferase level. Significant hepatic steatosis was defined as CAP ≥ 280 dB/m; and significant liver fibrosis, as LSM ≥ 8.0 kPa. LSM was divided into 3 severity levels: significant fibrosis (8.0 to < 9.7 kPa); advanced fibrosis, (9.7 to < 13.0 kPa); and liver cirrhosis (≥ 13.0 kPa).

Results

Serum sDPP-4 correlated positively with liver enzymes, CAP, LSM, and FAST score. Multivariate analysis showed that LSM remained to be an independent factor for serum sDDP-4. Serum sDPP-4 was significantly higher in patients with LSM ≥ 8.0 kPa than in those with LSM < 8.0 kPa and was significantly elevated in patients who are at risk for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis (FAST score ≥ 035 or 0.67). Patients with both hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis had the highest serum sDPP-4.

Conclusion

Serum sDPP-4 was strongly associated with severity of liver fibrosis evaluated by LSM and the FAST score and was markedly elevated in diabetic patients with LSM ≥ 13.0 kPa indicating probable cirrhosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as a non-invasive test for steatosis in suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UKzRd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondly, the data from conventional meta-analysis may not have the same strength as those obtained from multicenter trials because the quality of the meta-analysis may be affected by several factors such as different methodologies used in the studies, study designs, and procedures for analysis. Hence, variations exist between different centers and cohorts. Ideally, most "optimal" cutoff values should be used for more accurate diagnosis, but the so-called "optimal cutoff values" are unable to define. Moreover, diagnostic threshold value may be influenced by natural observation and disease prevalence, resulting in data heterogeneity. Hence, it is difficult to evaluate the diagnostic threshold of CAP with limited number of studies.

Thirdly, CAP provides an estimate of what percentage of hepatocytes is affected steatosis whereas the histological evaluation by liver biopsy provides information on the pathological changes in liver parenchyma. Using liver biopsy as the "gold standard" in the assessment of hepatic steatosis may be imperfect, as steatosis may be focal and the sampling error is still a major challenge for liver biopsy. Thus, perfect correlation between CAP and liver biopsy data should not be expected. In addition, since this is a very selected population in which apparently other liver diseases were ruled out and pre-test probability of NAFLD was very high, the diagnostic accuracy of CAP for evaluation of steatosis presence is over-inflated comparing with the general population.

In summary, CAP is a supplementary feature in transient elastography (TE), and it was initially made available for the M probe which has a limited applicability in obese patients. CAP is more suitable for patients with normal or moderate body weight because abdominal fat may increase the skin-to-liver capsule distance by > 25 mm, which could result in overestimation of the CAP data. Such a drawback of CAP in obese patients was tackled by applying XL probe to TE, but many authors suggested this approach is not reliable in patients with severe obesity due to the lack of the reliable reference criteria. Hence, the reliability of CAP in the diagnosis and staging of steatosis in suspected NAFLD patients should be further analyzed in large cohort of patients.

### Performance characteristics of vibration-controlled transient elastography for evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116WDA49]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vibration-controlled transient elastography estimates liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), which are noninvasive assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively. However, prior vibration-controlled transient elastography studies reported high failure rates in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We examined the performance characteristics of the FibroScan 502 Touch with two probes, medium (M+) and extra large (XL+), in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a multicenter setting. A total of 1,696 exams were attempted in 992 patients (body mass index, 33.6 ± 6.5 kg/m²) with histologically confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Simultaneous assessment of LSM and CAP was performed using the FibroScan 502 Touch with an automatic probe selection tool. Testing was conducted twice in patients by either a single operator (87%) or two operators (13%). Failure was defined as the inability to obtain a valid examination. An examination was considered unreliable if LSM interquartile range/median was > 30%. Significant disagreement between two readings was defined as > 95% limits of agreement between two readings. A total of 1,641 examinations yielded valid results with a failure rate of 3.2% (55/1,696). The proportion of unreliable scans for LSM was 3.9%. The proportion of unreliable scans with operator experience in the top quartile (≥ 59 procedures) was significantly lower than that in the lower three quarters combined (1.6% versus 4.7%, P = 0.02 by Fisher's exact test). The significant disagreement between first and second readings for LSM and CAP when obtained back to back was 18% and 11%, respectively.

Conclusion

Vibration-controlled transient elastography for estimation of LSM and CAP can be successfully deployed in a multicenter setting with low failure (3.2%) and high reliability (> 95%) rates and high reproducibility. (Hepatology 2018;67:134–144).

### Noninvasive detection of hepatic steatosis in patients without ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver using the controlled attenuation parameter evaluated with transient elastography [^1167qes8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Although ultrasound is a useful technique for detecting hepatic steatosis, it cannot provide a precise determination of hepatic fat content. A novel attenuation parameter named controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been developed to process the raw ultrasonic signals acquired by Fibroscan. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of hepatic steatosis in apparently healthy Turkish individuals using the proposed diagnostic cut-off points for CAP. In addition, we sought to investigate the association of CAP with the traditional risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a screening setting.

Materials and Methods

In the present study, 102 Turkish individuals without evidence of fatty liver on ultrasound and normal aminotransferase levels underwent CAP measurements by means of Fibroscan.

Results

The mean (SD), median (minimum-maximum), and 5th and 95th percentile values of CAP values in this cohort of 102 individuals were 206.99 (48.12), 210.5 (100.0–314.0), 113.4 and 280.2 dB/m, respectively. Using the cut-offs of 222, 238, and 283 dB/m for CAP, there were 39 (38.2%), 23 (22.5%), and five (4.9%) individuals out of 102 who had at least 10% steatosis despite normal liver findings on ultrasound. After allowance for potential confounders, CAP was independently associated with BMI (β = 0.39, t = 3.5, P < 0.001) and the number of metabolic syndrome criteria (β = 0.24, t = 2.1, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

These results hold promise for early noninvasive detection of hepatic steatosis on the basis of CAP assessment.

### The clinical usefulness of elastography in the evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients: a biopsy-controlled study [^115jPgnD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed at determination of the usefulness of elastography [acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and FibroScan] for evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.

Patients and Methods

A prospective cross-sectional study included 60 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (mean age: 45 years) was carried out. All patients were subjected to lab works, liver biopsy, and measurement of liver stiffness by ARFI and FibroScan and steatosis by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). CAP measurements were adjusted for the presence of NAFLD and presence or absence of diabetes and according to BMI.

Results

Linear regression analysis showed that CAP is an independent predictor for significant hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). No significant difference was found in diagnostic accuracy between adjusted and nonadjusted CAP values for diagnosis of mild (> S1) or significant (> S2) hepatic steatosis (P = 0.17 and 0.29 respectively). The median ARFI velocities for F1, F2, F3, and F4 were 0.92, 1.08, 1.07, and 2.58m/s, respectively. Although there was an overall significant increase in ARFI values across the fibrosis grades (P < 0.04), the difference in ARFI values was only significant between fibrosis grades F1 and F4 (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Elastography is a promising noninvasive tool for diagnosis and grading of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with good sensitivity and specificity, especially in moderate to marked grades.

### Performance of the attenuation imaging technology in the detection of liver steatosis [^1162RHMb]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver steatosis causes an increased attenuation of the US beam as it traverses the liver parenchyma. By using proprietary algorithms, this attenuation can be objectively quantified, and an attenuation coefficient is calculated. 11 The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), implemented in the FibroScan device (Echosens, Paris, France), was the first available tool for this purpose. 12 Software also based on the quantitation of the attenuation of the US beam has recently been implemented in the Aplio i‐series US systems (Attenuation Imaging [ATI]; Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Attenuation Imaging quantifies the attenuation of the US beam in a large area using a real‐time, color‐coded map, automatically filtering out vessels or strong artifacts. By using the magnetic resonance imaging‐derived proton density fat fraction (MRI‐PDFF) as a reference standard, our group has recently shown that the attenuation coefficient calculated with ATI is very promising for the noninvasive assessment of steatosis, performing better than the CAP, with a statistically significant improvement for steatosis grades higher than S1. 13 In this study, we used the ATI package tuned on a US frequency of 4.0 MHz. To allow better penetration in difficult cases, the manufacturer has lowered the US frequency in the ATI package to 3.0 MHz and has made it a default choice. However, a change in the US frequency used to calculate the attenuation coefficient may give a different result in the same patient.

The main aim of this study was to assess the performance and cutoff value for the detection of liver steatosis (S > 0) of ATI‐Penetration (ATI‐Pen) by using the MRI‐PDFF as the reference standard. Secondary aims were to compare the results to those obtained with the previous ATI software (Attenuation Imaging–General [ATI‐Gen]) and with the CAP and to generate a regression equation between ATI‐Pen and ATI‐Gen values.

### Screening diabetic patients for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurements: a prospective cohort study [^113ioZTi]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but current guidelines provide conflicting recommendations on whether diabetic patients should be screened for NAFLD. We therefore studied the strategy of screening diabetic patients by FibroScan.

Design

Liver fat and fibrosis were assessed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) by FibroScan at a diabetic centre for patients from primary care and hospital clinics. Probe-specific LSM cut-offs were used to detect advanced fibrosis.

Results

Of 1918 patients examined, 1799 (93.8%) had valid CAP and 1884 (98.2%) had reliable LSM (1770 with the M probe and 114 with the XL probe). The proportion of patients with increased CAP and LSM was 72.8% (95% CI 70.7% to 74.8%) and 17.7% (95% CI 16.0% to 19.5%), respectively. By multivariable analysis, female gender, higher body mass index, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and non-insulin use were associated with increased CAP. Longer duration of diabetes, higher body mass index, increased ALT and spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio and lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were associated with increased LSM. Ninety-four patients (80% had increased LSM) underwent liver biopsy: 56% had steatohepatitis and 50% had F3–4 disease.

Conclusions

Diabetic patients have a high prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis. Those with obesity and dyslipidaemia are at particularly high risk and may be the target for liver assessment. Our data support screening for NAFLD and/or advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Association between hepatic steatosis, measured by controlled Attenuation parameter, and fibrosis burden in chronic hepatitis B [^113FeQE3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The interaction between chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatic steatosis is poorly understood. We investigated whether measurement of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), a non-invasive method to quantify steatosis, can assist in monitoring patients with CHB.

Methods

We performed transient elastography, to measure liver stiffness, and made CAP measurements in 1606 patients with CHB (898 treated with nucleoside analogues, for a median 75.4 months) in Hong Kong, from January 2015 through September 2016. We also collected information on patients' medical history, current treatment, and smoking and alcohol habits, anthropometric measurements. We obtained and analyzed fasting blood samples. Severe liver fibrosis was defined, according to guidelines, as a liver stiffness measurement greater than 9.0 kPa in patients with normal level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or greater than 12.0 kPa in patients with a level of ALT 1–5-fold the upper limit of normal. Steatosis was defined as a CAP measurement of 248 dB/m or more, and severe steatosis as a CAP measurement or 280 dB/m more. We performed multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with severe fibrosis.

Results

The prevalence of steatosis, severe steatosis, and severe fibrosis in our cohort were 40.8%, 22.6%, and 14.1%, respectively. A higher proportion of patients with severe steatosis had severe fibrosis (21.4% vs 11.9% in the overall cohort; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, severe steatosis was associated with severe fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients (odds ratio, 3.60, 95% CI, 1.21–10.75) and in patients receiving treatment (odds ratios: 1.95 [1.06–3.61] for 3 or more years of treatment, 2.28 [1.13–4.61] for 5 or more years of treatment, and 2.79 [1.17–6.62] for 7 or more years of treatment). With every increase in CAP value of 10 dB/m, the risk of severe fibrosis increased by 15% in treatment-naïve patients and by 7%-8% in patients receiving treatment.

Conclusions

Severe steatosis, determined by CAP measurement, is associated with severe fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with CHB and in patients receiving treatment. Longitudinal studies are required to investigate if steatosis control, in addition to antiviral treatment, can reduce the burden fibrosis in patients with CHB.

### Vibration-controlled transient elastography-based parameters predict clinical outcomes in liver transplant recipients [^112G41uH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) is used in clinical practice to risk-stratify liver transplant (LT) recipients; however, there are currently little data demonstrating the relationship between VCTE and clinical outcomes.

Methods

A total of 362 adult LT recipients with successful VCTE examination between 2015 and 2022 were included. Presence of advanced fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥ 10.5 kPa and hepatic steatosis as controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥ 270 dB/m. The outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and graft cirrhosis using cumulative incidence analysis that accounted for the competing risks of these outcomes.

Results

The LSM was elevated in 64 (18%) and CAP in 163 (45%) LT recipients. The baseline LSM values were similar in patients with elevated vs normal CAP values. After a median follow-up of 65 (interquartile range, 20–140) months from LT to baseline VCTE, 66 (18%) patients died, 12 (3%) developed graft cirrhosis, and 18 (5%) experienced an MI. Baseline high LSM was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–3.50; p = 0.02) and new onset cirrhosis (HR, 6.74; 95% CI, 2.08–21.79; P < .01). A higher CAP value was significantly and independently associated with increased risk of experiencing a MI over study follow-up (HR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.29–13.27; p = 0.017).

Conclusions

The VCTE-based parameters are associated with clinical outcomes and offer the potential to be incorporated into clinical risk-stratification strategies to improve outcomes among LT recipients.

### Non-invasive assessment of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease [^117PxUnt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography is the most commonly used imaging test for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis and has been shown to be reliable and accurate for the diagnosis of moderate to severe hepatic steatosis with AUROC of 0.93. However, it is operator dependent and is less accurate for mild hepatic steatosis. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is derived from the same radio-frequency data used for liver stiffness measurement during examination using Fibroscan, a vibration-controlled transient elastography device, and has been shown to correlate with hepatic steatosis. It has been shown to be excellent for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, but its performance is affected by BMI and is less accurate to diagnose the different grades of hepatic steatosis. An individual patient data meta-analysis has defined the CAP cut-offs for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis ⩾ grade 1, ⩾ grade 2, and grade 3, which are 248, 268, and 280 dB/m, respectively. However, CAP can be affected by BMI, etiology, and the presence of T2DM, and these should be considered when interpreting the results. The XL probe has been introduced to reduce failed and unreliable transient elastography examination results when using the M probe, especially in obese patients. Studies suggested that the same cut-offs can be used for both the M probe and the XL probe for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. A subsequent individual patient data meta-analysis concluded that CAP obtained using the XL probe was good for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, especially in patients with viral hepatitis, but the optimal cut-offs varied according to etiology; however, CAP was not able to adequately grade steatosis in NAFLD patients. Another vibration-controlled transient elastography device, the FibroTouch, also provides measurement of attenuation parameter, called the ultrasound attenuation parameter (UAP), which uses 244 dB/m as the cut-off for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. In a study on patients with chronic liver disease of various etiologies, the UAP has been shown to correlate strongly with CAP. The main advantage of attenuation parameter for diagnosis of hepatic steatosis is that the result is available simultaneously with liver stiffness measurement and can help diagnose hepatic steatosis in patients with other causes of chronic liver disease undergoing liver stiffness measurement. It is important to identify and manage hepatic steatosis and metabolic risk factors to improve overall outcome of patients with other causes of chronic liver disease. MRI-based techniques, such as ¹H-MRS and MRI-PDFF are highly accurate for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. MRI-PDFF has been shown to more accurately classify steatosis than CAP. However, the use of MRI-based techniques in routine clinical practice is limited due to cost and availability, and it is usually reserved for clinical trial (see the section 'Non-invasive tests for monitoring of treatment response').

### The inverse effect of meal intake on controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness as assessed by transient elastography [^111gGKYv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (LS) measured by transient elastography (TE, Fibroscan®) have been used for steatosis and fibrosis assessment. We evaluated the effect of meal intake on CAP and LS values.

Methods

Forty patients who had had a liver biopsy within the previous month were recruited. The biopsy was graded for fibrosis (F) and steatosis (S) stagings. TE was performed after overnight fasting (baseline values) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min following the intake of a standard commercial formula meal, and every 30 min until LS and CAP values returned to baseline. The effect of meal intake on CAP and LS values was analyzed with a multilevel mixed model approach.

Results

The mean age was 53.1 ± 11.2 years old. The mean (SD) BMI was 25.6 ± 4.5 kg/m 2. F0, F1, F2, F3 and F4 fibrosis stages were found in 17 (42.5%), 9 (22.5%), 4 (10.0%), 8 (20.0%) and 2 (5.0%), respectively. S0, S1, S2 and S3 steatosis stages were seen in 22 (55.0%), 11 (27.5%), 4 (10.0%) and 3 (7.5%), respectively. The mean (SD) CAP and median (IQR) LS values at baseline were 249.7 ± 58.1 dB/m and 11.9 (6–18.1) kPa. A significant decrease in CAP values was observed in all patients 15 to 120 min after meals, with the CAP peak value at 60 min and the mean post-meal delta reduction of 18.1 dB/min. CAP values declined after meals at early fibrosis stages and across all stages of steatosis. A significant increase in LS values after meal intake was observed within 15 to 120 min, with the LS peak value at 15 min and the mean post-meal delta increase of 2.4 kPa. Post-meal CAP and LS values returned to baseline within 150 min following meals.

Conclusion

Following a meal, patients' CAP values declined with the peak value at 60 min, contrasting with the rising of LS values with the peak value at 15 min. The post-meal CAP and LS values returned to baseline by 150 min. A fasting period of more than 150 min after a meal is recommended for patients undergoing TE.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^1122LDLw]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) — prevalence and validation findings are reported from a cross-sectional cohort. CAP was normal in 86 (67%) of 129 children and young adults with CF, and steatosis defined as CAP ≥ 230 dB/m occurred in 27% without CFLD, 48% with CFLD without PHTN, and 20% with CFLD with PHTN, with p < 0.05 for comparisons between CFLD without PHTN and the other groups; CAP was not validated with liver histology.

### Accuracy of fibroScan controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement in assessing steatosis and fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114awYJp]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

We estimated the accuracy of FibroScan vibration-controlled transient elastography controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSMs) in assessing steatosis and fibrosis in patients with suspected nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD).

Methods

We collected data from 450 consecutive adults who underwent liver biopsy analysis for suspected NAFLD at 7 centers in the United Kingdom from March 2014 through January 2017. FibroScan examinations with M or XL probe were completed within the 2 weeks of the biopsy analysis (404 had a valid examination). The biopsies were scored by 2 blinded expert pathologists according to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research network criteria. Diagnostic accuracy was estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for the categories of steatosis and fibrosis. We assessed effects of disease prevalence on positive and negative predictive values. For LSM, the effects of histological parameters and probe type were appraised using multivariable analysis.

Results

Using biopsy analysis as the reference standard, we found that CAP identified patients with steatosis with an AUROC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–0.92) for S ≥ S1, 0.77 (95% CI 0.71–0.82) for S ≥ S2, and 0.70 (95% CI 0.64–0.75) for S = S3. Youden cutoff values for S ≥ S1, S ≥ S2, and S ≥ S3 were 302 dB/m, 331 dB/m, and 337 dB/m, respectively. LSM identified patients with fibrosis with AUROCs of 0.77 (95% CI 0.72–0.82) for F ≥ F2, 0.80 (95% CI 0.75–0.84) for F ≥ F3, and 0.89 (95% CI 0.84–0.93) for F = F4. Youden cutoff values for F ≥ F2, F ≥ F3, and F = F4 were 8.2 kPa, 9.7 kPa, and 13.6 kPa, respectively. Applying the optimal cutoff values, determined from this cohort, to populations of lower fibrosis prevalence increased negative predictive values and reduced positive predictive values. Multivariable analysis found that the only parameter that significantly affected LSMs was fibrosis stage (P < 10⁻¹⁶); we found no association with steatosis or probe type.

Conclusions

In a prospective analysis of patients with NAFLD, we found CAP and LSM by FibroScan to assess liver steatosis and fibrosis, respectively, with AUROC values ranging from 0.70 to 0.89. Probe type and steatosis did not affect LSM.

### First-in-human diagnostic study of hepatic steatosis with computed ultrasound tomography in echo mode [^112T2S7p]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound (US) imaging systems possess essential qualities to tackle the challenges of screening for NAFLD. They are safe, portable, relatively inexpensive, readily available in most clinical facilities, and provide real-time feedback. Thus, US is a more convenient imaging modality than MR for large-scale screening. In fact, US is commonly employed to assess hepatic steatosis by analyzing features in conventional gray-scale B-mode images such as the echo intensity, distribution, and contrast. Except for the hepatorenal index, these parameters are qualitative, and their assessment strongly depends on the expertise of the sonographer. Such subjective evaluation makes the sensitivity of conventional US particularly poor (60.9–65%) for low-grade hepatic steatosis (≤ 20% fat content).

Quantitative indicators of steatosis are indispensable to improving the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of US. The fat accumulation alters the liver composition and, consequently, its acoustic and mechanical properties, which we can quantify from US radio-frequency signals. For example, the energy loss or attenuation that US waves undergo during their propagation through the liver increases in the presence of fatand can be used as an indicator of steatosis. With this idea in mind, the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been developed using vibration-controlled transient elastography on FibroScan equipment (Echosens, Paris, France). CAP estimates the average US attenuation in a cylindrical volume of the liver of approximately 1 cm diameter at 25–65 mm depth using 3.5 MHz M probes (or at 35–75 mm depth with 2.5 MHz XL probes)and shows significant correlations with histological steatosis grades. Despite emerging as a widely used non-invasive diagnostic tool, CAP measurements depend substantially on covariates such as etiology, diabetes status, or body mass index, bringing concerns about its diagnostic performance –.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tYRmf]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the use of transient elastography (TE) with Fibroscan® equipment (Echosens, Paris, France) to obtain controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) has been seen as a promising tool for noninvasive quantifying hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively, and showed low failure (3·2%), high reliability (> 95%) rates, and high reproducibility. Besides, the development of the XL probe for patients with obesity has solved the limitations of the clinical application of CAP and LSM. Studies found unreliable measurements were independently associated with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m², while 83% of patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) who could not be measured with the M probe could be measured with the XL probe. In patients with obesity, due to thicker subcutaneous fat, the skin-liver capsule distance (SCD) is more than 25 mm, and the XL probe can increase the detection depth (35–75 mm vs M: 25–65 mm) to improve the measurement success rate. In addition, the new version of the FibroScan equipment includes an automatic probe selection tool that measures SCD and suggests which probe to use (M: SCD < 25 mm, XL: SCD ≥ 25 mm). In clinical practice, physicians can select probes based on BMI and the automated probe selection tool. However, as the use of CAP and LSM became more popular, results began to diverge, particularly regarding differences in diagnostic accuracy and cut-off values between different BMI populations and between different probes. Earlier, several meta-analyses had discussed the accuracy of CAP or LSM alone in NAFLD patients, but few studies were included, with only nine studies, which might lead to relatively limited conclusions.

Hence, we did this meta-analysis with the aim of comprehensively evaluating the performance of CAP and LSM for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD/NASH.

### Ultrasound in chronic liver disease [^114uR4bc]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal cutoff values for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis differ according to aetiology and are subject to debate as even within one aetiology a broad range of cutoff values exist.

In addition to using TE in the assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis, a new method has emerged for the quantification of steatosis. The amplitude of ultrasound waves decreases as they propagate through the liver. This attenuation is measured using the Fibroscan M probe and termed the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP™). Initially assessed in a pilot study of 115 patients, CAP™ detected > 10% (S1), > 33% (S2) and > 67% (S3) steatosis with areas under the ROC curves of 0.91, 0.95 and 0.89 respectively. The presence of fibrosis did not affect the CAP™ values. Similar performances were found in further studies, e.g. with areas under the ROC curves of 0.84, 0.86 and 0.93 for > 10% (S1), > 33% (S2) and > 67% (S3) steatosis respectively or with areas under the ROC curves of 0.79, 0.76 and 0.70 for > 5%, > 33% and > 67% steatosis respectively. There is evidence that the aetiology of steatosis does not affect the accuracy of CAP™.

The grades of steatosis used in the above studies correspond to the original proposal for grading by Brant et al. with the exception of S1 where the degree of steatosis is < 33%.

Early studies of CAP™ have shown promising results for quantification of hepatic steatosis, although some have reported limited accuracy in the range of severe disease and high failure rates. In a large prospective study of 5323 CAP™ examinations the overall failure rate was 7.7%, and 33% in elderly females with diabetes and hypertension. Further studies are required for validation and refinement of its use.

In summary, TE is the longest established and most validated technology. It has excellent diagnostic accuracy for cirrhosis and good accuracy for the detection of early cirrhosis. It is user friendly and has a high patient acceptance. There are a number of limitations and pitfalls, and dedicated non-imaging ultrasound hardware is required. The main limitations are high BMI and ascites, and there is a variable but not insignificant failure rate.

### Comparative study of ultrasound attenuation analysis and controlled attenuation parameter in the diagnosis and grading of liver steatosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients [^114UD7Qx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, FibroScan has developed Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP), a technology based on the characteristics of ultrasound signals. CAP quantitatively evaluates hepatic steatosis by measuring liver stiffness and liver attenuation parameters. Research results have shown that CAP has excellent diagnostic value for NAFLD patients and can detect hepatic fat infiltration greater than 5%. Additionally, CAP has the advantages of being non-invasive, easy to perform, providing immediate results, and being cost-effective. Asia-Pacific guidelines recommend CAP as a screening tool for NAFLD. However, different studies have reported variations in the diagnostic threshold and efficiency of CAP for assessing the degree of steatosis. Furthermore, CAP lacks ultrasound image's guidance, making it unable to dynamically observe the liver parenchyma in the examination area, and measurements may be influenced by the biliary system, large blood vessels, or liver lesions. Therefore, there is an urgent need in clinical practice for a quantitative examination technology that is accurate, efficient, and integrates liver visual structure with two-dimensional acoustic attenuation results.

Recently, a new technology called Ultrasound Attenuation Imaging (USAT), which uses attenuation coefficients to quantitatively detect hepatic steatosis. USAT is based on the "whole-domain sound field restoration" technology of the original ultrasound radiofrequency signal, which restores the true sound speed and original attenuation information at various positions in the liver, effectively improving the accuracy and repeatability of measurements.

Therefore, USAT can be used for screening, quantitative diagnosis, and follow-up of NAFLD.

### Noninvasive assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis in MASLD patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes [^111XoKYx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which have a reciprocal relationship compounded by obesity, are highly prevalent in the Middle East affecting morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the severity of MASLD and liver fibrosis among adult Emirati patients with long-standing T2DM.

Design and Participants

This cross-sectional study used noninvasive methods to assess the severity of MASLD and fibrosis progression in an adult cohort of Emirati patients (N = 546) with a mean T2DM duration of 16 years.

Main Measures

Fatty liver infiltration was assessed by hepatic steatosis index (HSI), while fibrosis was assessed by the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index and aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI). Of those, 108 patients were randomly subjected to ultrasound-based FibroScan ® to assess controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

Key Results

All patients had fatty liver with~83% being categorized as having severe steatosis. Serum-based fibrosis biomarker panels detected significant liver fibrosis in~2.5% of these patients. The APRI appeared to be more restrictive in detecting moderate fibrosis (1.5%) than the FIB-4 index (25.5%). CAP significantly correlated with the LSM, indicating that the two methods contributed to the same underlying pathophysiology. Liver steatosis was more severe in female patients, who were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those with moderate or no significant fibrosis. They also had higher serum liver enzymes and were more likely to have age-related changes in kidney function. Interestingly, severity of both steatosis and fibrosis remained unaffected by age and duration of T2D except for fibrosis severity detected by FibroScan ®.

Conclusions

This study highlights the critical need for routine screening of MASLD among Emirati patients with long-standing T2DM, given the high point prevalence of severe steatosis (~83%), predominantly among women in this population.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter compared with ultrasound for detecting hepatic steatosis in children with severe obesity [^115E9gh5]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Reference test: proton density fat fraction with magnetic resonance spectroscopy

All subjects underwent an MRI scan after fasting, consisting of localizers and several anatomic imaging sequences followed by the MRS-PDFF sequence. Briefly, a single breath-hold, multi-echo stimulated echoes acquisition mode (STEAM) ¹H-MRS sequence was performed using a 20 × 20 × 20 mm³ voxel positioned in segment VI or VII of the liver. Further details on acquisition and post-processing have been described in a previous study in our hospital. MRI technicians were blinded to clinical information and CAP and US results. Steatosis grades 1 (S1), S2, and S3 were defined as an MRS-PDFF fat fraction of > 4.14%, > 15.72%, and > 20.88%, respectively. These thresholds were validated to correspond with steatosis grades 1, 2, and 3 of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) based on liver histology in adults in a previous study in our hospital.

Index test 1: controlled attenuation parameter

The CAP measurement was obtained using the FibroScan ® 502 Touch Device with the 3.5-MHz M-probe. CAP was measured intercostally, in a midaxillary location, by one of two observers (J.R. a radiology resident who has performed more than 100 examinations, and B.K. a pediatric gastroenterologist who has performed more than 400 examinations). Both observers were blinded to US and MRS-PDFF results. Only CAP results with at least 10 valid measurements were analyzed.

### Individual patient data meta-analysis of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) technology for assessing steatosis [^113D8NcW]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The prevalence of fatty liver underscores the need for non-invasive characterization of steatosis, such as the ultrasound based controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Despite good diagnostic accuracy, clinical use of CAP is limited due to uncertainty regarding optimal cut-offs and the influence of covariates. We therefore conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis.

Methods

A review of the literature identified studies containing histology verified CAP data (M probe, vibration controlled transient elastography with FibroScan®) for grading of steatosis (S0-S3). Receiver operating characteristic analysis after correcting for center effects was used as well as mixed models to test the impact of covariates on CAP. The primary outcome was establishing CAP cut-offs for distinguishing steatosis grades.

Results

Data from 19/21 eligible papers were provided, comprising 3830/3968 (97%) of patients. Considering data overlap and exclusion criteria, 2735 patients were included in the final analysis (37% hepatitis B, 36% hepatitis C, 20% NAFLD/NASH, 7% other). Steatosis distribution was 51%/27%/16%/6% for S0/S1/S2/S3. CAP values in dB/m (95% CI) were influenced by several covariates with an estimated shift of 10 (4.5–17) for NAFLD/NASH patients, 10 (3.5–16) for diabetics and 4.4 (3.8–5.0) per BMI unit. Areas under the curves were 0.823 (0.809–0.837) and 0.865 (0.850–0.880) respectively. Optimal cut-offs were 248 (237–261) and 268 (257–284) for those above S0 and S1 respectively.

Conclusions

CAP provides a standardized non-invasive measure of hepatic steatosis. Prevalence, etiology, diabetes, and BMI deserve consideration when interpreting CAP. Longitudinal data are needed to demonstrate how CAP relates to clinical outcomes.

Lay Summary

There is an increase in fatty liver for patients with chronic liver disease, linked to the epidemic of the obesity. Invasive liver biopsies are considered the best means of diagnosing fatty liver. The ultrasound based controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) can be used instead, but factors such as the underlying disease, BMI and diabetes must be taken into account. Registration: Prospero CRD42015027238.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese subjects as related to increasing insulin resistance and deteriorating glucose control: three years of follow-up from a longitudinal survey [^1125k5kG]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This observational trial was performed to evaluate liver parameters in overweight or obese subjects in the context of insulin resistance and glucose control over time.

Subjects/Methods

Insulin resistance, glucose control and several parameters for liver integrity were monitored in 177 overweight (BMI > 28 kg/m²) subjects over a mean of 30 months. Volunteers were categorized according to insulin resistance (HOMA IR score) and glucose control in subjects with normal glucose control (NGT), impaired glucose control (IGT), or diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). Liver fat and fibrosis were evaluated by sonographic elastography (FibroScan®) and clinical scores, such as the AST/ALT ratio, fatty liver index (FLI), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).

Results

Liver fat fraction as estimated by the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and the FLI were significantly higher in subjects with T2DM compared to IGT and NGT. While fasting insulin levels and the HOMA IR score continuously increased over time, no change in CAP or FLI occurred during follow up. CAP was correlated with FLI (r = 0.50; p < 0.0001) and the HOMA IR score (r = 0.32; p < 0.0001). An inverse correlation was observed between serum adiponectin levels and FLI (r = -0.37; p < 0.0001), the HOMA IR score (r = -0.19; p < 0.001, and CAP (r = -0.15; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In subjects with a BMI ≥ 28 kg/m 2, liver fat fraction is significantly elevated in those with T2DM compared to IGT or NGT. Liver fat fraction is associated with deteriorating insulin sensitivity and loss of glucose control. Despite a continuous increase in insulin resistance, no change in liver fat content or stiffness occurred over 30 months.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153RWMf]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Not long ago, a meta‐analysis had investigated the performance of CAP and LSM, but its population involved alcoholic liver disease patients, pediatric patients, and patients with morbid obesity. Studies found that cirrhosis caused by NASH had higher LSM values than cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C, and LSM values should be selected based on different diseases. Besides, children and adult NAFLD patients had different histopathological features, and Fibroscan did not accurately predict steatosis or fibrosis in comparison to histology in morbidly patients with obesity. There were also meta-analyses that discussed the accuracy of CAP or LSM alone in NAFLD patients, but they included only nine articles, which also led to relatively limited conclusions. Therefore, we included only adult NAFLD/NASH patients, collecting all relevant literature as much as possible. Furthermore, to explore heterogeneity and influence factors, we did meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis to further analyze the effects of the population with obesity and different probes on CAP and LSM. As we know, this was the first meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of both CAP and LSM for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in adult NAFLD/NASH patients.

Study design and participants

The study participants were patients who came to the obesity clinic at Tianjin Union Medical Center from January 2021 to February 2024. The inclusion criteria included: (1) patients over the age of 18 years, (2) patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 24 kg/m² or above, (3) patients who do not receive insulin therapy or any oral medication that affects fasting insulin (FINS). Among the 929 patients who met the inclusion criteria, we further excluded: (1) pregnant women, people taking oral contraceptives and hormones, and those who were detected as having oncological, infectious, hyperthyroidism, or serious liver or renal disease, (2) weekly alcohol intake 140–350 g female, 210–420 g male (average daily 20–50 g female, 30–60 g male), (3) missing indicator value. Ultimately, 420 study participants were included in our study. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tianjin Union Medical Center (No. 2021C06), and all participants provided informed consent before participating in the study.

Variables and data measurement

All data in this study were collected and recorded by uniformly trained researchers. Demography and clinical information were recorded for each participant.

Measurement of hepatic steatosis

Hepatic fat accumulation was quantified using vibration controlled transient elastography. Measurements were taken on subjects in the dorsal recumbent position using a FibroScan 502 Touch (Echosens, Shenzhen, China) with the XL probe at the optimal measurement point previously defined by a morphological US (good acoustic window and no blood vessel in the area). The data was stored and transferred to a computer for processing and extraction of CAP and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values from the FibroScan output. The grade of hepatic fat accumulation was defined according to the CAP value: S0 (steatosis ≤ 10%, CAP value ≤ 238), S1 (steatosis ≥ 11%, 238 < CAP value ≤ 259), S2 (steatosis ≥ 34%, 259 < CAP value ≤ 292), and S3 (steatosis ≥ 67%, CAP value > 292). The manufacturer of FibroScan provided the cut-offs for grading.

### Usefulness of controlled attenuation parameter for detecting increased arterial stiffness in general population [^1163t1tY]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Liver fibroscan has recently been suggested as an alternative method to measure liver steatosis noninvasively. In this study, we evaluated usefulness of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) for detecting increased arterial stiffness in general population.

Methods

A total of 515 asymptomatic patients without potential cause of liver disease who had liver fibroscan and cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) during their health check-up exams were included. A cut off of CAP ≥ 222 dB/m was used to define fatty liver and CAVI ≥ 8 for increased arterial stiffness.

Results

Both unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses showed significant association between fatty liver and increased arterial stiffness [unadjusted Odds ratio (OR) 1.896, 95% CI 1.305–2.754, p = .001 for CAP ≥ 222 dB/m alone]. With all traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and smoking adjusted, CAP ≥ 222 dB/m still showed significant association with increased arterial stiffness (OR 2.309, 95% CI 1.419–3.756, p = .001). The correlation between CAP-defined fatty liver and arterial stiffness was especially strong in subjects without diabetes (OR 2.959, 95% CI 1.709–5.122, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

CAP ≥ 222 dB/m is independently associated with increased arterial stiffness. As increased arterial stiffness is a surrogate and prognosticator for cardiovascular disease, surveillance using liver fibroscan may help screen and further stratify risk of patients.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter compared with ultrasound for detecting hepatic steatosis in children with severe obesity [^112UV8cx]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study reports on the accuracy of CAP and conventional B-mode US for detecting steatosis in children with obesity using MRS-PDFF as the reference standard. This is the first head-to-head comparison of CAP and US in children with obesity. The overall performance of CAP was not significantly better than that of US.

When screening for NAFLD, detecting steatosis is usually the first step to identify those patients that require additional testing to stage NAFLD, i.e. detecting and grading inflammation and/or fibrosis. The most widely used screening tools, serum ALT measurement and ultrasound, are limited by their mediocre accuracy which has led to the development of new techniques such as MRI-based measurements and CAP, an ultrasound-based measurement available on the FibroScan ® device. To evaluate the clinical value of new screening tools for NAFLD, it is most relevant to determine the accuracy of detecting any steatosis (≥ S1), since the degree of steatosis is not associated with the histological severity of liver disease and metabolic changes. For example, insulin resistance starts early on after hepatic triglyceride accumulation and is fully established at 1.5% (measured by ¹H-MRS), which is well below the current cutoff point for the diagnosis of NAFLD.

### AASLD practice statement on the evaluation and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children [^116Me9Cr]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD guidance on MASLD in children — controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) pediatric performance shows variable correlation and thresholds: CAP offers a quantitative measure of liver fat content but lacks sufficient validation in pediatric diagnostic performance; CAP, measured concurrently with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), quantifies hepatic steatosis by measuring shear wave velocity and ultrasound signal attenuation, with CAP values (100–400 dB/m); in children, the correlation of CAP with liver MRI-PDFF ranges from 0.17 to 0.53; threshold values for identifying steatosis vary widely (225–277), with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 67% to 99% and 67% to 83%, respectively, and at the higher end of this range, an AUROC of 0.74–0.80 has been reported for detecting MRI-confirmed hepatic steatosis; however, when compared directly to ultrasound, the CAP score did not demonstrate any improvement, and uncertainties about optimal thresholds, bias, precision (particularly in children with more severe obesity), and longitudinal accuracy currently limit its diagnostic use.

Liver stiffness for fibrosis staging

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the assessment of its severity are important to provide appropriate management, to determine the prognosis or the need for surveillance.

Several guidelines have been released regarding the use of SWE techniques for the staging of liver fibrosis. – Currently, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with the SWE techniques is considered a reliable substitute for liver biopsy in several clinical settings. All SWE techniques perform better in assessing advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis – mainly in ruling out the disease – than in identifying early stages of liver fibrosis. –

Among the SWE techniques, VCTE is the most validated and most used in the clinical practice, particularly because it is a user-friendly technique giving an LSM without dealing with the quality of the US B-mode image that is instead of utmost importance when using an ARFI-based technique.VCTE is available since 2003, there is abundant literature regarding its accuracy, and it has become a point-of-care tool for the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis. The stiffness value, in kPa, is obtained together with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) which is an estimate of the attenuation (given in decibel/meter) of the US beam that traverses the liver tissue and is directly related to the amount of fat in the liver. Currently, an attenuation coefficient to quantify liver fat content is available also on several US systems and early works suggest an accuracy higher than CAP.

### Controlled attenuation parameter: a measure of hepatic steatosis in patients with cystic fibrosis [^115kSRxX]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic steatosis is a common manifestation of CF-related liver disease(CFLD). Controlled attenuation parameter(CAP) measurement during transient elastography(TE) semiquantifies liver steatosis. We examined the relationship between CAP and CFLD severity, clinical factors and liver stiffness measurements(LSM).

Methods

This is a cross-sectional study of CF patients seen for outpatient care between January 2013-March 2014. CFLD severity was categorized as no CFLD, CFLD without portal hypertension(PHTN) and CFLD with PHTN, based on published criteria.

Results

129 patients (median 18.4y; 57% male) had valid CAP. 70(54%) had no CFLD, 44(34%) CFLD without PHTN, and 15(12%) CFLD with PHTN. The median CAP was 210 dB/m (IQR 181–239). Steatosis(CAP ≥ 230 dB/m) was seen in 27% of subjects without CFLD, 48% in CFLD but no PHTN, and 20% in with CFLD and PHTN(P = 0.04). CAP was higher for subjects with CFLD without PHTN (P < .05). There was no CAP difference between subjects with no CFLD and those with CFLD and PHTN (P ≥ .65). LSM was not different between no CFLD and CFLD without PHTN (P = 0.07), but each of these groups had lower LSM compared to subjects with CFLD and PHTN(P < .001 for each). Except for direct bilirubin, CAP was not associated with clinical markers of liver disease.

Conclusion

CAP was normal in 86(67%) of patients with CF and was not associated with standard clinical markers of liver disease. CAP was higher in patients with liver disease, which could possibly reflect the loss of steatosis observed with progression to cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ETnhd]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease, and among the non-invasive tests, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) have shown better diagnostic performance in NAFLD. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the performance of CAP and LSM for assessing steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases for relevant articles published up to February 13 th, 2022, and selected studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and evaluated the quality of evidence. Then we pooled sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. A random effect model was applied regardless of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to explore heterogeneity, and Fagan plot analysis was used to evaluate clinical utility. This meta-analysis was completed in Nanjing, Jiangsu and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022309965).

Findings

A total of 10537 patients from 61 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The AUROC of CAP were 0·924, 0·794 and 0·778 for steatosis grades ≥ S1, ≥ S2 and = S3, respectively, and the AUROC of LSM for detecting fibrosis stages ≥ F1, ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and = F4 were 0·851, 0·830, 0·897 and 0·925, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² had lower accuracy for diagnosing S ≥ S1, ≥ S2 than BMI < 30 kg/m². For the mean cut-off values, significant differences were found in CAP values among different body mass index (BMI) populations and LSM values among different regions. For diagnosing S ≥ S1, ≥ S2 and = S3, the mean CAP cut-off values for BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² were 30·7, 28·2, and 27·9 dB/m higher than for BMI < 30 kg/m² (P = 0·001, 0·001 and 0·018, respectively). For diagnosing F ≥ F2 and = F4, the mean cut-off values of Europe and America were 0·96 and 2·03 kPa higher than Asia (P = 0·027, P = 0·034), respectively. In addition, the results did not change significantly after sensitivity analysis and the trim and fill method to correct for publication bias, proving that the conclusions are robust.

Interpretation

The good performance of CAP and LSM for the diagnosis of mild steatosis (S ≥ S1), advanced liver fibrosis (F ≥ F3), and cirrhosis (F = F4) can be used to screen for NAFLD in high-risk populations. Of note, the accuracy of CAP for the detection of steatosis in patients with obesity is reduced and requires specific diagnostic values. For LSM, the same diagnostic values can be used when the appropriate probes are selected based on BMI and the automated probe selection tool. The performance of CAP and LSM in assessing steatosis in patients with obesity, moderate to severe steatosis, and low-grade fibrosis should be further validated and improved in the future.

Funding

The study was funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

### Validity criteria for the diagnosis of fatty liver by M probe-based controlled attenuation parameter [^117Rtf3v]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) can be performed together with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) and is often used to diagnose fatty liver. We aimed to define the validity criteria of CAP.

Methods

CAP was measured by the M probe prior to liver biopsy in 754 consecutive patients with different liver diseases at three centers in Europe and Hong Kong (derivation cohort, n = 340; validation cohort, n = 414; 101 chronic hepatitis B, 154 chronic hepatitis C, 349 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 37 autoimmune hepatitis, 49 cholestatic liver disease, 64 others; 277 F3–4; age 52 ± 14; body mass index 27.2 ± 5.3kg/m 2). The primary outcome was the diagnosis of fatty liver, defined as steatosis involving ≥ 5% of hepatocytes.

Results

The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for CAP diagnosis of fatty liver was 0.85 (95% CI 0.82–0.88). The interquartile range (IQR) of CAP had a negative correlation with CAP (r = -0.32, p < 0.001), suggesting the IQR-to-median ratio of CAP would be an inappropriate validity parameter. In the derivation cohort, the IQR of CAP was associated with the accuracy of CAP (AUROC 0.86, 0.89 and 0.76 in patients with IQR of CAP < 20 [15% of patients], 20–39 [51%], and ≥ 40dB/m [33%], respectively). Likewise, the AUROC of CAP in the validation cohort was 0.90 and 0.77 in patients with IQR of CAP < 40 and ≥ 40dB/m, respectively (p = 0.004). The accuracy of CAP in detecting grade 2 and 3 steatosis was lower among patients with body mass index ≥ 30kg/m 2 and F3–4 fibrosis.

Conclusions

The validity of CAP for the diagnosis of fatty liver is lower if the IQR of CAP is ≥ 40dB/m. Lay summary: Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is measured by transient elastography (TE) for the detection of fatty liver. In this large study, using liver biopsy as a reference, we show that the variability of CAP measurements based on its interquartile range can reflect the accuracy of fatty liver diagnosis. In contrast, other clinical factors such as adiposity and liver enzyme levels do not affect the performance of CAP.

### Performance of the attenuation imaging technology in the detection of liver steatosis [^112MG2BT]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The main aim was to assess the performance and cutoff value for the detection of liver steatosis (grade S > 0) with the Attenuation Imaging-Penetration (ATI-Pen) algorithm available on the Aplio i-series ultrasound systems (Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). The magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) was used as the reference standard. Secondary aims were to compare the results to those obtained with the previous ATI algorithm (Attenuation Imaging-General [ATI-Gen]) and with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and to generate a regression equation between ATI-Pen and ATI-Gen values.

Methods

Consecutive adult patients potentially at risk of liver steatosis were prospectively enrolled. Each patient underwent ultrasound quantification of liver steatosis with ATI-Pen and ATI-Gen and a CAP assessment with the FibroScan system (Echosens, Paris, France). The MRI-PDFF evaluation was performed within a week. The correlations between ATI-Pen, ATI-Gen, the CAP, and the MRI-PDFF were analyzed with the Pearson rank correlation coefficient. The diagnostic performance of ATI-Pen, ATI-Gen, and the CAP was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis.

Results

Seventy-two individuals (31 male and 41 female) were enrolled. Correlation coefficients of ATI-Pen, ATI-Gen, and the CAP with the MRI-PDFF were 0.78, 0.83, and 0.58, respectively. The AUROCs of ATI-Pen, ATI-Gen, and the CAP for detecting steatosis (S > 0) were 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.96), 0.92 (0.82–0.98), and 0.85 (0.74–0.92), and the cutoffs were greater than 0.69dB/cm/MHz, greater than 0.62dB/cm/MHz, and greater than 273dB/m. The regression equation between ATI-Pen and ATI-Gen was ATI-Pen = 0.88 ATI-Gen+0.13.

Conclusions

Attenuation Imaging is a reliable tool for detecting liver steatosis, showing an excellent correlation with the MRI-PDFF and high performance with AUROCs of 0.90 or higher.

### The performance of M and XL probes of fibroScan for the diagnosis of steatosis and fibrosis on a Brazilian nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cohort [^111QqVLC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recently, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was incorporated for XL probe. However, its performance through M and XL probes has been scarcely evaluated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The performance of probes regarding transient elastography by Fibroscan is still under debate.

Aim

Compare the performance of CAP and transient elastography in NAFLD patients obtained through XL with M probes using histological analysis as gold standard.

Methods

NAFLD patients underwent liver biopsy and FibroScan/CAP with M and XL probes the same day. C-statistic evaluated CAP performance in the identification of moderate/severe (≥ 33%) and severe (≥ 66%) steatosis by both probes and transient elastography performance for identification of significant fibrosis (≥ F2).

Results

Eighty-one patients (74% female; age 54.2 ± 9.9 years; BMI 32.8 ± 5.2/ BMI ≥ 25 92.6%; 96% metabolic syndrome; 60% diabetes mellitus) were included. Mean CAP with M and XL probes was 314 ± 39 and 325 ± 47 dB/m, respectively. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the M and XL probes for steatosis detection ≥ 33% were 0.75 (0.64–0.84) and 0.76 (0.65–0.84) (P = 0.95) and for steatosis ≥ 66% 0.83 (0.73–0.90) and 0.82 (0.71–0.89) (P = 0.73), respectively, with similar performances for both degrees of steatosis. Regarding transient elastography, AUROCs of M and XL probes for ≥ F2 were 0.82 (0.71–0.93) and 0.80 (0.69–0.92) (P = 0.66).

Conclusion

Performance of M and XL probes is similar for the diagnosis of moderate and severe steatosis and significant fibrosis even on a overweight population with NAFLD.

### Evaluation of liver steatosis, measured by controlled attenuation parameter, in patients with hepatitis C-induced advanced liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [^117DjPxf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Steatosis is a documented feature of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). There is an association between steatosis decrease and fibrosis progression. The association between steatosis and advanced fibrosis versus hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development has not been precisely evaluated. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was applied as an immediate and efficient process to detect and quantify hepatic steatosis with adequate accuracy.

Aims

The aim of this study was to assess the difference in liver steatosis between patients with hepatitis C virus-related advanced hepatic fibrosis versus HCC.

Patients and Methods

This cross-sectional study included 130 patients with HCC, attending the multidisciplinary HCC clinic, Cairo University, and 54 patients with CHC between October 2015 and June 2016. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded. Liver stiffness and CAP were obtained by using the FibroScan 502, touch.

Results

All included patients had genotype 4. The mean CAP value was significantly lower in HCC (209.5 ± 57.1dB/m) versus CHC (259.9 ± 54.9dB/m). Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed an area under the curve of 0.75 for the differentiation between groups. At a cutoff value of 237dB/m, sensitivity was 72.3%, specificity was 70.7%, positive likelihood ratio was 2.5, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.4 in the differentiation between CHC versus HCC. Logistic regression analysis revealed an odds ratio of 6.4 for the diagnosis of HCC with CAP of less than 237dB/m. Multivariate analysis, controlling for age, sex, BMI, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels, revealed a significantly increased odds for HCC diagnosis (odds ratio: 4.3, P = 0.006).

Conclusion

The progression of CHC is associated with a decrease in steatosis, particularly toward advanced fibrosis and HCC. Steatosis reduction less than 237dB/m is likely to be associated with HCC.

### Novel controlled attenuation parameter for noninvasive assessment of steatosis using fibroscan (®): validation in chronic hepatitis C [^111fUrGq]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

A novel controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been developed for Fibroscan(®) to assess liver steatosis, simultaneously with liver stiffness measurement (LSM). We assessed CAP diagnostic accuracy in a large cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus. A total of 615 patients with CHC, who underwent both Fibroscan(®) and liver biopsy, were analysed. Fibrosis was graded using METAVIR score. Steatosis was categorized by visual assessment as S(0): steatosis in < 10% of hepatocytes, S(1): 11–33%, S(2): 34–66% and S(3): 67–100%. Performances of CAP and liver stiffness were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and cross-validated using the bootstrap method. The Obuchowski measure was used to assess overall accuracy of CAP and to differentiate between steatosis grades. In multivariate analysis, CAP was related to steatosis (P < 10⁻¹⁵) independently of fibrosis stage (which was related to LSM). The areas under ROC curves using CAP to detect steatosis were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.84) for S ≥ S(1), 0.86 (0.81–0.92) for S ≥ S(2) and 0.88 (0.73–1) S = S(3). CAP exhibited a good ability to differentiate steatosis grades (Obuchowski measure = 0.92). Performance of LSM for fibrosis assessment confirmed results from previous studies. CAP is a novel tool to assess the degree of steatosis and both fibrosis and steatosis can be evaluated noninvasively during the same procedure using Fibroscan(®), in patients with CHC.

Meta-regression analyses were performed according to covariates including cut-off value, BMI, probe type, study design, and region. The results showed that BMI (P = 0·0252), cut-off value (P = 0·0313), probe type (P = 0·0304), and region (P = 0·0068) might be the possible sources of heterogeneity (Table S3). Furthermore, we conducted subgroup analyses according to the probe type, BMI, cut-off value, and region. We found that M probe, BMI < 30 kg/m², low cut-off values, and Asia groups showed higher AUROC in detecting S ≥ S1 and ≥ S2, while for diagnosing S = S3, F ≥ F1, F ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and = F4, the AUROC of different probe types, BMI, cut-off values, and regions were similar (Table 1, Figure 2).

### Accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter compared with ultrasound for detecting hepatic steatosis in children with severe obesity [^114XkTVN]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) became available on the FibroScan ® device (Echosens SA) for the detection of hepatic steatosis. CAP reflects the attenuation (loss of signal amplitude) of an ultrasound beam as it traverses tissue and is influenced by the amount of hepatic fat. CAP uses standardized (controlled) settings, thereby minimizing user influence on the attenuation value. CAP is expressed as a number, whereas in conventional B-mode ultrasound, the grayscale values (which in part reflect the level of attenuation) are interpreted by an observer. These interpretations are subject to inter-observer variability. A second advantage of CAP is that FibroScan ® simultaneously measures liver stiffness to assess fibrosis, which is of great benefit when evaluating children with NAFLD.

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CAP in (a) detecting and (b) grading hepatic steatosis in children with obesity in a screening setting using MRS-PDFF as the reference standard. As a secondary aim, we performed a head-to-head comparison of the accuracy of CAP and US in detecting steatosis in children with obesity.

### Controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurements using transient elastography by fibroScan in gaucher disease [^117WUMj6]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver involvement in Gaucher disease (GD) is a result of glucosylceramide (GL1) and its deacylated lysolipid, glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL1) infiltration of macrophages. The long-term liver-related complications of GD could include liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical utility and relevance of TE by FibroScan in GD patients by assessing two parameters: controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (LS), in regard of GD-related variables, type of GD, age of patients, enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT), and metabolic features.

Methods

59 Polish patients (55 adults, 4 children) with GD (43 patients with type 1 and 16 patients with type 3) aged 7–86 years, underwent TE by FibroScan; elevated CAP was defined as > 250 dB/m and elevated LS as > 7 kPa. All patients, except five patients with type 1 GD (patients' refusal), were treated by ERT.

Results

Elevated CAP was present in 23% of GD1 patients and 19% of GD3 patients. Elevated LS was present in 21% of GD1 patients and 13% of GD3 patients. CAP was fairly, positively (ρ = 0.356) correlated with BMI. LS was fairly, positively (ρ = 0.4) correlated with patient's age, as well as the age at start of ERT (ρ = 0.326). CAP was strongly, negatively (ρ = -0.52) correlated with the age at start of ERT. LS and CAP were correlated (strongly, positively) only in GD3.

Conclusions

TE by FibroScan could be considered as an additional method for evaluating GD patients for non-invasive assessment of CAP and LS. The investigation of serial TE measurements in untreated as well as treated GD patients is needed to better determine whether this technology should be added to recommendations for monitoring GD patients. TE by FibroScan could be performed in GD patients with increased BMI and especially those with metabolic syndrome as they have other important risks for liver disease. After our analysis we think these risks factors are independent of GD but still very important for their overall health.

Data synthesis

We extracted and reconstructed classification tables for the performance of the index test from eligible studies. We calculated pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LRp), negative likelihood ratio (LRn), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for both reference standard thresholds (≥ 5%, ≥ 10%) following the hierarchical random effects model approach. In addition, we constructed summary receiver operating characteristics (sROC) curves with 95% confidence and prediction regions and evaluated the overall performance of CAP using the area under the ROC (AUROC) curve.

Heterogeneity is to be expected in diagnostic accuracy meta-analyses. We used the I 2 statistic and the Cochran Q χ 2 test to quantify heterogeneity, defining high heterogeneity as I 2 ≥ 50% and/or the result of the Cochran Q test being significant (P < 0.05). To address heterogeneity, we performed several sensitivity and subgroup analyses. More specifically, we performed sensitivity analyses that included only studies published in full text, studies that used a Fibroscan device to acquire CAP measurements, and studies with no concerns regarding applicability based on QUADAS-2. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis with the exclusion of case-control studies, as this type of study may lead to biased diagnostic accuracy estimates. We conducted subgroup analyses based on the origin of the study (Asia vs. Europe/USA), the power of the MRI scanner (1.5 vs. 3.0 Tesla), the number of quality criteria used to determine a successful CAP examination (≥ 2 vs. < 2 criteria), and CAP positivity thresholds as recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) (≥ 275 dB/m) and the AASLD (≥ 288 dB/m). In terms of quality criteria, we accepted any combination of the following: more than 10 CAP measurements, interquartile range (IQR)/median < 30%, and success rate > 60%. We conducted post hoc subgroup analysis based on the mean body mass index (BMI) of patients included in primary studies (≥ 30 kg/m 2 and < 30 kg/m 2). All statistical analyses were performed using MetaDTA and STATA statistical software. We did not assess small study effect bias with funnel plots or statistical tests, as these methods are not recommended in diagnostic test accuracy meta-analyses. All additional analyses were performed for MRI-PDFF ≥ 5%, which is the threshold used to define MASLD.

### Liver fibrosis assessed by transient elastography is independently associated with albuminuria in the general United States population [^115WsmTZ]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequent and progressive conditions that share traditional risk factors: obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Aims

To evaluate whether an independent relationship exists between liver steatosis and fibrosis and different CKD phenotypes.

Methods

Cross sectional study based on data from the 2017–18 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) was performed in a US representative sample allowing the simultaneous assessment of liver steatosis (CAP: controlled attenuation parameter) and fibrosis (LSM: liver stiffness measurement) and their relationships with CKD phenotypes (albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR).

Results

4746 adult participants had a complete VCTE exam. Prevalence of liver steatosis and significant fibrosis was 33.7% (95%CI: 30.9–36.6%) and 8.9% (95%CI: 7.5–10.5%), respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that liver fibrosis, but not steatosis, was associated with albuminuria (OR 2.19, 95%CI: 1.49–3.20) and albuminuria or reduced eGFR (OR 2.18, 95%CI: 1.59–3.00) also when adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, diabetes, blood pressure categories, glycated haemoglobin, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and CAP.

Conclusions

In the general US population liver fibrosis assessed using VCTE is associated with CKD, and in particular with the albuminuric phenotype, regardless of traditional risk factors.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis in children: the clinical value of controlled attenuation parameter [^114JahtB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a major health problem in children with an increasing incidence due to sedentary lifestyles and hyper-caloric diets that are the main factors of the obesity epidemics. Ten years ago, it was estimated that in Europe roughly one obese child out of three was affected by hepatic steatosis. A recent review on the burden of liver disease in Europe has reported an even higher prevalence (36–44%). A study conducted in the United States has reported that children with NAFLD have an increased risk of liver-related mortality and a survival significantly shorter than that observed in the general population of the same age and sex. Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD at an early stage is of outmost importance for limiting the progression of the pathology. Liver biopsy is the reference standard for the assessment of liver steatosis, however the procedure is invasive, has several limitations including intra and inter-observer variability in specimen's readings, and it's unpractical for screening purpose or to follow-up patients.

Ultrasound (US) is the imaging modality most widely used for the noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis. A good diagnostic accuracy of US for the detection of moderate to severe steatosis in children has been reported, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.87. However, US has a low sensitivity for the detection of mild steatosis.

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a method for the non-invasive assessment of liver steatosis. It measures the attenuation of the ultrasound beam that traverses the liver tissue, which increases in fatty liver, and is obtained by analyzing the ultrasound signal acquired by the transient elastography device (Fibroscan 502 Touch, Echosens, Paris, France). It has been shown that CAP has a good accuracy for quantifying liver steatosis also in pediatric patients.

The main aim of this study was to assess the clinical validity of CAP in the early diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in a series of overweight or obese children by using the imperfect gold standard methodology. Secondary aim was to analyze any association of CAP with liver stiffness values and with other indices of NAFLD.

Methods

Study selection

All relevant articles on the application of CAP in the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in liver-biopsy proven NAFLD patients available on multiple electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to May 12,017 were searched. Heading terms and key words used in the search include "controlled attenuation parameter" or "CAP", "hepatic steatosis" or "liver steatosis" or "steatohepatitis", "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease" or "NAFLD", "diagnosis accuracy" or "diagnostic test". The references screened by titles and abstracts therein were firstly reviewed by two authors (KP and SYB) independently and blindly. The remaining articles were further selected by reading full-text to exclude the irrelevant information, as set out below in the inclusion criteria. Only articles published in English were searched.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were included if the following criteria were met: (1) that performed in NAFLD patients diagnosed by liver biopsy and the degree of fatty liver changes classified as follows: Stage 0 (S0), fatty changes seen in < 5% of hepatocytes; Stage 1 (S1), fatty changes occurred in 5–33% of hepatocytes; Stage 2 (S2), fatty changes seen in 34–66% of hepatocytes; and Stage 3 (S3), > 66% of hepatocytes had fatty changes; (2) that provided adequate description of CAP using transient elastography (FibroScan FS); (3) that liver biopsy was used as the reference standard of the assessment of hepatic steatosis; and (4) that sufficient data were available for calculating the test performance parameters including true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN) rates. All data were extracted from the primary articles or acquired directly from the corresponding authors. Inclusion was not restricted by study size or publication type.

Figure 2
Diagnostic performance of CAP and LSM, mean cut-off values, and influencing factors.

Furthermore, we also compared the mean cut-off values between different subgroups. We found that there were significant differences in CAP values among different BMI populations and LSM values among different regions. For diagnosing S ≥ S1, ≥ S2, and = S3, the mean cut-off values of BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² were 30·7, 28·2, and 27·9 dB/m higher than BMI < 30 kg/m² (P = 0·001, 0·001 and 0·018), respectively. For diagnosing F ≥ F2 and = F4, the mean cut-off values of EUR-USA were 0·96 and 2·03 kPa higher than Asia (P = 0·027, P = 0·034), respectively. Interestingly, there were also differences, although not significant, that seemed to follow a pattern: higher mean CAP values for XL probes and EUR-USA groups, and higher mean LSM values for M probes and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² groups. Specifically, for diagnosing S ≥ S1 and = S3, the mean cut-off values of XL probe were 23·6 and 15·7 dB/m higher than M probe, respectively. For diagnosing S ≥ S1, ≥ S2 and = S3, the mean cut-off values of EUR-USA were 11·2, 16·7, and 6·3 dB/m higher than Asia. Moreover, for diagnosing F ≥ F2, ≥ F3, and = F4, the mean cut-off values of M probe were 0·87, 0·67 and 1·00 kPa higher than XL probe, respectively. For diagnosing F ≥ F1, ≥ F2, and ≥ F3, the mean cut-off values of high BMI were 0·54, 0·72, and 0·09 kPa higher than low BMI, respectively (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2).

### The inverse effect of meal intake on controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness as assessed by transient elastography [^116n6gHi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography

Patients underwent abdominal ultrasonography (HITACHI, Japan) using a convex 3.5 MHz probe for evaluation of fatty liver on the same day with TE. Fatty liver was evaluated based on the degree of liver brightness, the presence of sonographic contrast appearance between liver and kidney parenchyma, reduced vessel wall echogenicity, high posterior attenuation and poorly delineated diaphragm.

Measurement of liver stiffness (LS) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)

A single operator who had experiences of more than 1000 cases of TE measurement performed TE in this study. While the patients were lying on their back, the tip of a 3.5 MHz standard M probe was placed on the skin of intercostal space over the right lobe of the liver. The liver stiffness was measured with transient elastography (FibroScan®, Echosens, Paris, France). LS is expressed in kilopascal (kPa). The only results accepted followed the standard protocol with 10 valid measurements and had success rates over 60% and an interquartile range (IQR)/median of less than 0.3.

CAP is a novel non-invasive parameter to assess the degree of steatosis by using a vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE™) device based on the properties of ultrasonic signals acquired by TE. A total ultrasonic attenuation (go-and-return path) was estimated. CAP was evaluated using the same radiofrequency data and region of interest used for the assessment of LS. CAP values were expressed in dB/m, range 100–400 dB/m. CAP value was interpreted only when the associated LS value was valid.

LS and CAP measurement were obtained simultaneously after an eight-hour overnight fasting (baseline values) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min following the intake of a standard commercial formula (400 ml, 600 kcal, protein: carbohydrates: fat - 15: 55: 30 (equivalent to a standard Thai meal)), and every 30 min until the LS and CAP values returned to baseline.

### Dietary choline intake and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in U.S. adults: national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2017–2018 [^112m3aA7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether there is an association between dietary choline intake and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in American adults remains unclear.

Methods

Data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017–2018. Choline intake was defined by the mean amounts of two 24h dietary recalls, and choline intake was categorized into three groups according to the quartiles: inadequate (< P 25), average (P 25 -P 75), and optimal (> P 75). Hepatic steatosis was assessed with FibroScan ®, in which VCTE was employed with controlled attenuation to derive the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and NAFLD was defined as a CAP score ≥ 285dB/m. Multivariable linear regression was performed to assess the linear relationship between choline intake and CAP. Multivariable logistics regression models were conducted to assess the association between choline intake status and NAFLD in the final sample and subgroup analysis was then performed in men and women.

Results

The amount of dietary choline was inversely associated with CAP score (β = -0.262, 95% CI: -0.280, -0.245). Compared to inadequate choline intake, optimal choline intake was related to a lower risk of NAFLD (OR: 0.705, 95% CI: 0.704–0.706) in the final sample. Subgroup analysis by gender revealed that the highest choline intake status was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD both in females (OR: 0.764, 95% CI: 0.762–0.766), and males (OR: 0.955, 95% CI: 0.953–0.958) when compared to the lowest choline intake.

Conclusions

With the latest NHANES data, we found that higher dietary choline was associated with a lower risk of NAFLD in American adults, and such a relationship exists in both females and males.

### Improved noninvasive prediction of liver fibrosis by liver stiffness measurement in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease accounting for controlled attenuation parameter values [^112UdBEB]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) frequently overestimates the severity of liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a new parameter provided by the same machine used for LSM and associated with both steatosis and body mass index, the two factors mostly affecting LSM performance in NAFLD. We aimed to determine whether prediction of liver fibrosis by LSM in NAFLD patients is affected by CAP values. Patients (n = 324) were assessed by clinical and histological (Kleiner score) features. LSM and CAP were performed using the M probe. CAP values were grouped by tertiles (lower 132–298, middle 299–338, higher 339–400 dB/m). Among patients with F0-F2 fibrosis, mean LSM values, expressed in kilopascals, increased according to CAP tertiles (6.8 versus 8.6 versus 9.4, P = 0.001), and along this line the area under the curve of LSM for the diagnosis of F3-F4 fibrosis was progressively reduced from lower to middle and further to higher CAP tertiles (0.915, 0.848–0.982; 0.830, 0.753–0.908; 0.806, 0.723–0.890). As a consequence, in subjects with F0-F2 fibrosis, the rates of false-positive LSM results for F3-F4 fibrosis increased according to CAP tertiles (7.2% in lower versus 16.6% in middle versus 18.1% in higher). Consistent with this, a decisional flowchart for predicting fibrosis was suggested by combining both LSM and CAP values.

Conclusions

In patients with NAFLD, CAP values should always be taken into account in order to avoid overestimations of liver fibrosis assessed by transient elastography. (Hepatology 2017;65:1145–1155).

### Normal liver stiffness values in children: a comparison of three different elastography methods [^114YBQj1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Controlled Attenuation Parameter

Fat deposits in hepatocytes affect ultrasound propagation, increasing the attenuation. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) evaluates the ultrasonic attenuation in the liver at 3.5 MHz at depth 25 to 65 mm using FibroScan, and represents a noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis. CAP values in dB/m were reported as the median of 10 acquisitions for all subjects evaluated by TE.

Statistical Analysis

For all analyses, SPSS version 25 (SPSS Inc, 2016, Armonk, NY) was used. Variables were tested for normality, and data were presented as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (range), as appropriate. When establishing age-specific reference values, mean ± 1.96 SD was used. For comparison of groups, standard paired T test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, or Pearson Chi-Square test were used as appropriate. Correlations were tested by Pearson correlation coefficient. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to present interobserver reliability. Limits of agreement were assessed to reveal differences between platforms and observers. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Ethical Aspects

The protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Regional Committee on Medical and Health Research Ethics of Western Norway (2017/290/REK Vest).

### Is fasting necessary for individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to undergo vibration-controlled transient elastography? [^117KazWB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of meal intake on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease undergoing vibration-controlled transient elastography.

Methods

LSM and CAP were assessed at baseline and serially for 6 hours after meal intake in 24 patients.

Results

A significant increase in LSM was seen up to the 2-hour time point (26 ± 25%, P = 0.02). The CAP scores changed minimally with a maximal change of 3% (P > 0.1).

Conclusions

Three hours of fasting is necessary before evaluation with vibration-controlled transient elastography.

### Controlled attenuation parameter in NAFLD identifies risk of suboptimal glycaemic and metabolic control [^114uerSK]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the relationship between steatosis quantified by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values and glycaemic/metabolic control.

Methods

230 patients, recruited from an Endocrine clinic or primary care underwent routine Hepatology assessment, with liver stiffness measurements and simultaneous CAP. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify potential predictors of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), HbA1c ≥ 7%, use of insulin, hypertriglyceridaemia and CAP ≥ 300 dB/m.

Results

Patients were 56.7 ± 12.3 years of age with a high prevalence of MetS (83.5%), T2DM (81.3%), and BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2 (18%). Median CAP score was 344 dB/m, ranging from 128 to 400 dB/m. BMI (aOR 1.140 95% CI 1.068–1.216), requirement for insulin (aOR 2.599 95% CI 1.212–5.575), and serum ALT (aOR 1.018 95% CI 1.004–1.033) were independently associated with CAP ≥ 300 dB/m. Patients with CAP interquartile range < 40 (68%) had a higher median serum ALT level (p = 0.029), greater prevalence of BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2 (p = 0.020) and higher median CAP score (p < 0.001). Patients with higher CAP scores were more likely to have MetS (aOR 1.011 95% CI 1.003–1.019), HBA1c ≥ 7 (aOR 1.010 95% CI 1.003–1.016), requirement for insulin (aOR 1.007 95% CI 1.002–1.013) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 1.007 95% CI 1.002–1.013).

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that an elevated CAP reflects suboptimal metabolic control. In diabetic patients with NAFLD, CAP may be a useful point-of-care test to identify patients at risk of poorly controlled metabolic comorbidities or advanced diabetes.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a metabolic disease in humans: a literature review [^115ShCx6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic and increasingly common liver disorder among adults in Western countries. 1, 2 NAFLD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of disease, but is histologically categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver, characterized as ≥ 5% liver steatosis with no evidence of injury to hepatocytes and no evidence of fibrosis, 1 and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 1, 2 defined as ≥ 5% liver steatosis including inflammation and injury to hepatocytes with or without fibrosis, although fibrosis is typically observed. 1, 2, 3 NASH is associated with increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver‐related mortality, especially when fibrosis is present. 1, 2, 3 Advancing fibrosis stage exponentially increases the risk of liver‐related mortality. 4

Diagnosis of NAFLD requires detection of liver steatosis, exclusion of other liver diseases, and absence of alcoholic causes. 5 NAFLD is often identified by abdominal ultrasonography during routine health checks, and ultrasonography is an acceptable screening procedure for steatosis. 5 However, liver biopsies remain the only definitive technique to determine and then monitor the stage and severity of NAFLD. 6 Biopsies are invasive, costly, and allow for considerable sampling error 5, 6; thus, noninvasive diagnostic and staging methods are under continued investigation. Vibration‐controlled one‐dimensional transient elastography, also known as Fibroscan®, provides a liver stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter, which can indicate the level of liver fibrosis and steatosis, respectively. 7 This method is considered an effective noninvasive procedure for NAFLD screening. 7 Development of the XL probe has also improved Fibroscan® reliability in patients with obesity. 7 The commercial biomarker panels SteatoTest, ActiTest, NashTest‐2 and FibroTest have been validated for diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH and/or fibrosis; however, the validation cohorts only included a minority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 8 All panels were found to underperform in a population of patients with T2DM, suggesting that studies in nondiabetic populations should not be directly extrapolated to patients with T2DM. 8 Other proposed methods for detecting and assessing fibrosis stage in patients with NAFLD include various biomarkers and composite scores of clinical assessments such as NAFLD fibrosis score, fibrosis‐4 index and the aspartate transaminase (AST) to platelet ratio index; studies assessing these have found varying performance. 9, 10, 11 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis score for assessing advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. 12 Noninvasive imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging‐derived proton density fat fraction and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), have been suggested for liver fat and fibrosis detection, respectively. 13, 14 Recently, combining liver stiffness measurement and controlled attenuation parameter by Fibroscan® with AST level, known as FibroScan‐AST (FAST), demonstrated good performance in identifying patients at risk of progressive NASH (NASH with NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2). 15 The positive predictive value for FAST was 83% in the prospective UK derivation cohort, and 69% in the pooled global validation cohorts. 15 The MRE combined with FIB‐4 (MEFIB) index (MRE ≥ 3.3 kPa and FIB‐4 ≥ 1.6) demonstrated positive predictive values of 97% and 91% for detection of fibrosis stage ≥ 2 in the University of California at San Diego derivation cohort and Japan validation cohort, respectively. 16

### Defining values for controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness in youth without liver disease [^115jC65i]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine the reference values to define an age-specific normal range of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, a measure of liver steatosis) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values assessed by ultrasound-based transient elastography in adolescents without underlying liver disease.

Methods

A total of 462 participants were included in this cross-sectional study using data from NHANES 2017–2018. LSM and CAP were carried out using the FibroScan® M-probe. Anthropometric, metabolic and hematological parameters were measured.

Results

The median CAP was 199.0dB/m (150.0–245.0dB/m, 10th to 90th percentiles) and the median LSM was 4.7kPa (3.4–6.3kPa, 10th to 90th percentiles) for ages 12–19.9 years. Regression analyses show that the CAP and LSM were not positively correlated with age (boys CAP R 2 = 0.001, p = 0.576 and LSM R 2 = 0.012, p = 0.096; girls CAP R 2 = 0.011, p = 0.113 and LSM R 2 = 0.006, p = 0.236). Finally, CAP was positively associated with LSM in girls (β = 0.189, p = 0.005) but not in boys (β = -0.083, p = 0.202).

Conclusions

The reference values indicated here for LSM and CAP will help in the screening of adolescents between ages 12 and 19.9 years and might serve as a useful method for identifying those youth at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Impact

The reference values indicated in this study for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) will help in the screening of adolescents between ages 12 and 19.9 years in clinical practice. The cutoffs of LSM and CAP might serve as a useful method for identifying those youth at high risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

### The inverse effect of meal intake on controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness as assessed by transient elastography [^114hNoLR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic steatosis is a common feature in many types of chronic liver disease such as alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and chronic viral hepatitis B and C. NAFLD is a frequent concomitant condition in chronic liver disease that can accelerate the progression of the disease. NAFLD can reduce virological response in treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Liver biopsy is a gold standard for the assessment of steatosis and other histological features. However, this procedure is invasive and costly. Moreover, sampling errors and questionable reproducibility in liver biopsy have been reported.

A novel, non-invasive tool based on ultrasound attenuation, the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), was developed to assess the degree of liver steatosis. It is performed with transient elastrography (TE, FibroScan®). The reliable diagnostic performance of CAP has been confirmed in many types of chronic liver disease, including chronic viral hepatitis and NAFLD. Previous studies demonstrated that liver stiffness (LS), as assessed by TE, was affected by food consumption from the mechanism of postprandial hyperemia. High body mass index (BMI), alcohol drinking, histological steatosis grade 3 and CAP > 323 dB/m interfere with the accuracy of CAP measurement. The effect of a meal on CAP has never been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a meal on CAP and LS. We hypothesized that CAP value might increase after food ingestion similar to the phenomenon of the meal effect on LS.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115xKUdj]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — identification of hepatic steatosis using imaging indicates that ultrasound provides a semiquantitative assessment and reports steatosis when it is "Detected". FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) uses a likely cut point of ≥ 288 dB/m. Magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) uses ≥ 5% for likely steatosis and < 5% for unlikely, is described as most sensitive across the spectrum of steatosis, and is accurate to assess dynamic change, while CAP has limited accuracy for quantification.

Materials and methods

This prospective single-center study was approved by the Ethical Committee of our University Hospital (approval No. 01/2022). All participants provided written informed consent upon enrollment.

Participants

Participants were enrolled between February 2022 and July 2023 according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) being older than 18 years; (2) new diagnosis of MASLD undergoing initial clinical evaluation in the absence of prior treatments; (3) underwent percutaneous liver biopsy according to clinical/biochemical and instrumental evaluation. The following exclusion criteria were considered: (1) history of other etiologies of chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, alcohol consumption ≥ 30 g/day for men or ≥ 20 g/day for women, acute hepatitis, or hemochromatosis; (2) other causes of secondary hepatic steatosis, including use of hepatotoxic drugs that may cause steatosis; (3) aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation > 5 times the normal limits.

All participants underwent clinical evaluation on the same day of the liver biopsy. The following data were collected: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), laboratory tests, and transient elastography (FibroScan®) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurements. Participants were graded as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2), normal weight (BMI from 18.5 to < 25 kg/m 2), overweight (BMI from 25 to < 30 kg/m 2), or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2). TE and CAP measurements were performed by trained operators who had previously performed at least 300 determinations in patients with chronic liver diseases. Measurements were acquired with FibroScan ® (Echosens), using the M and the XL probe when appropriate, after overnight fasting. Only patients with ten valid measurements and with reliable results according to published criteria were enrolled.

Statement 4: NASH Should Be Confirmed by Liver Biopsy Before Initiating Pharmacological Therapy in NAFLD

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm NASH, new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These are stages that correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4+ ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising NIT is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by TE with AST. In the derivative/validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with AUROC of ~0.80 and 2 author-determined cutoffs: the first (≤ 0.35) to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2 and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

The effect of meal on CAP according to fibrosis and steatosis stages

For thirty (75%) patients with F0-F2 stage, the mean CAP values following meal intake began to decline from 15 min (P = 0.02) and peaked at 60 min (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2a). The peak post-meal delta decrease of CAP values was 20.3 dB/m (P = 0.002). The CAP values returned to baseline by 90 min. There were 10 (25%) patients who had F3-F4 fibrosis stage (Fig. 2b). The mean CAP values following meal intake did not show significant change.

Thirty-three (82.5%) patients had S0-S1 steatosis stage. The mean CAP values following meal intake was significant decline at 60 min (P = 0.003) and at 90 min (P = 0.03), respectively (Fig. 3a). The mean post-meal CAP peak value was at 60 min. The mean CAP values returned to baseline by 120 min. There were 7 (17.5%) patients who had S2-S3 steatosis stage. The mean CAP values following meal intake declined 15 to 120 min (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3b). The mean post-meal CAP peak value was at 15 min and the CAP values returned to baseline by 150 min.

### Serum cytokeratin-18 and its relation to liver fibrosis and steatosis diagnosed by fibroScan and controlled attenuation parameter in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus patients [^115wZ7C9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Multiple diagnostic noninvasive methods for NAFLD were studied (both serological and imaging), either single or combined. Attention has been focused on cytokeratin-18 (CK18) as a novel serological marker for the diagnosis of steatosis/fibrosis in NAFLD and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients.

Aim

The aim of this study was to evaluate serum CK18 in NAFLD and HCV fibrosis/steatosis and also to correlate its performance with the diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography (TE) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in the diagnosis of fibrosis/steatosis in these patients.

Patients and Methods

Three equal groups of participants were enrolled (n = 135): group I included patients with chronic HCV, group II included NAFLD patients, and group III included control participants. For all groups, TE/CAP and labs including serum CK18 were performed. Liver biopsy was performed for the NAFLD group.

Results

Serum CK18 was significantly higher in the NAFLD group (19.01 ± 3.49ng/ml) versus the HCV group (8.95 ± 1.06ng/ml) and the control group (4.83 ± 1.6ng/ml) (P < 0.001). The CK18 levels in biopsy stages (steatosis, ballooning, inflammation, and fibrosis) and FibroScan/CAP degrees showed that CK18 increased significantly with steatosis and fibrosis stages (biopsy or FibroScan/CAP), but did not reach significance with ballooning or inflammation grades. CK18 was significantly different in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis versus non-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients (P = 0.041). The best CK18 cutoff to detect steatosis (S ≥ 2) in NAFLD and HCV was 11.65 and 6.84ng/ml, respectively with an overall sensitivity and specificity over 97%. The CK18 cutoff for significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) by FibroScan in the NAFLD/HCV groups was 9.115ng/ml, with 62.5%/69.2% sensitivity/specificity (P = 0.031). However, inflammation had a cutoff with a marginal P value (P = 0.080), and a reliable cutoff for ballooning was not attained (P = 0.386). There was a positive correlation between CK18 and fibrosis (by FibroScan) in the NAFLD and HCV groups (P < 0.05). The correlation between CK18 and steatosis in CAP and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was very good (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Serum CK18 is related strongly to the development/progression of NAFLD and HCV-related fibrosis/steatosis. TE was correlated highly with liver biopsy results. The combination of CK18 with other noninvasive modalities increases the diagnostic yield of these tests.

NAFLD is typically diagnosed after liver steatosis is discovered through a liver biopsy, histological analysis, and imaging examinations in the absence of causes of abnormal transaminase values or secondary causes of liver fat accumulation as determined by a medical history or laboratory tests. As a non-invasive imaging method, vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) can be used to accurately diagnose liver steatosis and advanced hepatopathy in adults. VCTE was included as a method for detecting liver steatosis and hepatic fibrosis in the most recent cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) based on the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Using the NHANES database, we examined the relationship between HTN and liver steatosis and fibrosis in adult participants, as measured by CAP and LSM.
