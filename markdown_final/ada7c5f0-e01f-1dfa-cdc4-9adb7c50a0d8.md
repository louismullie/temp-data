## Question

70 year old patient with intermediate CML what is the primary treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best primary treatment for a 70-year-old with intermediate-risk chronic-phase CML. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the disease phase and risk stratification. Then, I should verify how age and comorbidities modify first-line TKI selection. Next, I will weigh the trade-offs between second-generation TKIs and imatinib in older adults. After that, I should consider dosing strategies and special situations like lower-dose dasatinib. Finally, I will outline monitoring, milestones, and contingency plans if responses are suboptimal, anchoring to NCCN and ELN guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: at age 70, most patients present in chronic phase, and "intermediate CML" implies intermediate risk by Sokal, Hasford/Euro, or ELTS, which should be calculated explicitly before choosing therapy because it informs progression risk and TKI selection, with ELTS particularly predictive of CML-specific mortality on imatinib [^1118Nxm2] [^111yyrAz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using a second-generation TKI by default; I need to check how age and comorbidities shift the balance. NCCN notes that imatinib may be preferred in older patients or those with cardiovascular comorbidities because of a more favorable toxicity profile, even though 2G TKIs and asciminib achieve faster and deeper responses and reduce progression compared with imatinib, without a proven overall survival advantage in randomized trials [^116h2tBX] [^1136izgD] [^113Y3w23].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit with 2G TKIs in intermediate-risk disease: randomized data show higher 12-month MMR and deeper molecular responses with dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib, and asciminib achieved higher MMR than imatinib in ASC4FIRST, supporting preference for 2G TKIs or asciminib in intermediate/high-risk patients when toxicity is acceptable [^1136izgD] [^116rrL1P].

> But wait, what if the patient has cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or is on multiple medications with interaction potential? In that scenario, imatinib's cleaner cardiovascular and interaction profile becomes compelling, and real-world data in older adults show excellent outcomes with imatinib-based strategies and selective switching, reinforcing that imatinib remains a strong first-line choice when comorbidity or frailty is a concern [^116h2tBX] [^111V74UV].

> Let me consider dosing pragmatics for an older adult; I initially thought "standard-dose dasatinib 100 mg daily" would be reasonable, but wait, I should verify age-adjusted options. NCCN highlights that dasatinib 20 mg daily can be an appropriate starting dose in patients 65 years and older, with 50 mg daily also showing efficacy in low/intermediate-risk disease, so starting low and titrating based on response and tolerability is sensible in a 70-year-old to mitigate pleural effusions, bleeding, and cytopenias [^112zptNU] [^114HZi4S].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit: qPCR on the International Scale at diagnosis, then every 3 months until MMR, then every 3–6 months indefinitely, with cytogenetics if molecular milestones are not met; failure to achieve BCR-ABL1 IS ≤ 10% at 3 months, ≤ 1% at 6 months, or ≤ 0.1% at 12 months should trigger reassessment of adherence, drug interactions, and consideration of switching TKI or mutation testing, though in older adults a more conservative approach may be justified if the absolute risk of progression remains low and toxicity would offset benefit [^112zptNU] [^1156LemW].

> Next, I should review contingency planning: if there is true imatinib resistance or intolerance, switching to a 2G TKI or asciminib is appropriate; if there is T315I or failure of two TKIs, ponatinib or asciminib are indicated; and if there is progression to accelerated or blast phase, evaluation for allogeneic transplant and clinical trials should be pursued, recognizing that most 70-year-olds will be evaluated case-by-case for transplant candidacy based on fitness and donor availability [^115iYCUz] [^116R4cQ4].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to individualize: if the 70-year-old is fit, without significant cardiovascular disease, and values faster deep responses with potential future discontinuation, a 2G TKI such as dasatinib 20–50 mg daily, bosutinib, nilotinib, or asciminib is preferred; if there are cardiovascular comorbidities, polypharmacy, or the patient prioritizes tolerability and cost, imatinib 400 mg daily is an excellent choice with close monitoring and a low threshold to switch if milestones are not met [^1136izgD] [^116h2tBX] [^112zptNU].

---

For a 70-year-old with intermediate-risk chronic-phase CML, **second-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or asciminib are preferred** [^1136izgD] because they achieve faster and deeper molecular responses and reduce progression risk compared with imatinib [^113Y3w23] [^116rrL1P]. Imatinib is a reasonable alternative if comorbidities (especially cardiovascular disease) [^116h2tBX], drug interactions, or patient preference favor it [^111xjvE2]. Therapy should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, toxicity profiles, and patient goals, with close molecular monitoring to guide adjustments [^115bsy7J] [^111BpN5g].

---

## Recommended first-line treatment options

According to the NCCN Guidelines (v2.2024), **preferred first-line options** for intermediate-risk CP-CML include:

- **Second-generation TKIs (2G TKIs)**: dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib [^1136izgD].
- **Allosteric TKI**: asciminib (STAMP inhibitor) [^116rrL1P].

These agents are preferred because they achieve **faster and deeper molecular responses** [^1136izgD] and reduce the risk of progression to advanced-phase CML compared with imatinib [^113Y3w23].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting second-generation TKIs

Randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up studies demonstrate that 2G TKIs achieve **higher rates of major molecular response (MMR)** and deep molecular response (DMR) than imatinib, translating into lower progression risk [^1136izgD] [^113Y3w23]. However, overall survival is similar across TKIs due to effective salvage therapies [^113Y3w23].

---

## Considerations for a 70-year-old patient

In older adults, **treatment selection must balance efficacy with tolerability and comorbidities** [^115bsy7J]:

- **Cardiovascular comorbidities**: Nilotinib and dasatinib carry cardiovascular risks (QT prolongation, ischemia, pleural effusions) [^notfound]; imatinib or asciminib may be safer in patients with significant cardiovascular disease [^116h2tBX].
- **Pulmonary comorbidities**: Dasatinib-associated pleural effusions may be problematic; consider alternatives if significant lung disease is present.
- **Hepatic comorbidities**: Nilotinib requires cautious use in hepatic impairment; monitor liver function closely.
- **Drug interactions**: Nilotinib and bosutinib have CYP3A4 interactions; review concomitant medications carefully [^notfound].

---

## Role of imatinib in older patients

Imatinib remains a **reasonable first-line option** for older adults, particularly with comorbidities or when a gentler toxicity profile is desired [^116h2tBX]. It is effective, well tolerated, and supported by long-term data showing durable responses and near-normal life expectancy [^112HPui4] [^116ERrpb]. However, it may be slower to achieve deep molecular responses, which can limit eligibility for treatment-free remission (TFR) strategies [^1136izgD].

---

## Monitoring and response milestones

Regardless of the chosen TKI, **close molecular monitoring is essential**:

- **Baseline**: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) to establish BCR-ABL1 transcript levels.
- **Every 3 months**: Until MMR is achieved.
- **Every 6 months**: Once MMR is stable.

Key milestones include **BCR-ABL1 ≤ 10% at 3 months**, **≤ 1% at 6 months**, and **≤ 0.1% (MMR) at 12 months** [^1127jU3d]. Failure to meet these milestones should prompt reassessment of adherence, drug interactions, and consideration of switching therapy [^111BpN5g].

---

## Treatment discontinuation and treatment-free remission

TFR is a realistic goal for select patients who achieve and maintain **deep molecular response (DMR)** for at least 2 years [^notfound]. TFR is more likely with 2G TKIs or asciminib due to faster DMR kinetics, but older patients should be counseled on the risks and benefits, as relapse can occur and monitoring must remain vigilant [^1136izgD] [^114iFyrd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Rationale** | **Considerations for 70-year-old** |
|-|-|-|
| Dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib | Faster, deeper responses; lower progression risk | - Cardiovascular risks <br/> - Pleural effusions <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - Drug interactions |
| Asciminib | Novel mechanism; favorable toxicity profile | Limited long-term data; consider if 2G TKIs contraindicated |
| Imatinib | Well tolerated; extensive long-term data | Slower DMR; consider if comorbidities or interactions |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 70-year-old with intermediate-risk CP-CML, **2G TKIs or asciminib are preferred** for their superior molecular responses and lower progression risk [^1136izgD]. Imatinib is a valid alternative if comorbidities, interactions, or patient preference favor it [^116h2tBX]. Therapy should be individualized, with close molecular monitoring and proactive management of adverse effects to optimize outcomes and quality of life [^115bsy7J] [^1169ZGvy].

The development of BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over the past 20 years has dramatically improved the outcomes for patients with every stage of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Clinicians now have access to 5 oral, generally well-tolerated, and highly effective TKIs. How should these agents be used for an individual patient to ensure the best possible duration and quality-of-life, to avoid treatment-related complications, and potentially to achieve a cure at an affordable cost? Because CML patients may need to continue TKI therapy indefinitely, the long-term safety of each treatment option must be considered. Evidence-based care requires an understanding of the optimal use of these drugs, their specific early and late toxicities, the prognostic significance of achieving treatment milestones, and the critical importance of molecular monitoring. Efficacy is important, but treatment choice does not depend only on efficacy. Choosing among various treatment options is informed by understanding the distinct benefits and risks of each agent, along with careful consideration of patient-specific factors, such as risk status, age, and comorbidities.

### How I individualize treatment for chronic-phase CML [^116xJL32]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has served as a paradigm for the development of effective initial and next-generation targeted therapies. The availability of five effective and generally well-tolerated BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML offers patients and their treating physicians a welcome luxury of choice. The long-term outlook for newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients is excellent, with expected survival similar to age-matched controls. However, most patients are expected to require lifelong treatment. As a result, important considerations when choosing frontline treatment include not only treatment efficacy, but also response durability, tolerability, maximizing quality of life, avoidance of serious and irreversible toxicities, the ease of treatment administration and increasingly, the cost of treatment to the patient as well as to society.

What is the appropriate goal of CML therapy?

The optimal goal of CML therapy is cure resulting in normal sex- and age-adjusted survival with a normal quality-of-life (QoL). Unfortunately, cure is achieved in few people with CML. An intermediate goal is achieving near normal age- and sex-matched adjusted survival off tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKIs)-therapy referred to as therapy-free remission (TFR).

### Tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukaemia: which, when, for whom? [^116EszHE]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic armamentarium for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) comprises mainly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with several agents available for frontline treatment, or for the treatment of disease resistance or intolerance to the first-choice or second-choice drug. The availability of different drugs is a major achievement, but means that choices must be made - which can be difficult and questionable at times. The most important end point considered in decision-making regarding treatment for any cancer is overall survival, but additional factors (such as age, prognostic category, safety, or the possibility of achieving treatment-free remission) should be considered when selecting an agent for frontline treatment. Regardless of the TKI selected for first-line treatment, guidelines that define the importance of reaching specific response indicators and procedures for vigilant follow-up monitoring are established to ensure timely implementation of second-line TKIs. Herein, we discuss the benefits and risks of the different TKIs available for the treatment of patients with CML, and how to decide when to employ these agents at different treatment settings.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^115TRHcM]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

In this 5th version of the European LeukemiaNet guidance for adult patients, there are important changes in several areas of management based on evidence available since 2020, including the World Health Organisation's reclassification of CML as a biphasic disease. Previous advice to switch the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) on failure of molecular milestones, is modified to better account for individual patient circumstances. Our recommendations are summarized in tables designed to be read in conjunction with the text which offers justification and additional advice. We describe decision-making for first-line treatment, both in available drugs and their initial dosing. Similarly we elaborate on dose reduction rather than drug switching to manage toxicities and discuss treatment sequencing. Data have matured for the outcome of treatment discontinuation and for management of parenting for both men and women. We acknowledge that most patients will remain on treatment for many years and emphasize the needs to minimize side effects, manage co-morbidities and optimize quality of life. Recent advances in allogeneic stem cell transplantation have broadened access to alternative donors, and lessened limitations of age and co-morbidities such that transplant remains a valuable option for patients for whom long-term disease control is not achieved through TKI therapy.

### Update on current monitoring recommendations in chronic myeloid leukemia: practical points for clinical practice [^1169ZGvy]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Excellent therapeutic options exist for the treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Therefore, managing CML patients has become a more common practice for many physicians. Most chronic-phase CML patients achieve durable cytogenetic and molecular responses on first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, careful monitoring and assessment of adherence are essential for successful outcomes and to identify patients at risk for failing therapy. The European LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide guidance and strategies for monitoring and managing patients treated with TKIs. These recommendations continue to evolve as approved treatment options expand to include second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. How measurements of response are defined and data supporting recent recommended changes to monitoring are reviewed here. These changes include increasing recognition of the importance of early response. The relevance of achieving deep molecular responses will also be addressed.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia: what is the best strategy to start and monitor treatment outside academic centers? [^1111b6uv]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has dramatically changed the outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Over the last decade, imatinib positioned itself as the gold standard of care, until second-generation TKIs were introduced as first-line treatment. Multiple therapeutic options available today in CML make the decision of the first-line therapy a difficult choice. However, a gap still exists, in the management of CML outside academic centers. Important advances in molecular monitoring have been developed worldwide; nevertheless, monitoring in the "real world" continues to be a challenge in part because international scale (IS) standardized laboratories are not available worldwide, and also because physicians still have some resource barriers and lack of familiarity restricting guideline adoption and consider optimal molecular monitoring a challenge. This review addresses CML first-line treatment, monitoring aspects and giving practical advice, identifying prognostic factors, and guiding management of CML for non-academic centers.

### Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia as a paradigm for solid tumors: how targeted agents in newly diagnosed disease transformed outcomes… [^114mYeXG]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract Overview: Although chronic myelogenous leukemia is rare, with approximately 5000 new cases in the United States annually, it may be the poster child for the future of oncology. Imatinib mesylate, a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, transformed the course of CML from a rapidly fatal disease to a functionally curable, indolent disease with an estimated median survival of more than 25 years. This transformation can be attributed to several key factors: the identification of a causal and actionable molecular aberration. BCR-ABL; the development of a potent and selective Bcr-Abl TKI — imatinib; and, importantly the application of imatinib in the earliest phase of CML. In contrast, imatinib, if used in CML blastic phase, improves median survival to only about 1 year.

In contrast, when treating the earliest phases of CML with a therapy — imatinib — specific for the critical genetic abnormality, the cumulative complete cytogenetic response rate was greater than 80%, and the estimated 10-year survival increased from less than 20% to 85% or more. Indeed, at present, the estimated median survival of patients with CML exceeds 25 years. 3–7Because the median age of patients with CML at the time of diagnosis is nearly 60 years, it is now estimated that most patients with CML have a normal life expectancy if treated appropriately with Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These patients are therefore "functionally cured". Imatinib changed the course of CML from a previously fatal disease to a functionally and molecularly curable disorder.

Patients diagnosed with chronic-phase CML today may be reassured, with our current knowledge, that most can expect to live decades and will likely die with, and not of, CML — provided they comply with TKI therapy, there is a reasonable observation for progression of the disease, and an appropriate change is made to second- and third-generation TKIs if disease resistance evolves. The experience with nilotinib indicated that despite the long half-life of the drug, gastrointestinal absorption plateaued at a dose of 400 mg, resulting in schedules of 400 mg orally twice daily, implemented into phase II studies in late chronic-phase CML.

### CML and the WHO: why? [^1156ULCe]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

With TKI therapy and careful disease monitoring, the incidence of progression to advanced phase disease has decreased, and the 10-year overall survival rate for CML is 80%-90%. The designation of AP has thus become less relevant, where resistance stemming from ABL1 kinase mutations and/or additional cytogenetic abnormalities and the development of BP represent key disease attributes. Accordingly, AP is omitted in the current classification in favor of an emphasis on high-risk features associated with CP progression and resistance to TKIs". Modifying the criteria for AP does not pose a problem; in fact it is expected when new therapies are introduced that transform the landscape as dramatically as imatinib did for CML. However, as practicing oncologists who see patients with CML, we have to consider the clinical utility of the term AP and whether deleting it from the current WHO classification solves or creates a problem.

Imatinib shifted the treatment paradigm, produced previously inconceivable responses that expanded our CML lexicon, and led to a completely new set of response criteria such as major molecular response, deep molecular response, and treatment-free remission. From the formal definition of these response criteria, identification of new risk factors emerged such as lack of early molecular response after 3 months of TKI therapy and loss of molecular response at any time, which have proven to be extremely useful to the clinician. For example, a patient in AP at diagnosis should be started on therapy with a second-generation TKI rather than imatinib, and the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dose for this phase is different than the CP dose for some of the TKIs. A different scenario is the patient who is already on a second. -generation TKI but progresses to AP; this patient should be given ponatinib or asciminib. In this instance, stem-cell transplantation could also be considered.

Why is the substitution — high-risk features associated with CP progression and resistance to TKI therapy — considered an improvement. Specific words are indispensable tools for both the patient and the clinician: They are terms that are easily communicated and understood. Treatment options for which clinical trial data are available include dasatinib 140 mg, nilotinib 400 mg, bosutinib 500 mg, and imatinib 600 mg. Under the new WHO criteria, the patient would be considered to have CP CML, and the doses of all of the TKIs for historically defined CP CML would be less.

Management of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) — first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy: Long-term efficacy data from randomized phase III studies indicate that all TKIs are highly effective as primary treatment with long-term overall survival (OS) expected to be similar to that of age-matched controls, while 2G TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib) and asciminib generally result in faster cytogenetic and molecular responses with less progression to advanced phase CML compared to imatinib; as of yet, randomized trials show no significant differences in OS between imatinib and a 2G TKI or asciminib.

Primary treatment of newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) is summarized from randomized phase III data: "all TKIs are highly effective as primary treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML, with long-term OS expected to be similar to that of aged-matched controls; 2) 2G TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) and allosteric TKI (asciminib; STAMP [specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket] inhibitor), generally result in faster cytogenetic and molecular responses, with less progression to advanced phase CML, compared to imatinib; and 3) in randomized clinical trials, as of yet, there are no significant differences in OS between imatinib and a 2G TKI or asciminib". Regarding generics, "Generic versions have been shown to be noninferior to innovator drugs in terms of efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile", thus "FDA-approved generic versions are appropriate substitutes for innovator drugs", and "Innovator and generic drugs approved by the regulatory authorities based on pharmacokinetic equivalence can be used interchangeably".

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) subgroup and toxicity considerations — 2G TKIs and asciminib should also be considered for specific subgroups based on treatment goals and benefit/risks, including younger patients interested in ultimately discontinuing treatment and particularly young patients assigned female at birth aiming for a deep and rapid molecular response to allow eventual TKI discontinuation for family planning. Imatinib may be preferred for older patients with comorbidities, especially cardiovascular comorbidities. All the TKIs are generally well tolerated, and differences in potential toxicity profiles may inform initial agent selection.

### 2025 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia [^114WTNZ7]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and other national and international groups have agreed on common definitions and standards for cooperative research, and guided management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) worldwide for almost three decades (NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025: chronic myeloid leukemia). Hitherto the emphasis has been on preventing progression to the blast phase (BP) and prolonging survival, a strategy that has de facto led to some patients having sufficiently deep molecular responses to trial discontinuation of treatment. While maximizing the number of patients who may achieve treatment free remission (TFR) is a laudable goal, we also recognize that many patients will remain on life-long medication and for them, optimizing both their response and their quality of life is paramount. In this, the 5th iteration of the ELN recommendations for management of CML, we will highlight new information that directly affects patient care and move towards even more personalized treatment. Our recommendations are for adults only; guidelines for the management of pediatric patients have been published recently.

Our intention is not to repeat in detail previously available information and recommendations that are largely unchanged. Instead we will focus on the results and interpretation of new evidence-based data that are ready to be incorporated into patient care. References will be largely limited to those published since March 2020.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1118Nxm2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t9;22] that gives rise to a BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. CML occurs in 3 different phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast phase) and is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase in developed countries. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is a highly effective treatment option for patients with chronic phase-CML. The primary goal of TKI therapy in patients with chronic phase-CML is to prevent disease progression to accelerated phase-CML or blast phase-CML. Discontinuation of TKI therapy with careful monitoring is feasible in selected patients. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic phase-CML.

What is the true incidence of resistance to optimal frontline TKI therapy?

It is often stated that the incidence of primary resistance to frontline TKI therapy is 10%, and of secondary resistance 30%. This may have been true in the original TKI studies, with the suboptimal use of imatinib, and may depend on the definition of resistance. True resistance to frontline therapy may be significantly lower. In the German CML IV trial of 1551 patients treated in chronic phase (CP) with imatinib-based regimens, with a median follow-up time of 10 years, the 10-year OS rate was 82%, the relative survival rate 92%, and the cumulative incidence of blast phase (BP) only 5.8%. Only 26.5% of patients switched from imatinib to second-generation TKIs, 10% because of resistance, the others for toxicities and/or other reasons. In our experience with frontline lower-dose dasatinib therapy (50 mg daily), with a median follow-up of 5 years, the incidence of true primary plus secondary resistance (defined as BCR::ABL1 transcripts [IS] > 1% any time after 12 months of therapy) was < 5%. The estimated 5-year OS rate was 98%, with only two deaths (not related to CML) and no transformation events to accelerated phase (AP) or BP. Similar results were reported in the randomized trial of dasatinib 100 mg daily versus imatinib in frontline CML therapy. In our long-term frontline TKI therapy experience, the estimated 15-year OS rate (including any death, regardless of cause) is about 75%. The CML-specific survival rate (considering only deaths from CML or treatment complications) is > 90%. Thus, frontline therapy with the existing TKIs achieves the primary endpoint of survival normalization for most patients with CML.

### First-generation vs second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors: which is best at diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia? [^115GVVET]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2020, for the great majority of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), life expectancy is unaffected by a diagnosis of CML because of the unparalleled efficacy of ABL-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in halting disease progression. A wealth of choices exist for first-line treatment selection, including the first-generation TKI imatinib and the second-generation TKIs bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. How I select first-line therapy between first-generation and second-generation TKIs is discussed in the context of patient-specific CML disease risk, therapy-related risks, and treatment goals. Although rare, identifying patients with CML at higher risk for disease progression or resistance is important and influences first-line TKI selection. I review the impact of first-generation vs second-generation TKI selection on treatment response and outcomes; the ability to achieve, as well as the timing of, treatment-free remission; and the impact of specific TKIs on longer-term health.

Introduction

Today, we celebrate two decades of experience with imatinib and later-generation BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). With maturing data, it is important to review our established guidelines on treatment options in frontline and subsequent-line CML therapy, treatment aims, response monitoring, and the significance of the response milestones proposed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). In this review, we discuss these issues to clarify questions about the management of CML in frontline and post-frontline TKI failure settings.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^1175SdcC]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyurea is used primarily to stabilize patients with hyperleukocytosis or as palliative therapy for patients who have not responded to other therapies. Treatment of Chronic-Phase CML Treatment Options for Chronic-Phase CML Treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia include:

- Targeted therapy with an allosteric inhibitor of BCR: :ABL1 at the ABL1 myristoyl pocket.
- Targeted therapy with other BCR: :ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- Allogeneic bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant. The preferred initial treatment for patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML could be any of the specific inhibitors of the BCR: :ABL1 tyrosine kinase. With any of these agents, the 10-year event-free survival and overall survival rates exceed 90%.

In the first year, it appears that the efficacy of asciminib is equivalent to those of second-generation TKIs. Longer follow-up is required to fully assess efficacy and toxicity outcomes.
- With a median follow-up of 16. 3 months, the 48-week MMR rate was
67. 7% for patients who received asciminib and 49% for patients who received imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib (. Allogeneic BMT or SCT Allogeneic BMT or SCT is the only consistently successful curative treatment for patients with CML. Patients younger than 60 years with an identical twin or with HLA–matched siblings can consider BMT early in the chronic phase. Although the procedure is associated with considerable acute morbidity and mortality, 50% to 70% of patients who undergo transplant in the chronic phase appear to be cured.
- In a prospective trial of 354 patients younger than 60 years, 123 of 135 patients with a matched, related donor underwent early allogeneic SCT while the others received interferon-based therapy and imatinib at relapse. Some patients also underwent a matched unrelated-donor SCT in remission.

### Update: chronic myelogenous leukemia clinical practice guidelines [^116j1PEJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Although meetings to update the specific NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology generally occur only once a year, the panel on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) met shortly after devising the original guideline. The reason was the incorporation of the then recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571, or imatinib mesylate, into the guidelines. The treatment of CML has been radically altered by the introduction of imatinib. However, important questions still have not been answered. For example, which patients may be cured with imatinib and which patients should still be offered transplant early in the course of their disease?

### Challenges in management of older patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [^116FqVWH]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2024). Medium credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved the survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), however, older patients are often underrepresented in pivotal trials. Approximately 20% of older adults never start treatment and face significant barriers to accomplish favorable outcomes. The treatment goal is to improve survival, prevent progression, and preserve quality of life. This is achieved through optimizing TKI doses and employing discontinuation strategies to attain treatment-free remission (TFR), a goal increasingly pursued by older patients. Imatinib may be favored as the front-line option for older individuals due to its side effect profile and cost. Bosutinib's favorable cardiovascular tolerability makes it a suitable second-line agent, but lower-dose dasatinib may likewise be an attractive option. The prevalence of comorbidities can preclude the use of second generation TKIs in some older patients. Optimal care for older patients with CML centers on personalized treatment, close monitoring, and proactive support.

### European LeukemiaNet 2020 recommendations for treating chronic myeloid leukemia [^111BpN5g]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic landscape of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has profoundly changed over the past 7 years. Most patients with chronic phase (CP) now have a normal life expectancy. Another goal is achieving a stable deep molecular response (DMR) and discontinuing medication for treatment-free remission (TFR). The European LeukemiaNet convened an expert panel to critically evaluate and update the evidence to achieve these goals since its previous recommendations. First-line treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; imatinib brand or generic, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are available first-line). Generic imatinib is the cost-effective initial treatment in CP. Various contraindications and side-effects of all TKIs should be considered. Patient risk status at diagnosis should be assessed with the new EUTOS long-term survival (ELTS)-score. Monitoring of response should be done by quantitative polymerase chain reaction whenever possible. A change of treatment is recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or when molecular milestones are not reached. Greater than 10% BCR-ABL1 at 3 months indicates treatment failure when confirmed. Allogeneic transplantation continues to be a therapeutic option particularly for advanced phase CML. TKI treatment should be withheld during pregnancy. Treatment discontinuation may be considered in patients with durable DMR with the goal of achieving TFR.

### Tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia [^111YUDha]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder that accounts for approximately 10% of new cases of leukemia. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to a reduction in mortalities. Thus, the estimated prevalence of CML is increasing. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Leukemia Net guidelines incorporate frequent molecular monitoring of the fusion BCR-ABL transcript to ensure that patients reach and keep treatment milestones. Most patients with CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase, and approximately 10% to 30% of these patients will at some time in their course meet definition criteria of resistance to imatinib.

NCCN Chronic Myeloid Leukemia — discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy general considerations — discontinuation of TKI therapy appears to be safe in select patients with CML, and clinicians should consult with a CML specialist to review appropriateness and risks, with discontinuation performed only in patients who give consent after discussion of risks and benefits. Consultation with an NCCN Panel Member or center of expertise is recommended for any significant adverse event related to treatment discontinuation, if there is progression to AP-CML or BP-CML at any time, or when MMR is not regained after 3 months following treatment reinitiation. Outside of a clinical trial, discontinuation of TKI therapy should be considered only if all of the criteria included in the list below are met, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112n3fek]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) management of intolerance and primary resistance — Switching to an alternate tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) because of intolerance is appropriate for patients with disease responding to TKI therapy and it might be beneficial for selected patients with acute grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicities or for those with chronic, low-grade nonhematologic toxicities that are not manageable with adequate supportive care; Asciminib and ponatinib are appropriate treatment options for CP-CML with intolerance to prior 2G TKIs. In a significant proportion of patients with TKI-induced toxicities, responses have been observed with doses well below their determined maximum tolerated doses, and short interruptions or dose reductions, when medically necessary, may not have a negative impact on disease control or other outcomes. Aberrant expressions of drug transporters and plasma protein binding of TKI could contribute to primary resistance by altering the intracellular and plasma concentration of TKI.

### Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia: approach to patients with treatment-naive or refractory chronic-phase disease [^116wQ31r]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

The 21st century ushered in the dawn of a new era of targeted therapeutics and a dramatic shift in the management of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients. Groundbreaking scientific and translational studies have led to the rapid development and approval of several effective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In the United States, there are currently 3 approved BCR-ABL TKIs for newly diagnosed CP-CML patients. It is anticipated that clinical outcomes will continue to improve as more TKIs that address unmet medical needs are approved. However, to achieve this goal, it is critical to carefully monitor and optimally manage patients. To this end, the latest seminal clinical trial results of approved and investigational BCR-ABL TKIs and some of the salient unique features of each of these agents are summarized herein.

### Expert opinion-management of chronic myeloid leukemia after resistance to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^116APsSz]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Regardless of line of therapy, treatment goals in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are: avoid progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis CML such that patients achieve a life expectancy comparable with that of the general population; avoid adverse events (AEs); and restore and maintain quality of life. The most important prognostic factor for achieving these goals is response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at key milestones. For patients failing a TKI, a treatment change is mandatory to limit the risk of progression and death. There is currently no precise guideline for patients that fail a second-generation TKI, and there is a paucity of data to guide clinical decision making in this setting. There is, therefore, an unmet need for practical and actionable guidance on how to manage patients who fail a second-generation TKI. Although the term 'failure' includes patients failing for resistance or intolerance, the focus of this paper is failure of a second-generation TKI because of resistance. CML patients who fail their first second-generation TKI for true resistance need a more potent therapy. In these patients, the key issues to consider are the relative appropriateness of early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or the use of a further TKI. Selection of the next line of treatment after second-generation TKI resistance should be individualized and must be based on patient-specific factors including cytogenetics, mutation profile, comorbidities, age, previous history of AEs with prior TKI therapy, and risk profile for AEs on specific TKIs. This expert opinion paper is not in conflict with existing recommendations, but instead represents an evolution of previous notions, based on new data, insights, and clinical experience. We review the treatment options for patients resistant to second-generation TKI therapy and provide our clinical opinions and guidance on key considerations for treatment decision making.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — additional management considerations include referral and testing options and specific situations: Consider referral to a specialized CML center and/or enrollment in a clinical trial. Switching to an alternate TKI for intolerance is appropriate for patients with disease responding to TKI therapy. Consider myeloid mutation panel to identify BCR::ABL1–independent resistance mutations in patients with no BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutations. Switching from imatinib to a 2G TKI or allosteric TKI may improve response, and the side effect profile of alternative TKIs may differ. Discontinuation of TKI with careful monitoring is feasible in selected patients. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era: what is the best therapy? [^116pAWkX]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg/d, is considered standard therapy for managing patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, yielding high rates of cytogenetic responses that translate into favorable long-term outcomes. However, some patients do not achieve adequate levels of response, lose a previously acquired response, or are forced to discontinue imatinib therapy because of safety reasons. To avoid these outcomes, several approaches are being tested in the frontline setting, including the use of higher imatinib doses or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib, the latter of which is approved only for managing patients who have imatinib therapy failure. Newer multikinase inhibitors active against multiple ABL1 mutations are also under development for patients in any CML phase who have therapy failure on sequential imatinib and a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor or carry the highly resistant T315I mutation and are not candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Some of these approaches are expected to improve the outcomes of patients with CML.

### Long-term outcome of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia: a randomized comparison of stem cell transplantation with drug treatment [^114Qv6QY]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent today's treatment of choice in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is regarded as salvage therapy. This prospective randomized CML-study IIIA recruited 669 patients with newly diagnosed CML between July 1997 and January 2004 from 143 centers. Of these, 427 patients were considered eligible for HSCT and were randomized by availability of a matched family donor between primary HSCT (group A; N = 166 patients) and best available drug treatment (group B; N = 261). Primary end point was long-term survival. Survival probabilities were not different between groups A and B (10-year survival: 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69–0.82) vs 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61–0.76)), but influenced by disease and transplant risk. Patients with a low transplant risk showed superior survival compared with patients with high- (P < 0.001) and non-high-risk disease (P = 0.047) in group B; after entering blast crisis, survival was not different with or without HSCT. Significantly more patients in group A were in molecular remission (56% vs 39%; P = 0.005) and free of drug treatment (56% vs 6%; P < 0.001). Differences in symptoms and Karnofsky score were not significant. In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, HSCT remains a valid option when both disease and transplant risk are considered.

### Practical monitoring of chronic myelogenous leukemia: when to change treatment [^114Mffo7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated at diagnosis with the standard therapy consisting of imatinib, 400 mg once daily, the failure to achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months from the start of therapy has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of progression and an overall inferior survival. Experts of the European LeukemiaNet and NCCN have indicated what degrees of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses should be expected at definite time points for patients with CML to have the highest probability of experiencing the final optimal response, defined as the achievement of at least a complete hematologic response with a minor cytogenetic response after 3 months; at least a partial cytogenetic response after 6 months; at least a CCyR after 12 months; and a major molecular response after 18 months of therapy. The last opportunity for a CCyR has been established at 18 months. Because the residual probability of attaining a CCyR is reduced for patients who do not experience a complete hematologic response by 3 months, any cytogenetic response by 6 months, or a major cytogenetic response by 12 months, these conditions are considered treatment failures. At this point, a change in therapy is highly recommended, such as second-line treatment with the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib or dasatinib and, in specific situations, a stem cell transplant. The loss of any grade of previously achieved cytogenetic response at any time point is also considered an imatinib failure demanding a change of therapy. Finally, intermediate gradations of response exist between optimal response and failure in which, although not totally compromised, the possibilities of achieving an optimal response later are decreased. The best therapeutic strategies to be followed in these intermediate situations, called suboptimal responses, have not been clearly established and are still under clinical investigation, but for the moment, a change of therapy is not required.

Most studies of CML therapy including transplants are in resource-rich geospaces where median age at diagnosis is about 60 years. However, in some Asian and African countries median age at diagnosis is < 50 years. In an international review of > 40,000 subjects with newly diagnosed CML, the rate of adults < 50 years old in Asia and Africa was about 70% compared with 35% in Europe, increasing the proportion of persons with CML who might be considered for a transplant.

### European LeukemiaNet 2020 recommendations for treating chronic myeloid leukemia [^116h2P9w]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The ELN panel for recommendations in CML comprises 34 experts from Europe, America, and the Asian-Pacific areas. The panel met six times at international meetings of the American Society of Hematology (2015, 2016), the European School of Hematology (2017), the ELN (2019), the European Investigators on CML (2019), and the European School of Hematology/International CML Foundation (2019). Five sets of key questions were submitted to panel members to complement the meetings. Discordant opinions were harmonized by email discussions, and a consensus of 75–100% was reached in most, but not all instances. Unresolved controversies are described in the discussion section. The costs of the meetings and the preparation of the interim and final reports were born entirely by ELN, a research network of excellence initiated by the European Union, now funded by donations and projects of ELN participants. There was no financial support from industry for any activity. Treatment recommendations are limited to the TKIs that have been approved with at least one indication in CML, either by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) or/and by the European Medicine Agency (EMA). The drugs are listed in the order of FDA approval. The panel acknowledges that not all drugs may be available worldwide and that the high price of some makes access to these drugs problematic in some countries.

Relevant papers published after the third version of the ELN recommendations in 2013 were identified through the PubMed database and were critically reviewed. With few exceptions, only papers published after 2013 are cited here. The panel also reviewed and utilized as appropriate abstracts presented at the recent meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Hematology Association and the American Society of Hematology.

The definitions of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses were maintained from previous versions.

### Drug treatment is superior to allografting as first-line therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia [^1123oKc5]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed as primary treatment modality for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This concept has been challenged by transplantation mortality and improved drug therapy. In a randomized study, primary HSCT and best available drug treatment (IFN based) were compared in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients. Assignment to treatment strategy was by genetic randomization according to availability of a matched related donor. Evaluation followed the intention-to-treat principle. Six hundred and twenty one patients with chronic phase CML were stratified for eligibility for HSCT. Three hundred and fifty four patients (62% male; median age, 40 years; range, 11–59 years) were eligible and randomized. One hundred and thirty five patients (38%) had a matched related donor, of whom 123 (91%) received a transplant within a median of 10 months (range, 2–106 months) from diagnosis. Two hundred and nineteen patients (62%) had no related donor and received best available drug treatment. With an observation time up to 11.2 years (median, 8.9 years), survival was superior for patients with drug treatment (P = 0.049), superiority being most pronounced in low-risk patients (P = 0.032). The general recommendation of HSCT as first-line treatment option in chronic phase CML can no longer be maintained. It should be replaced by a trial with modern drug treatment first.

Results

We identified 1192 patients with newly diagnosed CML who received TKIs and met our selection criteria (Figure 1). The majority of patients were female (52.3%) and non-Hispanic White (81.5%), with a median age at diagnosis of 74 years (IQR, 70–80 years). The median time from diagnosis to TKI initiation was 42 days (IQR: 27–72 days), with 973 patients (81.6%) initiating TKI within 90 days of diagnosis. During the first year after TKI initiation, among 748 patients starting frontline imatinib, 17.8% switched to a second generation TKI; furthermore, among 444 patients starting a frontline second generation TKI, 137 (30.9%) received a subsequent TKI, with 89 (65.0%) switching to imatinib.

### Monitoring chronic myelogenous leukemia in the age of tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^117JBNB1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now standard up-front therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML treated with the TKI imatinib mesylate typically experience a complete cytogenetic remission. Outcomes for patients with advanced-phase disease are distinctly worse. Unfortunately, a small proportion of chronic-phase patients experience relapse during this therapy, and most with advanced-phase disease develop resistance to imatinib mesylate after months of therapy. Hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only curative approach for CML and can salvage patients with advanced-phase disease. Therefore, physicians must carefully monitor patients with chronic-phase CML treated with TKIs so that they can undergo hematopoietic cell transplant (or treatment with another TKI or experimental therapy) before frank progression occurs. Fortunately, monitoring CML using cytogenetic and molecular methods (i.e., quantitative polymerase chain reaction) effectively defines end points that correlate highly with outcome.

Dasatinib — recommended and alternative dosing strategies: The recommended starting dose of dasatinib is 100 mg once daily for patients with CP-CML; a single-arm study (81 evaluable patients) suggests that 50 mg once daily may have similar efficacy in low- or intermediate-risk CP-CML, and 20 mg once daily has been shown to be an appropriate starting dose for patients ≥ 65 years with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Intermittent dosing or dose reduction to 50 mg once daily has been shown effective as second-line and subsequent therapy in CP-CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib. For clinically significant intolerance to dasatinib 100 mg once daily, dasatinib at 50 mg (20 mg with careful monitoring in selected patients) should be considered to avoid serious adverse events necessitating discontinuation.

Summary

Twenty-five years have elapsed since imatinib became widely available to the CML community, over which time we have observed a very remarkable change in patient prognosis, only possible through the work of earlier researchers in the fields of genetics, cytogenetics, biochemistry and molecular biology alongside the efforts of the clinical observationists, triallists and transplant pioneers. We now have several highly effective oral agents with at least three more entering clinical trials this coming year. The additional choice has made excellent clinical outcomes possible for the majority of patients with access to multiple agents but more options can make management decisions more challenging. Since the last version of these recommendations, drug choices are wider and we now have a better understanding, on one hand of the potential for treatment discontinuation and on the other, the impact of co-morbidities and the need to optimize quality of life. In this manuscript we have provided the evidence while emphasizing the need to put the patient at the heart of decision- making. We have made very considerable progress but significant challenges remain, not least of which is the prevention and management of blast phase disease.

However, for much of the world's population, treatment choices are not only dependent on evidence but also on drug availability and cost. In most countries there is today a striking price difference among various BCR::ABL1 TKI. Generic imatinib is usually by far the most cost-effective alternative, the annual price for 400 mg daily being as low as $200 to $500, potentially less than annual monitoring costs. Currently generic dasatinib is more expensive with annual costs varying between $3000 and $100,000. Patented second and third generation TKI are considerably more expensive, with approved first-line drugs at annual price ranges of $20,000 to $300,000, with still no demonstrable survival benefit between imatinib and other TKI. Some second, third and fourth generation drugs may facilitate earlier TFR, be superior for high-risk CML and/or be better tolerated. Whether these suggestions can be confirmed and translated into a clear gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) compared to imatinib within acceptable cost frames requires further investigation. Until that time recommendations such as these provide a framework for management and an evidence-based common-sense approach to patient care.

Second, the lack of a BCR::ABL1 IS < 1% at 12 months has in previous recommendations been defined as 'failure/resistance' with the advice to switch treatment. Two recent studies have challenged this concept, particularly in older patients. In 131 patients with BCR::ABL1 IS > 0.1% after 2 years of TKI therapy, patients with levels > 0.1%–1% or > 1%–10%, had 10-year CML-specific survival rates of > 90%. Patients with levels > 10% had a worse but not very poor outcome with a 10-year survival rate of 80%. Prompted by this observation, landmark survival analyses were performed for 1342 evaluable patients in the German CML IV study, who achieved BCR::ABL1 IS < 0.1%, 0.1%–1%, > 1%–10% or > 10% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Ten-year survivals of patients who would have been termed "treatment failure" because of BCR::ABL1 IS > 10% at 3 and 6 months and/or > 1% at 12 months were approximately 80%, some 10% less than patients with optimal responses. In contrast in patients in whom the RT-qPCR was > 10% at 12 months the OS dropped to 55%. Older patients (defined as > 60 years) understandably had poorer survival than younger patients but were dying largely of non-CML related diseases. These findings need confirmation in other settings but might suggest a more conservative approach in those with co-morbidities (usually the more elderly), whose BCR::ABL1 IS are in the unfavorable categories, but in whom a switch to a drug with more troublesome side effects may cause harm. We are reluctant to recommend different approaches simply because of patient age as management should be individualized and many patients > 60 years will be in good health and without co-morbidities. For these and younger patients who can tolerate more potent drugs without toxicity, and who may be pursuing treatment free remission, a BCR::ABL1 mutation analysis and a switch of TKI remain our recommended approach.

Chronic phase CML — risk stratification — uses Sokal and Hasford (Euro) scoring systems to categorize patients into three risk groups (low, intermediate, high), with Sokal based on age, spleen size, platelet count, and peripheral blood blasts, and Euro including eosinophils and basophils; the European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival (ELTS) score is based on the same variables as the Sokol score and provides the most useful predictor of CML-related death in first-line imatinib, validated in 1120 patients across six clinical trials; older age, higher peripheral blasts, bigger spleen, and low platelet counts were associated with higher probabilities of dying, with intermediate- and high-risk groups worse than low-risk and different from each other; unlike other systems, ELTS focuses on CML-specific overall survival; determination of risk score using Sokal or Euro or ELTS prior to starting TKI therapy is recommended for CP-CML.

### A population-based study of chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib in first line [^111V74UV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment is based on company-sponsored and academic trials testing different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy. These studies included patients selected according to many inclusion-exclusion criteria, particularly age and comorbidities, with specific treatment obligations. In daily clinical practice (real-life), inclusion-exclusion criteria do not exist, and the treatment outcome does not only depend on the choice of first-line TKI but also on second- and third-line TKIs. To investigate in a real-life setting the response and the outcome on first-line imatinib, with switch to second generation TKIs in case of unsatisfying response or intolerance, we analyzed all newly diagnosed patients (N = 236), living in two Italian regions, registered in a prospective study according to population-based criteria and treated front-line with imatinib. A switch from imatinib to second-generation TKIs was reported in 14% of patients for side effects and in 24% for failure or suboptimal response, with an improvement of molecular response in 57% of them. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-related survival (LRS) were 85% and 93%, respectively; the 4-year rates of MR 3.0 and MR 4.0 were 75% and 48%, respectively. Cardiovascular complications were reported in 4% of patients treated with imatinib alone and in 6% of patients receiving nilotinib as second-line. Older age (≥ 70 years) affected OS, but not LRS. These data provide an unbiased reference on the CML management and on the results of TKI treatment in real-life, according to ELN recommendations, using imatinib as first-line treatment and second-generation TKIs as second-line therapy.

Frontline CML therapy

The primary aim of CML therapy is to improve survival so that it matches that of a normal population. A second aim, emphasized in the past decade but that benefits fewer patients, is the achievement of a durable deep molecular response (DMR), which can then allow treatment discontinuation and potentially a treatment-free remission (TFR) status.

Four BCR::ABL1 TKIs are approved for frontline therapy: imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and nilotinib. All four produce near-normal quality of life and life expectancy provided patients comply with the treatment, are monitored optimally with minimal interruptions in therapy, and are managed appropriately at the earliest sign of true treatment resistance. Imatinib is available as a generic drug in the United States (US), and at least one of the 15 available formulations is priced at about $500/year in the US (through Cost Plus Drugs, for example). Imatinib generics are routinely available for $300-$3,000/year in other regions. Dasatinib will be available as a generic formulation in the US by 2024 and can be prescribed elsewhere now. The prices of patented TKIs range from $150,000 to 250,000+/year. Therefore, an important consideration in the frontline CML therapy is the "treatment value" or cost-benefit of a TKI if overall survival (OS) is the treatment endpoint. For this aim, generics provide the best treatment value.

Patients and methods

Study design and treatment strategy have been published previously. In brief, newly diagnosed CML patients in chronic phase (CP) were randomized into a 5-arm study comparing IM400 mg/day vs IM400 mg/day in combination with IFN vs IM400 mg/day in combination with low-dose cytarabine vs IM400 mg/day after IFN-failure vs IM800 mg/day. Recruitment was from July 2002 through March 2012. There was no upper age limit. Exclusion criteria were pretreatment except with hydroxyurea or anagrelide, no consent, pregnancy, participation in another study, second neoplasia and serious illness that made per protocol participation a priori unlikely. Only low- and intermediate-risk patients were randomized to primary IFN and, during a pilot-phase of 3 years, only high-risk patients to IM800 mg/day. After 3 years, recruitment to IM plus cytarabine and IM after IFN-failure was terminated, and the IM800 mg/day arm started to include non-high-risk patients, too. Data lock was on 19 September 2016.

Initial treatment in all study arms except IM-after-IFN-failure was IM400 mg once daily. If no complete hematologic remission was reached after 2 months or no partial cytogenetic remission (PCyR) after 6 months, a dose increase was permitted. If IM-treatment failed, stem-cell transplantation or risk-adapted drug treatment (hydroxyurea, cytarabine, intensive chemotherapy) was recommended - depending on type of mutation and degree of proliferation or progression. After availability, either dasatinib or nilotinib was recommended. Participation of IM-resistant or intolerant patients in the dasatinib and nilotinib phase II studies was permitted. The first patient was switched to 2G-TKI (dasatinib) on 30 March, 2005.

IFN, subcutaneous cytarabine and the full 800 mg/day dose were administered after a 6-week run-in period with IM 400 mg/day to avoid cytopenias. The IM-dose could be reduced according to tolerability.

Initial primary goal of CML-study IV were comparative response probabilities. Long-term primary goal was comparative survival (study protocol in the Supplementary Appendix). The strategy was to give more intensive treatment early since this has improved outcome.

### Optimizing outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: comparative safety profiles of newer agents [^1115Dnpc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Imatinib is broadly used in the frontline treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although long-term safety and efficacy have been established, some patients will not respond to imatinib. Nilotinib and dasatinib successfully recapture responses for most patients with imatinib-refractory or -intolerant disease. These drugs have different safety profiles, which are likely associated with their divergent inhibitory targets. The presence of Bcr-Abl mutations and safety profiles of available therapies in relation to patient history should be considered when choosing a second-line agent. This review evaluates the safety and tolerability of agents approved for CML treatment and briefly discusses newer third-line agents.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selection by risk score: Asciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib are all appropriate options for first-line TKI therapy for patients with CP-CML across all risk scores. For patients with an intermediate- or high-risk Sokal or Euro score, 2G TKIs and asciminib are associated with a lower risk of disease progression than imatinib and are preferred, and 2G TKIs result in quicker molecular responses with higher rates of MMR (≤ 0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) and deep molecular response (DMR) (MR4.0 [≤ 0.01% BCR::ABL1 IS] or MR4.5 [≤ 0.0032% BCR::ABL1 IS]). Asciminib resulted in higher rates of MMR versus imatinib with a significant difference (P < .001) and no statistically significant difference versus 2G TKI, supporting that 2G TKIs and asciminib are preferred for patients with an intermediate-risk or high-risk score. 2G TKIs and asciminib should also be considered for specific subgroups (based on the assessment of patient goals and benefit/risks), for example in younger patients who are interested in ultimately discontinuing treatment, while imatinib may be preferred for older patients with comorbidities, especially cardiovascular comorbidities.

The European Treatment and Outcome Study long-term survival (ELTS) score uses the same variables as Sokal and provides the most useful predictor of CML-related death in patients treated with first-line imatinib, has been validated in a cohort of 1120 patients with CP-CML treated with imatinib in six clinical trials, and higher age, higher peripheral blasts, bigger spleen, and low platelet counts were significantly associated with increased probabilities of dying of CML; unlike other scoring systems, ELTS is focused on CML-specific overall survival (OS). Determination of risk score using either the Sokal or Euro or ELTS scoring systems prior to initiation of TKI therapy is recommended for patients diagnosed with CP-CML.

Disease Overview

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with an annual incidence of two cases/100000. It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults.

Diagnosis

CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22) (q34; q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson murine leukemia (ABL1) gene from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR::ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR::ABL1 oncoprotein.

Frontline Therapy

Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib, are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with second and third-generation TKIs in frontline CML-CP therapy reported significantly deeper and faster responses but had no impact on survival prolongation, likely because of their potent efficacy and the availability of effective TKIs salvage therapies for patients who have a cytogenetic relapse with frontline TKI therapy. All four TKIs are equivalent if the aim of therapy is to improve survival. In younger patients with high-risk disease and in whom the aim of therapy is to induce a treatment-free remission status, second-generation TKIs may be favored.

Salvage Therapy

For CML post-failure on frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third-generation TKIs. Although potent and selective, these TKIs exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities and financial status, disease stage, and BCR::ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I "gatekeeper" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib, asciminib, and olverembatinib. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for patients with CML-CP and failure (due to resistance) of at least two TKIs and for all patients in advanced-phase disease. Older patients who have a cytogenetic relapse post-failure on all TKIs can maintain long-term survival if they continue a daily most effective/least toxic TKI, with or without the addition of non-TKI anti-CML agents (hydroxyurea, omacetaxine, azacitidine, decitabine, cytarabine, and others).

### European LeukemiaNet recommendations for the management of chronic myeloid leukemia: 2013 [^1127jU3d]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, particularly regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mandate regular updating of concepts and management. A European LeukemiaNet expert panel reviewed prior and new studies to update recommendations made in 2009. We recommend as initial treatment imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib. Response is assessed with standardized real quantitative polymerase chain reaction and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6, and 12 months. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels ≤ 10% at 3 months, < 1% at 6 months, and ≤ 0.1% from 12 months onward define optimal response, whereas > 10% at 6 months and > 1% from 12 months onward define failure, mandating a change in treatment. Similarly, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) at 3 months and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) from 6 months onward define optimal response, whereas no CyR (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] > 95%) at 3 months, less than PCyR at 6 months, and less than CCyR from 12 months onward define failure. Between optimal and failure, there is an intermediate warning zone requiring more frequent monitoring. Similar definitions are provided for response to second-line therapy. Specific recommendations are made for patients in the accelerated and blastic phases, and for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Optimal responders should continue therapy indefinitely, with careful surveillance, or they can be enrolled in controlled studies of treatment discontinuation once a deeper molecular response is achieved.

How important is it to achieve the landmark optimal responses recommended by the ELN and NCCN?

The ELN recommendations and NCCN guidelines highlight the importance of achieving an "early molecular response" (EMR; defined as BCR::ABL1 transcripts [IS] < 10% at 3–6 months) and a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR; approximated to BCR::ABL1 transcripts [IS] < 1%) by 12 months of therapy. In the early years of the TKIs, EMR was emphasized, resulting in attempts to optimize therapy by switching from imatinib to second-generation TKIs in the first few months of therapy. In the German CML IV experience, achieving BCR::ABL1 (IS) transcripts < 10% at 3 months was associated with a 5-year OS rate of 94%, compared with 90% if levels were > 10%. Indications from recent experiences are that the 6-month timepoint is more important than the 3-month timepoint for EMR, and that lack of EMR at 6 months occurs in a minority of optimally treated and compliant patients (< 5% with second-generation TKIs).

Impact of stopping CML therapy on patients

Patient-centered

The life expectancy of CML patients is now very close to that of the healthy population. For this reason, the improvement of patient health and well-being has become the main goal of CML management, a development that could not have been foreseen 10 years ago. Therefore, a primary motivating factor for TFR initiation is the desire and expectation of patients to lead a normal life. For CML patients the QoL must be considered normal or close to normal. Obviously, a reduction in the side effects associated with continuous TKI therapy is a primary consideration. It seems that the QoL in CML patients is lower than that of the normal population especially in younger patients. Patient perspectives are a very important and sometimes an overlooked aspect of CML management. A recent surveyfound that not all patients are willing to stop therapy. The survey also found that, for patients who would consider stopping therapy, the motivation is associated with cost and age.

A physician cannot practice today without having a global awareness of the price of drugs and taking into consideration that reducing economic burden is necessary to treat all patients worldwide. In many places, reduced cost is a motivating factor for TFR initiation. However, as generic versions of imatinib become more widely available, the costs of the increased monitoring for those on TFR may be comparatively more expensive than continued treatment, at least with generic imatinib. An interesting factor is that in many countries comprehensive health insurance means that reducing the cost of treatment is not usually a patient driven consideration, but may be a health payer-driven goal.

### Expert opinion-management of chronic myeloid leukemia after resistance to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^11489awG]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of this paper and methodology

CML patients who fail their first second-generation TKI for true resistance need a more potent therapy. In these patients, the key issues to consider are the relative appropriateness of early allo-HSCT or the use of a further TKI. Selection of the next line of treatment after second-generation TKI resistance should be individualized and must be based on patient-specific factors including cytogenetics, mutation profile, comorbidities, age, previous history of adverse events (AEs) with prior TKI therapy and risk profile for AEs on specific TKIs. This expert opinion paper is not in conflict with existing recommendations, but instead represents an evolution of previous notions, based on new data, insights, and clinical experience. The panel members review treatment options for patients resistant to second-generation TKI therapy and provide our clinical opinions and guidance on key considerations for treatment decision making. Panel members corresponded via teleconference calls and mail exchanges to finalize an agreed consensus. No honoraria were received for this project.

### Impact of age on the outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in late chronic phase: results of a phase II study of the GIMEMA CML working party [^113tU9nt]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

To assess the effect of age on response and compliance to treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) we performed a sub-analysis within a phase II trial of the GIMEMA CML Working Party (CML/002/STI571). Since the WHO cut-off age to define an older patient is 65 years, among the 284 patients considered, we identified 226 (80%) younger patients (below 65 years) and 58 (20%) older patients (above 65 years) before starting imatinib. Response rates (hematologic and cytogenetic) were lower in the older age group but the probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival (median observation time 3 years) were the same. Moreover, among complete cytogenetic responders, no differences were found in the level of molecular response between the two age groups. As might be expected, older patients experienced more adverse events, both hematologic and non-hematologic: this worsened compliance did not, however, prevent a long-term outcome similar to that of younger patients.

Chronic myeloid leukemia — switching tyrosine kinase inhibitor: switching to an alternate TKI (based on the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation status) is recommended for patients with disease that is resistant to primary treatment with imatinib; patients with disease that is resistant to primary treatment with asciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib could be switched to an alternate TKI, but there is no clear evidence to support that switching to an alternate TKI would improve long-term clinical outcome; ponatinib is a treatment option for patients with a T315I mutation in any phase (preferred for AP-CML or BP-CML) and asciminib is a treatment option for patients with CP-CML having a T315I mutation.

### Medical management of CML [^114nbif8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Management strategies of patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have been revolutionized by the BCR-ABL-selective kinase inhibitor imatinib, which is substantially improving median survival. However, a proportion of patients suffer progressive disease on imatinib therapy. Importantly, patients who are particularly at risk for developing progressive disease can be identified with appropriate monitoring of disease burden. Many of these patients may benefit from alternative treatment strategies, including second-generation kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib. As a result of improvements in medical therapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is increasingly deferred despite its known curative potential. It is anticipated that outcomes with medical therapy will continue to improve with the availability of effective second- and third-generation kinase inhibitors, and the percentage of patients progressing to the advanced phase of the disease is projected to decline. The future of kinase inhibitor therapy for CML may involve combinations of ABL kinase inhibitors.

### Diagnosing and managing advanced chronic myeloid leukemia… [^114ehuUB]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Defining Advanced Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: Chronic Phase, Accelerated Phase, and Blastic Phase. 18In the case of blastic transformation, TKIs are usually combined with AML- or ALL-type multiagent chemotherapy, whereas this is not typically the case for AP. 19All patients with AP/BP-CML should be considered for an allogeneic stem cell transplant, with TKI therapy used to restore a second chronic phase and bridge the time to transplant. 52, 53Moreover, responses are frequently not durable, raising the question of ponatinib as a more effective and durable salvage therapy. In the Ponatinib Ph +ALL and CML Evaluation trial, 46% of CP-CML patients achieved CCyR, 91% of which were maintained at 12 months. Progression to Accelerated-Phase/Blastic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients who progress to AP/BP-CML are treated with the appropriate TKI, taking into account prior TKI exposure history and.

56Patients managed with drug therapy had superior survival, with the biggest difference observed in low-risk patients. After approximately 8 years, the survival curves crossed, suggesting that transplant would be superior in the long-term if IFN was the alternative. However, given the efficacy of TKIs in the first-line setting, and that early transplant-related mortality is clearly higher than the risk of early disease progression, allotransplant is no longer justifiable in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP, except in unusual circumstances.
57. 62There is an emerging consensus that bone marrow is preferred over peripheral blood stem cells in patients with CML-CP, in whom graft-versus-host disease is a greater concern than disease control. 63This assessment is different for patients with transformation to AP/BP, even if they have achieved a second chronic phase. In these patients, salvage therapies are currently nonspecific.

The hope is that diverse upstream pathways may activate a limited set of downstream effector molecules, thus providing an opportunity for rationally targeted therapies that are applicable to a wider population of patients. Early identification of patients with TKI failure or at risk of transformation is critical, so that therapy can be adjusted in a timely fashion to maximize the chances of successful salvage therapy. Despite the introduction of new TKIs such as ponatinib, the prediction is that allogeneic stem cell transplant will retain its position as the salvage therapy of choice for patients who progress to AP/BC-CML.

Conclusion

The landscape of CML management has changed considerably since approval of imatinib. Long-term survival is a reality for the majority of patients, and one could argue that there would be much less demand for new therapies if patients were more compliant or physicians were better at managing side effects. In 2011 we have the privilege of witnessing improvements to first-line therapy using second generation TKIs, while third-line TKIs emerge as an effective salvage for patients who fail nilotinib and dasatinib, including those with the T315I mutation. It is easy to predict that the next quantum leap will be the ability to discontinue therapy altogether. For now, this option is limited to few selected patients, but the hope is that this population will grow with frontline use of dasatinib or nilotinib. However, some skepticism seems in order and it is conceivable that for the majority of patients, disease eradiation is beyond the reach of TKIs. Time will tell whether combinations with other signal transduction inhibitors or old-fashioned IFN might achieve this end result.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selection and risk stratification — Asciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib are all appropriate options across risk scores, and selection should be based on the risk score, toxicity profile, patient's age, ability to tolerate therapy, and comorbid conditions; allogeneic HCT is no longer recommended first line. Second-generation (2G) TKIs are associated with a lower risk of disease progression than imatinib and are preferred for patients with an intermediate- or high-risk Sokal or Euro score; they result in higher rates of MMR (≤ 0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) and deep molecular response (DMR) (MR4.0 [≤ 0.01% BCR::ABL1 IS] or MR4.5 [≤ 0.0032% BCR::ABL1 IS]) across all risk scores, which may facilitate subsequent discontinuation of TKI therapy in selected patients. In the ASC4FIRST study, asciminib produced higher MMR rates than investigator-selected TKI across risk scores, with a significant difference vs imatinib (P < .001) but no statistically significant difference vs 2G TKI; therefore, 2G TKIs and asciminib are preferred for patients with an intermediate-risk or high-risk score.

### Chronic myeloid leukemia following treatment for primary neoplasms or other medical conditions [^117K2WPo]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Therapy-related chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been reported, but its clinical presentation and pathologic features have not yet been well characterized.

Methods

Twenty-one cases of CML following treatment for primary diseases were collected and retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The clinical presentation, pathologic features, and cytogenetic profile were similar to de novo CML. In particular, those with an isolated Philadelphia chromosome constituted 88.9% of our cases, and additional aberrations characteristic of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) were not identified in this study. The patients responded to imatinib/derivatives and survived with limited follow-up.

Conclusions

Therapy-related CML has a clinical presentation, pathologic features, and cytogenetic profile akin to de novo CML. Absence of additional significant aberrations seems to suggest a pathogenesis different from therapy-related AML/MDS. Therapy-related CML exhibits a robust therapeutic response to imatinib/derivatives and favorable clinical outcomes similar to de novo CML.

Chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) — dose minimization and de-escalation: Limited available evidence from small cohort studies suggests that initiation of first-line TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) at lower doses and dose reduction with close monitoring in patients who achieve optimal responses are appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of long-term toxicities. However, the minimum effective dose or optimal de-escalation of TKI (bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) has not yet been established in prospective randomized clinical trials.

Are current recommendations for TKI-therapy appropriate?

CML therapy recommendations are continuously modified with success inviting to more ambitious goals. Five-year survival of persons with CML is now 80–90% in the European geospaces, with about one-half of deaths occurring from unrelated causes. Survival is like that of sex- and age-adjusted people without CML in Europe, but not in the US and certainly not in resource-poor countries. Considerable data suggest people with CML achieving a stable deep molecular response (DMR; ≥ MR 4; 4-log BCR::ABL1 transcript decrease from the standardized baseline, corresponding to a transcript level ≤ 0.01% on the International Scale) can discontinue therapy, about one-half of whom achieving TFR. The clinical advantage of TFR over lifelong TKI-therapy is obvious, but the road to achieving this goal is not simple, cheap or rewarding for everyone. Some people choose not to stop TKI therapy for diverse reasons, usually fear of leukaemia recurrence.

There is controversy on how to best use TKIs. Which are the best and most cost-effective strategies to achieve TFR, to optimize survival and improve QoL? Which strategy(ies) should be used when someone does not meet proposed TKI stopping criteria or fails because of molecular, cytogenetic and/or haematologic leukaemia recurrence? How can we limit adverse events (AEs) associated with lifelong TKI-therapy and complications of more intensive therapies aimed at achieving TFR? Put otherwise, the main issues are: which TKI, at what dose and for how long, alone or with other drugs? But there is another important consideration. TKI-therapy rarely cures CML, as we discussed elsewhere. If so, should the only therapy of CML be TKIs?

Discussion

The current policies of TKI treatment of chronic phase CML mandate using TKIs at their respective approved or maximum tolerated doses lifelong, with the possibility of opening a window for treatment discontinuation when a DMR has been achieved and maintained for an as yet unspecified period of time. The window for treatment discontinuation can be enlarged in some of the patients who received imatinib first line, by switching early or late to a second-generation TKI, as well as using second-generation TKIs first line. Other policies have not been tested prospectively, particularly for treatments alternative to discontinuation, when discontinuation is not possible. The importance of the compliance to the treatment dose is highlighted by studies reporting that poor compliance is associated with a poorer molecular response. However, it is time to open a debate not on compliance but on which dose should be used for chronic treatment, once a stable, optimal response has been achieved.

### Which TKI? An embarrassment of riches for chronic myeloid leukemia patients [^117QEYEa]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

With the approval in many countries of nilotinib and dasatinib for frontline therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia, clinicians now have to make a difficult choice. Because none of the 3 available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown a clear survival advantage, they all represent reasonable choices. However, in individual patients, the case may be stronger for a particular TKI. In the younger patient, in whom the prospect of eventually achieving treatment-free remission is likely to be of great importance, dasatinib or nilotinib may be preferred, although their advantage over imatinib in this setting remains to be proven. In patients with a higher risk of transformation (which is currently based on prognostic scoring), the more potent TKIs may be preferred because they appear to be more effective at reducing the risk of transformation to BC. However, imatinib still represents an excellent choice for many chronic myeloid leukemia patients. All of these considerations need to be made in the context of the patient's comorbidities, which may lead to one or more TKIs being ruled out of contention. Whatever first choice of TKI is made, treatment failure or intolerance must be recognized early because a prompt switch to another TKI likely provides the best chance of achieving optimal response.

Dose modifications of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy — Limited available evidence from small cohort studies suggests that initiating select first-line TKIs at lower doses and using dose reduction (with close monitoring) in patients who achieve optimal responses are appropriate strategies to reduce long-term toxicities, but the minimum effective dose or optimal de-escalation of TKIs has not yet been established in prospective randomized clinical trials.
