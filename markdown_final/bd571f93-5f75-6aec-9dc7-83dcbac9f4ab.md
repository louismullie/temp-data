## Question

What to do when a patient says that have a allergy to a local anesthetic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when a patient reports an allergy to a local anesthetic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and the differential diagnosis of adverse reactions to local anesthetics. Then, I should verify the key elements of the clinical history that separate immunologic from non-immunologic causes. Next, I will review when and how to pursue diagnostic testing, including skin testing and graded challenges, and I should double-check the timing and safety considerations. After that, I need to outline management pathways for negative testing, positive testing, and scenarios where testing is deferred. Finally, I should consider special populations, documentation, and follow-up, and I will continuously sanity-check claims against the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the baseline probability and the differential. True IgE-mediated allergy to local anesthetics is extremely rare, generally less than 1% of adverse reactions, so most reports reflect vasovagal episodes, anxiety, systemic toxicity, or reactions to preservatives or excipients rather than the anesthetic itself, which means I should not jump to conclusions about allergy without corroborating details [^edc84a47] [^a2448177] [^516ed343].

> Wait, let me verify the key history elements I must capture to triage this properly. I need to ask about the exact agent and formulation, including whether epinephrine was present, the timing of symptoms relative to injection, the specific manifestations such as urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, or syncope, whether there were palpitations or tremor suggesting systemic toxicity, and whether there were prior uneventful exposures to the same or different local anesthetics, because these features help distinguish immunologic reactions from vasovagal, toxic, or preservative-related events [^edc84a47] [^516ed343] [^e7c9e588].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of preservatives and excipients. Methylparaben in multidose vials and metabisulfites in epinephrine-containing solutions are frequent culprits for hypersensitivity reactions that patients misattribute to the anesthetic, so I need to check whether the index reaction occurred with a preservative-containing preparation and whether preservative-free options have been tolerated since, because this can obviate the need for formal allergy testing in many cases [^e7c9e588] [^516ed343] [^3f83b9c8].

> Next, I should review when to pursue diagnostic evaluation. I need to ensure I reserve testing for patients with a convincing history of immediate hypersensitivity, such as urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, or hypotension within minutes of injection, or a compelling delayed reaction such as eczematous dermatitis, and I should avoid testing for vague symptoms like dizziness or palpitations without objective features, given the low yield and risk of false positives [^edc84a47] [^516ed343].

> I will now examine the testing strategy. Skin testing remains the criterion standard to detect IgE-mediated allergy, starting with prick tests and proceeding to intradermal tests if negative, using nonirritant concentrations and standardized protocols; however, I should confirm that the gold standard for confirming local anesthetic allergy is a graded subcutaneous challenge, because skin tests alone can be falsely positive and do not prove tolerance in vivo [^ec638e70] [^516ed343] [^80e7cdcc].

> Let me think about timing and safety. I should double-check that skin testing is generally deferred for 4 to 6 weeks after a severe reaction to avoid false negatives, but for local anesthetics, testing can often proceed earlier if clinically indicated, including during pregnancy when necessary; I need to ensure resuscitation capability and use incremental dosing with observation between steps during any challenge, and I should remember that preservative-containing test solutions may provoke false positives, so preservative-free agents are preferred for testing and challenges [^b83e5365] [^516ed343] [^e7c9e588].

> If testing is negative, I should confirm that the patient can safely receive local anesthetics going forward, typically using a different class or a preservative-free preparation for the first exposure; I need to ensure I document the negative evaluation and counsel the patient that the prior reaction was likely non-allergic, while still planning cautious administration with aspiration and incremental injection to mitigate toxicity risk [^516ed343] [^edc84a47] [^069b3b0e].

> If testing is positive, I should verify cross-reactivity patterns. Immediate hypersensitivity to amides is rare and cross-reactivity within the amide class can occur, whereas esters share cross-reactivity via para-aminobenzoic acid metabolites; importantly, there is no cross-reactivity between amides and esters, so switching class is a rational strategy, and I should also consider alternatives such as diphenhydramine or bacteriostatic saline for small procedures when appropriate [^aea03db9] [^2bce60f8] [^00aadc0b].

> But wait, what if testing is deferred or not feasible. In urgent settings, I should consider using an agent from the opposite class with preservative-free formulation, employ a graded test dose with observation, and ensure full resuscitation readiness; if uncertainty remains high, I can use non-anesthetic alternatives like diphenhydramine or bacteriostatic saline for limited procedures, recognizing their slower onset and lower potency compared with conventional local anesthetics [^2bce60f8] [^00aadc0b].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pregnancy, preservative-free bupivacaine has been used safely for labor analgesia after appropriate evaluation, and in children, true local anesthetic allergy is exceedingly uncommon, so I should prioritize preservative-free amides and standard toxicity-prevention practices; in patients with clonal mast cell disorders, amide local anesthetics are generally considered low risk for degranulation, though I should still individualize based on history and consider perioperative planning if there has been prior mediator-related symptoms [^9bb47483] [^baa5297c] [^d02c12a9].

> Next, I should review documentation and follow-up. I must record the exact agent, formulation, and reaction details, the results of any testing and challenges, and provide the patient with a clear allergy label that distinguishes true allergy from preservative sensitivity or non-allergic reactions; I should also communicate with future providers to avoid unnecessary avoidance of local anesthetics when testing is negative, and I should arrange follow-up if testing is deferred or if new exposures are planned [^2015a5ef] [^edc84a47].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with the evidence hierarchy. The approach of careful history to triage, selective skin testing, and confirmatory graded challenge is supported by contemporary reviews and practice parameters, and the rarity of true IgE-mediated local anesthetic allergy is consistently reported across large series, reinforcing the need to avoid overcalling allergy without objective confirmation [^edc84a47] [^a2448177] [^516ed343].

---

When a patient reports a local anesthetic "allergy", the priority is to **clarify the reaction history** [^edc84a47] and distinguish true allergy from vasovagal, toxic, or preservative-related reactions [^516ed343]. True IgE-mediated allergy to amide local anesthetics is **extremely rare** (< 1%) [^a2448177], and most reactions are due to preservatives (methylparaben, sulfites) [^e7c9e588], anxiety, or systemic toxicity [^516ed343]. If the history suggests a true immediate hypersensitivity, refer for **allergy testing** (skin prick/intradermal) [^ec638e70] followed by a graded challenge [^516ed343] to confirm or exclude allergy. If allergy is confirmed, use an alternative class (amide vs ester) [^aea03db9] or preservative-free formulations [^e7c9e588]; if not confirmed, proceed with standard local anesthetics using aspiration and incremental dosing to mitigate toxicity risk [^069b3b0e].

## Clinical significance of reported local anesthetic allergy

True IgE-mediated allergy to local anesthetics is **rare** [^a2448177], accounting for < 1% of adverse reactions [^edc84a47]. Most reported "allergies" are **non-allergic** — vasovagal reactions, anxiety, systemic toxicity, or reactions to preservatives (methylparaben, sulfites) [^e7c9e588] [^516ed343].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

A detailed history is essential to **characterize the reaction** and guide next steps:

- **Agent and formulation**: Identify the specific local anesthetic and whether it contained preservatives or epinephrine [^e7c9e588].
- **Timing and symptoms**: Determine onset, duration, and specific symptoms (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope) [^ec638e70].
- **Risk factors**: Assess for anxiety, vasovagal tendencies, or prior similar reactions [^516ed343].
- **Cross-reactivity**: Amides (lidocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine) do not cross-react with esters (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) [^aea03db9].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

If the history suggests a true immediate hypersensitivity reaction, **allergy testing** is indicated:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Procedure** |
|-|-|-|
| Skin prick test (SPT) | Immediate hypersensitivity | Undiluted or 1:10 dilution; read at 15–20 minutes [^ec638e70] |
| Intradermal test (IDT) | Negative SPT | 1:10,000 to 1:1,000 dilution; incremental titration [^ec638e70] |
| Graded challenge | Negative skin tests | 0.1 mL → 0.5 mL → 1 mL; 15–20 minute intervals [^516ed343] |

---

The **gold standard** is a graded subcutaneous challenge [^516ed343], which confirms or excludes true allergy when skin tests are negative [^e2f5caa0].

---

## Management strategies

### Confirmed true allergy

- **Alternative class**: Use an ester if the allergy is to an amide, or vice versa [^aea03db9].
- **Preservative-free**: Use preservative-free formulations to avoid methylparaben or sulfite reactions [^e7c9e588].
- **Emergency preparedness**: Have epinephrine and resuscitation equipment available during administration [^0ff697ca].

---

### No confirmed allergy

If allergy is not confirmed, **standard local anesthetics** can be used with precautions:

- **Aspiration**: Always aspirate before injection to avoid intravascular injection [^069b3b0e].
- **Incremental dosing**: Administer in small increments and monitor for toxicity [^069b3b0e].
- **Patient education**: Explain the nature of the prior reaction and reassure about safety [^edc84a47].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Preservative-free bupivacaine can be used safely for labor analgesia after appropriate evaluation [^9bb47483].
- **Pediatrics**: True allergy is rare; standard pediatric dosing and monitoring apply [^8ea768be].
- **Mast cell disorders**: Amide local anesthetics are generally safe; avoid histamine-releasing agents [^baa5297c].

---

## Documentation and communication

Record the **detailed reaction history**, results of any testing, and the final diagnosis. Communicate clearly with the patient and other clinicians to avoid mislabeling and unnecessary avoidance of local anesthetics [^2015a5ef].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **History**: Clarify the reaction details and identify potential non-allergic causes [^edc84a47].
- **Testing**: Use skin testing and graded challenge when indicated [^ec638e70].
- **Alternatives**: Use a different class or preservative-free formulation if allergy is confirmed [^aea03db9].
- **Precautions**: Use aspiration and incremental dosing when re-administering local anesthetics [^069b3b0e].
- **Documentation**: Record findings and communicate clearly to prevent mislabeling [^2015a5ef].

---

Most reported local anesthetic "allergies" are **not true allergies**; careful history, selective testing, and safe administration practices enable safe ongoing use of local anesthetics.

### Allergy to local anesthetics is a rarity: review of diagnostics and strategies for clinical management [^edc84a47]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Local anesthetics (LA) are commonly used in procedures and in topical agents for pain management. With the increasing use of LA drugs, the management of LA reactions is more frequently encountered in the office and in operating rooms. True allergic reactions involving IgE-mediated reactions and anaphylaxis are rare; they have only been identified in case reports and account for less than 1% of adverse LA reactions. Most reactions are non-allergic or are a result of hypersensitivity to other culprits such as preservatives, excipients, or other exposures. LA reactions that are misclassified as true allergies can lead to unnecessary avoidance of LA drugs or delays in surgical procedures that require their use. A detailed history of prior LA reactions is the first and most crucial step for understanding the nature of the reaction. Reactions that are suspicious for an immediate hypersensitivity reaction can be evaluated with skin prick and intradermal testing with subsequent graded challenge. Reactions that are suspicious for a delayed hypersensitivity reaction can be evaluated with patch testing.

### A critical review of local anesthetic sensitivity [^d1cb6e5d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

With their ability to block pain signals to the brain, local anesthetics (LAs) have made possible many surgical procedures and interventions once thought impossible. LAs are generally safe and well tolerated when used correctly by trained professionals. However, adverse reactions do occur, and may generate a referral to an Allergist for evaluation of LA allergy. LA structure, classification, and metabolism will be briefly reviewed. A critical analysis of the studies and case reports involving LA allergy found via PubMed search for "local anesthetic allergy" and "local anesthetic hypersensitivity" will be discussed. In addition, the clinical evaluation of a patient with concern for a LA allergy will be examined.

### Hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics – update and proposal of evaluation algorithm [^9414afe7]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Local anaesthetics (LA) are widely used drugs. Adverse reactions are rare but may be caused by delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and probably also immediate-type reactions. As it is not always easy to clinically differ between these subtypes, allergy skin testing should be considered. Although numerous test protocols have been published, how patients with hypersensitivity reactions to LA are ideally evaluated remains a topic of discussion. This review attempts to generate a comprehensive update on allergic reactions to LA and to present an algorithm that can be used for the evaluation of patients suspected with immediate- and delayed-type immune reactions. Literature was examined using PubMed-Medline, EMBASE, Biosis and Science Citation Index. Based on the literature, the proposed algorithm may safely and rapidly distinguish between immediate-type and delayed-type allergic immune reactions.

### Management of a parturient with a history of local anesthetic allergy [^9bb47483]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Implications

The management of parturients with a strong history of allergy to local anesthetics poses significant challenges to the obstetric anesthesiologist. We recommend that when such patients have a strong desire to receive labor analgesia with local anesthetics, they undergo provocative challenge testing with preservative-free bupivacaine performed in labor and delivery with preparations for emergent cesarean delivery after 24-wk gestation.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^516ed343]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Local anesthetics — diagnostic testing and provocation challenge: Skin testing for diagnosis of local anesthetic allergy is limited by false-positive reactions, and the gold standard for establishing a diagnosis of local anesthetic allergy is the provocative challenge (C). Local anesthetics are commonly used and reactions to injections are often due to vasovagal, anxiety, psychosomatic, or toxic effects, whereas IgE-mediated or anaphylactoid reactions are extremely rare. In patients who subsequently tolerate a provocative challenge without an adverse reaction, false-positive intracutaneous test results occur in approximately 1% and 9% of history-negative and history-positive patients, respectively, and given the low pretest probability and false positives, it is unclear whether intracutaneous tests have any diagnostic benefit. Subcutaneous local anesthetic challenges using a graded incremental approach after skin tests were reported as safe in a study of 236 patients with histories of adverse reactions, and rechallenge without prior skin tests was reported to be an easy and cheap alternative to skin testing, although the possibility of a rare systemic reaction must be kept in mind.

### Local and general anesthetics immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^8af15451]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Intraoperative anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions in the setting of anesthesia contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of surgeries and surgical procedures. Because multiple medications and products are given in a short period of time, identifying the specific cause can be difficult. Neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, and latex are the most common causes of anesthesia-related reactions, though other medications or exposures could be involved. Careful review of anesthetic charts and allergy testing can help identify the underlying cause. The identification of the cause and subsequent prevention of reactions are critical to reduce overall mortality and morbidity related to anesthesia.

### The science of local anesthesia: basic research, clinical application, and future directions [^968667c7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Local anesthetics have been used clinically for more than a century, but new insights into their mechanisms of action and their interaction with biological systems continue to surprise researchers and clinicians alike. Next to their classic action on voltage-gated sodium channels, local anesthetics interact with calcium, potassium, and hyperpolarization-gated ion channels, ligand-gated channels, and G protein-coupled receptors. They activate numerous downstream pathways in neurons, and affect the structure and function of many types of membranes. Local anesthetics must traverse several tissue barriers to reach their site of action on neuronal membranes. In particular, the perineurium is a major rate-limiting step. Allergy to local anesthetics is rare, while the variation in individual patient's response to local anesthetics is probably larger than previously assumed. Several adjuncts are available to prolong sensory block, but these typically also prolong motor block. The 2 main research avenues being followed to improve action of local anesthetics are to prolong duration of block, by slow-release formulations and on-demand release, and to develop compounds and combinations that elicit a nociception-selective blockade.

### IgE-mediated allergy to local anaesthetics: separating fact from perception: a UK perspective [^a2448177]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Local anaesthetic (LA) agents have been routinely used in dentistry, ophthalmology, minor surgery, and obstetrics since the late nineteenth century. Reports relating to adverse reactions and LA allergy have appeared in the published literature for several years. However, the incidence of true, IgE-mediated LA allergy remains uncertain and is presumed to be very low. We critically reviewed the English language literature on suspected LA allergy and its investigation with the aim of estimating the reported prevalence and analysing the role of different tests currently used to identify and confirm LA allergy. Twenty-three case series involving 2978 patients were identified and analysed. Twenty-nine of these patients had true IgE-mediated allergy to LA, thus confirming the reported prevalence of LA allergy in large series to be < 1% (0.97%). The protocols used in the investigation of these patients have also been discussed. Evidence from this review confirms the rarity of IgE-mediated allergy to LA and supports an investigation strategy based on using the clinical history to select patients for skin testing and challenge. We believe that such a triage process would alleviate pressures on allergy services without compromising patient safety.

Local anesthetics are widely used in the practice of medicine, particularly within the field of interventional radiology. When used properly, these agents are safe and effective in preventing procedural pain and treating postprocedural pain. The clinician should be aware of proper dosing regimens, techniques, and applications and the methods of preventing and treating complications of systemic toxicity, allergy, and methemoglobinemia. This review provides an introduction to the pharmacology and optimal use of local anesthetics and current strategies for minimizing and managing their potential risks.

### Identifying and managing local anesthetic allergy in dermatologic surgery [^21b2217e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Local anesthetic (LA) allergy is a concern for dermatologic surgeons given the large number of procedures performed yearly with LAs. Many patients also have anxiety about past or potential anesthesia allergy.

Objective

This article will review the symptoms of IgE-mediated allergic reactions, the prevalence of IgE-mediated LA allergy, discuss common mimics of LA, and propose a practical approach for diagnostic and therapeutic options for LA allergy for the dermatologic surgeon in practice.

Materials and Methods

A literature search of Pubmed using keywords "lidocaine", "local anesthetic", "hypersensitivity", and "allergy" was performed.

Results

Amide anesthetics result in the most reports of true local anesthetic immediate hypersensitivity.

Conclusion

True IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to local anesthesia is very rare. Dermatologic surgeons should be aware of the symptoms of anesthetic allergy and its mimickers, as well as how to manage allergic reactions in their clinical practice.

### Polocaine (mepivacaine hcl) [^06f1b609]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Mepivacaine should be used with caution in patients with known allergies and sensitivities.

Because amide-type local anesthetics such as mepivacaine are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, these drugs, especially repeat doses, should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic and renal disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs.

Serious dose-related cardiac arrhythmias may occur if preparations containing a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are employed in patients during or following the administration of potent inhalation anesthetics. In deciding whether to use these products concurrently in the same patient, the combined action of both agents upon the myocardium, the concentration and volume of vasoconstrictor used, and the time since injection, when applicable, should be taken into account.

Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial malignant hyperthermia. Because it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and because the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for management should be available. Early unexplained signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, labile blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s), and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures, and dantrolene. (Consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using.)

### Evaluation of adverse reactions to local anesthetics: experience with 236 patients [^e2f5caa0]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse reactions to local anesthetics (LAs) are frequently reported. Although most of these reactions are not immune mediated, many patients are referred to allergy clinics and undergo extensive evaluation.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of true LA allergy among the patients referred for suspected hypersensitivity and to evaluate the usefulness of the currently used evaluation protocol.

Methods

A total of 236 patients referred to our allergy clinic for investigation of LA hypersensitivity were included in this study. The evaluation protocol was composed of skin prick and intradermal tests, followed by subcutaneous challenge with unrelated LA preparations that contained preservatives.

Results

Skin prick and intradermal test results were negative for all subjects. No objective adverse reactions were observed during the challenge in all but 1 patient, who developed local erythema at the site of injection and later underwent an uneventful challenge with a different LA.

Conclusions

Allergic reactions were not reproduced during testing and challenge with LA preparations that contained preservatives or preservatives with adrenaline in our large group of patients with suspected LA allergy. Since both prick and intradermal skin test results were negative in all the patients and did not provide us with useful information, we propose to modify the standard protocol by omitting intradermal tests and shortening the challenge. We also suggest that the whole procedure be performed with LAs that contain preservatives, which are usually the preferred preparations widely used in daily practice.

### Twenty years' experience with anaphylaxis-like reactions to local anesthetics: genuine allergy is Rare [^3ecf5a03]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis-like reactions occur within minutes after the application of local anesthetics (LA), most commonly during dental interventions. Impressive symptoms including respiratory distress or loss of consciousness frequently give rise to a suspicion of allergy and may prompt patients and treating physicians to refuse future LA injections.

Objective

Nonallergic mechanisms are responsible for the majority of LA-induced immediate-type reactions. In view of the preponderance of nonallergic reactions, the question arises whether genuine LA allergy may be missed during routine testing procedures.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated clinical data and test results from patients referred to our allergy clinic within the past 20 years for diagnostic workup of LA-induced immediate-type reactions.

Results

Of 402 evaluated patients, 29 had an episode of acute urticaria within 30 minutes after LA injections, and the remaining 373 had a history of mainly subjective cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological complaints. Of the patients reporting urticaria with or without angioedema, 14 were diagnosed with a spontaneous episode of urticaria, 13 had allergic or nonallergic reactions to other agents, and 2 had IgE-mediated LA allergy. LA allergy was definitely excluded by 771 subcutaneous provocation tests with skin test negative LA, thereby demonstrating the high predictive value of negative intradermal testing.

Conclusions

Skin testing and provocative LA challenge are useful to exclude LA allergy, and this testing procedure seems to be appropriate to identify the extremely rare cases with IgE-mediated LA allergy.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^00aadc0b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Local infiltrative anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery — indications, combination use, dosing limits, alternatives for allergy, and toxicity reduction — is summarized as follows: Infiltrative anesthesia is safe and recommended for office-based dermatologic procedures, including but not limited to obtaining a biopsy specimen, excision, wound closure, tissue rearrangement, skin grafting, cauterization, nonablative laser, and ablative skin resurfacing. It may be combined with other forms of local anesthesia for larger or more complex cutaneous procedures, including full-face ablative laser resurfacing combined with topical and nerve block anesthesia and follicular unit hair transplantation combined with tumescent local anesthesia. The maximum safe dose of local infiltrated anesthesia is unknown. Dose limits specify that for adults, no more than 4.5 mg/kg of lidocaine and 7.0 mg/kg of lidocaine with epinephrine should be administered in a single treatment, and for children, no more than 1.5–2.0 mg/kg of lidocaine and 3.0–4.5 mg/kg of lidocaine with epinephrine should be administered in a single treatment. For a multistage procedure such as Mohs micrographic surgery, a maximum dose of 50 mL of 1% lidocaine solution (500 mg) delivered over several hours is recommended. For patients with true allergy to lidocaine, use of either ester-type local anesthetics, bacteriostatic normal saline, or 1% diphenhydramine is suggested as an alternate form of local infiltration anesthesia. Steps recommended to decrease the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity include using the lowest effective dose, aspirating prior to each injection, using incremental injections, and continually assessing and communicating with the patient to monitor for signs of early toxicity.

### Society of Interventional Radiology IR pre-procedure patient safety checklist by the safety and health committee [^c6e5c33c]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patient allergies — various agents used during IR (local anesthetics, opioids, anxiolytics, contrast agents, prophylactic antibiotics) are frequently administered, and latex glove use is common unless the institution is latex‑free; the most common agents responsible for anaphylactic reactions during surgical and medical procedures are muscle relaxants and latex, followed by antibiotics and induction agents. The major emphasis on managing a patient's allergies is prevention, and reviewing allergies before the start of the procedure can help avoid minor or major reactions with potential morbidity.

### BSACI guidelines for the investigation of suspected anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia [^b889331c]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Investigation of anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia requires an accurate record of events including information on timing of drug administration provided by the anaesthetist, as well as timed acute tryptase measurements. Referrals should be made to a centre with the experience and ability to investigate reactions to a range of drug classes/substances including neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) intravenous (i.v.) anaesthetics, antibiotics, opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local anaesthetics, colloids, latex and other agents. About a third of cases are due to allergy to NMBAs. Therefore, investigation should be carried out in a dedicated drug allergy clinic to allow seamless investigation of all suspected drug classes as a single day-case. This will often require skin prick tests, intra-dermal testing and/or drug challenge. Investigation must cover the agents administered, but should also include most other commonly used NMBAs and i.v. anaesthetics. The outcome should be to identify the cause and a range of drugs/agents likely to be safe for future use. The allergist is responsible for a detailed report to the referring anaesthetist and to the patient's GP as well as the surgeon/obstetrician. A shorter report should be provided to the patient, adding an allergy alert to the case notes and providing an application form for an alert-bracelet indicating the wording to be inscribed. The MHRA should be notified. Investigation of anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia should be focussed in major allergy centres with a high throughput of cases and with experience and ability as described above. We suggest this focus since there is a distinct lack of validated data for testing, thus requiring experience in interpreting tests and because of the serious consequences of diagnostic error.

### Systemic anaphylaxis following local lidocaine administration during a dental procedure [^0ff697ca]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

We report a 4-year-old child who developed systemic anaphylactic reaction to lidocaine hydrochloride within 15 minutes after a dental procedure. Hypersensitivity to local anesthetics is not common; however, if anaphylaxis did happen, it required emergent and immediate resuscitation. To prevent such complications, complete medical history including drug allergy should be taken. Prompt administration of epinephrine and other resuscitative measures are life saving in such circumstance. All emergency room physicians should consider systemic anaphylaxis in patients with rapid vascular collapse and respiratory failure immediately following lidocaine administration for minor outpatient procedures.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^ec638e70]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Skin testing for anesthetics — criterion standard and procedure: Skin testing remains the criterion standard for detecting IgE-mediated allergy versus nonallergic immediate hypersensitivity, and all drugs to which the patient was exposed within minutes before the clinical reaction must be skin tested. Investigation is performed by prick tests (PTs) followed by intradermal tests (IDTs) using solutions undiluted or diluted without exceeding maximum nonirritant concentrations; PTs may be false negative, IDTs are more sensitive but less specific, and should be performed only if PT results are negative. Tests should be read within 15 to 20 minutes; if PT is negative, IDT uses 0.03 to 0.05 mL, beginning at 1:10,000 or 1:1,000 dilution, then increases 10-fold with incremental 15- to 20-minute intervals until positive or the highest nonirritant concentration is reached.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^1011e7b6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Local and general anesthetics and opiates — perioperative immediate hypersensitivity epidemiology and presentation show that the overall incidence of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity was estimated to be 1 in 5,000 to 13,000 in Australia, 1 in 4,600 in France, 1 in 1,250 to 5,000 in New Zealand, and 1 in 3,500 in the United Kingdom; by the end of the 1990s the overall incidence of perioperative IgE-mediated anaphylaxis was 1 in 1,000 to 20,000 in Australia and 1 in 13,000 in France. Recently, the combined allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis rate with an anesthetic was estimated to be 1 in 11,000 in Western Australia and 1 in 10,000 in the United Kingdom, and an IgE-mediated mechanism has been involved in half and up to two-thirds of cases. Perioperative IgE-mediated allergy mainly occurs after anesthetic induction and is primarily linked to neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) and antibiotics such as β-lactam drugs; a female predominance has been reported and immediate IgE-mediated drug allergy is uncommon in children. The latest National Audit Project reported a mortality rate of 3.8% among 266 reports of anaphylaxis over 1 year, whereas a Western Australian retrospective study suggested mortality within the range of 0% to 1.4% and that higher rates, that is, 3% and up to 10%, may be an overestimate. Perioperative immediate hypersensitivity mainly occurs within minutes after anesthetic induction and is primarily linked to agents administered intravenously, and the emergency management of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity is guided by the clinical expression of the reaction.

### Risk of immediate-type allergy to local anesthetics is overestimated-results from 5 Years of provocation testing in a Danish allergy Clinic [^beb4faf0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Local anesthetics (LAs) are used in many health care settings and exposure during a lifetime is almost inevitable. Immediate-type allergy to LAs is considered rare among allergy experts but is commonly suspected by health care workers from other specialties, and by patients.

Objective

The main aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of immediate-type allergy to LAs in our regional allergy clinic over the 5-year period 2010 to 2014.

Methods

This was a retrospective single-center study of patients referred to a regional allergy clinic (excluding patients with perioperative reactions) with suspected immediate allergy to LAs, who had undergone subcutaneous provocation with 1 or more LAs. Patients were identified in the hospital clinical coding system and clinical information about the reaction and investigation results was obtained from their medical records.

Results

A total of 164 patients (123 women/41 men; median age, 56 years; range, 7–89 years) who had 189 provocations with LAs were included over the 5-year period 2010 to 2014. All 164 patients had negative subcutaneous provocations to all 189 tests with LAs (95% CI, 0%-1.83%). Another allergen was identified in 10% (n = 17) of the patients.

Conclusions

None of the 164 patients with suspected immediate-type allergy to LAs reacted on provocation. Thus, no patients have been diagnosed with an immediate allergy to LAs in our regional allergy clinic in the 5-year period studied, and allergy to LAs must be considered very rare. Alternative mechanisms should be considered, but if symptoms are consistent with allergy, other potential allergens should be investigated.

### Perioperative hypersensitivity evaluation and management: a practical approach [^c857ae50]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Perioperative hypersensitivity (POH) is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening event. Identification of POH can be difficult given the lack of familiarity, physiological effects of anesthesia, draping of the patient during surgery, and potential nonimmunological factors contributing to signs and symptoms. Given the unique nature and large number of medications administered in the perioperative setting, evaluation of POH can be challenging. In this paper, we present a practical approach to management with an emphasis on understanding what happens in the operating room, the overlap of signs and symptoms between nonimmunological and immunological reactions, acute management, and subsequent evaluation. In addition, we provide a strategy for further review of an initially negative evaluation and emphasize the importance of establishing management plans for the patient as well as providing recommendations to the medical, anesthesia, and surgical teams for future surgeries. A critical factor for successful management at all points in the process is a close collaboration between the anesthesia and the allergy teams.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^80e7cdcc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Perioperative and drug-specific skin testing — Skin testing is a useful diagnostic tool in cases of perioperative anaphylaxis, and when skin testing is used to guide subsequent anesthetic agents, the risk of recurrent anaphylaxis to anesthesia is low; skin testing is not helpful in cases of taxane-induced anaphylactoid reactions; skin testing to carboplatin yields favorable predictive values; skin testing with asparaginase before treatment is recommended but does not identify all patients at risk of reactions; for local anesthetic allergy, skin testing is limited by false-positive reactions and the gold standard for establishing a diagnosis of local anesthetic allergy is the provocative challenge; for systemic corticosteroid allergy, the specificity and sensitivity of skin tests are unknown and cases with negative skin test results to the implicated corticosteroid have been reported; for most allergic reactions to additives, skin tests are of no diagnostic value and placebo-controlled oral challenges are required.

### Drug allergy [^0c7d558e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Drug allergy is one type of adverse reaction to drugs and encompasses a spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions with heterogeneous mechanisms and clinical presentations. A thorough history is essential to the management of drug allergy. Laboratory testing has a very limited role in the management of drug allergy. Graded dose challenges and procedures to induce drug tolerance might be required in patients with drug allergy when there is a definite need for a particular agent. Management of reactions to specific agents, including beta-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, local anesthetics, radiocontrast media, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and biologic modifiers, will be discussed in further detail.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^aea03db9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Local anesthetics — group classification, metabolites, and cross-reactivity patterns are distinct for esters versus amides. Local anesthetics (LAs) belong to the ester or amide groups (Table LXXII). Para-aminobenzoic acid is the common metabolite of ester LAs inducing immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, and cross-reactivity is the rule among esters due to para-aminobenzoic acid. IgE-mediated allergy to amide LAs is extremely rare relative to their widespread use, cross-reactivity in the amide group has been established for immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, and there is no cross-reactivity between amide and ester LAs.

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^7a2ab90a]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Later investigations to identify the causative agent

Any patient who has a suspected anaphylactic reaction associated with anaesthesia should be investigated fully, but investigations should not interfere with the immediate treatment of the patient. The anaesthetist who administered the anaesthetic or the consultant anaesthetist in charge of the patient is responsible for ensuring that the reaction is investigated.

The patient should be referred to a specialist Allergy or Immunology centre that has appropriate experience of investigating this type of problem. Anaesthetic departments should identify a lead anaesthetist for anaesthetic anaphylaxis. Referral pathways should be agreed prospectively with the appropriate specialist centre.

### Adverse reactions to drugs and biologics in patients with clonal mast cell disorders: a Work group report of the mast cells disorder committee, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^d02c12a9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Adverse drug reactions during anesthesia in mastocytosis (Box 1) are addressed with risk identification and perioperative planning, noting that patients at greater risk of adverse reactions during anesthesia are those with a history of anaphylaxis, those who have undergone major surgeries, and those who have been exposed to general anesthesia. The benefit of administration of prophylactic antimediator therapy before anesthetic procedures has not been thoroughly evaluated, and there is no consensus about their routine administration, and premedication is recommended in patients with previous perioperative anaphylaxis in need of future general anesthesia if the culprit agent has not been identified. A reasonable approach is to choose those drugs with low capacity to elicit mast cell (MC) degranulation in each pharmacologic group and to use drugs with known tolerance by individual patients, with examples including aminosteroids, neuromuscular blockers, short-acting synthetic opioids, and amide derivatives among local anesthetics. After perioperative anaphylaxis, obtain a serum tryptase value 15 to 60 minutes after the acute episode and 24 or more hours after resolution of the episode. A complete allergic work-up before anesthesia is recommended for patients with mastocytosis who have experienced perioperative mediator-related symptoms in the past; however, routine preoperative skin testing with drugs to be used is not recommended.

### Local anesthesia and anxiolytic techniques for oculoplastic surgery [^3f83b9c8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Precautions

The administration of local anesthetics may have potential iatrogenic complications.

First, patients may report an allergy to local anesthetics. True allergic reactions to amide local anesthetics such as lidocaine are rare. More commonly, patients claiming allergy to amide local anesthetics are sensitive to the metabisulfite (antioxidant) or methylparaben (preservative) contained in the local anesthetic solution. Allergy to amide anesthetics does not cause cross-allergy to ester anesthetics. Allergies to the ester topical anesthetics are usually due to sensitivity to the metabolite paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA). If there are concerns regarding a history of allergic reaction to local anesthetics, a referral can be made for allergy testing prior to the procedure. Allergic sensitization and possible cross-reaction to topical anesthetics are a potential occupational hazard for ophthalmologists, especially in providers with chronic eczema.

Second, patients' comorbidities must be considered prior to local anesthetic injection. Local anesthetic injection may cause pupillary dilation, and periocular injections with epinephrine are a relative contraindication in patients with untreated narrow angles. Retrobulbar and parabulbar anesthetic injections should not be used for enucleation of patients with suspected intraocular tumor.

Third, periocular injections can cause injury to the globe. Several cases of globe perforation during local anesthetic injection for oculoplastic procedures have been described. To decrease this risk, a cornea protector can be placed with sterile gloves prior to injection. Appropriately tightened Luer lock syringes prevent inadvertent needle expulsion during local anesthetic administration; Luer slip syringes are not recommended. Bending the needle at an acute angle, keeping the needle bevel up during injection, and needle trajectories almost parallel to the tarsal plate may decrease the risk of globe injury. In anticipation of patient movement, the syringe can be nestled in a "snooker" grip, with the non-injection hand resting on the patient's forehead or cheek. Stimulation of the afferent arm of the sternutatory (sneeze) reflex by botulinum toxin injection, periocular local anesthetic, or with propofol may occur in 5%–46% of the patients, and the surgeon should be prepared for any associated head movements, to avert eye injury. It is speculated that propofol may suppress sneeze inhibitory neurons. Administration of an opioid prior to propofol and the local anesthetic injection may decrease the sternutatory reflex.

### Local anaesthetics in interventional radiology: a primer for radiologists on applications and management of complications [^40e87297]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Local anaesthetics (LAs) allow a range of procedures to be performed in interventional radiology (IR) through improving patient comfort and reducing pain. This review serves as a primer for interventional radiologists, providing an overview of commonly used LAs and practical tips for their implementation. With its quick onset time and moderate duration of action, the amide lidocaine is the most used and applicable to a variety of procedures such as biopsies and embolization. In contrast, bupivacaine and ropivacaine (both amides) have longer durations of action, and are therefore suitable for lengthy procedures and pain control post-procedurally. Procaine, an ester, may be used in cases of amide anaesthetic allergies. This review examines the clinical applications of LAs in radiology and management of their adverse effects including local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) and allergic reactions. It concludes with a discussion of LAST, emphasising techniques for early intervention and management. The role of lipid emulsion therapy and modifications to the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol are highlighted, including a discussion of other aspects such as airway management. By presenting the latest strategies to manage LAST and adverse effects, this research aims to help standardise anaesthetic management in radiology. It provides actionable steps for selecting and injecting anaesthetics, and management of complications that will be beneficial for interventional radiologists performing a diverse array of procedures.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Allergic-Type Reactions

Assess if the patient has had allergic-type reactions to amide-type local anesthetics or to other formulation ingredients, such as the antimicrobial preservative methylparaben contained in multiple dose vials or sulfites in epinephrine-containing solutions [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions (6)].

Temporary Loss of Sensation and Motor Activity After Caudal or Epidural Anesthesia

When appropriate, patients should be informed in advance that they may experience temporary loss of sensation and motor activity, usually in the lower half of the body, following proper administration of caudal or epidural anesthesia.

Instructions After Dental Injection of Sensorcaine

Advise patients receiving dental injections of SENSORCAINE not to chew solid foods or to test the anesthetized area by biting or probing until anesthesia has worn off (up to 7 hours) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Methemoglobinemia

Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Tramadol use in a patient with Brugada syndrome and morphine allergy: a case report [^286a30a7]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Brugada syndrome is a rare rhythm disorder which may cause serious arrhythmias in patients undergoing anesthesia. Medications particularly used during local anesthesia, propofol infusion and anticholinesterases, can aggravate Brugada syndrome. These medicines should be avoided in the presence of alternative medicines. We believe that, when local anesthetics are avoided, morphine is a safe analgesic, whereas tramadol may be an option in patients with morphine contraindication. However, the best choice of analgesia in patients with Brugada syndrome will be clarified with future research involving larger case series.

Diagnosis — perioperative immediate hypersensitivity evaluation relies on a triad that integrates history and testing. The etiologic diagnosis of perioperative immediate hypersensitivity is linked to a triad including clinical evidence along with biological and allergologic results. The interpretation of the biological and allergologic assessment should always be correlated to the careful and complete review of the clinical history including the management care, and the joint analysis of these elements helps to determine the pathomechanism involved (allergic vs nonallergic), identify the culprit agent, and provide subsequent and appropriate advice for further anesthetic.

### Ultrasound-guided superior cluneal nerve block: a narrative review [^5e16a905]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications

Local Anesthetic-Related Complications

The risk of injecting local anesthetics into blood vessels during the process of SCN block is highly unlikely. Currently, no complications related to SCN block have been reported, however, it is essential to remain vigilant towards allergic and toxic reactions caused by local anesthetics. Individuals with a predisposition to allergies or with a history of local anesthetic allergies should exercise caution. Amide-type local anesthetics have a lower occurrence of allergic reactions compared to ester-type local anesthetics. It is crucial to administer a safe dosage of local anesthetics during the blockade procedure and monitor for potential prodromal symptoms of toxicity.

Needle Trauma

During the process of blockade, repeated punctures or inadvertent injection of local anesthetics into the nerve can lead to temporary or permanent nerve damage. Moreover, if the puncture needle penetrates a blood vessel, it can result in concomitant vascular injury. To mitigate the complications arising from needle puncture, a comprehensive comprehension of the anatomical structure and precise positioning should be acquired prior to the puncture. Multiple aspiration techniques should be employed before administering medication, ensuring the secure fixation of the puncture needle.

### Benzocaine, butamben, and tetracaine hydrochloride (cetacaine anesthetic) [^1f31ff19]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Unpredictable adverse reactions (i.e. hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis) are extremely rare.

Localized allergic reactions may occur after prolonged or repeated use of any aminobenzoate anesthetic. The most common adverse reaction caused by local anesthetics is contact dermatitis characterized by erythema and pruritus that may progress to vesiculation and oozing. This occurs most commonly in patients following prolonged self-medication, which is contraindicated. If rash, urticaria, edema, or other manifestations of allergy develop during use, the drug should be discontinued. To minimize the possibility of a serious allergic reaction, Cetacaine preparations should not be applied for prolonged periods except under continual supervision. Dehydration of the epithelium or an escharotic effect may also result from prolonged contact.

Use in Pregnancy

Safe use of Cetacaine has not been established with respect to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, Cetacaine should not be used during early pregnancy, unless in the judgement of a physician, the potential benefits outweigh the unknown hazards. Routine precaution for the use of any topical anesthetic should be observed when Cetacaine is used.

### Anaphylactic-like reaction to methylene blue: case report and review of perioperative hypersensitivity reactions [^d040d782]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic-like reactions in the perioperative period are a significant concern for anesthesiologists and surgeons. With an incidence as high as one in 3500 and a mortality rate of 3 to 6 percent, proper management of these reactions is essential. The available surgical literature provides varied and unclear guidelines for determining the nature of these reactions and has no consensus treatment algorithm. The authors present a rare case of hypersensitivity reaction to methylene blue during cleft lip repair. A review of current literature for best-practice evaluation and management guidelines follows.

Methods

Literature review was performed using search terms including "anaphylaxis", "hypersensitivity", "allergy", "perioperative", and "intraoperative". Results from basic science literature, case reports, and clinical studies were used, as were personal communications with leading investigators in allergy and immunology.

Results

Despite variations in incidence, reporting, evaluation, and management, the authors found that immediate treatment should include epinephrine, steroids, and histamine-1- and histamine-2-blocking agents. In the event of reactions with characteristics of anaphylaxis, obtaining tryptase levels 1, 4, and 24 hours after the event provides the most accurate biochemical evidence. Skin-prick and intradermal testing by an allergy specialist should be performed 6 or more weeks after the reaction.

Conclusions

With the unique exposure risks in the perioperative period, it is the surgeon's responsibility to aid in the proper immediate and short-term treatment of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic-like reactions. Proper biochemical evaluation at the time of reaction can be critical in helping the patient avoid future reactions and should not be overlooked.

### Preventing the complications associated with the use of dermal fillers in facial aesthetic procedures: an expert group consensus report [^c74abae5]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Anaesthesia

One of the main concerns of the patients with regard to the injection of the filler injections is the pain and discomfort associated, especially for the first-time patient. Whereas topical anaesthetics alone can provide adequate anaesthesia for some procedures, others require the injection of a local anaesthetic. However, while anaesthesia that blocks the nerves is effective against the pain, it may distort the area to be treated, as well as lengthen and complicate the procedure. Indeed, lidocaine injected in the infraorbital region distorts the local anatomy and may result in suboptimal correction. Furthermore, there is a possibility that patients may experience an allergic reaction to lidocaine. However, a review of the literature showed that the incidence of true allergic reactions to local anaesthetic agents (including lidocaine and other products) was < 1%.

Injection Technique

Selecting the appropriate technique for administration, based on the physician's experience, the patient and the characteristics of the filler, helps to ensure successful outcomes and limits the incidence of complications. To identify and react to any adverse reaction, injections must be performed slowly and with caution. In terms of the filler, that amount administered should be adapted to each individual and injected in small quantities at multiple points to avoid overfilling. Before injecting, aspiration should be performed as a prophylactic measure, particularly in highly vascularized areas, and a new needle without filler should be used prior to deep bolus injections.

For needle treatment, the panel recommends that adequate suctioning should be employed before injecting, at least 0.1–0.2 cc of air, and waiting for at least 4 s. Additionally, the experts also recommend changing the needle every 3 or 4 punctures. If the treatment is going to be administered using a blunt tip cannula, the panel recommends paying special attention to maintaining it sterile:
The cannula should not be touched.
Non-sterile areas should not be touched with the cannula.
The cannula should be kept in its cap when not in use (it is recommended that antiseptic solution is put into the cannula cap).

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^2bce60f8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Dermatologic surgery — management of lidocaine allergy and alternatives: Allergy to lidocaine is rare, with a genuine immunologic reaction representing only 1% of adverse reactions, and for patients with a true allergy an ester type local anesthetic is an option because cross-reaction is rare and often related to paraben allergy in preservative-containing amide preparations or cosensitization. Injection of 1% diphenhydramine has been suggested but has a longer onset of action (5 min vs 1 min for lidocaine) and limited efficacy. Bacteriostatic saline (0.9% benzyl alcohol in normal saline) is another alternative, and 1 study suggests injection of this agent with epinephrine may be less painful than diphenhydramine. Based on the work group's experience, injection of diphenhydramine or bacteriostatic normal saline may be useful as an anesthetic for small excisions and biopsies in patients with sensitivity or allergy to lidocaine.

### Radio contrast imaging for continuous epidural infusion in humans: a report of three cases [^bc8a3a1d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This prospective, invasive clinical research was conducted at our tertiary teaching hospital in Japan with institutional review board approval of Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Okayama University Hospital, Ethics Committee (Number: 05002) and after obtaining the patients' written informed consent for study participation. This study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Patients who required CT-guided procedures, such as embolism of a liver artery or radiofrequency treatment of the liver, which are usually performed under epidural analgesia, were included. Only conscious patients with whom we would be able to communicate were included.

Patients with allergies to contrast agents, renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL), liver dysfunction (serum AST/ALT > 100 mg/dL), severe cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%), convulsions, severe asthma or thyroid dysfunction were excluded from the study.

According to a previous anticancer therapy protocol, the required sample size in this study was three to nine patients. Since we did not know what dose of epidural contrast would be appropriate for continuous administration, we created a new protocol for this research, keeping the concentration of contrast at the lowest level possible for patient safety.

The main outcome evaluated was the feasibility of continuous epidural contrast administration at the end of the therapeutic procedure being performed under CT guidance by authorized radiologists. The secondary outcome evaluated was the safety of the procedure in terms of the viscosity resulting from mixing the contrast agent with ropivacaine. Additionally, we observed the patients for side effects to the procedure, including allergic and anaphylactic reactions to the injection of contrast. We also investigated the relationship between the level of analgesic effect and epidural spread of the contrast agent.

The study was to be performed in three steps, each step using different concentrations of the contrast agent mixed with a local anesthetic and being performed in three patients. At each step, the corresponding dose of contrast agent was administered epidurally, and the patient was assessed clinically for the local anesthetic effect, while CT scan was performed to assess the spread of the contrast agent.

If Step 1 could not be successfully performed, Step 2 would be performed, and if Step 2 was unsuccessful, Step 3 would be performed. According to the study protocol, if Step 3 could not be successfully performed in even a single case, continuous epidural contrast injection would be deemed impossible.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 209: obstetric analgesia and anesthesia [^e7c9e588]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Local anesthetics — epinephrine adjuncts, allergy, and toxicity management are summarized: epinephrine may be added to local anesthetic solutions to delay absorption and increase duration of blockade by inducing vasoconstriction, but epinephrine should not be used in women with medical conditions, such as cardiac disorders, that necessitate the avoidance of maternal tachycardia. Risks of local anesthetics include allergic reaction and toxicity; anaphylaxis may occur with use of chloroprocaine and tetracaine but is unlikely with bupivacaine, lidocaine, and ropivacaine, and allergic reactions to preservatives (methylparaben) or antioxidants (sulfites) in prepared local anesthetic solutions are possible. Toxicity may be manifested with neurologic symptoms (eg, seizures, coma) or cardiac symptoms (eg, arrhythmias, myocardial depression), and hypoxemia and acidosis, which potentiate local anesthetic systemic toxicity, should be corrected quickly with intravenous lipid emulsion administered by an anesthesiologist.

### Adverse reactions and alleged allergy to local anesthetics: analysis of 331 patients [^84c9e536]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of true local anesthetic (LA) allergy among patients referred for suspected hypersensitivity and to describe the main characteristics of adverse drug reactions (ADR) induced by LA in our population. We retrospectively analyzed the medical files of patients referred to the Department of Dermatovenereology, University Hospital Center Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia, for the investigation of LA hypersensitivity in the period between January 2000 and December 2012. A total of 331 patients underwent skin testing and, in cases of negative results, subcutaneous exposition to LA. In patients with suspected delayed reaction, patch test was performed. Altogether, 331 patients reported 419 independent ADR occurring during 346 procedures. Most commonly, patients reported having only one ADR, but 41 (12.4%) of them had two reactions, 14 (4.2%) had three, five (1.5%) had four and in one patient (0.3%) five ADR to LA were observed. The majority of reactions occurred during dental procedures when most commonly lidocaine and articaine were used. Local reactions were reported in 44 patients, whereas 490 general symptoms occurred during 375 independent ADR in 287 patients. The most common symptoms were cardiovascular system reactions in 89 patients (18.2%). Allergic reaction was detected in three patients (0.91%). One patient showed immediate-type reaction to bupivacaine and two patients had a delayed-type reaction to lidocaine. Adverse reactions to LA are common and are mostly due to their pharmacological properties and drug combinations or psychogenic origin. Allergic accidents to LA are rare.

Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to the local anesthetic agent or to other components in the formulation. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.

### Preventing the complications associated with the use of dermal fillers in facial aesthetic procedures: an expert group consensus report [^7d94aaeb]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Medical History

Obtaining a complete medical history is crucial to prevent potential complications. The medical history should scour for any medical illnesses, allergies, medications used and prior aesthetic procedures. For instance, the risk of bruising is greater when patients have bleeding disorders, uncontrolled hypertension or when anticoagulants like aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin are being taken. Similarly, we must check for hypersensitivity to lidocaine. Anti-ds DNA antibodies cross-react with collagen and, hence, collagen-based fillers should not be used in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. When evaluating patients with cardiovascular diseases or those who take anticoagulant medication, it is important to determine the time frame during which the patient will be taking the medication and the risk associated with temporary discontinuation of the medication.

Although there have only occasionally been reports of adverse events or suboptimal results, caution is advised when injecting hyaluronic acid-based fillers derived from Streptococcus species in patients with any prior streptococcal disease. Indeed, this may be a source of delayed reactions. It should be noted that some of the currently available non-animal hyaluronic acid-based fillers contain trace amounts of gram-positive bacterial proteins and, therefore, they are contraindicated for patients with a history of allergies to such material. Finally, it is extremely important to check for any signs of inflammation in the area to be treated. Active inflammation will provoke degradation of the filler.

Table 2 summarizes the minimum requirements in terms of the information that should be gleaned from the patient's medical records for aesthetic procedures.

Table 2
Minimum requirements demanded to the medical records in aesthetic procedures

* The panel recommends to pay special attention for asking about allergy/hypersensitivity reactions to lidocaine (information may be obtained from previous dental procedures)

 According to the panel recommendations, previous aesthetic procedures must be thoroughly assessed. The physician must be sure about the filler/fillers injected

* After a dental procedure, such as dental removal, dental cleaning or drilling the panel recommends to wait, at least, 1 month before injecting the fillers

### Consensus recommendations for paediatric airway topicalisation using lidocaine [^8ea768be]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse reactions

Whilst rare, adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis and local anaesthetic systemic toxicity secondary to lidocaine use in children have been reported. WebAIRS (the anaesthetic incident reporting system from the Australian and New Zealand Tripartite Anaesthetic Data Committee) captured nine cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity during regional anaesthesia in Australia and New Zealand; however, none of those reported were secondary to the use of lidocaine. The United States National Poison Data System captured 37 paediatric cases with adverse outcomes following topical lidocaine exposure over 20 years, yet none of these cases were secondary to airway topicalisation. Self‐reporting of cases in the airway topicalisation in paediatrics survey identified eight cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity following airway topicalisation seen globally among 1638 participants. Cases presented with a variety of signs/symptoms, including seizures; somnolence; twitches; tachyarrhythmia; and peri‐oral tingling.

Medical professionals have a responsibility to be open and transparent with patients and/or their families following adverse events. Sharing information with patients and detailed medical records can help prevent repeat circumstances by informing future care providers. Local and national procedures for incident reporting may vary, but engagement with such processes plays an important part in keeping patients safe.
Adverse reactions believed to be secondary to lidocaine topicalisation, e.g. local anaesthetic systemic toxicity, should be reported according to local and national procedures (Grade D, strong recommendation).
Where adverse reactions believed to be secondary to lidocaine topicalisation have occurred, parents or guardians should be informed (Grade D, strong recommendation).

Institutional responsibilities

The recommendations set out in this document aim to improve patient safety. They serve to support clinicians and organisations. Multidisciplinary team involvement, supported by a systematic review, has been key to their production. Institutions may adopt a number of strategies to mitigate against risk; these may include individual risk leads; local polices; and training programmes. Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity is a recognised anaesthetic emergency, and we expect most departments will already have strategies in place to support delivery of specific guidelines related to its management.
20% intravenous lipid emulsion should be immediately available in departments where lidocaine topicalisation takes place (Grade C, strong recommendation).
Departments should conduct multidisciplinary simulation training regularly covering the management of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (Grade D, strong recommendation).
Departments carrying out topicalisation should have a standard operating procedure or local guideline which is reviewed regularly and updated in line with emerging evidence (Grade D, strong recommendation).

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^d99b2bec]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Criteria for referral to a specialist centre for investigation

Patients in whom allergic or non-allergic anaphylaxis is suspected should be referred to a specialist clinic for investigation. A patient should be referred if there is any of the following:

Unexplained cardiac arrest during anaesthesia.
Unexplained, unexpected hypotension (for example a decrease of mean arterial pressure of more than 30 mmHg) which requires active treatment.
Unexplained, unexpected bronchospasm, particularly if the bronchospasm is severe, causes a significant decrease in oxygen saturation and is relatively resistant to treatment.
Widespread rash, flushing or urticaria.
Angioedema.

A detailed analysis of events surrounding the suspected anaphylactic reaction must be undertaken. The time of onset of the reaction in relation to induction and other events is the most important information. All drugs and other agents to which the patient was exposed before and during the anaesthetic as well as their timing in relation to the reaction must be recorded.

Details sent to the specialist centre along with a letter of referral must include:

A legible photocopy of the anaesthetic record
A legible photocopy of the recovery room chart
Legible photocopies of drug charts
A description of the reaction and time of onset in relation to induction
Details of blood tests sent and their timing in relation to the reaction
Contact details of the surgeon and the general practitioner

A standard referral proforma is useful (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information).

### Benzocaine, butamben, and tetracaine hydrochloride (cetacaine topical anesthetic) [^ac8251e8]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Unpredictable adverse reactions (i.e. hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis) are extremely rare. Localized allergic reactions may occur after prolonged or repeated use of any aminobenzoate anesthetic. The most common adverse reaction caused by local anesthetics is contact dermatitis characterized by erythema and pruritus that may progress to vesiculation and oozing. This occurs most commonly in patients following prolonged self-medication, which is contraindicated. If rash, urticaria, edema, or other manifestations of allergy develop during use, the drug should be discontinued. To minimize the possibility of a serious allergic reaction, Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic Gel should not be applied for prolonged periods except under continual supervision. Dehydration of the epithelium or an escharotic effect may also result from prolonged contact.

Use in Pregnancy

Safe use of Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic Gel has not been established with respect to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic Gel should not be used during early pregnancy, unless in the judgement of a physician, the potential benefits outweigh the unknown hazards. Routine precaution for the use of any topical anesthetic should be observed when Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic Gel is used.

### Allergic reactions in anaesthesia: are suspected causes confirmed on subsequent testing? [^bfa7f4c9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this retrospective survey of possible allergic reactions during anaesthesia was to investigate whether the cause suspected by anaesthetists involved corresponded with the cause found on subsequent investigation in the Danish Anaesthesia Allergy Centre (DAAC).

Methods

Case notes and anaesthetic charts from 111 reactions in 107 patients investigated in the DAAC were scrutinized for either suspicions of or warnings against specific substances stated to be the cause of the supposed allergic reaction.

Results

In 67 cases, one or more substances were suspected. In 49 of these (73%) the suspected cause did not match the results of subsequent investigation, either a different substance being the cause or no cause being found. Only five cases (7%) showed a complete match between suspected cause and investigation result. In the remaining 13 cases (19%) there was a partial match, the right substance being suspected, but investigations showed an additional allergen or several substances, including the right substance being suspected.

Conclusions

An informed guess is not a reliable way of determining the cause of a supposed allergic reaction during anaesthesia and may put a significant number of patients at unnecessary risk. Some patients may be labelled with a wrong allergy, leading to unnecessary warnings against harmless substances, and some patients may be put at risk of subsequent re-exposure to the real allergen. Patients with suspected allergic reactions during anaesthesia should be referred for investigation in specialist centres whenever possible.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — Recommendation 45 (CBS): We suggest that challenges be performed, when feasible, to all potential culprit agents to which skin and/or in vitro testing is negative, before or in conjunction with use of these agents for a future surgical procedure. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Very Low. Graded challenge with suspected agents for which skin testing result is negative may also be carried out in collaboration with an anesthesiologist, and if necessary and feasible, in the operating room in conjunction with a planned procedure; in cases for which challenge with a NMBA is indicated, this can be accomplished through administration of a 10% "test dose" before the procedure; if tolerated without untoward reaction after a period of observation, full dosing can then be administered as indicated.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^1fc4f256]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis — testing, timing, and re-exposure: We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro–specific IgE testing be performed, when available, to all potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic culprits used during the perioperative period. If testing is not possible, we suggest referral to another center or, if necessary, use of the most efficacious agents structurally dissimilar from the most likely culprit. We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity testing to suspected culprit (and alternative) agents be delayed after POA, unless repeat surgery cannot be postponed. If surgery with general anesthesia is needed sooner, then testing may be performed when needed. We suggest that challenges be performed, when feasible, to all potential culprit agents to which skin and/or in vitro testing is negative, before or in conjunction with the use of these agents for a future surgical procedure. We suggest that repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and as directed by history and results of diagnostic evaluation.

### Contraindications to injection… [^7d84c6d5]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Contraindications to Injection Anesthetics There are few absolute contraindications for local injection anesthetics. Allergy to amide anesthetics such as lidocaine is rare, and when it does occur, it is usually caused by the preservative methylparaben. 1 One way to circumvent a potential allergic reaction is to use preservative-free lidocaine, which is available in single-dose vials. History of an allergy to an ester anesthetic such as procaine is not a contraindication to the use of lidocaine, 1 because they are chemically different, and cross-reaction is rare. Another approach includes using 1 percent diphenhydramine, which has proved effective in randomized studies.
2. Choosing a Local Anesthetic for Injection Local anesthetics are divided into amide and ester classes.

Historically, amide and ester anesthetics were both used, but esters lost their favor after reports of increased sensitization. Pinching the skin stimulates local sensory nerves, partially blocking the transmission of other painful stimuli. Injecting slowly and steadily can minimize the pain of the anesthetic itself. If clinically indicated, injecting into the subcutaneous tissues is less painful than infiltrating directly into the dermis to raise a wheal. Physicians should remember that ethyl chloride is flammable and should not be used with electrocautery. Complications of Injection Anesthetics Most local anesthetics rarely produce side effects. The most common complications occur during epidural administration or accidental intravascular administration. If large amounts of local anesthetics are absorbed rapidly, central nervous system and cardiovascular toxicity may occur.

The signs and symptoms of CNS toxicity induced by local anesthetic resemble vasovagal responses. Early symptoms, such as a metallic taste, tinnitus, lightheadedness, and confusion, are followed by tremors and shivering. Ultimately, generalized seizures and respiratory arrest may occur. 1, 4 Toxic reactions to local anesthetics are best avoided by slow and careful injection to avoid intravascular administration. Low doses well below the toxic range should be used in patients with known peripheral vascular and cardiovascular disease.

### Prilocaine hydrochloride (citanest plain) [^c5d35566]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Allergic

Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to prilocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.

Neurologic

The incidences of adverse reactions (e.g., persistent neurologic deficit) associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the technique employed, the total dose of local anesthetic administered, the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical condition of the patient.

### Adverse reactions to drugs and biologics in patients with clonal mast cell disorders: a Work group report of the mast cells disorder committee, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^baa5297c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Opioids, local anesthetics, and adjuncts in mastocytosis — histamine release and allergy risk: It is generally believed that most opioids directly induce histamine release; however, fentanyl did not induce either histamine or tryptase release, and in vivo microdialysis showed only codeine and pethidine induced MC activation. Vasodilatation and hypotension from opioids are reported to be less prominent with fentanyl and sufentanil than with morphine because fentanyl and sufentanil did not induce histamine release during use. For local anesthetics, lidocaine and other amide‑type agents rarely lead to allergic responses and have in vitro immunomodulatory effects; true IgE‑mediated allergy among suspicious cases is described as less than 1%. Guidance also notes limited information on colloid fluid therapy, recommending gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch if needed, and that randomized controlled trials and meta‑analyses are not available; recommendations generally emphasize avoiding histamine‑releasing drugs. Skin testing to anesthetic drugs in mastocytosis before procedures is not routinely recommended.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^05ef0c2a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

NMBAs, sugammadex, neostigmine, hypnotic agents, opioids, local anesthetics (LAs), chlorhexidine, and latex — skin testing and challenge guidance includes that for neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) the sensitivity of skin tests in NMBA anaphylaxis is greater than 95%, testing should be done by PTs followed by IDTs, and when a test is positive, investigation for cross-reactivity with other available NMBAs should be performed to identify a safe alternative. Sugammadex and neostigmine may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT is negative using nonirritant dilutions up to 1/10 and up to 1/100, respectively. Hypnotic agents may be skin tested undiluted by PTs, followed by IDTs up to 1/10 dilution if PT results are negative. For opioids, phenylpiperidines may be skin tested undiluted by PTs followed by IDTs if PT results are negative and 1/10 dilution should not be exceeded; additionally, 1/10 and 1/1000 morphine dilutions are recommended for PT and IDT, respectively. For LAs (without epinephrine), PTs may be performed undiluted followed by IDTs if PT is negative and 1/10 dilution should not be exceeded; a subcutaneous incremental challenge uses a single-blind saline step 15 to 20 minutes after the skin PT, then undiluted injections of 0.1 mL, 0.5 mL, and 1 mL, and it is ideal to wait 15 to 20 minutes between steps. Chlorhexidine (without alcohol) may be skin tested up to 5 mg/mL by PTs followed by IDTs up to 0.002 mg/mL if PT is negative, and in Europe latex allergy investigation is performed by PTs using commercial extracts with excellent sensitivity of skin tests.

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^1fa0083e]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The AAGBI published its first guidelines on suspected anaphylactic reactions in 1990. Subsequent revisions were published in 1995 and 2003. The current guidelines incorporate advice from a large number of clinical immunologists, allergists and anaesthetists throughout the UK. In common with the 1995 and the 2003 editions, this report is published jointly with the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI).

This document is intended to be concordant with, and complementary to, the 2007 Scandinavian Clinical Practice Guidelines, the 2008 Resuscitation Council UK guidelines and the BSACI guidelines: Investigation of suspected anaphylaxis during anaesthesia.

These guidelines apply only to suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia and it is presupposed that the patient is in the care of a trained anaesthetist.

### Prevention of local anesthetic systemic toxicity [^069b3b0e]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although new drugs and techniques may improve outcomes when unintended high blood levels of local anesthetics occur, the primary focus of daily practice should remain the prevention of such events. Although adoption of no single "safety step" will reliably prevent systemic toxicity, the combination of several procedures seems to have reduced the frequency of systemic toxicity since 1981. These include the use of minimum effective doses, careful aspiration, and incremental injection, coupled with the use of intravascular markers when large doses are used. Epinephrine remains the most widely used and studied marker, but its reliability is impaired in the face of beta-blockade, anesthesia, advanced age, and active labor. As an alternative, the use of subtoxic doses of local anesthetics themselves can produce subjective symptoms in unpremedicated patients. Fentanyl has also been confirmed to produce sedation in pregnant women when used as an alternative. The use of ultrasound observation of needle placement and injection may be useful, but has also been reported as not completely reliable. Constant vigilance and suspicion are still needed along with a combination of as many of these safety steps as practical.

Skin testing timing and special conditions — post-reaction interval, modifiers, and pregnancy: It is usually recommended that skin testing be done at least 4 to 6 weeks after the clinical reaction to avoid false-negative results; dialysis and heavy tobacco smoking may lead to a decreased response, dermographism may increase reactivity, and skin testing can be performed at any point during pregnancy, especially for local anesthetics (LAs) and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs).

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^c4b4fe82]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Local anaesthetics

Anaphylactic reactions to local anaesthetic drugs are very uncommon. Local anaesthetic esters are more likely than amides to provoke a Type lV allergic reaction. Preservatives such as methyl-paraben or metabisulphites may be responsible in some cases. It has been suggested that inadvertent intravascular injection of a local anaesthetic or the systemic absorption of adrenaline may be responsible for many of the reported reactions. Reactions occurring in the dental chair may also be associated with idiopathic angioedema or latex allergy.

Opioids

Opioids are an uncommon cause of anaesthesia-related anaphylaxis. Diagnosis is difficult and the true incidence is unknown. Morphine, pethidine and codeine are well-known to cause non-specific histamine release which precludes diagnostic skin testing. The diagnosis of opioid anaphylaxis often rests on a careful history and the exclusion of other possibilities. Challenge testing may be appropriate in some cases but may be performed only in specialist centres.

Anaesthetic induction agents

Anaphylaxis to propofol is very uncommon. The antigenic determinant may be the isopropyl groups. It has been stated that patients with egg allergy or soy allergy should avoid propofol but there is no strongly-supportive evidence. It has been suggested that propofol anaphylaxis is more likely if lignocaine is added to reduce pain on injection: there is no evidence to support this suggestion. Anaphylaxis to thiopental has become extremely uncommon, probably reflecting the decline in its use. A small number of cases of midazolam anaphylaxis have been reported.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Several mechanisms may be responsible for reactions to NSAIDs. Inhibition of the PGE 2 pathway leads to excessive leukotriene synthesis and subsequent mediator release, causing urticaria or bronchospasm. IgE-mediated reactions may also occur in relation to some NSAIDs. Fatal anaphylaxis has been described after oral administration of NSAIDs.

Halogenated volatile anaesthetics

There are no published reports of anaphylaxis to halogenated volatile anaesthetics. The rare fulminant form of hepatitis associated with halothane has an immune basis which is unrelated to anaphylaxis.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Allergic-Type Reactions

Assess if the patient has had allergic-type reactions to amide-type local anesthetics or to other formulation ingredients, such as the antimicrobial preservative methylparaben contained in multiple-dose vials or sulfites in epinephrine-containing solutions [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions (6)].

Temporary Loss of Sensation and Motor Activity After Caudal or Epidural Anesthesia

When appropriate, patients should be informed in advance that they may experience temporary loss of sensation and motor activity, usually in the lower half of the body, following proper administration of caudal or epidural anesthesia.

Instructions After Dental Injection of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection

Advise patients receiving dental injections of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride Injection not to chew solid foods or to test the anesthetized area by biting or probing until anesthesia has worn off (up to 7 hours) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

Methemoglobinemia

Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic considerations for TAVR emphasize that patients are at a high risk for procedural complications, including hemodynamic collapse; careful planning and intraoperative anesthetic management can mitigate this risk, and preventing prolonged hypotension is a key goal. Preoperative evaluation pays special attention to factors that may predict higher risk of intraprocedural instability, particularly depressed EF, elevated pulmonary pressures, significant mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, incomplete revascularization, collateral-dependent coronary and cerebral circulation, chronic lung disease, heart failure, and acute/chronic kidney disease. In patients least likely to tolerate rapid ventricular pacing and hypotension, preventive measures may be instituted and steps taken to allow for rapid institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, and rarely, elective bypass may be utilized. Of critical importance is a baseline evaluation of the airway with a focus on the ease or difficulty of emergently securing the airway during cardiovascular compromise or collapse, attention to possible equipment obstruction (such as from the c-arm) that often limits access, and a review of allergies, particularly to iodinated contrast, performed routinely.

### Improving mucosal anesthesia for awake endotracheal intubation with a novel method: a prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^e1fa2a71]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Awake intubation consists of placing an endotracheal tube in the trachea while a patient continues to breathe spontaneously. This technique can be utilized in many different situations to help control a potentially unstable airway. However, awake intubation can be a difficult, time-consuming maneuver for the anesthesiologist and an unpleasant experience for the patient. Satisfactory execution of awake intubation needs both moderate sedation and sufficient topical anesthesia. Thus, topical anesthesia of the upper airways, including the oropharyngeal and subglottic tracheal mucosa, is a crucial element in providing adequate comfort for the patient throughout the procedure.

Traditionally, the standard of care at our institution for topical anesthesia of the oropharyngeal mucosa is with oropharyngeal tetracaine (0.5 ~ 1%) or lidocaine (4%) sprays, while topical anesthesia of the subglottic tracheal mucosa is provided by tetracaine (2%) transcricoid or intratracheal injection. Tetracaine is a potent local anesthetic commonly used as the standard of care for awake intubation in many health care institutions. Application of tetracaine can effectively blunt the cough reflex and provide topical anesthesia for procedures requiring mucosal anesthesia, such as bronchoscopy and endotracheal intubation. However, the standard of care for awake intubation is potentially complicated by the undesirable properties of tetracaine sprays, including its narrow safety profile, sialogogic effects, and bitter taste.

Dyclonine hydrochloride, a relatively new and different chemical compound with local anesthetic properties, was initially adopted for endoscopic procedures to reduce pain, nausea, patient movements, and to lubricate the gastroscope. Multiple reports have shown that dyclonine is more effective than tetracaine and lidocaine in providing adequate mucosal anesthesia. In daily clinical practice, the oral application of dyclonine hydrochloride mucilage does not involve as many complicated steps as tetracaine sprays do in the current standard of care regimen for awake intubation. Additionally, dyclonine can be safely used in patients with documented allergy to bupivacaine and procaine. However, dyclonine is rarely utilized as a topical anesthetic for patients requiring awake endotracheal intubation. Therefore, it is worth further investigating whether dyclonine could be a potential mucosal anesthetic for use in awake intubation.

In this prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial, the authors compared the mucosal anesthetic efficacy of oral dyclonine hydrochloride mucilage to the current standard of care, pharyngeal tetracaine sprays, for performing awake endotracheal intubation.

Severe local tissue damage. (5.2)

5.1 Respiratory Reactions

Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. An emergency tray should always be available.

If a potential allergy is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration, i.e., 0.05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection. Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing, a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein.

5.2 Severe local tissue damage

Extravasation during injection can result in severe local tissue damage due to high pH of fluorescein solution. The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur: Sloughing of the skin, superficial phlebitis, subcutaneous granuloma, and toxic neuritis along the median nerve in the antecubital area. Complications resulting from extravasation can cause severe pain in the arm for up to several hours. When extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented [see ADMINISTRATION (2.3) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)].

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^6ca627d1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — post-testing management states that once testing is conducted as earlier, negative tests should ideally be confirmed with a challenge, but repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision making (SDM). A challenge can be conducted before a future operation by anesthesia and, if desired, a 10% test dose can be given before the challenge if there is concern; when a challenge is not feasible, agents structurally unrelated to any agents used in the original POA event can be used, assuming the structurally unrelated agents are equally efficacious.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^3cce5a42]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — risk, likely culprits, and post-event evaluation are described: POA has a greater risk of death than other anaphylaxis types and occurs at a rate of 1.53 per 100,000 cases; multiple agents are often given in close succession, and antibiotics and paralytics (neuromuscular blocking agents [NMBAs]) are more common culprits. After POA, repeat anesthesia may proceed with shared decision-making guided by history and diagnostic results; immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal, if available) and/or in vitro–specific IgE testing should be performed to all potential and prominent pharmacologic culprits, including alternatives available at the facility. Delaying immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for 4 to 6 weeks after anaphylaxis is generally recommended due to a refractory period; graded challenge of agents with negative test results can proceed safely, and if testing or challenge is not feasible, avoidance of culprit exposures may be considered if equally efficacious, structurally unrelated alternatives are available.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^f658321b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Local infiltrative anesthesia additives — hyaluronidase, buffering, and mixing agents guidance includes: Hyaluronidase may be used as an additive to local infiltration anesthesia to ease diffusion and reduce contour distortion, yet there are insufficient data to support a recommendation for its routine use in dermatologic surgery. Hyaluronidase should not be administered to patients with a known bee venom allergy. The addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetic, particularly lidocaine with epinephrine, is recommended to decrease the pain of delivery by subcutaneous or intradermal infiltration. Preinjection of buffered lidocaine solution is suggested to reduce the pain of bupivacaine infiltration. It is unclear whether mixing multiple anesthetics for local infiltration poses further benefit over use of a single agent.

### Procaine hydrochloride (novocain) [^9b6c3be1]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Careful and constant monitoring
of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital
signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be performed
after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at
such times that restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, light-headedness,
numbness, and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus,
dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, or drowsiness
may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.

Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor
should be used cautiously and in carefully circumscribed quantities
in areas of the body supplied by end arteries, or those areas having
otherwise compromised blood supply such as digits, nose, external
ear, penis. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and hypertensive
vascular disease may exhibit an exaggerated vasoconstrictor response.
Ischemic injury or necrosis may result.

NOVOCAIN
should be used with caution in patients with known allergies and sensitivities.
A thorough history of the patient's prior experience with NOVOCAIN
or other local anesthetics as well as concomitant or recent drug use
should be taken. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.)

Because ester-type local anesthetics such as NOVOCAIN
are hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase produced by the liver and
excreted by the kidneys, these drugs, especially repeat doses, should
be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Because of their
inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, patients with
severe hepatic disease are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma
concentrations. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution
in patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may
be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with
the prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs.

### Causes of perioperative hypersensitivity reactions in the Netherlands from 2002 to 2014 [^9a0b7d3e]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Specific serum IgE could be measured for chlorhexidine (from 2007 onward), NRL and rocuronium using ImmunoCAP ® System fluorescence enzyme immunoassay. Results of all performed drug provocation tests (DPT, including antibiotics, NSAIDs, colloids, local anaesthetics, proton pump inhibitors and analgesics) were collected. If a patient was exposed to a suspected drug after the reaction without an allergic reaction, this was noted as a negative DPT. DPT were performed according to the local protocols, consisted of ≥ 3 incremental steps and were considered positive if consistent objective symptoms were reproduced as based on the interpretation of the attending allergist.

Outcome of diagnostics evaluation was defined as:
Definitive immediate allergic hypersensitivity: suggestive history (typical symptoms and time interval; reaction < 1 h after drug exposition or < 2 h for NSAID) confirmed by detection of a culprit drug with ≥ 1 positive diagnostic result;
Probable immediate hypersensitivity: suggestive history without identification of culprit drug. (Eg other causes excluded, skin tests/specific IgE negative and DPT not feasible);
Non‐specific mast cell degranulation: suggestive symptoms of mild cutaneous symptoms, negative diagnostics;
Hypersensitivity unlikely: uncharacteristic history without identification of culprit drug;
Idiopathic angioedema: isolated angioedema without identification of culprit drug;
Other diagnosis: NSAID‐exacerbated disease (NERD) or transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI).

This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review committee [protocol number 14‐478/C]. Exemption regarding obtaining informed consent was granted according to the GDPR. Two hundred forty‐six patients were included (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of patients with suspected perioperative drug hypersensitivity reactions

A specific causal agent could be identified (definite immediate hypersensitivity) in 97 patients (39.4%) and was considered probable in another 51 (20.7%) patients. In fifty‐eight (23.6%) patients, the reaction was supposedly caused by non‐specific mast cell degranulation, whereas in 30 patients (12.2%) an underlying POH was considered to be very unlikely. In ten patients, an alternative diagnosis could be made, including spontaneous angioedema (n = 7, 2.8%), NERD (n = 2, 0.8%) and TRALI (one patient, 0.4%). In five of the 97 patients with definite immediate hypersensitivity, sensitization of two potential culprits was demonstrated.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for local anesthetic systemic toxicity, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ASRA 2018 guidelines recommend to maintain a low threshold for considering the diagnosis of LAST in patients with atypical or unexpected presentation of CNS or cardiac signs and symptoms after receiving more than a minimal dose of local anesthetic based on the overall variability of LAST signs and symptoms, the timing of onset, and association with various disease states.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: an overview of current guidelines [^2ababf58]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 | Healthcare Professionals Should Be Trained to Recognise and Treat Severe Anaphylaxis

Given that RA is not a rare occurrence in either the community or hospital setting and the underuse of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, healthcare professionals and prehospital providers must be familiar with the correct recognition of anaphylaxis, understand the steps which are essential to the adequate management of RA. For example, staff working in Emergency Departments and Allergy Challenge settings should undergo simulation training which includes the management of RA — something which has been done for staff in the perioperative setting for many years but also in a paediatric emergency department and an allergy clinic. High-fidelity simulation training has been shown to improve performance during resuscitation, and it is likely that this applies to specific simulation training on RA, although data are limited as to whether this translates into improved outcomes. In the particular context of perioperative anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis may be difficult to recognise as most anaesthetic inductions are associated with a slight, transient drop in blood pressure. However, most of these situations resolve spontaneously or after administration of a small dose of vasopressor. In anaphylaxis, hypotension is generally more severe, resistant to low-dose vasopressors, associated with tachycardia and often bronchospasm (32% of cases in the French GERAP cohort) and cutaneous signs (43% of cases in the French GERAP cohort). Interestingly, anaphylaxis is also associated with a sharp drop in end-tidal CO2, which is particularly specific to this situation and considered as a potential marker of severity.

### Mepivacaine hydrochloride (scandonest 3% plain) [^194e62f0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:

Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics:

MEPIVACAINE SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES AND SENSITIVITIES. A thorough history of the patient's prior experience with mepivacaine or other local anesthetics as well as concomitant or recent drug use should be taken (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Patients allergic to methylparaben or para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross-sensitivity to agents of the amide type such as mepivacaine. Since mepivacaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, it should be used cautiously in patients with liver and renal disease.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Studies of mepivacaine HCl in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been conducted.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this solution. It is also not known whether this solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. This solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers:

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this solution is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use:

Great care must be exercised in adhering to safe concentrations and dosages for pedodontic administration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^42d97c0f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anaphylaxis (POA) — diagnostic testing, challenges, anesthesia planning, and pretreatment are addressed with suggestion-level language. We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro specific-IgE testing be performed, when available, to all potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic culprits used during the perioperative period, and if testing is not possible, we suggest referral to another center or, if necessary, use of the most efficacious agents structurally dissimilar from the most likely culprit. We suggest that immediate hypersensitivity testing to suspected culprit (and alternative) agents should be delayed after POA, unless repeat surgery cannot be postponed, and if surgery with general anesthesia is needed sooner, testing should be performed when needed. We suggest that challenges be performed, when feasible, to all potential culprit agents to which skin and/or in vitro testing is negative, before or in conjunction with use of these agents for a future surgical procedure, and we suggest that repeat anesthesia may proceed in the context of shared decision-making and as directed by history and results of diagnostic evaluation. We suggest that avoidance of culprit pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic agents associated with POA may be considered, regardless of test results if challenge is not feasible and if equally efficacious, structurally unrelated alternatives are available, and we offer no recommendation for or against the use of pretreatment before return to the operating room in patients with negative cutaneous (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro specific-IgE testing (and challenge when possible) result to all suspected POA culprit agents.

Regarding specific circumstances for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to patients with perioperative anaphylaxis, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining immediate hypersensitivity skin testing (percutaneous and intradermal) and/or in vitro-specific IgE testing, when available, in all potential pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic culprits used during the perioperative period. Consider referring to another center if testing is not possible or, if necessary, use the most efficacious agents structurally dissimilar from the most likely culprit.

5.1 	Respiratory Reactions

Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. An emergency tray should always be available.

If a potential allergy is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration, i.e., 0.05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection. Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing, a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein.

5.2 	Severe local tissue damage

Extravasation during injection can result in severe local tissue damage due to high pH of fluorescein solution. The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur: Sloughing of the skin, superficial phlebitis, subcutaneous granuloma, and toxic neuritis along the median nerve in the antecubital area. Complications resulting from extravasation can cause severe pain in the arm for up to several hours. When extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented [see Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.6)].

### Anaphylactic reaction to lidocaine… [^ce074f1b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Lidocaine hydrochloride is an amide-type local anesthetic, commonly used for facial plastic as well as other surgical procedures. In an unusual case of reproducible anaphylactic reaction to lidocaine, early treatment with epinephrine, oxygenation, and intravenous fluid resuscitation resulted in relief of the symptoms. This case demonstrates the importance of sensitivity testing and choosing an appropriate alternative local anesthetic in a patient with a history of possible allergy to lidocaine.

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^e4610fcf]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Recognition and clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis

In a closely monitored patient such as during anaesthesia, when a fall in blood pressure, change in heart rate or difficulty with ventilation are noticed, anaphylaxis is so rarely the cause that inevitably treatment is given for another diagnosis before anaphylaxis is recognised; the response to this treatment has commonly delayed or even prevented recognition of the true cause. It is therefore probable that many grade I and II acute allergic reactions to anaesthetic drugs are missed. Conversely, a cause other than allergic anaphylaxis seems more likely in around one-third of the patients referred to specialist centres for investigation of suspected anaphylaxis during anaesthesia.

Previous history

Any clue that appropriately raises anticipation of anaphylaxis will be helpful. A previous history of reaction to anaesthetic drugs, antibiotics, other drugs, chlorhexidine or latex should obviously lead to appropriate avoidance. Because it is always possible the wrong trigger factor was identified, the exact details of exposure leading to any previous reaction should be sought during the pre-operative assessment. Cross-reactivity between non-anaesthetic drugs such as pholcodine or environmental chemicals containing quaternary ammonium groups such as cosmetics and detergents has been proposed as the source of sensitivity to opioids and muscle relaxants: a history of cutaneous sensitivity to cosmetics or rashes from cough medicines should raise caution.

Anaphylaxis to amoxicillin and cephalosporins is commonest in asthmatic smokers who have had multiple courses of these antibiotics without reacting: the symptoms of anaphylaxis in such a patient are likely to be initially misinterpreted (quite reasonably) as those expected from anaesthesia in an asthmatic smoker.

### Complications of local anesthesia used in oral and maxillofacial surgery [^b29ec920]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Local anesthetics are used routinely in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Local anesthetics are safe and effective drugs but do have risks that practitioners need to be aware of. This article reviews the complications of local anesthesia. A brief history is provided and the regional and systemic complications that can arise from using local anesthesia are discussed. These complications include paresthesia, ocular complications, allergies, toxicity, and methemoglobinemia. Understanding the risks involved with local anesthesia decreases the chances of adverse events occurring and ultimately leads to improved patient care.

### The importance of prolonged provocation in drug allergy-results from a Danish allergy clinic [^cbad14d0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Drug provocation is the "Gold Standard" in drug allergy investigation. Recent studies suggest that a negative drug provocation on first dose should be followed by a prolonged provocation over several days.

Objective

To evaluate drug allergy investigations on the basis of drug provocation, including prolonged provocation.

Methods

Data from adult patients investigated for drug allergy in a Danish Allergy Clinic during the period 2010 to 2014 were entered into a database. Data included clinical details and results of provocations with suspected culprit drug (for penicillins performed only in specific IgE-negative patients). If provocation was negative on first dose, treatment was continued for 3 to 10 days.

Results

A total of 1,913 provocations were done in 1,659 patients, median age 46 years, of whom 1,237 (74.6%) were females. Drugs investigated were antibiotics, 1,776 (92.8%), of which 1,590 (89.5%) were penicillins; analgesics, 59 (3.1%); local anesthetics, 33 (1.7%); and other drugs, 45 (2.4%). In total, 211 of 1,913 (11.0%) provocations were positive. Causes were antibiotics, 198 (93.8%), of which 167 (84.3%) were penicillins; analgesics, 7 (3.3%); local anesthetics, 0; and other drugs, 6 (2.8%). Only 43 (20.4%) provocations were positive on first dose, whereas 95 (45.0%) turned positive more than 3 days later.

Conclusions

Only 11.0% of the provocations were positive. Importantly, only 1 of 5 patients tested positive on the first dose, indicating that prolonged exposure should always be considered when drug provocation is included in allergy investigations. Most provocations were with penicillins, reflecting the pattern of antibiotic use in Denmark, which differs from that in other countries, especially outside Northern Europe.
