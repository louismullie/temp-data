## Question

How to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism ￼

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining tertiary hyperparathyroidism and establishing diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the indications for treatment and when to intervene. Next, I will compare surgical versus medical options, including efficacy and safety. After that, I need to choose among surgical strategies and outline preoperative planning. Then, I will detail intraoperative decision-making and postoperative management. Finally, I should consider special populations, long-term surveillance, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is best understood as persistent or autonomous hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation, characterized by elevated PTH with hypercalcemia or sometimes normocalcemia, reflecting autonomous parathyroid function that fails to suppress despite restored renal function, and it carries risks of bone disease, vascular calcification, and allograft dysfunction, so I need to ensure I'm capturing both biochemical and clinical contexts when diagnosing it [^3c5ce7a9] [^1cf6d496].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about who needs treatment; I should verify indications. The clearest indication is hypercalcemia, particularly when symptomatic or persistent beyond 6 to 12 months post-transplant, because hypercalcemic tertiary HPT correlates with worse allograft outcomes and should be treated rather than observed, whereas isolated PTH elevation without hypercalcemia may be observed initially but warrants closer follow-up given the risk of progression and bone complications [^7e7fe608] [^1b37b7fa] [^c92297f8].

> Next, I should review the two principal therapeutic modalities and their comparative effectiveness. Surgery achieves higher biochemical cure rates, with subtotal parathyroidectomy yielding about 98.7% initial cure and total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation about 100%, though recurrence can occur in a minority, whereas cinacalcet achieves normocalcemia in roughly 80.8% but requires ongoing therapy and has discontinuation rates around 6.4% due to side effects, so I need to weigh durability and tolerability when counseling patients [^34e31336] [^c2e38bb3].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit on hard outcomes. Observational data using time-varying analyses suggest that treating hypercalcemic tertiary HPT, whether by parathyroidectomy or cinacalcet, is associated with substantially lower risks of death-censored and all-cause allograft failure compared with no treatment, which strengthens the case for intervening rather than observing hypercalcemic disease, even though causality cannot be fully established from retrospective designs [^7e7fe608] [^1b37b7fa] [^fea39883].

> I will now examine surgical strategy, and I should double-check the trade-offs between subtotal parathyroidectomy and total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. Subtotal parathyroidectomy leaves a vascularized remnant and is associated with lower rates of permanent hypoparathyroidism, whereas total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation carries higher hypoparathyroidism risk but may facilitate easier management of recurrence in the forearm; multi-institutional data in transplant recipients favor subtotal parathyroidectomy to mitigate hypoparathyroidism while maintaining high cure rates, so I should align the approach with gland morphology and patient risk profile [^abac0cf6] [^c92297f8].

> But wait, what if the disease is focal rather than multigland hyperplasia. In carefully selected patients with single- or double-gland enlargement, a focused resection can be curative with excellent long-term outcomes, so preoperative localization and intraoperative confirmation become critical to avoid undertreatment or unnecessary bilateral exploration; I need to ensure imaging is used for localization rather than diagnosis, and that intraoperative PTH dynamics guide extent of resection [^56f98db3] [^6df1f788].

> Next, I should review preoperative planning and imaging so I don't miss ectopic or supernumerary glands. High-resolution neck ultrasound is a reasonable first-line modality, but sestamibi and cross-sectional imaging can improve localization of ectopic or mediastinal tissue, and given the high prevalence of supernumerary glands in renal hyperparathyroidism, I should maintain a low threshold to explore the thymic tongue and consider routine cervical thymectomy in reoperative or high-risk contexts to reduce recurrence [^6df1f788] [^667cb0d7].

> I need to check intraoperative decision tools and their pitfalls. Intraoperative PTH monitoring is useful to confirm adequate resection, with a commonly cited 50% drop from baseline predicting biochemical cure; however, PTH spikes can occur in up to about 23% of renal hyperparathyroidism cases and can confound interpretation, so I should obtain pre-incision baselines and interpret drops cautiously, integrating clinical judgment and anatomy to avoid false reassurance or unnecessary extension of surgery [^5ae575f9] [^a02688da].

> Let me consider postoperative management, especially the risk of hungry bone syndrome and hypocalcemia. Prophylactic calcium and active vitamin D are prudent, with taper as tolerated, and I should anticipate higher calcium requirements in patients with severe preoperative hyperparathyroid bone disease; if prolonged hypoparathyroidism emerges, recombinant PTH can be considered in refractory cases, and I should remember that a postoperative PTH that remains above normal does not necessarily indicate failure if calcium is normalized, which is the key endpoint in tertiary HPT [^235ce73d] [^cf791af0] [^eb218e96].

> Hold on, I should verify the role and limitations of cinacalcet for patients who decline or are poor surgical candidates. Cinacalcet effectively lowers calcium and PTH and can improve bone mineral density in transplant recipients, but it does not provide a durable cure and may cause gastrointestinal intolerance and hypocalcemia; thus, it is a reasonable bridge or alternative, with close monitoring of calcium and dose titration to effect, and I should reassess periodically for surgical candidacy [^34e31336] [^4390ab4e].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In children and adolescents, total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is effective and safe, with outcomes comparable to adults, though the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism must be balanced against cure; in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia, tertiary HPT is a recognized complication of phosphate and active vitamin D therapy, and management includes adjusting phosphate and vitamin D, considering cinacalcet for hypercalcemia, and reserving parathyroidectomy for refractory cases [^1ee52b5a] [^d753f73e] [^dfe15e8f] [^c9bb3568].

> Next, I should review long-term surveillance so I don't miss recurrence or hypoparathyroidism. After surgery, calcium and PTH should be checked within 24 to 48 hours, then periodically over the first year and annually thereafter, with vigilance for recurrent hypercalcemia or persistent hypocalcemia; after cinacalcet, I should monitor calcium every 1 to 3 months initially and adjust therapy to maintain normocalcemia while avoiding symptomatic hypocalcemia [^c92297f8] [^4390ab4e].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I will double-check that it aligns with the evidence. If hypercalcemia is present beyond 6 to 12 months post-transplant, I should recommend parathyroidectomy as first-line curative therapy when the patient is a suitable candidate, using subtotal parathyroidectomy for multigland hyperplasia and focused resection for focal disease; if surgery is declined or contraindicated, cinacalcet is a reasonable alternative to control calcium and PTH, with ongoing reassessment for surgical candidacy; if hypercalcemia is absent and PTH is only modestly elevated, observation with periodic reassessment is acceptable, but I should escalate to treatment if hypercalcemia develops or if PTH remains markedly elevated with evidence of bone disease or allograft risk [^c92297f8] [^7e7fe608] [^34e31336].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways so the plan is actionable. Hypercalcemic tertiary HPT should not be observed because it is associated with worse allograft survival and is highly curable with surgery; subtotal parathyroidectomy balances cure and hypoparathyroidism risk in transplant recipients; cinacalcet is an effective noncurative alternative for selected patients; and structured follow-up with early recognition and timely referral are essential to close the current undertreatment gap seen in transplant cohorts [^7e7fe608] [^abac0cf6] [^34e31336] [^76b0fe33].

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (3HPT) is best managed with **parathyroidectomy as first-line therapy** for persistent hypercalcemia or symptomatic disease, achieving high cure rates and durable biochemical control [^c92297f8] [^c2e38bb3]. Cinacalcet is a **reasonable alternative** for patients who are high surgical risk, decline surgery, or have mild disease, normalizing calcium in ~80% but requiring lifelong therapy and monitoring [^34e31336] [^4390ab4e]. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is preferred in transplant patients to balance cure and hypoparathyroidism risk, while total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is reserved for severe multigland disease or recurrence [^abac0cf6] [^c92297f8]. Medical therapy alone is inferior to surgery for durable control and symptom relief, and undertreatment is common — so early referral to experienced surgeons is essential [^34e31336] [^c95c6d39].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is indicated for **persistent hypercalcemia** (> 10.2 mg/dL) beyond 6–12 months after kidney transplantation, especially with symptoms (bone pain, nephrolithiasis, fractures, neuropsychiatric symptoms) [^c92297f8] [^eb218e96]. Intervention is also warranted for **severe hyperparathyroidism** (PTH > 300 pg/mL) with hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria, or when medical therapy fails or is not tolerated [^c92297f8] [^4390ab4e].

---

## Surgical management

### Surgical options

- **Subtotal parathyroidectomy (STPX)**: Removal of 3–3.5 glands, leaving a 30–50 mg vascularized remnant; preferred in transplant patients to minimize hypoparathyroidism while achieving high cure [^abac0cf6] [^c92297f8].
- **Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TPX-A)**: Removal of all glands with forearm autotransplantation; used for severe multigland disease or recurrence, but with higher hypoparathyroidism risk [^abac0cf6] [^c92297f8].
- **Focused parathyroidectomy**: Limited resection for single-gland disease (adenoma) with excellent outcomes when localized [^56f98db3].

---

### Outcomes and complications

- **Cure rates**: 93–100% for hypercalcemia; 70–90% for PTH normalization [^c2e38bb3] [^c272fa74].
- **Persistent disease**: More common in 3HPT than primary HPT (7.6% vs 4%) [^c2e38bb3].
- **Hypoparathyroidism**: Higher after TPX-A (45% transient, 20% permanent) vs STPX (23% transient, 10% permanent) [^abac0cf6].
- **Recurrence**: 5–8% after adequate initial surgery; higher with incomplete resection or supernumerary glands [^8547e469] [^667cb0d7].

---

## Medical management

### Calcimimetic therapy

Cinacalcet is the **first-line medical therapy**, lowering calcium and PTH in ~80% of patients, but requires lifelong therapy and monitoring [^34e31336] [^4390ab4e]. Common adverse effects include hypocalcemia, nausea, and gastrointestinal upset, with a 6.4% discontinuation rate [^34e31336] [^4390ab4e]. It is **less effective than surgery** for durable biochemical control and symptom relief, and is best for patients who are high surgical risk, decline surgery, or have mild disease [^34e31336] [^c92297f8].

---

### Vitamin D analogs and phosphate binders

Vitamin D analogs (calcitriol, alfacalcidol) can be used cautiously to suppress PTH but may worsen hypercalcemia; **monitor calcium closely** [^b07b442e] [^4390ab4e]. Phosphate binders are used to control phosphate, but their role in 3HPT is limited and they do not address autonomous PTH secretion [^notfound].

## Comparative effectiveness: surgery vs. medical therapy

| **Outcome** | **Parathyroidectomy** | **Cinacalcet** |
|-|-|-|
| Cure rate | 93–100% | 80% |
| Recurrence | 5–8% | 20–30% |
| Hypoparathyroidism | 10–20% | Rare |
| Discontinuation | Rare | 6.4% |
| Allograft outcomes | Improved survival | Neutral/slight improvement |

---

Surgery achieves **higher cure rates**, lower recurrence, and improved allograft survival compared with cinacalcet, which is effective but requires lifelong therapy and monitoring [^34e31336] [^7e7fe608].

---

## Special considerations

- **Timing**: Early referral (within 12 months post-transplant) improves outcomes and reduces complications [^c92297f8] [^7e7fe608].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound and sestamibi guide focused surgery; intraoperative PTH monitoring confirms cure [^6df1f788] [^5ae575f9].
- **Hypocalcemia**: Manage hungry bone syndrome with calcium, calcitriol, and close monitoring post-PTx [^235ce73d] [^56ea1c2a].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

The AAES recommends **parathyroidectomy as first-line** for persistent hypercalcemic 3HPT, with subtotal parathyroidectomy preferred in transplant patients [^c92297f8]. Cinacalcet is reasonable for patients who are high surgical risk, decline surgery, or have mild disease, with ongoing monitoring of calcium and renal function [^4390ab4e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Parathyroidectomy is the **preferred treatment** for tertiary hyperparathyroidism, offering high cure rates and durable control, with subtotal parathyroidectomy favored in transplant patients [^c92297f8] [^abac0cf6]. Cinacalcet is a reasonable alternative for patients unsuitable for surgery or with mild disease, but requires lifelong therapy and monitoring [^34e31336] [^4390ab4e]. Early referral to experienced endocrine surgeons and individualized decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize complications [^c92297f8] [^c2e38bb3].

### Parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review [^eb218e96]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Analyze the efficacy and indications for parathyroidectomy as an intervention for tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases.

Review Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using the. Original research articles in English were retrieved using the search terms ("tertiary hyperparathyroidism" OR "3HPT") AND "parathyroidectomy". Articles were analyzed in regards to their surgical indications, operative endpoints, comparison between different surgical interventions, characterization of disease recurrence rates, and evaluation of alternative medical management.

Results

Thirty studies met the criteria for inclusion. Among the studies that report indications for parathyroidectomy, persistent hypercalcemia as well as clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia despite medical therapy predicted which patients would eventually need surgical intervention. The majority of studies comparing the extent of parathyroidectomy recommended a more focused approach to parathyroidectomy when warranted. All studies found that parathyroidectomy was an effective treatment for 3HPT. Three studies discussed alternative conservative approaches.

Conclusion

Interestingly, hyperparathyroidism alone is not an indication for surgery without other findings; rather, symptomatic hypercalcemia appears to be the main indication. Most studies recommend limited or subtotal parathyroidectomy for 3HPT. The operative endpoint of surgery is not necessarily a return of PTH to normal, but a > 50% drop in PTH level even if PTH remains above normal. Additionally, "success" or "cure" is defined as normal calcium levels regardless of whether or not PTH is elevated. It appears the goal of surgery for 3HPT is not a normal PTH value, but a normal calcium level at least six months postoperatively.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^4052463e]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have evolved since their original description. What was once a debilitating disease has now become one with few symptoms on initial presentation. Complications from these disorders have decreased significantly because of earlier detection. Improved management of patients with chronic renal disease has also limited complications among those with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Appropriate management is essential even in the early phase of the disorder to minimize the morbidities that may result if left untreated.

### Systematic review of surgical and medical treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^34e31336]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of patients with chronic kidney disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) remain hyperparathyroid after kidney transplantation, a state known as tertiary HPT. Without treatment, tertiary HPT can lead to diminished kidney allograft and patient survival. Parathyroidectomy was commonly performed to treat tertiary HPT until the introduction of the calcimimetic drug, cinacalcet. It is not known whether surgery or medical treatment is superior for tertiary HPT.

Methods

A systematic review was performed and medical literature databases were searched for studies on the treatment of tertiary HPT that were published after the approval of cinacalcet.

Results

A total of 1669 articles were identified, of which 47 were included in the review. Following subtotal and total parathyroidectomy, initial cure rates were 98·7 and 100 per cent respectively, but in 7·6 and 4 per cent of patients tertiary HPT recurred. After treatment with cinacalcet, 80·8 per cent of the patients achieved normocalcaemia. Owing to side-effects, 6·4 per cent of patients discontinued cinacalcet treatment. The literature regarding graft function and survival is limited; however, renal graft survival after surgical treatment appears comparable to that obtained with cinacalcet therapy.

Conclusion

Side-effects and complications of both treatment modalities were mild and occurred in a minority of patients. Surgical treatment for tertiary HPT has higher cure rates than medical therapy.

### Parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism: a multi-institutional analysis of outcomes [^c2e38bb3]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) often experience delays between diagnosis and referral for surgical treatment. We hypothesized that patients with tertiary HPT experience similarly high cure rates and low complication rates after parathyroidectomy compared with patients with primary HPT.

Methods

We retrospectively identified patients undergoing parathyroidectomy from the Collaborative Endocrine Surgery Quality Improvement Program for primary or tertiary HPT from January 2014 to April 2019. Patients were categorized according to their primary diagnosis and compared for cure rates and surgical complications.

Results

The study included 9030 patients, with 334 (3.7%) being treated for tertiary HPT. Parathyroidectomy provided a high cure rate (93.7%) in patients with tertiary HPT. However, adjusting for age, sex, and prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery, tertiary HPT was associated with a greater chance of persistent disease than was primary HPT (odds ratio: 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.3–4.0). Overall, complications were low for patients across both groups. However, patients with tertiary HPT were more likely to present to the emergency department (7.5% versus 3.3%; P < 0.001), be readmitted (5.1% versus 1.1%; P < 0.001), and develop a hematoma (1.5% versus 0.2%; P = 0.002). Both groups of patients shared similarly low rates of other complications, including mortality, vocal cord dysfunction, and surgical site infections (P < 0.5% for all).

Conclusions

Patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for tertiary HPT experience high cure rates and low complication rates. However, tertiary HPT is associated with a greater chance of persistent disease and select complications. Nevertheless, the low rates of persistent disease and complications should not deter early referral for the treatment of tertiary HPT.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism [^c92297f8]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective, and appropriate treatment of secondary (SHPT) and tertiary (THPT) renal hyperparathyroidism.

Background

Hyperparathyroidism is common among patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney transplant. The surgical management of SHPT and THPT is nuanced and requires a multidisciplinary approach. There are currently no clinical practice guidelines that address the surgical treatment of SHPT and THPT.

Methods

Medical literature was reviewed from January 1, 1985 to present January 1, 2021 by a panel of 10 experts in SHPT and THPT. Recommendations using the best available evidence was constructed. The American College of Physicians grading system was used to determine levels of evidence. Recommendations were discussed to consensus. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons membership reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the content.

Results

These clinical guidelines present the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SHPT and THPT and provide recommendations for work-up and management of SHPT and THPT for all involved clinicians. It outlines the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of SHPT and THPT, as well as related definitions, operative techniques, morbidity, and outcomes. Specific topics include Pathogenesis and Epidemiology, Initial Evaluation, Imaging, Preoperative and Perioperative Care, Surgical Planning and Parathyroidectomy, Adjuncts and Approaches, Outcomes, and Reoperation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines were created to assist clinicians in the optimal management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^7e7fe608]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the detrimental clinical consequences of tertiary HPT, the guidelines for managing tertiary HPT post-KT are unclear. KDIGO guidelines suggested treatment with vitamin D analogs in the first 12 months post-KT. However, the use of vitamin D analogs is often limited by concurrent hypercalcemia. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) guidelines recommend PTx as the treatment of choice for KT recipients with hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism, with referral for PTx within 12 months post-KT.PTx is the only curative treatment for HPT. Calcimimetics offer an alternative to PTx by acting as allosteric activators of calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid glands and other tissues to suppress PTH secretion. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic, has been approved in the US since 2004 for dialysis patients with secondary HPT. While not approved for treatment of tertiary HPT, cinacalcet is also used for KT recipients with hypercalcemia.

The treatment of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT with regard to allograft function remains controversial. Several studies reported a decline in allograft function following PTx, or the use of cinacalcet. However, other studies found no changes in allograft function following PTx, or cinacalcet. The discrepancy is partly due to variation in length of follow-up and a lack of a control group to adjust the confounding effect of tertiary HPT itself. Finnerty et al. concluded that PTx was associated with a lesser rate of allograft failure than cinacalcet in KT recipients. However, the study was prone to survivor treatment selection bias. The question remains whether the benefit of improved allograft survival is due to immortal bias (ie, the benefit of PTx itself, or the fact that KT recipients who live longer have more opportunities to select PTx). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between treatment for tertiary HPT and long-term allograft survival, mitigating survivor treatment selection bias by utilizing treatment of tertiary HPT as a time-varying variable.

### The missing piece in post-transplant bone health: tertiary hyperparathyroidism management [^92365a96]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Perhaps most concerning is the substantial undertreatment of post-transplant hyperparathyroidism, with 73% of patients with persistent disease receiving no targeted therapy. This therapeutic gap likely represents a missed opportunity to mitigate skeletal complications in a population already at elevated fracture risk.

We commend Kurnool et al. for their excellent review and echo their call for high-quality randomized controlled trials with hard clinical endpoints, including fracture reduction and mortality outcomes, in transplant recipients with hyperparathyroidism-related bone disease.

### The missing piece in post-transplant bone health: tertiary hyperparathyroidism management [^036ca0c6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with great interest the comprehensive review by Kurnool et al.on the treatment of osteoporosis in solid organ transplant recipients. The authors have provided an excellent and thorough overview of therapeutic approaches to post-transplant bone disease, systematically addressing medication options across organ systems.

We would like to provide a more nuanced discussion of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in kidney transplant recipients as it represents a significant contributor to post-transplant bone disease. Given the pharmacologic focus of this excellent review, we hope our contribution provides a complementary perspective that further enriches this comprehensive work.

Persistent and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which represent a post-transplant continuum of chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder, are significant yet underappreciated contributors to post-transplant bone loss. Studies show that 61.7% of kidney transplant recipients develop persistent hyperparathyroidism, with 21.5% progressing to tertiary hyperparathyroidism within 1 year post-transplant. Critically, persistent hyperparathyroidism is independently associated with a 1.6-fold higher risk of death-censored graft loss, with this risk increasing to 4.19-fold in patients with parathyroid hormone levels ⩾300 pg/mL. Beyond graft outcomes, tertiary hyperparathyroidism directly contributes to bone mineral density loss and increased fracture risk, a relationship briefly acknowledged in their review.

Two principal therapeutic approaches exist for managing post-transplant hyperparathyroidism: calcimimetics and parathyroidectomy. Calcimimetic therapy, particularly cinacalcet, has been shown to selectively improve bone mineral density, with studies demonstrating significant increases at the femoral neck and improved T -scores. To date, no prospective study has demonstrated that cinacalcet reduces fracture incidence in kidney transplant recipients; available evidence is limited to surrogate endpoints such as bone mineral density.

When compared directly, parathyroidectomy results in more pronounced and generalized improvements in bone mineral density than calcimimetic therapy. Randomized trials have shown that subtotal parathyroidectomy leads to greater increases in bone mineral density at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck compared to cinacalcet treatment. Notably, pre-transplant parathyroidectomy is associated with more substantial gains in bone mineral density than post-transplant surgery, underscoring the importance of timing in therapeutic decision-making. However, as with calcimimetics, high-quality data on fracture outcomes after parathyroidectomy in transplant recipients remain limited. Nevertheless, some retrospective studies suggest that parathyroidectomy may be associated with a reduced risk of fractures.

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^e23c1131]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® parathyroid adenoma [^6df1f788]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is defined as excessive parathyroid hormone production. The diagnosis is made through biochemical testing, in which imaging has no role. However, imaging is appropriate for preoperative parathyroid gland localization with the intent of surgical cure. Imaging is particularly useful in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism whereby accurate localization of a single parathyroid adenoma can facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Imaging can also be useful to localize ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid glands and detail anatomy, which may impact surgery. This document summarizes the literature and provides imaging recommendations for hyperparathyroidism including primary hyperparathyroidism, recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after parathyroid surgery, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Recommendations include ultrasound, CT neck without and with contrast, and nuclear medicine parathyroid scans. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1531f439]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is due to increased activity of the parathyroid glands, either from an intrinsic abnormal change altering excretion of parathyroid hormone (primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) or from an extrinsic abnormal change affecting calcium homoeostasis stimulating production of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disorder, with the highest incidence in postmenopausal women. Asymptomatic disease is common, and severe disease with renal stones and metabolic bone disease arises less frequently now than it did 20–30 years ago. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by surgical removal of an adenoma, increasingly by minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Medical management of mild disease is possible with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, and calcimimetics. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in elderly people. However, the biochemical definition of vitamin D deficiency and its treatment are subject to much debate. Secondary hyperparathyroidism as the result of chronic kidney disease is important in the genesis of renal bone disease, and several new treatments could help achieve the guidelines set out by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^a2053baa]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (general principles), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients presenting with elevated PTH levels for vitamin D and/or dietary calcium deficiency and supplement if necessary.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^1b37b7fa]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to leverage time-varying survival analyses to overcome survivor treatment selection bias in the treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and to clearly demonstrate an association between treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and improved allograft survival. With an exponential increase in the need for kidney transplant worldwide and vastly insufficient kidney donors, this study provides evidence that hyperparathyroidism should be screened and treated following kidney transplant to achieve this survival benefit and protect a finite public health resource.

### The effect of parathyroidectomy on patients' symptoms in tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^c01b7d16]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of parathyroidectomy for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism is well-established but evidence in tertiary hyperparathyroidism is lacking. We examined parathyroidectomy's effect in tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroidectomy were followed up for 12months. A modification of the 13-item parathyroid symptoms list developed by Pasieka was administered at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12months post-surgery. We also examined if preoperative factors would predict symptom improvement post-surgery.

Results

Ninety-one patients were included. Survey response rates at 1, 3, 6, and 12months post-surgery were 97.8%, 90.1%, 82.4%, and 80.2%, respectively. Mean preoperative Pasieka parathyroid score (PSS) was 6.3 ± 2.7. At first month, PSS decreased to 2.9 ± 2.0 (P < .001) and was sustained at 3, 6, and 12months (2.7 ± 2.1, P < .001, 2.3 ± 1.6, P < .001 and 3.4 ± 2.5, P < .001). The degree of PSS reduction at 1-month post-parathyroidectomy correlated strongly with preoperative symptom severity (Pearson's coefficient: 0.690, P < .001).

Conclusions

Parathyroid symptoms unequivocally improve post-parathyroidectomy. The greatest degree of improvement was observed in early postoperative period up to 6 months.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (general principles), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to manage patients with elevated PTH levels on therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D by increasing the dose of active vitamin D and/or decreasing the dose of oral phosphate supplements.
Reduce or stop active vitamin D and phosphate supplements in cases of persistent hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia.
Consider administering active vitamin D without phosphate supplements in adult patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is guaranteed.
Consider switching these patients to burosumab therapy if possible.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetics, XLH-IWG 2025 guidelines recommend to administer calcimimetics (off-label), such as cinacalcet, to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia with anticipated multi-gland involvement. Carefully monitor serum calcium levels to prevent hypocalcemia.

### Impact of the introduction of calcimimetics on timing of parathyroidectomy in secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^73ce0911]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In chronic kidney disease (CKD), calcium and phosphate homeostasis are progressively deregulated, resulting in CKD-related mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD), commonly accompanied by secondary HPT. Tertiary HPT develops when hyperplastic parathyroid glands no longer respond to the plasma calcium concentration and function autonomously, which is clinically most evident when HPT does not resolve after successful kidney transplantation (KTx). Both secondary and tertiary HPT are associated with cardiovascular complications and increased mortality. –

More than a decade ago, the main treatment options for HPT consisted of calcium-containing phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols and (sub-)total parathyroidectomy (PTx). More recently, recommended strategies include the use of (primarily) non-calcium-containing phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, or a combination of these to decrease parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.PTx is currently only recommended in patients with severe HPT who fail to respond to medical treatment. Since its introduction in 2004, the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet has become a common first-line therapy for HPT patients insufficiently responsive to vitamin D and phosphate binders. Despite the lack of randomized studies that directly compare cinacalcet with PTx, the introduction of cinacalcet seems to have led to a change in treatment strategy and, consequently, PTx is less often performed. Despite this policy change, several questions have been raised about the efficacy, side effect profile, and costs of cinacalcet. Moreover, studies evaluating the effect of cinacalcet on lowering PTH levels show contradictory results. A recent Cochrane review, which was strongly driven by the primary results from the EVOLVE trial, concluded that there is no clear evidence that cinacalcet reduces the risk of death or major cardiovascular events. Consequently, cinacalcet is no longer subsidized by the Australian Government. It is unclear how the introduction of cinacalcet affected the secondary and tertiary HPT patient population ultimately requiring PTx. To address this, we performed a retrospective, single-center observational study to compare PTx patient characteristics, time from diagnosis to surgery, and PTx efficacy and safety outcomes before and after the introduction of calcimimetics.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^2f5e8b0e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^7f095790]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of renal insufficiency in adults is only 40–70 per million, and in children it is even lower, at 0.5–5 per million. A significant proportion of patients with renal insufficiency develop secondary and eventually tertiary hyperparathyroidism. If left untreated, hyperparathyroidism can lead to symptoms of hypercalcemia, renal complications, and bone disease connected to hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by high turnover and remodeling rates leading to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. If hyperparathyroidism becomes clinically significant, or if a patient undergoes work-up for renal transplantation, parathyroidectomy is usually performed, either subtotal, or total in combination with autotransplantation, to prevent aparathyroidism.

The Amsterdam Academic Medical Centre and the Emma Children's Hospital (AMC) form a care unit for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism to which children, adolescents, and adults with this disease are referred for treatment on a regular basis. For such a care unit, it is important to assess provided care to assure high quality. Few articles have reported on surgical treatment for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents, and none have compared outcomes in children and adolescents with outcomes in adults. Children and adolescents cannot simply be seen as young adults if they suffer from chronic renal disease and hyperparathyroidism. The resulting growth retardation and the potentially rapid onset of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) in children are different from ROD in adults. If left untreated during the critical phases of skeletal growth, ROD can result in bone deformities and a disturbed growth pattern.

The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate if parathyroidectomy with forearm autograft is as effective and safe in pediatric and adolescent patients as in adult patients and, therefore, if treating them the same way is justifiable even though there are differences in the effect of the disease. More specific study questions were (1) is secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated effectively by this surgical treatment, in children and adolescents as well as in adults? (2) Is parathyroid function adequate after surgery and, if so, could this benefit be ascribed to the autotransplanted tissue in children and adolescents as well as in adults? (3) Which factors are predictors for an effective surgical treatment and for the conservation of sufficient parathyroid function and, again, do these factors differ between children and adolescents on the one hand and adults on the other?

### Surgical management of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^4c67c551]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) often arises from kidney disease and is characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The reported optimal PTH level to balance the compensatory physiologic response in SHPT with the pathologic morbidity and mortality has changed over time with our evolving understanding. Parathyroidectomy for kidney-related hyperparathyroidism requires consideration of the patient's dialysis status, potential for kidney transplantation, and medical history. Extent of parathyroidectomy and intraoperative decision-making requires consideration to maximize cure with the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy for kidney-related hyperparathyroidism can provide a reduction in morbidity, mortality, and improved kidney allograft function and survival.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^ab14eb79]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^be08a1c1]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage time-varying survival analyses to overcome survivor treatment selection bias in treatment of tertiary HPT, and to clearly demonstrate an association between treatment of tertiary HPT and improved allograft survival. HPT is often managed by oncologic surgeons and endocrine surgeons. This study offers evidence supporting the treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation. Specifically, in this retrospective study of 280 KT recipients who developed hypercalcemic tertiary HPT demonstrated compared to no treatment group, recipients who underwent PTx or were prescribed cinacalcet had lower risks of death-censored allograft failure and all-cause allograft failure. With an exponential increase in the need for KT worldwide and vastly insufficient kidney donors, HPT should be screened and treated following KT to protect a finite public health resource.

The association of persistent HPT post-KT and allograft failure has been reported in several retrospective studies. A longitudinal follow-up of 911 KT recipients having hypercalcemic tertiary HPT 1 year post-KT showed that hypercalcemic tertiary HPT was associated with an increased risk of death-censored graft failure. Crepeau et al.reviewed 824 KT recipients with elevated PTH levels post-KT with hypercalcemia and normocalcemia. They concluded that persistent HPT at 1-year post-KT had a 1.37-fold higher risk of all-cause graft loss and a 1.6-fold higher risk of death-censored graft loss. This is consistent with our results that no treatment of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT was associated with worse allograft survival. The possible mechanism for a causative role of tertiary HPT for allograft dysfunction and mortality includes the promotion of vascular calcificationand renal interstitial fibrosis.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^34ecca15]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations, including those inherent to any retrospective study. The 3 groups are not homogenous in terms of HPT. The untreated group had milder diseases, as reflected by lower PTH levels at KT and later onset of hypercalcemia post-KT compared to the treated groups. However, the untreated group had a worse outcome of allograft survival compared to the treated groups. This further demonstrated the positive effect of treating HPT on allograft survival. The generalizability of study results is limited due to small sample size and single-institution cohorts. The number of graft failure events was relatively small, which limited the covariates adjusted in the Cox regression models. Given that this is a retrospective study, we cannot conclude causality between the treatment of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT and graft outcome. However, we used adjusted delayed entry time-varying Cox regression models to minimize confounding effects. Our findings stress the need for large randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-ups to investigate the causality between tertiary HPT treatment and allograft outcome.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that treatment of hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism post-kidney transplantation was associated with improved allograft survival. To achieve this survival benefit, hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism should be screened and treated following kidney transplantation.

### Impact of the introduction of calcimimetics on timing of parathyroidectomy in secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^27f6a2ab]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This single-center, retrospective study documents a significant 22-month delay from diagnosis to (sub-)total PTx in patients with HPT since the introduction of the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet in 2005. Moreover, we observed that, even after the introduction of cinacalcet, median preoperative PTH levels have remained unchanged. Our findings raise questions about the efficacy of current treatment of patients with HPT and the consequently prolonged exposure to high PTH levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study documenting the difference in time interval between HPT diagnosis and parathyroid surgery since cinacalcet became available.

Several reasons may underlie the 22-month referral delay. First, in the past decade, there has been an increasing interest for the medical treatment of HPT, particularly with cinacalcet. The availability of cinacalcet seems to have contributed to a strategy change intending to delay surgery as long as medically possible, and preferably until KTx, which might result in resolution of HPT. Indeed, several studies have aimed to reduce the incidence of PTx. However, whether delaying surgery with long-term medical therapy is truly beneficial for the individual patient is unknown. While waiting for KTx, HPT often becomes refractory, eventually leading to an unavoidable PTx. Eventually, approximately 30% of transplanted patients have ongoing (tertiary) HPT. When calcium-phosphate homeostasis does not normalize after KTx, medical treatment often delays definite surgical intervention, as Lou et al. concluded that PTx is underused in patients with tertiary HPT. Therefore, we need predictive factors for developing refractory or tertiary HPT to determine in advance which patients will eventually need PTx after transplantation. In The Netherlands, the Dutch Hyperparathyroid Study Group (DHSG), a multicenter initiative, is currently trying to answer these questions in larger retrospective patient data sets. A second reason for the observed referral delay may be that standardized and specific indications for referral for surgery are not available. The overall change in guidelines of HPT management might be another explanation for the late referral. The 2003 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines recommended maintaining PTH values below 300 pg/mL (three to five times the upper limit), whereas the 2009 KDIGO guidelines recommended PTH levels between two and nine times the upper limit (up to 746 pg/mL; grade 2C recommendation); however, little evidence is available to support these (changes in) guidelines. Lastly, group B received predominantly non-calcium-containing phosphate binders as opposed to group A patients, who mainly received calcium-containing phosphate binders. This prescription change might have also led to a referral delay as patients using calcium-containing medication might be referred in an earlier stage because of high serum calcium levels.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetics, XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering calcimimetics in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism despite normocalcemia or in those with hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism that has failed to respond to the above treatments.
Use cinacalcet with caution in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia, as it has been associated with severe adverse effects, namely, hypocalcemia and increased QT interval.

### Pattern of intraoperative parathyroid hormone and calcium in the treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^5ae575f9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism, an autonomous hyperproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), has a challenge in its treatment. This study asked whether the intraoperative PTH and calcium drop can confirm the resection of all parathyroid tissues.

Study Design

Case series with planned data collection.

Setting

Tertiary referral medical center.

Subjects and Methods

The study assessed patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism who were treated at the Hospital of the State University of Campinas from 2007 to 2015. All patients underwent total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid fragments. PTH and calcium were collected during the preoperative period; at 10, 20, and 240 minutes after resection of the glands; and at 1 year after the procedure. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis with statistical values of P < .05.

Results

Thirty-five patients were assessed: 17 women (48.57%) and 18 men (51.43%). The percentage of PTH drop was statistically significant at all times, unlike the calcium analysis, but only PTH collected at 20 minutes was able to confirm the removal of all parathyroid tissues (P = 0.029). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the 71.2% drop obtained high sensitivity and specificity (P = 0.028).

Conclusions

Treatment success can be predicted by analyzing the decrease of intraoperative PTH and not by calcium. The 71.2% PTH drop at 20 minutes after parathyroidectomy had high sensitivity and specificity to predict surgical cure.

CKD–MBD, non–dialysis-dependent CKD (adult and pediatric) — use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs: In adult patients with CKD G3a-G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C), and it is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4-G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded). In children, calcitriol and vitamin D analogs may be considered. The KDOQI work group agrees that low doses of calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues could be initiated in patients with elevated and increasing PTH levels with close monitoring, and expresses concern that less aggressive attention to PTH levels may lead to increased rates of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and need for parathyroidectomy or more use of expensive medications later in CKD.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^fea39883]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia. Among kidney transplant (KT) recipients, hypercalcemia is mostly caused by tertiary HPT. Persistent tertiary HPT after KT is associated with allograft failure. Previous studies on managing tHPT were subjected to survivor treatment selection bias; as such, the impact of tertiary HPT treatment on allograft function remained unclear. We aim to assess the association between hypercalcemic tertiary HPT treatment and kidney allograft survival.

Materials and Methods

We identified 280 KT recipients (2015–2019) with elevated post-KT adjusted serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). KT recipients were characterized by treatment: cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, or no treatment. Time-varying Cox regression with delayed entry at the time of first elevated post-KT calcium was conducted, and death-censored and all-cause allograft failure were compared by treatment groups.

Results

Of the 280 recipients with tHPT, 49 underwent PTx, and 98 received cinacalcet. The median time from KT to first elevated calcium was 1 month (IQR: 0–4). The median time from first elevated calcium to receiving cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy was 0(IQR: 0–3) and 13(IQR: 8–23) months, respectively. KT recipients with no treatment had shorter dialysis vintage (P = 0.017) and lower PTH at KT (P = 0.002), later onset of hypercalcemia post-KT (P < .001). Treatment with PTx (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.18, 95%CI 0.04–0.76, P = 0.02) or cinacalcet (aHR = 0.14, 95%CI 0.004–0.47, P = 0.002) was associated with lower risk of death-censored allograft failure. Moreover, receipt of PTx (aHR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.12–0.66, P < .001) or cinacalcet (aHR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.22–0.66, P < .001) was associated with lower risk of all-cause allograft failure.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that treatment of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT post-KT is associated with improved allograft survival. Although these findings are not specific to hypercalcemia of malignancy, they do demonstrate the negative impact of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT on kidney function. Hypercalcemic HPT should be screened and aggressively treated post-KT.

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hyperparathyroidism: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^3f86fda3]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is increasingly being investigated as a treatment for parathyroid lesions, with favorable outcomes, especially in patients who are ineligible for surgery or decline surgery. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of RFA in treating hyperparathyroidism.

Materials and methods

PubMed and Embase were searched for original literature published on or before July 18, 2024. We included 14 eligible studies with 593 patients (241 with primary hyperparathyroidism [PHPT], 310 with secondary hyperparathyroidism [SHPT], and 42 with tertiary hyperparathyroidism [THPT]). Serial pooled means of biochemical indexes (parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium, phosphorus), volume reduction ratio (VRR) after RFA, and complication rate were calculated.

Results

In PHPT, the pooled mean baseline PTH value of 158.7 pg/mL and serum calcium value of 10.96 mg/dL significantly decreased to 57.3 pg/mL and 9.55 mg/dL, respectively, at 12 months (both p < 0.001), with both being within normal ranges. The pooled mean VRR gradually increased, reaching 95.6% at 12 months. In SHPT, the pooled mean baseline PTH value of 1683.7 pg/mL significantly decreased to 267.2 pg/mL at 12 months (p < 0.001), which was within the target reference level (PTH ≤ 585 pg/mL). In THPT, the mean baseline PTH value of 1284.9 pg/mL decreased to 161.6 pg/mL at 1 year (p < 0.001). The pooled incidence rates of total, major, and minor complications were 27.9%, 7.5%, and 20.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

RFA showed promising effectiveness and safety profiles, particularly for patients who are ineligible for surgery or decline surgical intervention.

Key Points

Question What is the efficacy and safety of RFA in treating hyperparathyroidism?

Findings In PHPT, pooled mean values of biochemical indexes (serum PTH, calcium) were normal throughout 12-month follow-up. In SHPT and THPT, pooled mean PTH stayed within target ranges throughout 12-month follow-up.

Clinical relevance RFA showed efficacy and safety in treating hyperparathyroidism, maintaining biochemical indexes within normal or target ranges throughout 12-month follow-ups. RFA would be a valuable treatment option for patients who are ineligible for surgery or who decline surgical intervention.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^98d75770]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the clinical consequence, tertiary HPT in KT recipients are undertreated. In a large cohort study of 30,127 Medicare-ensured KT recipients, only one-fifth of the cohorts were treated with PTx and/or cinacalcet. In this study, half of our cohort (47.5%) did not receive any treatment for hypercalcemic tertiary HPT. One potential explanation for this undertreatment is the concern about the adverse effect of treatment on allograft function. The effect of PTx or cinacalcet on allograft function is controversial. Kruse et al. reported a statistically significant increase in serum creatinine at months 2 and 3 after cinacalcet initiation in a prospective study of 14 cohorts. Patecki et al. retrospectively reviewed 47 KT recipients who underwent PTx post-KT and reported a median annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change of −0.5 mL/minute before and + 1.0 mL/minute post-PTx. Okada et al.compared 55 and 53 patients who underwent PTx before and post-KT and found a more significant decrease in the eGFR 12–36 months after PTx post-KT. The decline in allograft function was cited as a rationale for favoring PTx before KT in the KDIGO guideline. However, the above studies are often from single institutions and were subject to a selection bias. Frey et al.performed a meta-analysis of 7 studies assessing the evolution of graft function post-PTx or cinacalcet introduction. The meta-analysis shows that PTx and cinacalcet do not significantly impair graft function in KT recipients. Moreover, the decrease in allograft function is often resolved in long-term follow-up. A previous study from our institution compared KT recipients who underwent PTx pre- and post-KT with a median follow-up length of 58 months; no significant changes in allograft function were found in either group.van der Plasalso reported a similar eGFR in the pre-KT and post-KT groups at 5 years after transplantation. The fluctuation of the allograft function is multifactorial. We used allograft failure as a dependent outcome in our study and no treatment group as the control group to adjust the confounding effect of hypercalcemic tertiary HPT on allograft function. We found that recipients who were treated for hypercalcemic tertiary HPT were less likely to develop allograft failure. This finding demonstrates the importance of managing HPT in KT recipients to protect allograft function.

### AAES guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism management… [^f63a169d]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT. Symptomatic patients are expected to derive clear benefits from curative parathyroidectomy, and patients considered to be asymptomatic frequently report improvement in quality-of-life indexes. 11–14 Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less effective and less cost-effective than surgery, even when the patient is considered asymptomatic. 15 Long-term hypercalcemia should be avoided because of potential deleterious effects. 16–18 Referral to an experienced parathyroid surgeon is advised to determine whether the likelihood and benefits of cure outweigh the anticipated risks of the procedure. Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT.

Recommendation 3–2: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the serum calcium level is greater than 1 mg/dL above normal, regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent. Although many pharmacologic agents have been used in an attempt to reduce the serum calcium level or stabilize BMD, none have improved both. In formal cost-effectiveness analyses, pharmacologic treatment is not optimal at any life expectancy. 15, 23 Recommendation 3–12: Operative management is more effective and cost-effective than long-term observation or pharmacologic therapy. Recommendation 5–1: Most patients with pHPT should follow Institute of Medicine guidelines for calcium intake.

Recommendation 5–2: Before parathyroidectomy, patients with pHPT who are vitamin D deficient can safely begin vitamin D supplementation. Recommendation 5–4: Patients with pHPT who present with hypercalcemic crisis should be medically managed, followed by parathyroidectomy. Regardless of MIP technique, specific strategies are advised to improve the likelihood of success, including selection by imaging results. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy can achieve cure in 97% to 99% of selected patients when adjunctive IPM is used to confirm adequacy of resection. 31 During MIP, if IPM suggests residual hypersecreting tissue, conversion to bilateral exploration is warranted and has equivalent cure rates to planned BE.

### Outcomes of subtotal parathyroidectomy versus total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation for tertiary hyperparathyroidism: multi-institutional study [^abac0cf6]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Due to the paucity of data and controversy regarding the preferred surgical approach for managing tertiary HPT, we sought to investigate the outcomes of different surgical approaches in managing this challenging disease.

Methods

We performed a multi-center retrospective study to include patients with tertiary HPT who underwent STPX or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TPX-A).

Results

One hundred five patients had kidney transplant, and 43 were on dialysis. In the kidney transplant group, 61 patients underwent STPX, and 44 for TPX-A. Patients' demographics were not significantly different (48.61 ± 9.31 vs 47.95 ± 12.73years, P = 0.759. The postoperative follow-up showed that the TPX-A cohort had a higher rate of hypoparathyroidism (N = 20, 45.45%) versus (N = 14, 22.95%) with the STPX cohort (P = 0.013). The cure among the TPX-A cohorts (84.09%) over the STPX cohort (73.77%) (P = 0.153). The long-term follow-up showed that the rate of developing temporary (N = 16, 41.03%) or permanent (N = 8, 20.51%) hypoparathyroidism was significantly higher among patients who underwent TPX-A over the patients who underwent STPX (N = 7, 17.95%), and (N = 4, 10.26%), respectively (P = 0.012). There was no statistical difference between the persistence (N = 3, 7.69%) or the recurrence (N = 2, 5.13%) of the HPT in the TPX-A cohort and the STPX cohort (N = 2, 5.13%). (N = 4, 10.26%), respectively, P = 0.644.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the largest multi-center study that compared different approaches for managing tertiary HPT. Showing that STPX is the better modality in patients diagnosed with tertiary HPT and had kidney transplants avoiding the risk of hypoparathyroidism.

Objective

To report a rare case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) as a result of long-term oral phosphate therapy.

Methods

We present a case report, with a focus on clinical manifestations and biochemical findings during the course of tertiary HPT, and discuss the pathophysiologic features of this disorder and the therapeutic strategies.

A 35-year-old woman, 22 years after the initial diagnosis of familial hypophosphatemic rickets and initiation of treatment with phosphate and vitamin D, underwent assessment for recurrent symptomatic kidney stones, bone pain, and fatigue. Laboratory studies performed 10 months before this presentation showed findings consistent with secondary HPT. Examination was notable for short stature, and pertinent laboratory results were as follows: intact parathyroid hormone 602 pg/mL, calcium 10.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 3.6 mg/dL. Tertiary HPT was diagnosed, and she underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy and transcervical thymectomy. Postoperatively, she had hypocalcemia and was treated with calcitriol, phosphate, and calcium carbonate; the last agent was discontinued when the serum calcium normalized. Despite multiple dosage alterations in the phosphate and calcitriol therapy, the patient had recurrent tertiary HPT and another kidney stone (treated by lithotripsy). Three years after the subtotal parathyroidectomy, treatment consisted of cinacalcet, calcitriol, and elemental phosphate.

Conclusion

Long-term follow-up of patients with tertiary HPT is critical, with careful dosage adjustments in phosphate and vitamin D therapy and monitoring of serum levels of phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^262f1c86]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Combining the facts from the other 11 articles and our own study, we came to the conclusion that total parathyroidectomy and forearm autograft is as effective a treatment for secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents as it is in adults. We believe our findings justify treating children and adolescents the same way as adults.

### Impact of the introduction of calcimimetics on timing of parathyroidectomy in secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^5f254279]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperparathyroidism (HPT), both secondary and tertiary, is common in patients with end-stage renal disease, and is associated with severe bone disorders, cardiovascular complications, and increased mortality. Since the introduction of calcimimetics in 2004, treatment of HPT has shifted from surgery to predominantly medical therapy.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this change of management on the HPT patient population before undergoing (sub-)total parathyroidectomy (PTx).

Methods

Overall, 119 patients with secondary or tertiary HPT undergoing PTx were included in a retrospective, single-center cohort. Group A, who underwent PTx before January 2005, was compared with group B, who underwent PTx after January 2005. Patient characteristics, time interval between HPT diagnosis and PTx, and postoperative complications were compared.

Results

Group A comprised 70 (58.8%) patients and group B comprised 49 (41.2%) patients. The median interval between HPT diagnosis and PTx was 27 (interquartile range [IQR] 12.5–48.0) and 49 (IQR 21.0–75.0) months for group A and B, respectively (p = 0.007). Baseline characteristics were similar among both groups. The median preoperative serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 936 pg/mL (IQR 600–1273) for group A versus 1091 pg/mL (IQR 482–1373) for group B (p = 0.38). PTx resulted in a dramatic PTH reduction (less than twofold the upper limit: A, 80.0%; B, 85.4%), and postoperative complication rates were low in both groups (A: 7.8%; B: 10.2%) [p = 0.66].

Conclusions

The introduction of calcimimetics in 2004 is associated with a significant 2-year delay of surgery with continuously elevated preoperative PTH levels, while parathyroid surgery, even in a fragile population, is considered a safe and effective procedure.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism treated by resection of a single or double adenoma [^56f98db3]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to single- or two-gland disease undergoing limited resection have similar long-term outcomes compared with patients with hyperplasia undergoing subtotal or total parathyroidectomy.

Summary Background Data

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs in less than 2% of patients after renal transplantation. Approximately 30% of these cases are caused by one or two hyperfunctioning glands. Nevertheless, the standard operation for this disease has been subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.

Methods

Seventy-one patients underwent surgery for tertiary hyperparathyroidism. At the time of surgery, 19 patients who had a single or double adenoma underwent limited resection of the enlarged glands only (adenoma group). The remaining 52 patients with three- or four-gland hyperplasia had subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with implantation (hyper group). Long-term cure rates between the two groups were compared.

Results

In the adenoma group, 7 patients had a single adenoma and 12 underwent resection of a double adenoma. In the hyper group, 49 patients had subtotal and 3 had total parathyroidectomies. After surgery, 70 of 71 patients (99%) were cured of their hypercalcemia. The incidence of postoperative transient hypocalcemia was significantly higher in the hyper group (27% vs. 5%). No patients in either group had permanent hypocalcemia requiring long-term supplementation. With up to 16 years of follow-up, there have been no recurrences in the adenoma group, whereas three patients (6%) in the hyper group have had recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusions

Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism who underwent limited resection of a single or double adenoma only had equivalent long-term cure rates compared with patients undergoing more extensive resections. Therefore, the authors recommend in patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and enlargement of only one or two parathyroid glands that the resection be limited to these abnormal glands only.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^1ee52b5a]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment safety and effectiveness of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation for secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have been extensively proven in adults; the evidence for children, however, is scarce. Children and adolescents cannot simply be seen as young adults in the case of chronic kidney disease and hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this retrospective study was therefore, to evaluate whether parathyroidectomy with forearm autograft is as effective and safe in children and adolescents as in adults.

Methods

A group of 64 adults and 8 children and adolescents treated for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism were retrieved from our database. The outcomes were compared on patient demographics, operation results, and blood parameters consisting of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels. Our results were compared with all currently available articles on parathyroidectomy in children with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism (n = 11).

Results

For adults, preoperative mean serum calcium was 2.67 ± 0.29 mmol/l and mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 120 ± 86 pmol/l. For children, preoperative mean serum calcium was 2.62 ± 0.20 mmol/l and mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 80 ± 38 pmol/l. Postoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone levels for adults dropped to 2.39 ± 0.23 mmol/l and 30 ± 53 pmol/l, respectively. Postoperative calcium and parathyroid hormone levels for children dropped to 2.41 ± 0.16 mmol/l and 26 ± 33 pmol/l, respectively. The effectiveness of parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation was 75% in children and 72% in adults. Thus, effectiveness did not differ significantly between children and adults.

Conclusions

Combining the results of our own study with a literature review on pediatric parathyroidectomy, we conclude that parathyroidectomy and forearm autograft is as effective a treatment for secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents as it is in adults.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^fc3df7e4]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed all KT recipients from 2015 to 2019 diagnosed with hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) post-KT at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (n = 296). KT recipients were identified from our institutional kidney transplant database. Hypercalcemic tertiary HPT was defined as elevated PTH levels with hypercalcemia post-KT. All included patients had either elevated PTH levels from the time of KT until December 2021 or received treatment with either cinacalcet or PTx. Included patients had at least 2 elevated serum calcium levels post-KT. We excluded recipients who underwent PTx before KT (n = 6), recipients who had first elevated serum calcium after graft failure (n = 8), and recipients who developed hypercalcemia before death events (n = 2) (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. KT = kidney transplantation; HPT = hyperparathyroidism; PTx = parathyroidectomy.

Patients were categorized by treatment group. Recipients who did not receive PTx or cinacalcet post-KT were classified as the no treatment group. At our institution, cinacalcet is often considered the first choice of treatment when KT recipients develop hypercalcemic tHPT. When KT recipients do not tolerate or cannot afford cinacalcet or hypercalcemic tHPT is not controlled by cinacalcet, KT recipients are referred for PTX. Recipients who only received cinacalcet post-KT were classified as the cinacalcet group. Of note, two recipients who received cinacalcet for only 5 and 7 days, respectively, from the date of first hypercalcemia to the date of graft failure were classified to the no treatment group. Recipients who received parathyroidectomy post-KT were classified as the PTx group. Our aim was to 1) evaluate the characteristics of patient demographics and kidney transplantation in each treatment group, 2) assess the characteristics of HPT post-KT for each treatment group, and 3) investigate the association between different treatment modalities and allograft survival.

### Machine learning-derived integer-based score and prediction of tertiary hyperparathyroidism among kidney transplant recipients: an integer-based score to predict tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^b7e530df]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism in kidney allograft recipients is associated with bone loss, allograft dysfunction, and cardiovascular mortality. Accurate pretransplant risk prediction of tertiary hyperparathyroidism may support individualized treatment decisions. We aimed to develop an integer score system that predicts the risk of tertiary hyperparathyroidism using machine learning algorithms.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We used two separate cohorts: a derivation cohort with the data of kidney allograft recipients (n = 669) who underwent kidney transplantation at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea between January 2009 and December 2015 and a multicenter registry dataset (the Korean Cohort Study for Outcome in Patients with Kidney Transplantation) as an external validation cohort (n = 542). Tertiary hyperparathyroidism was defined as post-transplant parathyroidectomy. The derivation cohort was split into 75% training set (n = 501) and 25% holdout test set (n = 168) to develop prediction models and integer-based score.

Results

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism requiring parathyroidectomy occurred in 5% and 2% of the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Three top predictors (dialysis duration, pretransplant intact parathyroid hormone, and serum calcium level measured at the time of admission for kidney transplantation) were identified to create an integer score system (dialysis duration, pretransplant serum parathyroid hormone level, and pretransplant calcium level [DPC] score; 0–15 points) to predict tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The median DPC score was higher in participants with post-transplant parathyroidectomy than in those without (13 versus three in derivation; 13 versus four in external validation; P < 0.001 for all). Pretransplant dialysis duration, pretransplant serum parathyroid hormone level, and pretransplant calcium level score predicted post-transplant parathyroidectomy with comparable performance with the best-performing machine learning model in the test set (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.94 versus 0.92; area under the precision-recall curve: 0.52 versus 0.47). Serial measurement of DPC scores (≥ 13 at least two or more times, 3-month interval) during 12 months prior to kidney transplantation improved risk classification for post-transplant parathyroidectomy compared with single-time measurement (net reclassification improvement, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.54; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

A simple integer-based score predicted the risk of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in kidney allograft recipients, with improved classification by serial measurement compared with single-time measurement.

### Surgery is underutilized in the management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^c95c6d39]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (3HPT) is observed in up to 40% of renal transplant patients. Standard guidelines defining 3HPT and indications for operative intervention are not well described.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of patients who underwent renal transplant between January 1, 2012 and January 30, 2018, with a minimum of 13-month follow-up and at least 1 y of allograft function. We defined 3HPT as having elevated serum level parathyroid hormone (> 88 pg/mL) after successful renal transplantation or multiple instances of elevated serum calcium starting at least 3 mo after transplant. We compared graft failure rates after stratifying the cohort based on management strategy: expectant, medical management with cinacalcet, and parathyroidectomy.

Results

Out of the 381 transplanted patients with functional grafts at 1 y, 178 patients (46.6%) were found to have 3HPT. One hundred twenty-nine patients (72.5%) were managed expectantly without medications, 35 patients (19.7%) were managed medically, and 14 patients (7.8%) were managed with parathyroidectomy. Twenty-two patients (17.1%) in the observation group had graft failure, 4 patients (11.4%) in the medically managed group had graft failure, and 0 patients in the surgery group had graft failure. Surgical intervention was associated with decreased renal allograft failure when compared to the combined cohort of nonoperative 3HPT patients (P = 0.03). All patients who underwent parathyroidectomy were cured and did not have graft failure as of December 30, 2019. Calcium elevation, but not PTH elevation, was associated with referral for parathyroidectomy on multivariable logistic regression analysis (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

At our institution, the referral rate for parathyroidectomy among patients with 3HPT remains low. Parathyroidectomy was associated with high cure rates and reduced graft failure. Surgery may be underutilized in the management of 3HPT.

### Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and posttransplant tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^98982fcc]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is prevalent in dialysis patients and can lead to tertiary hyperparathyroidism (tHPT) after kidney transplantation. We aimed to assess the association of pretransplant sHPT treatment on posttransplant outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed kidney transplant patients treated with parathyroidectomy or cinacalcet for sHPT. We compared patients biochemical and clinical parameters, and outcomes based on sHPT treatment.

Results

A total of 41 patients were included: 18 patients underwent parathyroidectomy and 23 patients received cinacalcet prior to transplantation. There were no significant differences between demographics, comorbidities, allograft characteristics or pre-sHPT intervention parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels. Patients that underwent parathyroidectomy were on dialysis for longer, although not significantly (71.9 versus 42.3 mo, P = 0.051). At time of transplantation, patients treated by parathyroidectomy had increased rates of controlled sHPT (88.9%; 16/18 versus 47.8%; 11/23, P = 0.008). Patients treated by parathyroidectomy had decreased development of tHPT (5.9%; 1/17; versus 42.1%; 8/19, P = 0.020) as well as decreased rates of posttransplant treatment with cinacalcet (11.1%; 2/18 versus 52.2%; 12/23, P = 0.008). Three patients treated with cinacalcet underwent parathyroidectomy after transplantation. Median PTH after transplant remained lower in patients treated by parathyroidectomy prior to transplant compared to those treated with cinacalcet (60.7 [interquartile range 39.7–133.4] versus 170.0 [interquartile range 128.4–292.7], P = 0.001). Allograft function and survival were similar for parathyroidectomy and cinacalcet, with median follow-up after transplantation of 56.7 and 34.2 mo, respectively.

Conclusions

sHPT treated by parathyroidectomy is associated with controlled PTH levels at transplantation and decreased rates of tHPT. Long-term outcomes should be studied on a larger scale.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^4390ab4e]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 9.2 KTR: tertiary hyperparathyroidism

We suggest:
Severe hyperparathyroidism should be treated prior to transplantation (2D)
Cinacalcet can be used in KTRs (2C)
We suggest treatment should be the same as for other patients with CKD (2D)

Audit Measures

Incidence of hyperparathyroidism
Incidence of parathyroidectomy
Usage of cinacalcet

Rationale

Post-transplant hyperparathyroidism is a complex entity that may represent a true high bone turnover state but also low bone turnover. Dietary intake of phosphate, longstanding phosphate retention whilst on dialysis treatment, followed by sometimes profound urinary phosphate losses in the early post transplant period all contribute to the complexity of managing this condition. In the latter case the suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion may lead to adynamic bone disease and the only certain way to distinguish between the two types of mineral and bone disorder (MBD-CKD) is by bone biopsy. There are contradictory data on the effect of parathyroidectomy post transplantation but it seems sensible to treat severe hyperparathyroidism prior to transplantation. In KTRs, cinacalcet may be used; it successfully corrects hypercalcaemia and elevated PTH level, seems to improve bone mineral density, and may also have an antihypertensive effect. Caution should be exercised with high doses. In hyperparathyroidism refractory to pharmacological agents, parathyroidectomy also provides a benefit but should only be pursued when potential risks of such a procedure are considered.

The Panel Proposes

Provide ongoing care by an expert in metabolic bone disease who recognizes the importance of multidisciplinary services at the transition to adulthood — along with patient support groups — to address disease-related comorbidities.
Continue medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) for at least several years following epiphyseal closure enabling the optimization of peak bone mass which occurs at approximately 20 to 25 years of age in asymptomatic individuals.
Provide medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) in the presence of symptoms or biochemical/histological evidence of osteomalacia (bone pain, weakness, osteomalacic fractures, elevated ALP, or osteomalacia on bone biopsy)
Optimize medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) prior to undertaking orthopedic surgeries or dental implant surgeries.
Provide ongoing adult care with pharmacotherapeutic management (with either burosumab or conventional therapy) with consideration of the benefits and risks of therapy and the patient's capacity for ongoing monitoring.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low to mid normal (peak) or just below the normal or low normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
If burosumab is not available, symptomatic adults should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts).
Phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), the fasting serum phosphorus should not serve as a target. It is not necessary to achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to treat XLH, and the high phosphate loads used to accomplish this often lead to severe hyperparathyroidism.
Treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts should be modified to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.
Burosumab is contraindicated in CKD (GFR less than 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use may be considered in the presence of an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring.
Treat hypertension using current regional recommendations pertaining to hypertension management.
Treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia, where multi-gland involvement is anticipated, with off-label use of calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) to lower PTH levels, with careful monitoring of serum calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia remain uncontrolled, a subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Treat hypercalciuria by reducing the dose of active vitamin D, and in persistent hypercalciuria, hydrochlorothiazide or potassium citrate may be used. The panel also proposes a low sodium intake (< 1500 mg/day) and increased fluid intake up to 3 L/24 hours in the presence of hypercalciuria.
Early referral to the spinal team with physiotherapy in cases of spinal scoliosis.
Treat spinal scoliosis with surgical fixation if the Cobb angle is greater than 30 degrees depending on the rate of progression and location of the curve.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^44e8c094]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications of Medical Therapy

Important side effects complicate treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets. Phosphate salts cause gastrointestinal symptoms, including dyspepsia and a laxative effect. Decreasing the dose and gradual upward titration may improve tolerability.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is commonly present prior to starting treatment in XLH, but is also worsened by phosphate salts. Secondary hyperparathyroidism affects over 80% of patients with XLH, and up to 25% to 30% of adults with XLH develop hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism during conventional therapy, with lower rates in childhood. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism tends to occur with higher phosphate doses and longer durations of treatment. A calcimimetic (ie, cinacalcet) may be attempted; however, insurance approval may be a barrier, and nausea is a common side effect. Regarding surgical intervention, resection of multiple parathyroid glands is typically required due to multigland hyperplasia. Risks include persistent hypercalcemia after incomplete resection, recurrence of hypercalcemia years later, or postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^1cf6d496]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypercalcemia is relatively uncommon in the general population, with an overall prevalence of 1 in 1000 individuals. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism (HPT). There are 4 mechanisms of malignancy-related hypercalcemia, including humoral hypercalcemia via the secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), local osteolytic hypercalcemia, excess production of extra-renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and ectopic secretion of parathyroid hormone. The primary goal of therapy is the treatment of the underlying malignancy. Antihypercalcemia therapy should be considered an interim measure. The available treatments for malignancy-related hypercalcemia include intravenous hydration, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, denosumab, and calcimimetics.

HPT is caused by overactive parathyroid glands and can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more parathyroid glands secrete excess parathyroid hormone, resulting in hypercalcemia without a known stimulus. Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only curative treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary HPT is nearly universal in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).PTH is elevated in response to decreased production of calcitriol from failed kidneys, elevated serum phosphorus, and decreased serum calcium. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline recommends maintaining PTH levels in the range of 2 to 9 times the upper normal limit in patients with ESKD. Treatment of secondary HPT usually includes PTx and the use of calcimimetics, such as cinacalcet. Successful kidney transplantation (KT) corrects the endocrine and metabolic imbalances responsible for secondary HPT. However, secondary HPT can persist and become tertiary HPT post-KT. Tertiary HPT is caused by autonomous function of multiple hyperplastic parathyroid glands, characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with hypercalcemia or normocalcemia. Persistent HPT post-KT carries a significant clinical burden and is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The reported prevalence of tertiary HPT post-KT can be as high as 80%. Tertiary HPT is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, renal osteodystrophy, pathologic fractures, graft loss, and mortality in KT recipients.

### Treatment of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation is associated with improved allograft survival [^69a67e04]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 280 KT recipients with hypercalcemic tertiary HPT included in this study, 49 recipients underwent parathyroidectomy, 98 recipients were only prescribed cinacalcet, and 133 recipients did not receive any treatment. Recipients who received treatment were more likely to require dialysis before KT (P = 0.019) and had a longer dialysis vintage (ie, length of time on dialysis) (P = 0.017) than the no treatment group. We did not find differences in the patient's demographics, baseline comorbidities, insurance type, or etiology of ESKD between groups (Table 1). There was no difference in the characteristics of kidney transplantation between the 3 groups (Table 2). There was significantly more death (P = 0.003), death-censored graft failure (P < .001), and all-cause graft failure (P < .001) in the no treatment group than in the treatment groups.

Characteristics and clinical outcome of kidney transplantation.

We then evaluated the characteristics of HPT post-KT in each treatment group (Table 2). Compared to the no treatment group, recipients who were treated for hypercalcemic tHPT had higher PTH levels before KT (P = 0.002) and earlier onset of hypercalcemia post-KT (P < .001). The mean (± SD) follow-up length for all patients was 43.5 ± 19.4 months. At the most recent follow-up, there were statistically significant differences in PTH (P = 0.012) and serum calcium (P < .001) levels between each group. After conducting post hoc analyses, the PTx group had a significantly lower median (IQR) PTH levels than the cinacalcet group (adjusted P = 0.015). There was no difference in most-recent PTH levels between the PTx group and the no treatment group (adjusted P = 0.643) or cinacalcet group vs. no treatment group (adjusted P = 0.100). The PTx group had significantly lower medium (± SD) serum calcium than the cinacalcet group (adjusted P < .001) and the no treatment group (adjusted P < .001). There was no difference in serum calcium between the cinacalcet group and the no treatment group (adjusted P = 0.215).

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^dfe15e8f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional Therapy

Generally, symptomatic adults with XLH are treated with phosphate salts (750–2000 mg/day) divided into 3 to 4 doses daily, and active vitamin D (calcitriol [0.5 to 1 µg/day] or alfacalcidol [0.75–1.5 μg daily]), especially when treating osteomalacia or fractures. Doses may then be lowered during the maintenance phase of treatment to minimize long-term complications. A balanced use of calcitriol (useful in dampening PTH secretion) and phosphate is of value in order to avoid phosphate stimulation of PTH, which exacerbates renal phosphate loss and further lowers serum phosphate. Importantly, phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy without concurrent active vitamin D. Active vitamin D without phosphate salts, however, may be considered in adults with mild symptoms.

Figure 4.
GRADEd monitoring recommendations for follow-up in adults with XLH.

Figure 5.
GRADEd treatment recommendations in adult XLH.

Adequate dietary calcium intake is recommended to provide calcium for skeletal mineralization and the healing of osteomalacia and rickets, especially during the first few months of treatment, acknowledging that the active vitamin D also increases gastrointestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, and the combination may increase the risk of hypercalciuria. As calcium supplements act as phosphate binders, potentially reducing the bioavailability of phosphate supplements, calcium intake must be separated 1 hour from phosphate intake. Elevated PTH with concomitant low urinary Ca/Cr may indicate the need for increasing the calcium intake.

Phosphate supplementation is often limited by gastrointestinal tolerability issues, including dyspepsia, and a laxative effect. Patients may opt to discontinue phosphate replacement due to gastrointestinal side effects. As mentioned above, complications of conventional therapy include secondary and tertiary (hypercalcemic) hyperparathyroidism, nephrocalcinosis, and CKD. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs in about 25% to 30% of adults with XLH and may develop several years after stopping conventional therapy. The resulting hypercalcemia limits the use of active vitamin D. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually requires multi-gland parathyroidectomy, and hypercalcemia can still recur. Cinacalcet may be effective as adjunctive therapy for hyperparathyroidism.

### Development and treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B [^4c91bb6c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP1B) patients have PTH resistance at the renal proximal tubule and develop hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroid bone disease also develops in some patients. PHP1B patients are at theoretical risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Setting

Patients were studied in a clinical research center.

Patients

Five female PHP1B patients presented with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH.

Intervention

Patients either underwent parathyroidectomy (n = 4) or received cinacalcet (n = 1).

Main Outcome Measures

Serum calcium and PTH were serially measured before and after intervention.

Results

Five PHP1B patients developed concomitantly elevated serum calcium and PTH levels (range, 235–864 ng/liter) requiring termination of calcium and vitamin D therapy (time after diagnosis, 21–42 yr; median, 34 yr), consistent with tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Four patients underwent parathyroidectomy with removal of one (n = 2) or two (n = 2) enlarged parathyroid glands. Calcium and vitamin D therapy was reinstituted postoperatively, and at 93-month median follow-up, PTH levels ranged between 56 and 182 (normal, < 87) ng/liter. One patient was treated with cinacalcet, resulting in resolution of hypercalcemia.

Conclusions

PHP1B patients are at risk of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism and/or hyperparathyroid bone disease and should therefore be treated with sufficient doses of calcium and vitamin D to achieve serum calcium and PTH levels within or as close to the normal range as possible. Surgery is the treatment of choice in this setting. Cinacalcet may be a useful alternative in those who do not undergo surgery.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^a701f235]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^d753f73e]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Because hyperparathyroidism is rare, children and adolescents as well as adults in the Netherlands are referred to a single specialized center for treatment. The Emma Children's Hospital AMC is an integrated pediatric hospital in the Amsterdam Medical Centre; both are specialized academic tertiary hospitals. To ensure high quality care, it is necessary to know whether it is possible to treat children and adolescents with renal hyperparathyroidism in the same way adults are treated for this disease.

The amount of information or evidence available was scarce; therefore this study was set up to investigate this matter. To research the outcome of parathyroidectomy it is necessary to be more specific than merely observing a decrease in PTH values and in symptoms, as reported in the 11 articles reviewed later. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative was searched for guidelines and definitions for effectiveness of parathyroidectomy treatment, but none were found.

To provide a specific outcome evaluation, a PTH value that provided a realistic representation of effectively treated patients was needed. This was the value at which parathyroidectomy was found to be effective and reoperation was generally not considered. A PTH value of 8 pmol/l is generally considered normal. However, because of the variations in serum calcium that may result from dialysis, this is not a realistic value for most patients with renal failure who have undergone parathyroidectomy. As shown in Fig. 4, only 52% of adults and 38% of children would be considered effectively treated if a value of 8 pmol/l were upheld. This does not represent the effectiveness of treatment as patients with a value higher than 8 pmol/l but with a significant reduction of symptoms are still considered effectively treated. A PTH value of 25 pmol/l (three times the lower limit) or less gives a more realistic representation, with nearly three-quarters of patients effectively treated.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^da9496cd]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The choice of this value explains the difference in outcome between our group of patients and the patients described in the 11 articles reviewed later, as most of the latter patients did not have specific criteria as to what can be defined as effective treatment.

The results from our study give us reason to believe that parathyroidectomy is an effective treatment for hyperparathyroidism, in children as well as in adults. There were no significant differences between the children and adolescents and the adults in our study. Seven adult patients showed serum PTH values associated with aparathyroidism, 65 patients had no aparathyroidism. Aparathyroidism was not seen in the children and adolescent group.

In 54 patients we believe that autotransplantation prevented aparathyroidism, but in 14 of these patients we considered the autotransplant to have a hyper function. For 18 patients, 1 child and 17 adults, we were unable to confirm that it did, as 7 had aparathyroidism and 11 had not had four glands removed. No significant differences in effectiveness were seen between the two groups, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

Percentage effectively treated at different PTH values

Fig. 5
Illustration of differences between adults and children in effectiveness of parathyroidectomy as treatment for hyperparathyroidism

We were not able to find any significant predictive factors for an effective surgical treatment, and therefore no comparison could be made between the two groups. In addition to our study, we performed a specific literature search on the operative treatment of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents. 1 The PubMed search that was performed produced 125 articles, of which only 11 examined parathyroidectomy in children or adolescents with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. These 11 articles are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5
Literature overview of parathyroidectomies performed on children suffering from secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism

As we wanted to know if parathyroidectomy is an effective treatment for secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents, we searched these 11 articles for effective and ineffective outcome findings. Generally, an outcome was considered to be effective if the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism-related bone disease and PTH values were reduced. Ten of the 11 articles reported effective outcome results in 35 of 36 patients treated. In one article, only the abstract was traceable and it contained no information on the type of operation or effectiveness.

### PTH spikes during surgical treatment for secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism: a prospective observational study [^a02688da]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of the present study was to determine whether PTH spikes in renal hyperparathyroidism can interfere with the interpretation of intraoperative PTH monitoring and to determine its frequency and characteristics.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study of consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment in a single tertiary institution. Patients were divided into two groups: spike and no spike. Patients with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism were analyzed separately. Intraoperative PTH monitoring by venous serial samples: two samples were taken before the excision of the parathyroid gland, and two others were taken after resection.

Results

PTH spikes occurred in 23.5% (53 of 226), and their occurrence was similar between secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism patients (p = 0.074). The relative PTH spike intensity was higher in transplanted patients than in dialysis patients (55 vs. 20%, p = 0.029). A characteristic of the secondary hyperparathyroidism patients was the highest frequency of surgical failure (23 vs. 7.5%, p = 0.016) and the higher occurrence of supernumerary glands in the spike group (23 vs. 10.3%, p = 0.035). Supernumerary parathyroid was associated with surgical failure [19.1 (6.5–55.7) odds ratio [confidence interval], p < 0.001). In the studies evaluating the diagnostic test validity for patients on dialysis and experiencing spikes, the most significant impacts were in the sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of the method.

Conclusions

PTH spikes occurred in up to 23.5% of renal hyperparathyroidism surgical treatments and can negatively influence the intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring. Regarding the phenomenon of PTH spikes, it is prudent to think about the possibility of a hyperplastic supernumerary gland.

### Significance of elevated parathyroid hormone after parathyroidectomy [^514a47e3]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the prevalence of parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism and to discuss possible mechanisms.

Methods

A Medline search of the English-language literature published between 1990 and 2009 was performed using the search terms "elevated PTH after parathyroidectomy". All of the identified articles reported either prospective or retrospective studies without control groups. Studies that included patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism were not reviewed.

Results

Within 1 week to 5 years after parathyroidectomy, 9% to 62% of patients with a normal serum calcium concentration are reported to have an elevated parathyroid hormone concentration. No evidence suggests that postoperative normocalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation is an indication of surgical failure and recurrent hypercalcemia. Preoperative findings in patients with postoperative parathyroid hormone elevation include lower vitamin D concentration, higher concentrations of bone turnover markers, and higher parathyroid hormone concentration. Potential mechanisms for parathyroid hormone elevation in the setting of normocalcemia include vitamin D deficiency, hungry bone syndrome, and parathyroid hormone resistance. Study findings suggest a possible benefit of postoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation, but no randomized trials have been done.

Conclusion

Elevation of parathyroid hormone commonly occurs after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

### Calciphylaxis due to hyperparathyroidism [^1e4d28a3]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss when and how to workup calciphylaxis for early diagnosis and to delineate medical vs surgical management of the disease.

Methods

Review of evidence-based medical literature on calciphylaxis due to primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

Calciphylaxis is usually associated with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. However, calciphylaxis can also be seen in the absence of chronic renal failure and has been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. Calciphylaxis occurs when the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood exceed their solubility level, leading to calcium-phosphate deposits in arteries that compromise the vasculature. These ischemic changes result in plaque-like lesions that progress to painful nodules. Calciphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of physical examination, laboratory, and histopathologic findings. When medical therapy has failed in the setting of secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with calciphylaxis, parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment. In primary hyperparathyroidism, early recognition and aggressive wound care with debridement are important in managing this condition. However, resection of the offending parathyroid gland should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

When calciphylaxis is present, early detection is critical to the successful management of this condition. Although medical therapy can be effective, surgical resection of the diseased parathyroid glands can be curative and potentially life saving. A multidisciplinary approach involving early diagnosis, aggressive medical management, operative debridement, and parathyroidectomy has the best chance of improving survival in calciphylaxis.

### Parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients [^cb7357a5]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large database study, we showed that hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism have better survival when treated by parathyroidectomy than those treated with Cinacalcet despite having more severe disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the outcomes between these treatment modalities.

The rate of parathyroidectomy to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism has decreased in recent years, mostly due to the expansion of medical therapeutic options to treat the disease. Surgery is associated with a low risk of recurrent disease, improved quality of life, lower risk of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and decreased risk of graft failure in transplant recipients. In 2004, Kestenbaum et al. have reported improved survival following parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism when compared to those who did not undergo surgery. Our study shows that the survival advantage of surgery over medical therapy persists more than a decade later and surpasses that of Cinacalcet. Parathyroidectomy in ESRD patients, however, is associated with significant perioperative risks including a two-percent 30-day postoperative mortality reported in the literature and 3.7% mortality risk in our study. Due to these risks, clinicians follow the KDIGO guidelines and only refer patients with severe refractory disease for surgery.

While Cinacalcet has been shown to lower PTH levels and improve calcium-phosphorus homeostasis, it failed to reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular events as shown in the EVOLVE trial. After the EVOLVE trial showed that Cinacalcet decreased the rate of parathyroidectomy, the rate of parathyroidectomies in the USA decreased between 2004 and 2005 with Cinacalcet made available; however, the rate of surgery rose again shortly after. The suggested rationale is that the severity of the side effects caused the doses used in clinical practice to be much lower than those used in the trial. The other drawback to Cinacalcet use is the high cost.

Despite these drawbacks, Cinacalcet remains a reasonable treatment option for secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is important to point out that all the studies thus far have compared Cinacalcet to other medical treatments but not to surgery. The only study to compare surgery to Cinacalcet was in patients with hypercalcemia in transplant recipients (Tertiary hyperparathyroidism), and it showed that surgery was superior in correcting hypercalcemia.

### Tertiary hyperparathyroidism… [^c272fa74]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism commonly have parathyroid hyperplasia and should have a bilateral neck exploration with subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to obtain long-term cure. Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary referral medical center. Four patients had transient hypocalcemia, and no other permanent complications or deaths occurred. Biochemical cure was achieved in 94% of patients with a mean follow-up of 4. 8 years. Conclusions Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is usually due to multiple hyperplastic parathyroid glands, and patients who have initial limited parathyroidectomy have a higher risk of persistent or recurrent THPT. and hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone after a successful kidney transplantation.

4, 5 The THPT results in significant metabolic complications and symptoms, especially in patients who have had kidney transplants and are taking immunosuppressive therapy, which can be treated only by successful parathyroidectomy. 6–8. There is a consensus that patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism should have a bilateral neck exploration with subtotal or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. In patients with persistent or recurrent THPT, a unilateral or focused approach based on preoperative localizing studies was used. As part of routine care, before and after parathyroidectomy, serum calcium and PTH levels were collected prospectively. Intraoperative PTH measurement was used in some patients with THPT. The mean duration of hospitalization was 1. 1 days. The 1 patient who was hospitalized for 6 days developed severe hypocalcemia due to bone hunger and required intravenous calcium replacement. The mean follow-up time was 4.

8 years; 94% of patients were cured on the basis of total serum calcium levels within the reference range, and
70. 6% were cured on the basis of PTH levels within the reference range. Patients with THPT commonly have significant symptoms and metabolic complications that improve after parathyroidectomy. 5–8 In THPT, the autonomous growth and hypersecretion of PTH from the parathyroid glands is thought to subside after successful kidney transplantation.

### Prolonged high-dose phosphate treatment: a risk factor for tertiary hyperparathyroidism in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets [^25a7cfff]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia and defective bone mineralization. Treatment with oral phosphate (Pi) and calcitriol improves skeletal changes but associates with secondary hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare complication of the treatment. The aim of the present study was to identify treatment-related factors that might be associated with the transition of secondary hyperparathyroidism to tertiary hyperparathyroidism in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.

Design

Thirteen patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism were included in the study. Their hospital records were reviewed and compared for onset, duration and dosage of treatment, and for age of diagnosis and degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

Two patients developed tertiary hyperparathyroidism and 11 patients secondary hyperparathyroidism during the treatment. Patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism had, on average, earlier onset and longer duration of treatment, higher dose of Pi and longer duration of treatment with very high Pi doses (> 100 mg/kg/day) compared to the 11 patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, variation of all parameters was great with considerable overlap. Very high S-PTH levels ≥ 42 pmol/l were observed in those who later developed tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusions

Prolonged very high dose oral Pi treatment is a major risk factor for the development of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^3ee28f51]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Medical therapy for TIO

Therapy should be initiated as soon as a biochemical diagnosis has been made to minimize HBS and prepare the skeleton for surgery (Table 2, Fig. 2). In patients with nonlocalizable, nonresectable, or recurrent tumors, the therapeutic goal of medical treatment is to ease clinical symptoms, restore phosphate homeostasis, and normalize ALP and PTH levels.

Traditionally, the approach to medical therapy has been conventional therapy: phosphate salts and active vitamin D (calcitriol, alfacalcidol). However, these have a narrow therapeutic range, require multiple daily doses and intensive monitoring, and are often difficult to tolerate. Side effects include gastrointestinal intolerance, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, impaired renal function, and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism. It is important not to treat with phosphate salts alone due to their tendency to induce hyperparathyroidism and their limited effectiveness.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^ffd0f134]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The last international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) were published in 2014. Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. © 2022 The Authors.

### Recurrent tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to supernumerary parathyroid glands in a patient receiving long-term hemodialysis: a case report [^56ea1c2a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone levels secondary to derangements in the homeostasis of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D. Rapid correction of severe and prolonged hyperparathyroidism by surgical parathyroidectomy in long-term hemodialysis patients occasionally causes hungry bone syndrome. These patients then exhibit severe and long-lasting secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism with high bone turnover.

Case Presentation

We report a case of recurrent tertiary hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy due to supernumerary parathyroid gland in a patient with long-term hemodialysis. Supplementation with intravenous calcium, oral calcium, and vitamin D immediately after patient surgery helps to prevent and treat hungry bone syndrome.

Conclusions

We should prompt a search for the supernumerary parathyroid glands in ESRD patients, who have recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy. ESRD patients are more likely to develop hungry bone syndrome after parathyroidectomy. Prevention and treatment of hungry bone syndrome may be required after ectopic parathyroidectomy in clinical practice.

### Tertiary hyperparathyroidism after high-dose phosphate therapy in adult-onset hypophosphatemic osteomalacia [^7d191b45]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of adult-onset hypophosphatemic osteomalacia treated with orally administered phosphate and complicated by tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

We present pertinent clinical, radiologic, and laboratory details of the study patient for a period of more than 20 years and discuss the few reported cases of tertiary hyperparathyroidism attributable to prolonged phosphate therapy.

Results

A 49-year-old Jordanian man, who had been diagnosed at age 26 years as having sporadic adult-onset hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant osteomalacia, presented with severe right hip pain, severe osteopenia with lytic bone lesions, and hypercalcemia after prolonged oral treatment with phosphate and vitamin D. These clinical, radiologic, and biochemical findings, in conjunction with a very high serum parathyroid hormone level, indicated the diagnosis of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which was substantiated histopathologically.

Conclusion

Physicians should be aware of the potential for development of tertiary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving prolonged oral phosphate therapy.

### Missed opportunities to diagnose and treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism after transplant [^76b0fe33]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (3HPT) is common after renal transplant. However, guidelines for diagnosis are not clear and few patients are treated surgically. This study aims to determine rates of diagnosis and treatment of 3HPT in renal transplant patients with hypercalcemia.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective chart review identified all renal transplant recipients at a single tertiary care institution between 2011 and 2021. Patients with post-transplant hypercalcemia (> 10.2 mg/dL) were identified. The time in months of index hypercalcemia was noted. Measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after index hypercalcemia was determined and noted as elevated if > 64 pg/mL at least 6 mo after transplant. Documentation of symptoms of hyperparathyroidism, a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism in the electronic medical record, and medical or surgical management of patients with classic 3HPT (elevated calcium and PTH) were determined.

Results

Of 383 renal transplant recipients, hypercalcemia was identified in 132 patients. The majority of hypercalcemic patients had PTH levels measured (127, 96.2%). PTH was elevated in 109 (82.6%). Among the 109 patients with classic 3HPT, 54 (49.5%) had a documented diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism in the electronic medical record (P = 0.01). Kidney stones or abnormal DEXA scan were present in 16 (14.7%) and 18 (16.5%), respectively. Most patients were managed non-surgically (101, 92.6%); calcimimetics were prescribed for 42 (38.5%, P = 0.01). Eight (7.3%) patients with classic 3HPT were referred to a surgeon (P = 0.35); all were initially prescribed calcimimetics (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

3HPT is underdiagnosed in patients with elevated calcium and PTH levels post-transplant. A significant percentage of these patients go without surgical referral and curative treatment.

### Recurrent tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to supernumerary parathyroid glands in a patient receiving long-term hemodialysis: a case report [^667cb0d7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Supernumerary (more than four) parathyroid glands may be result from the separation of parathyroid anlage when the glands pull away from the pouch structures during the embryologic branchial complex phase. These additional parathyroid glands are a common cause of recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy. Residual small supernumerary glands with diffuse hyperplasia have the potential to be transformed to nodular hyperplasia during long-term hemodialysis. In a retrospective study of 290 patients with renal hyperparathyroidism underwent reoperative parathyroidectomy, supernumerary parathyroid glands were identified in 87 patients (30%), corresponding to intrathymic in 70 cases and to extrathymic in 17 cases. Supernumerary parathyroid glands are thus present in 30% of patients with renal hyperparathyroidism and are also responsible for 32% of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Thus, resecting the thymic tongue during the initial operation may reduce the need for reoperative parathyroidectomy to prevent recurrences arising from anterior mediastinal glands. Beside, routine bilateral cervical thymectomy during the initial parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism seems to be acceptable and can be recommended in patients on permanent hemodialysis not awaiting kidney transplantation.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism represents an autonomous and advanced form of secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is seen in ESRD patients receiving long-term dialysis and/or kidney transplant. Loss of response to serum calcium concentration leads to parathyroid glands with hyperplasia and autonomous activity, which then leads to elevated serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels. When PTH concentration rises, it causes certain complications in bone, vessels or tissues such as osteomalacia, osteoporosis, osteitis fibrosa cystica, vascular calcification, and soft tissue calcification. Operative correction of tertiary hyperparathyroidism is indicated if hypersecretion of PTH and severe or symptomatic hypercalcemia. Parathyroidectomy is considered to be the only curative treatment for patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and all parathyroid glands should be examined. In addition, medical treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism with Cinacalcet has been reported to be efficacious. A systemic review comparing the outcomes of surgical and medical treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism concluded that surgical treatment has higher cure rates than medical therapy. One study reported that the diameter of the parathyroid gland is a main factor involved in resistance to Cinacalcet. Parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is associated with lesser rates of renal allograft failure in cinacalcet management.

### Parathyroidectomy versus cinacalcet for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients [^3060f17b]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis is associated with bone pain and fractures in addition to accelerated vascular calcification. It has been shown that elevated levels of phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and fibroblast growth factor 23 are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Cinacalcet (Sensipar/Mimpara, Amgen) is a calcimimetic that activates the calcium-sensing receptor (CSR) on the parathyrocytes that is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism after showing effectiveness in reducing the levels of PTH levels as well as calcium and phosphorus levels in randomized controlled trials. The Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial, however, showed that Cinacalcet did not reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular morbidity in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are undergoing dialysis.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD-MBD Update Work Group recommends calcimimetics such as Cinacalcet, Calcitriol, Vitamin D analogs, or a combination of calcimimetics with calcitriol or vitamin D analogs in patients requiring PTH-lowering therapy. The guidelines also recommend parathyroidectomy in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism who fail to respond to medical therapy.

Parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD has been shown to have a higher complication and death rate compared to parathyroidectomy when performed for other indications. As such, surgery has been reserved for patients with refractory disease that is otherwise uncontrolled with medical therapy. There has been a single prospective randomized study comparing parathyroidectomy with Cinacalcet in treating hyperparathyroidism, but it was performed in patients with persistent hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation (tertiary hyperparathyroidism). The study showed that parathyroidectomy was superior to Cinacalcet in achieving normocalcemia and improving bone mass density (BMD).

The aim of this study is to compare the long-term outcomes and survival between Cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving hemodialysis using The United States Renal Data System (USRDS).

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hyperparathyroidism: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^2e459926]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disease characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which disrupts normal calcium and phosphorus metabolism. It can be caused by either intrinsic changes involving excessive PTH excretion (primary hyperparathyroidism [PHPT] or tertiary hyperparathyroidism [THPT]) or extrinsic changes affecting calcium homeostasis (secondary hyperparathyroidism [SHPT]). Hyperparathyroidism results in various functional abnormalities, including nephrolithiasis, pathologic bone fractures, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, neuropsychiatric, and musculoskeletal symptoms, and thus requires treatment. Current guidelines recommend surgical intervention, specifically parathyroidectomy, as the first-line treatment course for patients with symptomatic PHPT and those with SHPT unresponsive to medical treatments.

Although surgery is generally safe, patients with hyperparathyroidism often have serious comorbidities that increase the risk of postoperative complications and reduce tolerance to parathyroidectomy, especially among elderly patients. Given the successful outcomes and safety profiles of thermal ablation (TA) for malignant tumors of the lung, kidney, and liver, TA has been increasingly investigated as a treatment modality for parathyroid lesions in recent years. As an alternative to surgery, TA offers a minimally invasive treatment option, especially for patients who are ineligible for surgery or decline surgical intervention. Among the various TA options, which include microwave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, MWA and RFA have been most frequently used for treating hyperparathyroidism.

Although there have been some recent studies that reported favorable outcomes following MWA or various TA methods for parathyroid lesions, studies specifically focusing on the efficacy and safety of RFA are notably absent. Therefore, this meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to consolidate and evaluate the published literature on the use of RFA for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism.

### Outcome of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation as treatment of secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism in children and adults [^8e2e3b02]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

A list of all patients who had been treated by complete removal of the parathyroid glands and autotransplantation to the forearm (PTx) from 1988 to 2006 was retrieved from the operation administration of the Amsterdam Medical Centre. Indications for surgical treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are severe hypercalcemia (> 3 mmol/l), progressive and incapacitating hyperparathyroid bone disease, and severe pruritis. For tertiary hyperparathyroidism, the indications are consistently high parathyroid hormone levels (> 35 pmol/l) and calcium levels (> 2.60 mmol/l) and hypercalciuria after renal organ transplantation.

Data on these patients were collected from patient files, operative reports, and office notes, mainly from the Amsterdam Medical Centre digital hospital information system. Data collected consisted of patient demographics, record of renal transplant in the patient's history and/or type of dialysis at the time of operation, details of the parathyroidectomy, complications, including all adverse outcomes that occurred after the operation and required treatment by any means, and any reoperations necessary for persistent hypercalcemia.

The adults had a mean age of 48.6 years ± 11.3 with a minimum age of 23.1 years and a maximum of 72.4 years. The children had a mean age of 13.8 years ± 3.2 with a minimum of 8.8 years and a maximum of 17.8 years. Further patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Group specifics

Surgery

Total parathyroidectomy with forearm autograft is the standard of care for these patients at the AMC, and it was performed in all 81 patients. Cervical thymectomy was only performed if the surgeon deemed it necessary. Autotransplantation was performed by implanting half a parathyroid gland cut into, on average, fifteen 1 mm 3 pieces into three pockets in the brachioradial muscle of the forearm.

### Hyperparathyroidism… [^3b3c858c]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

glands make a substance called parathyroid hormone, which regulates the level of calcium in the blood. By helping the body absorb calcium from food, PTH maintains a healthful level of calcium for strong bone function. Also, PTH helps to control the amount of calcium that is released from bones and then excreted in urine. When the. parathyroid glands make too much PTH, a condition called primary hyperparathyroidism exists, causing abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood. Hyperparathyroidism can also occur as a result of other medical problems, such as kidney disease, and is then called secondary hyperparathyroidism. The April 13, 2005, issue of JAMA includes an article about primary hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis Because hyperparathyroidism often begins without symptoms, it may be diagnosed by high calcium levels on a routine blood test. Confirmation of high levels of PTH in the blood establishes the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.

Sometimes x-ray examination of the abdomen shows kidney stones caused by the high calcium levels. Bone density tests may be performed to indicate the extent. Fatigue Depression Memory problems Abdominal pain Pain in other areas of the body Constipation Complications Kidney stones High blood pressure Osteoporosis Fractures of weak bones Treatment Surgery is the usual treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. The. glands are surgically removed through a small incision in the neck. The most common complications of this surgery are damage to the nerve supplying the vocal cords and low blood levels of calcium. Hypocalcemia following surgery can be treated with medication and. often resolves in a few months after the operation. If an individual does not have any symptoms from hyperparathyroidism, close monitoring of blood calcium levels may be chosen for treatment instead of surgery.

This monitoring includes checking blood calcium levels and examinations by a doctor looking for possible complications of hyperparathyroidism.

### Comparative effects of etelcalcetide and maxacalcitol on serum calcification propensity in secondary hyperparathyroidism: a randomized clinical trial [^6b61486d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Vitamin D receptor activators and calcimimetics (calcium-sensing receptor agonists) are two major options for medical treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. A higher serum calcification propensity (a shorter T 50 value) is a novel surrogate marker of calcification stress and mortality in patients with CKD. We tested a hypothesis that a calcimimetic agent etelcalcetide is more effective in increasing T 50 value than a vitamin D receptor activator maxacalcitol.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial with active control was conducted in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism undergoing hemodialysis in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous etelcalcetide 5 mg thrice weekly (etelcalcetide group) or intravenous maxacalcitol 5 or 10 µ g thrice weekly (maxacalcitol group). The primary, secondary, and tertiary outcomes were changes in T 50 value, handgrip strength, and score of the Dementia Assessment Sheet for Community-Based Integrated Care System from baseline to 12 months, respectively.

Results

In total, 425 patients from 23 dialysis centers were screened for eligibility, 326 patients were randomized (etelcalcetide, n = 167; control, n = 159), and 321 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age, 66 years; 113 women [35%]). The median (interquartile range) of T 50 value was changed from 116 minutes (interquartile range, 90–151) to 131 minutes (interquartile range, 102–176) in the maxacalcitol group, whereas it was changed from 123 minutes (interquartile range, 98–174) to 166 minutes (interquartile range, 127–218) in the etelcalcetide group. The increase in T 50 value was significantly greater in the etelcalcetide group (difference in change, 20 minutes; 95% confidence interval, 7 to 34 minutes; P = 0.004). No significant between-group difference was found in the change in handgrip strength or in the Dementia Assessment Sheet for Community-Based Integrated Care System score.

Conclusions

Etelcalcetide was more effective in increasing T 50 value than maxacalcitol among patients on hemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. There was no difference in handgrip strength or cognition between the two drugs.

KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) provides a US perspective, places the guideline in the context of supporting evidence and US care delivery, and summarizes differences between prior KDOQI guidelines and the newer KDIGO guideline. The guideline scope addresses evaluation and treatment of CKD-MBD in adults and children with CKD stages 3–5 on long-term dialysis therapy or with a kidney transplant, with tests related to laboratory, bone, and cardiovascular abnormality detection and monitoring. Treatments considered include interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease in patients with CKD stages 3-5D and 1-5T. It also considers the potential impact of a new bundled payment system for dialysis clinics, and explains that most recommendations are not of level 1 but of level 2 strength, which means weak or discretionary recommendations.

### Tertiary and postrenal transplantation hyperparathyroidism [^3c5ce7a9]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation (KTx) (KTxps) are a distinctive population characterized by the persistence of some metabolic anomalies present during end-stage renal disease. Mineral metabolism (MM) parameters are frequently altered after KTx. These alterations involve calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and parathormone (PTH) disarrangements. At present, there is little consensus about the correct monitoring and management of PTH disorders in KTxps. This article presents the prevalence and epidemiologic and clinical impact of post-KTx hyper-PTH. The principal biochemical and instrumental investigations and the therapeutic options for these conditions are also reported.

### Parathyroidectomy is safe and improves symptoms in elderly patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) [^816fbbef]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is curative in over 95% of cases. Although PHPT affects up to 2% of the elderly population, whose life expectancy may be a decade or more, such patients may be denied surgery because of perceived risk. This study investigates the outcomes of surgery for PHPT in the elderly.

Design and Patients

Consecutive patients with PHPT treated at a tertiary referral centre over 5 years.

Measurements

A prospective database recorded clinical, biochemical and pathological information. Pasieka's parathyroid symptom scores were obtained pre-operatively and post-operatively, from a recent subgroup of 70 consecutive patients. Deaths during follow-up were identified using the NHS Strategic Tracing Service. Statistical analysis was performed with spss v12.0.

Results

Between November 2002 and October 2007, 224 patients (17–89 years) underwent surgery for PHPT. In the subgroup comprising patients aged > 75 years there was a significantly greater proportion of women (47/56 vs. 52/81, P < 0.05). Pre-operative indices of these patients were similar to younger patients, as were proportions undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (n = 134) or bilateral neck exploration (n = 90). Patients > 75 years had a longer hospital stay (1.6 vs. 0.8 days, P = 0.003). Pasieka's symptom scores improved significantly at 3–6 months postoperatively in all age groups. During a minimum median follow-up of 22 months, there were seven patients with persistent/recurrent disease. Median 2-year survival of those aged 60–74 and those over 75 ranged from 85–90%.

Conclusion

Parathyroidectomy is safe in the elderly and is associated with a significant improvement in symptoms. As survival after operation is similar to younger patients, surgery should be considered in all elderly patients with PHPT.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^db9309a4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

This commentary provides a US perspective on the 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). KDIGO is an independent international organization with the primary mission of the promotion, coordination, collaboration, and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with kidney disease. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), recognizing that international guidelines need to be adapted for each country, convened a group of experts to comment on the application and implementation of the KDIGO guideline for patients with CKD in the United States. This commentary puts the KDIGO guideline into the context of the supporting evidence and the setting of care delivered in the United States and summarizes important differences between prior KDOQI guidelines and the newer KDIGO guideline. It also considers the potential impact of a new bundled payment system for dialysis clinics. The KDIGO guideline addresses the evaluation and treatment of abnormalities of CKD-MBD in adults and children with CKD stages 3–5 on long-term dialysis therapy or with a kidney transplant. Tests considered are those that relate to laboratory, bone, and cardiovascular abnormality detection and monitoring. Treatments considered are interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease in patients with CKD stages 3-5D and 1-5T. Limitations of the evidence are discussed. The lack of definitive clinical outcome trials explains why most recommendations are not of level 1 but of level 2 strength, which means weak or discretionary recommendations. Suggestions for future research highlight priority areas.

### The role of parathyroidectomy in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^9c9a4167]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is often used to treat severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. However, most evidence for the proposed benefits of PTX originates from observational studies, which cannot demonstrate causality. A reconsideration of the potential role of PTX might help guide its appropriate use.

Recent Findings

Several large observational studies have suggested that PTX can reduce mortality risk. However, these studies generally suffer from bias and confounding, tempering conclusions and suggesting that the true effects of PTX may not be known. PTX has been reported to be associated with a 2% 30-day mortality, a substantial risk for what is generally an elective procedure. Additionally, biochemical control after PTX in a subset of patients may be suboptimal. The optimal surgical approach to PTX in specific clinical scenarios is also uncertain.

Summary

PTX may be beneficial for certain patients with severe SHPT and clinical symptoms, but identifying patients in whom the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks is a substantial challenge. Further, great care must be taken to monitor symptoms and laboratory values in patients who undergo PTX in the immediate postoperative period and, in many cases, well beyond.

### Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism: causes of recurrent disease after 446 parathyroidectomies [^8547e469]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, in a series of patients with secondary and tertiary parathyroid hyperplasia, whether the type of parathyroidectomy (subtotal, total with autotransplantation, or total), the histologic pattern of the parathyroid tissue, or the proliferative index, as determined by Ki-67 analysis, could predispose patients to recurrent hyperparathyroidism.

Summary Background Data

Recurrent hyperparathyroidism appears in 10–70% of the patients undergoing surgery for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The incidence could be related to the type of operation (Rothmund) but also depends on the histologic pattern of the glands removed (Niederle).

Methods

The retrospective investigation was performed on 446 patients undergoing parathyroid surgery. They were also studied in relation to the possibility of renal transplantation. In this population, two homogeneous groups were subsequently identified (23 patients with clear signs of recurrence and 27 patients apparently cured); they were studied from the histologic and immunohistochemical point of view using antibody to Ki-67 antigen.

Results

Subtotal parathyroidectomy, total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, and total parathyroidectomy produced similar results when considering the regression of osteodystrophy, pruritus, and ectopic calcification. As one could anticipate, total parathyroidectomy increased the incidence of hypoparathyroidism. The percentage of recurrence was 5% to 8% after subtotal parathyroidectomy, total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, and total parathyroidectomy, and only after incomplete parathyroidectomy did this percentage climb to 34.7%. In the recurrence group, the nodular form was more common and the proliferative fraction detected by Ki-67 was 1.9%; it was 0.81% in the control group.

Conclusions

Because more radical procedures were not more effective, the authors favor a less radical procedure such as subtotal parathyroidectomy. Histologic patterns and proliferative fraction could be useful indices of a recurrence, and these patients should be watched closely after surgery.
