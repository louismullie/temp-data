## Question

What is the best CT imaging to further evaluate an unicate process lesion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best CT imaging protocol to evaluate a lesion in the pancreatic uncinate process, and how to structure it step-by-step with justification and references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic and pathologic context of uncinate lesions and why they are challenging to detect. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline recommendation for CT protocol. Next, I will specify the exact multiphasic acquisition parameters, including timing, slice thickness, and coverage. After that, I need to check post-processing requirements and the key diagnostic features to assess. Finally, I should consider problem-solving adjuncts, pitfalls, and a concise bottom-line recommendation with caveats for special scenarios like contrast allergy or renal dysfunction.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why uncinate lesions are tricky. The uncinate process lies posterior to the SMA/SMV and is relatively distant from the CBD and MPD, so tumors there often present without biliary obstruction and can be isoattenuating and small, making them easy to miss on non-dedicated studies. Importantly, uncinate PDACs have a higher propensity for SMA/SMV encasement and duodenal invasion, which directly impacts resectability and surgical planning [^111jsUm2] [^115Wqqv8] [^1136aaP3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the highest-authority recommendation. The NCCN explicitly states that a pancreatic protocol CT is critical for preoperative planning in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and this applies to head and uncinate lesions where precise vascular relationships determine resectability; this is the strongest available directive for CT protocol selection in this setting [^116zG9Cu].

> I will now examine the specific multiphasic protocol elements. A pancreatic protocol CT should include a non-contrast phase, a pancreatic parenchymal phase at about 35–45 seconds, and a portal venous phase at about 60–70 seconds. Thin slices (≤ 1 mm) with overlapping reconstructions and multiplanar reformats are essential to define subtle lesions and vascular interfaces, and this approach is repeatedly emphasized in imaging reviews and surgical technique discussions of uncinate lesions [^1163Z5R4] [^1171zeNP].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and why each phase matters. The pancreatic parenchymal phase maximizes tumor–parenchyma contrast for small PDAC, which is often hypoenhancing, while the portal venous phase better depicts venous anatomy and duodenal involvement. Non-contrast images help detect calcifications and serve as a baseline for enhancement assessment, all of which are crucial for uncinate lesions abutting SMA/SMV and duodenum [^1163Z5R4] [^115Wqqv8].

> Next, I should review post-processing and display requirements. Multiplanar reformats in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, curved planar reformats along the SMA/SMV, and 3D volume rendering are necessary to accurately grade vessel contact and circumferential involvement. These reconstructions directly inform surgical strategy for uncinate resections and are standard in high-quality pancreatic CT workflows [^1163Z5R4].

> Let me consider the key diagnostic features I must document. I need to assess lesion attenuation relative to pancreas, degree and pattern of enhancement, relationship to SMA/SMV and portal vein including contact arc and fat plane loss, duodenal wall invasion, perineural tracking, and any lymphadenopathy or metastases. Uncinate PDACs are more likely to show SMA encasement and duodenal invasion, and early tumors may lack ductal dilatation, so I should double-check for subtle contour abnormalities and vascular abutment even when ducts are normal [^115Wqqv8] [^1136aaP3] [^112ZuRk2].

> But wait, what if the CT is negative and suspicion remains high. EUS has high sensitivity for small (≤ 2 cm) PDAC and offers the ability to obtain tissue; it is particularly useful when CT is equivocal or when a mass is not clearly seen, and EUS-guided FNA/FNB is the preferred sampling method for solid pancreatic masses including uncinate lesions [^111jsUm2] [^111qGBKC].

> I should confirm the role of PET in this context. FDG-PET/CT can help detect occult metastases and may add value in staging, but it is not a substitute for a high-quality pancreatic protocol CT for local tumor–vessel assessment. Moreover, physiologic SSTR uptake in the uncinate process can mimic NETs, so any PET finding must be correlated with anatomic imaging to avoid misclassification [^115acLoE] [^114jpzZw] [^1136pffv].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations. If iodinated contrast is contraindicated, non-contrast CT will be suboptimal for small isoattenuating PDAC; in that scenario, MRI with MRCP and contrast-enhanced sequences is the preferred alternative to preserve diagnostic performance for local staging and ductal evaluation, recognizing that CT remains first-line when contrast is safe [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the protocol summary to ensure nothing is missing. The best CT for an uncinate lesion is a pancreatic protocol multiphasic CT with non-contrast, pancreatic parenchymal phase, and portal venous phase acquisitions, using ≤ 1 mm slices with overlapping reconstructions and comprehensive multiplanar/3D post-processing; this maximizes detection of subtle hypoenhancing tumors and precisely defines relationships to SMA/SMV, portal vein, and duodenum, directly informing surgical resectability and operative planning [^116zG9Cu] [^1163Z5R4].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Pancreatic protocol CT is the modality of choice for uncinate lesions. If the CT is negative but clinical suspicion persists, proceed to EUS with tissue acquisition, and reserve PET/CT for staging rather than primary detection. Always correlate PET findings with anatomic imaging to avoid false positives from physiologic uptake, and tailor modality selection when contrast is contraindicated [^116zG9Cu] [^111jsUm2] [^114jpzZw].

The best CT imaging for evaluating an uncinate process lesion is a **multiphasic pancreatic protocol CT** [^116zG9Cu] with thin slices (≤ 1 mm), reconstructed in multiple planes, and with **arterial and venous phases** to optimize detection and delineation of small, isoattenuating tumors and their vascular relationships [^1163Z5R4]. This protocol is superior to standard CT because it **improves sensitivity for small lesions** [^112ZuRk2], defines vascular invasion [^114SWTSN], and guides surgical planning [^116zG9Cu]. If CT is inconclusive, EUS or MRI/MRCP should be added for further characterization and tissue diagnosis [^111jsUm2] [^1171zeNP].

---

## Recommended CT protocol

| **Phase** | **Timing** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast | Baseline | Detect calcifications, hemorrhage, and baseline lesion density |
| Arterial (pancreatic) | 35–45 seconds | - Maximize tumor-pancreas contrast <br/> - Detect small hypovascular lesions <br/> - Assess arterial invasion |
| Portal venous | 60–70 seconds | - Evaluate venous invasion <br/> - Assess lymph nodes <br/> - Detect liver metastases |

- **Slice thickness**: ≤ 1 mm with 50% overlap for optimal spatial resolution and multiplanar reformatting [^1147Buh7].
- **Contrast**: High-concentration iodinated contrast (300–370 mg/mL) at 4–5 mL/s with a total dose of 1.5–2 mL/kg.
- **Reconstruction**: Multiplanar reformats (axial, coronal, sagittal) and 3D volume rendering to define vascular relationships and surgical planes [^111QoyD8].

---

## Advantages of pancreatic protocol CT

- **Enhanced lesion detection**: Small, isoattenuating lesions are better visualized due to optimal contrast timing [^notfound].
- **Vascular assessment**: Detailed evaluation of SMA, SMV, and portal vein involvement, critical for resectability [^114SWTSN].
- **Surgical planning**: Precise anatomical mapping facilitates operative strategy and reduces intraoperative surprises [^116zG9Cu].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

Despite its strengths, pancreatic protocol CT has limitations: **small lesions (< 1 cm)** may still be missed, particularly if isoattenuating or without ductal dilation [^1171zeNP]; **radiation exposure** is higher with multiphasic imaging; and **contrast nephropathy** is a risk in patients with renal impairment.

---

## Alternative and complementary imaging modalities

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: High sensitivity for small lesions, allows FNA for tissue diagnosis, and is particularly useful when CT is inconclusive [^111jsUm2] [^111qGBKC].
- **MRI/MRCP**: Superior soft-tissue contrast, useful for cystic lesions, ductal anatomy, and detecting subtle enhancement patterns [^1111porT].
- **PET/CT**: Limited role in PDAC; may help in selected cases but not routinely recommended due to low sensitivity and false positives [^111jsUm2].

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing CT protocol selection

- **Suspected malignancy**: Multiphasic pancreatic protocol CT is mandatory for diagnosis, staging, and surgical planning [^notfound].
- **Benign lesions**: Standard contrast-enhanced CT may suffice, but MRI/MRCP is preferred for cystic lesions to assess communication with the ductal system [^notfound].
- **Contrast contraindications**: Non-contrast CT or MRI should be considered, acknowledging reduced sensitivity.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Multiphasic pancreatic protocol CT with thin slices and multiplanar reformats is the **best CT imaging approach** for uncinate process lesions, providing optimal detection, vascular assessment, and surgical planning [^1171zeNP] [^116zG9Cu]. If CT is inconclusive, **EUS or MRI/MRCP should be added** for further characterization and tissue diagnosis [^111jsUm2] [^1171zeNP].

### Current knowledge on the sensitivity of the (68) Ga-somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography and the SUVmax reference range for management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours [^114my9hG]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In order to evaluate and establish the 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake for PNET lesions and differentiate the physiologic pancreatic uptake, our group calculated the SUV max. The SUV max amounted to 34.6 ± 17.1 for PNET lesions (n = 43). We differentiated these lesions and calculated 33.6 ± 14.3 for tumours of the uncinate process (n = 30) and 36.3 ± 21.5 for the pancreatic tail (n = 13). The pancreatic body served as "normal pancreas" for calculating the ratios. "Normal" pancreas was defined as faint/no uptake. Finally, a mean cut-off SUV max -value of 17.1 was assessed for differentiating tumours in the uncinate process with a specificity of 93.6% and a sensitivity of 90%. At this cut-off value we found true positive (TP) = 27, FP = 20, false negative (FN) = 3, true negative (TN) = 290, and the three cases of FN (i.e. CT-positive) with SUV max -values of 14.7, 12.8, and 11.7. We concluded that physiological uptake can pose difficulties in correctly analysing this region. In our cohort of > 1500 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC-PET/CT scans (years 2010–2014), 115 studies were performed to detect or exclude pancreatic malignancy (unpublished data): for 14 patients who underwent subsequent surgery, the SUV max -data of histopathologically verified PNETs indicated large variation, for the uncinate process 33.2 ± 15.1 (n = 3), pancreatic body 57.9 ± 67.6 (n = 3), and the pancreatic tail 47.2 ± 39.7 (n = 9). Cut-offs obtained by ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analyses were 17.1 for the uncinate process (specificity 92%; sensitivity 100%), for the pancreatic body 14.4 (specificity 100%; sensitivity 100%) and for the pancreatic tail 12.0 (specificity 92.5; sensitivity 88.9%).

Pancreas — Whenever possible, all portions of the pancreas — head, uncinate process, body, and tail — should be identified, and orally administered water and changes in patient positioning or patients' maneuvers, such as upright or decubitus positions, may afford better visualization of the pancreas. The following should be assessed in the examination of the pancreas: parenchymal abnormalities, such as masses and calcifications; the distal common bile duct in the region of the pancreatic head; the main pancreatic duct for dilatation and any other abnormalities, with dilatation confirmed by measurement; and the peripancreatic region for adenopathy or collections.

### Dilemmas in the management of screen-detected lesions in patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer [^113WWNCn]. Familial Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Case 1

The first patient, a 55-year-old male with a CDKN2A/p16 - Leiden mutation, was referred to the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the Leiden University Medical Centre in 2011 to discuss the option of pancreatic surveillance. The patient had no known family history of PDAC, and quit smoking in 2003.

The advantages and disadvantages of the surveillance program were discussed with the patient before he gave informed consent. In the summer of 2015, a solid 8 mm lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas was detected by MRI (Fig. 1, upper panel). Retrospectively, a small lesion was already visible on the previous MRI in 2014. The patient did not report any complaints and all blood tests were normal, including CA19.9. Subsequent CT scanning confirmed the presence of a solid 10 mm lesion (Fig. 1, lower panel), whereas EUS was normal.

Fig. 1
MRI (upper panel) and CT-scan (lower panel) of the pancreas in case 1

The patient was discussed by a multidisciplinary team and resection was recommended because two of the three imaging tools showed the presence of a solid lesion.

During surgical exploration, a small lesion was palpated in the uncinate process of the pancreas and a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) was performed. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen showed a 3 mm small area with sclerotic stroma and inflammation. Amidst the sclerosis ductular proliferation, with focal cribriform architecture was found. SMAD4 and p53 immunostaining was normal. Taking everything into account it was concluded that there was no evidence of (pre)cancer. A total of 23 lymph nodes were identified, all of which were free of tumor.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for SSTR PET: imaging neuroendocrine tumors [^1136pffv]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-PET sources of false-positive uptake and mitigation — Similarity between the SUVs of the physiologic pancreas and tumoral lesions of the head/uncinate process can result in false positive interpretations, and correlation with MRI or multiphase CT, with subsequent follow-up with SSTR-PET, may be useful in challenging cases. Splenules demonstrate high levels of physiologic uptake, similar to the spleen, making interpretation difficult in intrapancreatic splenules or when differentiating peritoneal splenosis from new tumor deposits after splenectomy; in these cases, heat-damaged red blood cell or sulfur colloid SPECT/CT may be useful to confirm ectopic splenic tissue. SSTR2 expression by normal osteoblasts and white blood cells including macrophages can lead to false positive interpretations; areas of high osteoblastic activity can have increased osseous uptake on SSTR-PET (including degenerative changes, fractures, and benign lesions such as fibrous dysplasia), and areas of high leukocyte activity can have increased uptake on SSTR-PET in post-radiation changes and reactive lymphadenopathy including sarcoidosis and infections such as tuberculosis; in challenging cases, correlation with dedicated CT and/or MRI can help distinguish tumor from non-tumor pathology.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115acLoE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — criteria for resection following neoadjuvant therapy emphasize that decisions about resectability status should be made in consensus at multidisciplinary meetings/discussions. For neoadjuvant therapy, consider PET/CT or PET/MRI scan before and after initiation to assess response to systemic therapy and for restaging, and resection may be considered only if there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Mild increases in perivascular soft tissue can be observed, but alone should not represent a contraindication to surgical exploration, and exploration following clear local progression on neoadjuvant therapy should be undertaken only after careful consideration in a multidisciplinary conference given its implications of aggressive tumor biology. Patients who initially presented with resectable or borderline resectable disease should be explored if their CA 19–9 is at least stable or has decreased and radiographic findings do not demonstrate clear progression. For patients with borderline resectable tumors, exploration may be undertaken if there is involvement of, or thrombus in, the SMV/PV as long as there is suitable patent vessel for vascular reconstruction proximal and distal to the site of involvement, and for borderline resectable tumors involving the pancreatic head/uncinate process, mild increases in soft tissue around the SMA/CHA/ variant arterial anatomy (replaced right hepatic artery [RHA] or GDA, or aorta) should not be considered a contraindication to surgical exploration in the setting of other signs of clinical improvement (ie, improvement in PS, pain, early satiety, weight/nutritional status). For patients who presented with locally advanced disease, exploration for resection should be considered if there is a significant decrease in CA 19–9 level and clinical improvement (ie, improvement in PS, pain, early satiety, weight/nutritional status) indicating response to therapy. For locally advanced disease, patients should be counseled that the long-term benefit (ie, chance for cure) is unknown, and locally advanced disease cases should always be handled in highly specialized centers. Note that for all clinical stages, radiographic findings may appear stable despite dramatic falls in CA 19–9, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Ampullary adenocarcinoma, version 1.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114kf2aN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Ampullary adenocarcinoma — Whipple technique dissection principles: The goals of surgical extirpation of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater focus on the achievement of an R0 resection, as a margin-positive specimen is associated with poor long-term survival, and achievement of a margin-negative dissection must focus on meticulous perivascular dissection, recognition of the need for vascular resection and/or reconstruction, and the potential need for extra-pancreatic organ resection. Medial dissection is best achieved by complete mobilization of the PV and SMV from the uncinate process, and skeletalization of the lateral, posterior, and anterior borders of the SMA down to the level of the adventitia will maximize uncinate yield and radial margin.

### Imaging diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a comprehensive review [^1171zeNP]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a poor prognosis with a dismal 5-year survival rate of 6–7%, most importantly due to delayed clinical presentation at an advanced stage when the tumor invades the surrounding structures or metastasizes. Approximately, 30% of patients with PDAC present with locally advanced cancer and the majority have metastasis either at the time of diagnosis or later during the disease course. Currently, there are no reliable blood markers that can help an early detection of PDAC, and early-stage tumor is usually asymptomatic. Furthermore, PDAC can be missed in abdominal CT examinations performed for other reasons before clinical presentation. Subtle pancreatic abnormalities may be detected on the retrospective review of CT images in these patients. Improvements in imaging modalities and techniques have intensified radiologists' role in the management of PDAC. Multi-detector CT with the availability of thinner slices, multi-planar reformat, and 3D images helps a detailed assessment of the tumor and tumor-vessel relationship. Also, advanced MR imaging and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are often used as problem-solving tools in tumor detection and staging.

Small isoattenuating PDAC, which can only manifest as a main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture, can be easily missed on CT. Uncinate process PDAC is often clinically silent and can be overlooked on imaging particularly at its early stage due to absent biliary or pancreatic ductal dilatation. The grey-zone of tumor resectability is often debated during multidisciplinary tumor boards as the criteria for borderline resectability are variable among different institutions. Therefore, the radiologists should be able to itemize the key findings according to their clinical impact. It is challenging to interpret the imaging appearance of PDAC after neoadjuvant therapy due to difficulties in differentiating necrosis, fibro-inflammation or edema from the residual tumor on imaging.

In this pictorial review, we will discuss several challenges in imaging diagnosis of PDAC in terms of tumor detection, preoperative evaluation, and assessment of response to treatment on imaging. Also, we will describe the imaging features to differentiate PDAC from other benign and malignant conditions that appear similar on imaging.

### Xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis mimicking a malignant solid tumour [^113zpUYq]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Xanthogranulomatous inflammation, which is known to occur in several viscera, is rarely found to affect the pancreas. We report a case of xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis (XGP) occurring in a 60-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and vomiting. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed an ill-defined, heterogeneous mass lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas, suggestive of malignancy. Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed and the final pathological diagnosis was XGP. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. When a pancreatic mass does not show clinicoradiological features typical of common pancreatic neoplasms, XGP should be considered for a differential diagnosis and duodenum preserving surgery can be considered.

### CT protocol review and optimization [^115nXYwb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

To reduce the radiation dose associated with CT scans, much attention is focused on CT protocol review and improvement. In fact, annual protocol reviews will soon be required for ACR CT accreditation. A major challenge in the protocol review process is determining whether a current protocol is optimal and deciding what steps to take to improve it. In this paper, the authors describe methods for pinpointing deficiencies in CT protocols and provide a systematic approach for optimizing them. Emphasis is placed on a team approach, with a team consisting of at least one radiologist, one physicist, and one technologist. This core team completes a critical review of all aspects of a CT protocol and carefully evaluates proposed improvements. Changes to protocols are implemented only with consensus of the core team, with consideration of all aspects of the CT examination, including image quality, radiation dose, patient care and safety, and workflow.

### Detection of small (≤ 2 CM) pancreatic adenocarcinoma and surrounding parenchyma: correlations between enhancement patterns at triphasic MDCT and histologic features [^111QaUfP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

The PDAs ranged in size (maximum diameter on the axial plane) from 1.2 to 2.0 cm (mean, 1.85 cm). PDA was located at the head (n = 17), uncinate process (n = 7), neck (n = 6) and body (n = 8) of the pancreas. Dilatation of main pancreatic duct (diameter ranged from 4 to 14 mm, mean 6.9 mm) was detected in 23 of 38 patients (60.5%).

The results of tumor appearance (hyper-, iso- and hypodense) at qualitative analysis in each CT phase with respect to pancreas upstream (n = 38) and downstream (n = 25) are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
CT attenuation patterns of tumor, pancreas upstream and pancreas downstream to the tumor at qualitative analysis by triphasic CT

PPP: pancreatic parenchymal phase; PVP = portal venous phase; DP = delayed phase. *CT/histologic assessment in 38/38 patients; CT/histologic assessment in 25/38 patients. Number in brackets indicates the percentage.

At qualitative analysis the PDA was isodense to the pancreas upstream to the tumor on PPP in 10/38 (26.3%), on PVP in 12/38 (31.6%) and on DP in 22/38 cases (57.9%). On qualitative triphasic CT analysis, small PDAs were isodense to the pancreas upstream to the tumor in 8 cases (8/38; 21%); on DP were detected 2 PDAs isoattenuating on PPP and PVP. The PDA was hypodense to the pancreas downstream to the tumor in 25/25 (100%) cases on PPP, hypodense and isodense on PVP in 22/25 (88%) and in 3/25 (12%) respectively and hypodense and hyperdense on DP in 14/25 (56%) and in 6/25 cases (24%) respectively.

### Imaging of cranial nerves: a pictorial overview [^116DmQXG]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Key points

Anatomy of cranial nerves is complex and its knowledge is crucial to detect pathological alterations in case of nervous disorders
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard technique in the study of the cranial nerves
Steady-state free procession (SSFP) images are the best sequences for the visualization of the cisternal segments showing dark cranial nerves against a background of bright cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Computed tomography (CT) can be useful to evaluate intraosseous segments of cranial nerves, skull base foramina, and bony traumatic lesions
Cranial nerve dysfunctions may be the result of pathological processes of the cranial nerve itself or may be associated with tumor, inflammation, infectious processes, or traumatic injuries of adjacent structures

### ESR essentials: imaging of sacroiliitis-practice recommendations by ESSR [^1138TvzF]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sacroiliitis is commonly seen in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, in whom timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent irreversible structural damage. Imaging has a prominent place in the diagnostic process and several new imaging techniques have been examined for this purpose. We present a summary of updated evidence-based practice recommendations for imaging of sacroiliitis. MRI remains the imaging modality of choice for patients with suspected sacroiliitis, using at least four sequences: coronal oblique T1-weighted and fluid-sensitive sequences, a perpendicular axial oblique sequence, and a sequence for optimal evaluation of the bone-cartilage interface. Both active inflammatory and structural lesions should be described in the report, indicating location and extent. Radiography and CT, especially low-dose CT, are reasonable alternatives when MRI is unavailable, as patients are often young. This is particularly true to evaluate structural lesions, at which CT excels. Dual-energy CT with virtual non-calcium images can be used to depict bone marrow edema. Knowledge of normal imaging features in children (e.g., flaring, blurring, or irregular appearance of the articular surface) is essential for interpreting sacroiliac joint MRI in children because these normal processes can simulate disease. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Sacroiliitis is a potentially debilitating disease if not diagnosed and treated promptly, before structural damage to the sacroiliac joints occurs. Imaging has a prominent place in the diagnostic process. We present a summary of practice recommendations for imaging of sacroiliitis, including several new imaging techniques. KEY POINTS:
- MRI is the modality of choice for suspected inflammatory sacroiliitis, including a joint-line-specific sequence for optimal evaluation of the bone-cartilage interface to improve detection of erosions.
- Radiography and CT (especially low-dose CT) are reasonable alternatives when MRI is unavailable.
- Knowledge of normal imaging features in children is mandatory for interpretation of MRI of pediatric sacroiliac joints.

### Computed tomography (CT) scans and cancer fact sheet-NCI… [^1142nPgX]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Modern CT machines take continuous pictures in a helical fashion rather than taking a series of pictures of individual slices of the body, as the original CT machines did. Helical CT has several advantages over older CT techniques: it is faster and produces better quality 3-D pictures of areas inside the body, which may improve detection of small abnormalities. CT has many uses in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancer, including
- screening for cancer
- helping diagnose the presence of a tumor
- providing information about the stage of a cancer
- determining exactly where to perform a biopsy procedure
- guiding certain local treatments, such as cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and the implantation of radioactive seeds for brachytherapy
- helping plan external-beam radiation therapy or surgery
- determining whether a cancer is responding to treatment
- detecting recurrence of a tumor.

In addition, CT is widely used to help diagnose circulatory system diseases and conditions, such as coronary artery disease, blood vessel aneurysms, and blood clots; spinal conditions; kidney and bladder stones; abscesses; inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and sinusitis; and injuries to the head, skeletal system, and internal organs. CT imaging is also used to detect trauma, brain bleeds, and abnormal brain function or deposits in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. The estimated effective dose from a PSMA PET procedure is 3 mSv. Combining CT and PET may provide a more complete picture of a tumor's location and growth or spread than either test alone. The combined procedure may improve the ability to diagnose cancer, to determine how far a tumor has spread, to plan treatment, and to monitor response to treatment.

Combined PET/CT may also reduce the number of additional imaging tests and other procedures a patient may need. The effective dose from a whole-body combined PSMA PET/CT procedure can range from 4 to 23 mSv depending on the specifics of the imaging protocol. The radiation exposure from CT is higher than that from standard x-ray procedures, but the increase in cancer risk from one CT scan is still small. The benefits of a CT scan, especially if it is being used to diagnose cancer or another serious condition in someone who has signs or symptoms of disease, greatly outweigh any potential health risks.

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^111hSd8P]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreas

Von Hippel-Lindau disease

As VHL is a multisystemic disease, the pancreas may also be affected among the course of the disease. The pancreatic manifestations are either cysts, serous cystadenomas, or neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Combined lesion pattern, the presentation of solid and cystic manifestations, may be observed in 11.5% of patients with VHL disease and in 7.6% of the cases pancreas may be the only affected organ.

The pancreatic cysts follow the typical imaging characteristics of cysts elsewhere in the body (Fig. 23). Pancreatic NETs are mostly solid but cystic tumors were also reported (Fig. 24). These tumors, be it cystic or solid, generally tend to have early arterial phase-contrast enhancement for detection and correct characterization.

Fig. 23
Two different patients with VHL. a Coronal plane post-contrast CT image of a 47-year-old male patient shows innumerable pancreatic cysts (arrowheads). Also note is made of large-sized solid RCC (arrows) in the left kidney and bilateral renal cysts (asterisks). b Axial plane T2W MR image of a 40-year-old male patient demonstrates multiple cysts of the pancreas, almost completely replacing pancreatic parenchyma (arrows)

Fig. 24
A 21-year-old female patient with recently diagnosed (with genetic testing after a recent diagnosis of her elder sister) VHL underwent a baseline CT exam. Axial plane post-contrast pancreatic phase CT image shows a predominantly cystic lesion in the uncinate process (arrows) with enhancing mildly thickened internal septation (arrowhead). The lesion was found to be highly suspicious of a cystic NET. Surgical removal and histopathological examination confirmed the presence of cystic NET

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I

MEN 1 is an inherited endocrine tumor syndrome in autosomal dominant fashion. The pituitary gland, islet cells of the pancreas, and parathyroid glands are the most common tumor sites. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the disease.

Most pancreatic NETs in MEN 1 are functional with the gastrinoma being the most common. The pancreatic NETs seen in MEN 1 follow the typical imaging characteristics of spontaneous NETs. Rarely, the tumors can be cystic (Fig. 25).

Axial plane post-contrast pancreatic phase CT image shows a predominantly cystic lesion in the pancreatic body (arrows). Focal contrast-enhancing mural wall thickening can also be seen (arrowhead). Histopathological findings revealed cystic NET

### Imaging diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a comprehensive review [^115Wqqv8]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncinate process PDAC, compared to PDAC in other locations, is more frequently associated with vascular invasion, namely SMA, SMV, and MPV encasement (Fig. 3). Furthermore, a higher incidence of extrapancreatic perineural invasion has been reported. Duodenal invasion is also more common with a reported rate of 68% compared to 41% in other head PDAC. As a result, a duodenal obstruction may develop in up to 9% of patients with uncinate process PDAC. At CT and MRI, duodenal invasion is identified as a contiguous tumor extension within the duodenal wall and focal interruption of the normal mural enhancement of the duodenum (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
A 63-year-old man with uncinate process PDAC causing a duodenal obstruction. Axial pancreatic phase CT images (a and b) show a hypoattenuating mass (asterisk) arising from the uncinate process, infiltrating the third part of the duodenum (D) and abutting the anterior wall of the aorta. CBD (arrow) is normal in caliber. The pancreas (P) has no ductal dilatation or atrophy. Axial portal venous phase CT image (c) obtained 1 month later shows a marked distension of the stomach (S) due to duodenal obstruction and there is a new hypoattenuating metastatic liver lesion (arrow)

Early-stage uncinate process PDAC can be easily missed on imaging because of the subtlety of the tumor and absence of secondary signs of ductal dilatation (Fig. 5). Tamada et al. reported a 14% incidence of PDAC without secondary signs on preoperative CT of which 50% were located in the uncinate process.

### 68 Ga-exendin-4 PET / CT enables identification of multiple and ectopic insulinoma in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 [^117748VP]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A 53-year-old woman with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was diagnosed with multiple insulinomas as determined by contrast-enhanced CT. Genetic test confirmed the presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). 68Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT revealed multiple lesions with intense uptake in the tail and uncinate process of the pancreas, with an additional lesion in the gastric wall on the lesser curvature. These lesions were subsequently confirmed to be insulinomas by histopathologic examination after surgery. This case illustrates the benefits of 68Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT in detecting multiple and ectopic insulinomas in patients with a MEN1 background.

### Application of spectral CT combined with perfusion scan in diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^114FVQ6b]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Clinical characteristics

Thirty-six patients who underwent spectral CT combined with perfusion scanning and were histopathologically confirmed as pNETs were included, including 15 males and 21 females, with an age range of 20 to 71 years, and a median age of 52 years. 22 patients were excluded, including 16 patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, 3 patients were cystadenoma, 1 patient was solid pseudopapillary and 2 patients were pancreatitis. There were 52 pathologically confirmed lesions, including 16 in the head of the pancreas, 4 in the neck, 17 in the body and 15 in the tail. Among the 30 retrospective patients, 14 were males and 16 were females, with an age range of 20 to 81 years, and a median age of 53.5 years. The number of tumors that were pathologically confirmed lesions was 37, 12 lesions were in the head of the pancreas, 4 in the neck, 8 in the body and 13 in the tail. The average longest diameter of the tumors was 15.54 ± 1.36 mm, and the longest diameter of one lesion was 47 mm.

Detection rate of spectral CT combined with perfusion scanning

Most of pNETs lesions were characterized by rich blood supply, but some were not obviously enhanced and lack specificity. Some lesions were poorly visualized on conventional perfusion scans but were clearly visualized on energy spectrum (Fig. 1). The detection rate of combined perfusion and spectral scan at the optimal keV in the arterial phase of the energy spectrum was 96.6%, and that in the venous phase was 84.6%, the detection rate of spectral CT combined with perfusion was 83.1%–96.2%, and the detection rate of conventional pancreatic perfusion was 82.8%, the former was higher than the latter (p < 0.05). The arterial phase energy CT combined with perfusion scanning is more conducive to the detection of lesions (Table 2).

### Imaging diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a comprehensive review [^111jsUm2]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

EUS is of particular importance in patients with high clinical suspicion of PDAC without a detectable mass on CT, especially for small (≤ 2 cm) tumors. The reported sensitivity and specificity were 87% and 98%, respectively. PDAC appears as a hypoechoic lesion relative to the normal pancreatic tissue. In the absence of discrete mass, EUS has the advantage of obtaining a tissue biopsy targeted towards the area of focal pancreatic or common bile duct stricture.

The role of FDG-PET in early detection of PDAC remains controversial. High detection rates have been reported with a sensitivity of 81–100% for small (≤ 2 cm) PDAC. A large retrospective study, however, demonstrated a decline of the FDG-PET sensitivity to 50% for small tumors implying its low diagnostic yield in early-stage PDAC.

Uncinate process PDAC

The uncinate process is a tongue-like extension from the inferior aspect of the pancreatic head that extends posteriorly behind the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and artery (SMA). The incidence of uncinate process PDAC ranges from 2.5% to 10.7% of all PDAC. Uncinate process is relatively distant from the pancreatic and common bile ducts, while it is closer to the SMA, SMV, and main portal vein (MPV) compared with the remaining pancreas. Owing to these particular anatomic features, uncinate process PDACs often have clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics dissimilar to other PDAC in the pancreatic head. Abdominal pain, rather than jaundice, is the most frequent presenting symptom in uncinate process PDAC, often leading to a late clinical presentation and diagnosis.

### Imaging to determine… [^112kiXpe]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Imaging to Determine Malignancy Most incidentally detected adrenal masses greater than 1 cm are characterized as benign, lipid-rich adenomas using the unenhanced phase of adrenal protocol CT. Fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography can be used for lesions that cannot be categorized by CT or MRI. If the lesion still cannot be characterized, biopsy or surgical removal may be indicated. The tracer m-iodobenzylguanidine localizes to adrenergic nerve endings, and studies using MIBG are useful in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma. CT The Hounsfield unit scale is a semiquantitative method of measuring radiography attenuation. Organs and tissues demonstrate variable attenuation depending on their density. Fat- and lipid-containing lesions have lower densities than the spleen, normal adrenal gland, or parenchyma of the liver. If an adrenal mass measures 10 HU or less on unenhanced CT, it is probably a lipid-rich adenoma.

14 The mean Hounsfield unit for adrenal carcinoma, metastasis, and pheochromocytoma is significantly higher. 20 A threshold value of 10 HU has a 71 percent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity for identifying adenomas and is generally accepted as a cutoff for diagnosis of lipid-rich adenomas. 21, 22. In contrast, nonadenomas do not show signal loss on out-of-phase imaging. 23, 24 Recent studies have shown that 60 to 89 percent of lesions measuring between 10 and 30 HU on unenhanced CT can be characterized using chemical shift MRI. 23, 25. FDG-PET Evaluation using FDG-PET has a high sensitivity for detecting malignancy 26; however, adenomas can also occasionally take up the radiotracer, decreasing the test's specificity. Therefore, FDG-PET is used to determine the need for biopsy in masses that cannot be characterized on CT or MRI.

6 For lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm that are characterized as adenomas, follow-up unenhanced CT at 12 months can be performed to ensure that there has not been significant growth. Tumors that have grown should be further investigated, and adrenal biopsy or resection should be considered, although even growing adrenal lesions are usually not malignant. 13 If the size of the mass is stable, no further imaging is required, although serial biochemical evaluation may be needed. 35.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^11656gdy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography for rhinosinusitis — protocol, contrast use, and radiation are outlined as follows: Modern CT examinations are obtained with 3-mm coronal slices, and modern scanners typically obtain thin (< 1 mm) axial slices that are reformatted in the coronal plane, with thin-section (ie, 1 mm) axial CT images used for computer applications. Technical advances have lowered exposure, with radiation doses of 0.13 mSv reported from screening sinus CT scans, which is significantly lower than a conventional head CT (2 mSv). There is a limited role for contrast-enhanced sinus CT imaging; the vast majority of cases of inflammatory sinus disease should be imaged without intravenous contrast. For inflammatory sinus disease complications, MRI with contrast is preferred over contrast-enhanced sinus CT, and most sinus tumors ultimately should be evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRI; if MRI cannot be obtained, pre- and postcontrast sinus CT studies could be considered.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) — Technical considerations and venous involvement findings note that division of the retroperitoneal tissues between the uncinate process and SMA with a stapler or a clamp and cut technique may leave up to 43% of the soft tissue in situ and increase the risk of an R1 resection. Liberal use of partial or complete vein resection when vein infiltration is suspected has been studied; on evaluation of excised vein specimens, only 60% to 70% had histologic evidence of frank tumor involvement, and R0 resections were still not obtainable in 10% to 30% of patients. If an R0 resection is obtained with vein excision, longevity appears similar to those with R0 resections without venous involvement, with no significant increase in morbidity and mortality, and these data support an aggressive approach to partial or complete vein excision if tumor infiltration is suspected.

### Current knowledge on the sensitivity of the (68) Ga-somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography and the SUVmax reference range for management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours [^116kJACY]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Physiologically increased pancreatic uptake at the head/uncinate process is observed in more than one-third of patients after injection of one of the three (68)Ga-labelled octreotide-based peptides used for somatostatin (sst) receptor (r) imaging. There are minor differences between these (68)Ga-sstr-binding peptides in the imaging setting. On (68)Ga-sstr-imaging the physiological uptake can be diffuse or focal and usually remains stable over time. Differences in the maximal standardised uptake values (SUVmax) reported for the normal pancreas as well as for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PNET) lesions may be related to several factors, including (a) differences in the peptide binding affinities as well as differences in sstr subtype expression of pancreatic α- and β-cells, and heterogeneity / density of tumour cells, (b) differences in scanner resolution, image reconstruction techniques and acquisition protocols, (c) mostly retrospective study designs, (d) mixed patient populations, or (e) interference with medications such as treatment with long-acting sst analogues. The major limitation in most of the studies lies in the lack of histopathological confirmation of abnormal findings. There is a significant overlap between the calculated SUVmax-values for physiological pancreas and PNET-lesions of the head/uncinate process that do not favour the use of quantitative parameters in the clinical setting. Anecdotal long-term follow-up studies have even indicated that increased uptake in the head/uncinate process still can turn out to be malignant over years of follow up. SUVmax-data for the pancreatic body and tail are limited. Therefore, any visible focal tracer uptake in the pancreas must be considered as suspicious for malignancy irrespective of quantitative parameters. In general, sstr-PET/CT has significant implications for the management of NET patients leading to a change in treatment decision in about one-third of patients. Therefore, follow-up with (68)Ga-sstr-PET/CT is mandatory in the clinical setting if uptake in the head/uncinate process is observed.

### Abstract… [^111UkMFF]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION Many incidental renal masses are discovered on abdominal ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound criteria for the diagnosis of a simple renal cyst include the following: spherical or ovoid shape; absence of internal echoes; presence of a thin, smooth wall that is separate from the surrounding parenchyma; and enhancement of the posterior wall, indicating ultrasound transmission through the water-filled cyst. When visualization is inadequate on ultrasound scanning or when the ultrasound examination shows evidence of calcifications, septa or multiple cysts that may obscure a potential malignancy, renal CT scanning with contrast medium should be performed. Symptomatic patients should also be evaluated with renal contrast CT scanning. CT AND MRI Incidental renal masses may also be detected on the standard abdominal CT scan.

The current "gold standard" for evaluating renal masses requires capturing CT images before and after contrast medium is administered. The density of a renal mass is reported in Hounsfield units. In one study, CT scanning had a sensitivity of 94 percent for the detection of renal parenchymal masses, but magnetic resonance imaging was statistically superior to CT scanning in the correct characterization of benign lesions. 5 Thus, MRI may be helpful for further evaluation of an equivocal lesion before an invasive procedure is performed. T 2-weighted turbo-spin echo images are especially helpful in providing additional characterization of a lesion. 9; hence, surgical exploration of these lesions is warranted in otherwise healthy patients. Class IV cystic lesions and solid renal masses that enhance with contrast medium are presumed to be malignant.

The CT criteria for a renal mass to be called a Bosniak class I cyst include the following: uniform density of no greater than 20 H (assigned density of water is 0 H, with a range of−20 to +20 H. Incidental Adrenal Masses Incidental adrenal masses are also being discovered more frequently on CT scanning and ultrasound examinations. Most adrenal masses are detected first on abdominal CT scans, with an incidence of 0. 6 to

1. 3 percent on such scans. 11 The vast majority of asymptomatic adrenal masses are benign, and patients with these lesions do not require subspecialist referral or treatment. 12 The differential diagnosis of incidental adrenal masses, summarized from studies in the literature, is provided in Table 4. 13.

### Elucidating early CT after pancreatico-duodenectomy: a primer for radiologists [^1165kS2k]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Basics of pancreatico-duodenectomy

Most PDs are performed to manage resectable pancreatic ductal carcinoma, neuroendocrine and malignant intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms, cancers of the distal common bile duct (CBD), Vaterian ampulla and duodenum. Other indications include symptomatic chronic pancreatitis refractory to medical treatment and selected benign tumours not amenable to conservative surgery. The use of laparoscopy and robotic techniques is still limited in oncological pancreatic surgery.

The classic (Whipple's) PD (shown in Fig. 1 a) involves several steps, namely: (1) exposure of the superior mesenteric vessels and intraoperative assessment of resectability; (2) cholecystectomy; (3) transection of the distal stomach, proximal jejunum near to the ligament of Treitz and pancreatic neck; (4) regional lymph node dissection; (5) en-bloc removal of the pancreatic head, neck and uncinate process along with the duodenum and choledochus. Compared to the above-described operation, the Traverso-Longmire pylorus-preserving technique (Fig. 1 b) spares the gastric antrum.

Image analysis and quantification for [68Ga]SSAs — Intense accumulation of radioactivity is seen in the spleen (and accessory splenic tissue if present), kidneys, and adrenal, salivary, and pituitary glands; accumulation in the liver is generally less intense than that in the spleen and the thyroid is faintly visible. Variable tracer uptake is frequently observed in the pancreas, particularly the uncinate process, and the prostate gland and breast glandular tissue may show diffuse, low-grade uptake of [68Ga]DOTA-SSAs. The Krenning scale is not validated for [68Ga]SSTA PET/CT; the standardised uptake value (SUV) is an easy-to-measure and useful parameter for tumour characterisation if images are acquired and processed in a standardised manner, the PET/CT system should be calibrated for the half-life of 68Ga, and SUVs in organs differ between various [68Ga]SSTa.

Results

The operative duration was 180 min, with an estimated blood loss of 40 mL. The patient experienced a biochemical leak (grade A according to ISGPS criteria) postoperatively, with a daily drainage output of approximately 20 mL. The drainage volume progressively decreased, allowing drain removal on postoperative day 10, which was followed by uneventful discharge.

During the follow-up period, no complications (i.e. steatorrhea, secondary diabetes mellitus, dyspepsia, or hepatic steatosis) were observed. A contrast-enhanced CT of the entire abdomen demonstrated normal postoperative anatomy without evidence of recurrence or fluid collections. Histopathologic examination with immunohistochemical profiling confirmed the diagnosis of IPMN exhibiting mild epithelial dysplasia.

The condition is referred to as silent sinus syndrome

The anatomy of the frontal sinus is largely conditioned by the degree of pneumatization of surrounding air cells (mostly agger nasi cells) and by the cranial attachment of the uncinate process. Some configurations (i.e. supraorbital ethmoid air cell and deep olfactory fossa) significantly influence the complexity of the procedure and may increase the relative risk of complications.

Incidental findings, normal variants, and important pitfalls in SSTR PET note that increased uptake on SSTR-PET does not make the diagnosis of a NET, and care should be taken in interpretation. Physiologically increased uptake in the head/uncinate process of the pancreas is observed in a large portion of patients (diffuse or focal) and usually remains stable over time, and this physiologic uptake in the head/uncinate process of the pancreas is thought to be caused by a higher concentration of pancreatic polypeptide producing cells in this region.

### 68Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in neuroendocrine tumour and healthy tissue: differentiation of physiological uptake and pathological processes in PET / CT [^115Fq57S]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We wanted to establish the range of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in liver and bone metastases of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and to establish the range of its uptake in pancreatic NET. This would allow differentiation between physiological uptake and tumour-related somatostatin receptor expression in the pancreas (including the uncinate process), liver and bone. Finally, we wanted to test for differences in patients with NET, either treated or not treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

Methods

In 249 patients, 390 (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT studies were performed. The clinical indications for PET/CT were gastroenteropancreatic NET (194 studies), nongastroenteropancreatic NET (origin in the lung and rectum; 46 studies), NET of unknown primary (111 studies), phaeochromocytoma/glomus tumours (18 studies), and radioiodine-negative metastatic thyroid carcinoma (21 studies).

Results

SUVmax (mean ± standard deviation) values of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC were 29.8 ± 16.5 in 162 liver metastases, 19.8 ± 18.8 in 89 bone metastases and 34.6 ± 17.1 in 43 pancreatic NET (33.6 ± 14.3 in 30 tumours of the uncinate process and 36.3 ± 21.5 in 13 tumours of the pancreatic tail). A significant difference in SUVmax (p < 0.02) was found in liver metastases of NET patients treated with PRRT. There were significant differences in SUVmax between nonmalignant and malignant tissue for both bone and liver metastases and for pancreatic NET including the uncinate process (p < 0.0001). At a cut-off value of 17.1 the specificity and sensitivity of SUVmax for differentiating tumours in the uncinate process were 93.6% and 90.0%, respectively (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

(68)Ga-DOTA-TOC is an excellent tracer for the imaging of tumours expressing somatostatin receptors on the tumour cell surface, facilitating the detection of even small tumour lesions. The noninvasive PET/CT approach by measurement of regional SUVmax can offer important clinical information to distinguish between physiological and pathological somatostatin receptor expression, especially in the uncinate process. PRRT does not significantly influence SUVmax, except in liver metastases of patients with NET.

### EDGE procedure to allow EUS / FNB of an uncinate process pancreatic mass in a patient with gastric-bypass anatomy using a 20-mm lumen-apposing metal stent [^1131iMex]. VideoGIE (2018). Low credibility.

EUS is the standard for sampling pancreatic tumors. However, in a patient with gastric-bypass anatomy, pancreatic tumors at the head of the pancreas cannot be sampled by EUS in the traditional manner. EUS-directed transgastric ERCP (EDGE) is a procedure originally described to access the excluded stomach so as to perform ERCP in gastric-bypass anatomy. We report a modification of the EDGE procedure to sample and stage a pancreatic mass at the uncinate process in a patient with gastric-bypass anatomy.

A 57-year-old man with a history of gastric-bypass surgery presented with a 3-week history of upper-abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed a pancreatic mass at the uncinate process without distant metastases (Fig. 1). The study was limited by an inability to inject intravenous contrast material because of chronic renal insufficiency. We discussed with the patient different methods to obtain a biopsy specimen, including CT-guided biopsy, surgical laparotomy, and endoscopic sampling (EUS-directed gastrostomy with EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy [FNB]). The patient elected to proceed with the endoscopic method (Video 1, available online at).

Figure 1
Abdominal CT without contrast material showing the pancreatic mass.

A linear echo endoscope was advanced to the gastric pouch. The excluded stomach was located. A 19-gauge needle was advanced to the lumen of the excluded stomach. Contrast material was infused to fill and distend the excluded stomach (Fig. 2). A lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) with a 2-cm diameter and electrocautery tip was advanced to the excluded stomach under EUS guidance and was deployed, connecting the gastric pouch to the excluded stomach. The stent was then dilated by use of a controlled radial expansion balloon up to 2 cm (Fig. 3). After that, in the same session, the echoendoscope was advanced carefully through the stent lumen to the excluded stomach and all the way to the second part of the duodenum. A hypoechoic mass measuring 3 cm was seen at the uncinate process abutting the superior mesenteric artery and invading into the duodenal wall (Fig. 4). Biopsy of the mass was performed with a 25-gauge core needle. An onsite pathologist confirmed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The echoendoscope was carefully withdrawn, leaving the LAMS in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well without adverse events and was referred to an oncologist. Our plan is to remove the LAMS after 4 weeks.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112L83Qm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple technique) — margin-negative goals and vascular management focus on achievement of an R0 resection, as a margin-positive specimen is associated with poor long-term survival, and require meticulous perivascular dissection with recognition of potential vascular resection/reconstruction and extra-pancreatic organ resection. Medial dissection is best achieved by complete mobilization of the portal vein (PV) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) from the uncinate process, assuming no tumor infiltration, and skeletization of the lateral, posterior, and anterior borders of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) down to the adventitia to maximize uncinate yield and radial margin. In the absence of frank venous occlusion on preoperative imaging, the need for lateral venorrhaphy or complete portal or SMV resection and reconstruction to achieve an R0 resection may be suggested but is often not known until division of the pancreatic neck; tethering to the PV is not uncommon, differentiation of invasion from desmoplasia is frequently impossible, and data support an aggressive approach to partial or complete vein excision if tumor infiltration is suspected. While further data for arterial resection are needed, judicious utilization would appear to be reasonable in very select populations.

### Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction [^111LRNYs]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial morbidity associated with PD for benign disease, we implemented a novel laparoscopic approach involving pancreatic neck transection, uncinate process IPMN enucleation, and pancreatic reconstruction. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) facilitated a 5-Fr pancreatic duct stent placement. Intraoperatively, laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck enabled optimal exposure and complete enucleation of the uncinate process lesion, followed by meticulous main pancreatic duct reconstruction and parenchymal restoration. Both the intraoperative frozen section and final pathology confirmed the diagnosis. Classified as a biochemical leak according to International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) criteria, the postoperative course was managed successfully using drainage, with no complications such as hemorrhage, intra-abdominal infection, pancreatitis, delayed gastric emptying, or endocrine/exocrine dysfunction. This case validated the feasibility of this parenchyma-sparing strategy for benign or low-grade malignant uncinate process lesions.

### Normal uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC by the pancreas uncinate process mimicking malignancy at somatostatin receptor PET [^112JqoKz]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize a commonly occurring increased uptake by the uncinate process of the pancreas at PET/CT using 68Ga-DOTA-d-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (68Ga-DOTA-TOC). This tracer has replaced In pentetreotide (OctreoScan®) for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy at our laboratory.

Methods

Fifty of our first 74 PET/CT examinations with 68Ga-DOTA-TOC could be evaluated in retrospect. None of these patients had surgery or showed any pathology in the pancreas head at the concomitant CT.

Results

Thirty-five of the 50 examinations (70%) showed an uptake by the uncinate process sufficiently intense to be interpreted as pathologic and simulating a tumor. Mean SUVmax was 9.2. Mean SUVmean using an isoactivity cut-off of > 75% and > 50% was 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. Volume calculations of the uncinate process activity using these definitions gave 0.9 mL and 4.2 mL, respectively.

Conclusion

There is a frequent physiological uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC by the pancreas uncinate process. This may be caused by an accumulation of pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells expressing somatostatin receptors. If there is a normal finding at concomitant diagnostic CT, this uptake should be regarded as physiological.

EUS-directed gastrostomy with EUS/FNB is a feasible and safe method to sample and stage a mass at the head of the pancreas in a patient with gastric-bypass anatomy. This procedure was valuable in this patient, who could not have undergone imaging with intravenous contrast material because of chronic renal insufficiency. The alternative methods are CT-guided biopsy and surgical laparotomy with frozen section. CT-guided biopsy is technically challenging if a mass is at the uncinate process. In addition, it carries a theoretic risk of seeding the needle track with malignant cells. Surgical laparotomy is a more invasive method. In this case, with the tumor abutting the superior mesenteric artery, the surgical method would not have provided a cure. We elected to proceed with EUS/FNB immediately after deploying and dilating the LAMS to prevent delaying the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's pancreatic malignancy. In order to minimize the risk of stent dislodgement, we used a 2-cm diameter LAMS. The echoendoscope was advanced slowly and carefully through the LAMS under fluoroscopic guidance.

In conclusion, EUS-directed gastrostomy with EUS/FNB is a feasible and safe technique for sampling and staging a pancreatic tumor at the head of the pancreas in gastric-bypass anatomy in the absence of known distal metastases.

### Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction [^114cJ4sV]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction represents a novel surgical approach for managing pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. This technique may provide a new therapeutic option for patients with benign or low-grade malignant tumors in the pancreatic uncinate process. This study aimed to assess this procedure's short- and long-term clinical outcomes and delineate its technical operative details.

Methods

For a 42-year-old man, branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) was diagnosed. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular cystic lesion in the cephalad portion of the pancreatic uncinate process, with no enhancement on post-contrast imaging. Abdominal MRI demonstrated the irregular cystic lesion (38 × 18 mm), showing suspected communication with the pancreatic duct. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a multicystic lesion in the pancreatic uncinate process measuring up to 40 mm in maximum diameter, with heterogeneous wall thickness and well-defined margins. The patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of IPMN in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction.

Results

The patient experienced a biochemical leak postoperatively, with a daily drainage volume of approximately 20 mL. The drainage volume gradually decreased, and the drain was removed on postoperative day 10, followed by hospital discharge. At this writing, follow-up evaluations have shown no complications such as steatorrhea, secondary diabetes, or dyspepsia. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the entire abdomen showed no abnormalities. Morphologic and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of IPMN with mild epithelial dysplasia.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of IPMN in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction represents a safe and effective surgical approach for managing pancreatic uncinate process IPMN.

### Tumor reduction in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer lesions with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine: an exploratory analysis from a phase 3 study [^1137pyUs]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study design of the MPACT trial has been described previously. Key details are described as follows.

Patients

Adults with KPS 70 or greater and histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma measurable by RECIST version 1.0 were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic disease or prior adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, including gemcitabine.

Study Design and Treatment

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous nab -paclitaxel 125 mg/m² followed by intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43 or intravenous gemcitabine monotherapy 1000 mg/m² weekly for 7 of 8 weeks. Subsequent cycles for each regimen consisted of treatment on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Randomization was stratified by geographic region, performance status, and presence of liver metastases. Patients were treated until disease progression.

Assessments

Spiral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed every 8 weeks. Lesion size and ORR were evaluated by 2 independent radiological reviewers and an adjudicator according to RECIST version 1.0. Carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels were evaluated at baseline and every 8 weeks. The sums of the longest diameters (SLDs) for the primary pancreatic and metastatic lesions were calculated to assess changes in tumor burden relative to baseline. Baseline lesion frequency included target and nontarget lesions. Tumor shrinkage measurements were based on SLDs of target lesions. Primary pancreatic lesions referred to lesions found in the head, neck, body, uncinate process, and/or tail of the pancreas, including peripancreatic lymph nodes, both target and nontarget. Target lesions were measurable by RECIST, whereas nontarget lesions were those that were noted but for which measurements were not obtained. Patients with scans of measurable lesions at baseline and 1 or greater postbaseline time point using the same modality (CT or MRI) were included in the analysis.

### Task-based assessment of neck CT protocols using patient-mimicking phantoms-effects of protocol parameters on dose and diagnostic performance [^111jNEKZ]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Computed tomography (CT) acquisition protocols should provide diagnostic image quality at the lowest possible dose in line with the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable). Protocol settings used in clinical routine determine diagnostic reliability and dose exposure of patients. On a larger scale, they affect the overall radiation burden to the population from CT examinations. Previous work has shown that CT acquisition protocols and related dose exposure vary substantially across facilities. Protocol optimization thus offers significant potential for improving patient safety.

Prior efforts to optimize protocols harmonized dose exposure across CT facilities through protocol revision by expert panels and best practice sharing. Such programs were shown to be valuable in reducing dose and identifying dose outliers. However, they were not intended to assess diagnostic image quality, which means that they could neither exclude unacceptable image quality nor identify optimal protocols that strike the best balance between dose and image quality. Protocol optimization for such purposes can be defined in terms of determining how to better use a system's imaging capabilities for obtaining adequate diagnostic information at the lowest possible dose.

Today, CT protocols routinely involve technologies that reduce dose, but also have complex effects on image properties. Especially the use of iterative reconstruction algorithms is associated with complex interactions between noise, texture, contrast, and spatial resolution, which are not adequately assessed with traditional metrics such as contrast-to-noise ratios. In light of this situation, methods are of interest that reliably predict clinical image performance and allow comparison of protocols independently of the CT techniques involved. The recent report of the AAPM task group 233 on CT performance evaluation has highlighted the role of task-based methods for such purposes.

Task-based methods assess image quality by testing how well CT images enable an observer to perform detection tasks that are similar to clinical diagnostic tasks of radiologists. The simplest of such tasks is the detection of a signal (e.g. a low-contrast lesion) against a uniform phantom background. However, patients are not uniform, and the complexity of background texture affects image properties and detection outcomes. A further development towards assessing CT protocols more realistically would therefore involve quantitative assessment of detection outcomes in anatomically more realistic phantoms.

Cases

Case 1

A 90-year-old man with a medical history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation presented with recurrent, highly symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes. Labs were significant for elevated C-peptide (6.3 ng/mL) and insulin (28 mlU/L) levels. A CT scan revealed a 1.8- × 1.0-cm pancreatic tail lesion. EUS with biopsy of the lesion revealed a well-differentiated pNET with Ki67 < 1%. The patient declined surgical management. EUS-RFA was performed at 20 W with 6 applications of energy to achieve complete visual ablation of the lesion by endosonographic appearance.

Case 2

A 46-year-old woman with a history of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by spontaneous pneumothorax and portal vein thrombosis presented with recurrent, symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes for 3 years. Laboratory results were significant for elevated fasting C-peptide (4.3 ng/mL) and insulin (39.1 mlU/L) levels. A CT scan revealed a 9- × 8-mm mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas. EUS with biopsy of the lesion revealed a well-differentiated pNET with Ki67 1%. She declined surgical management. Because of the location of the mass deep in the uncinate process, it was noted to be mildly challenging to introduce the 19-gauge trocar. She underwent EUS-RFA with 10 applications of energy at 20 W to achieve complete visual ablation of the lesion by endosonographic appearance.

Case report

A 68-year-old man with a history of diverticulosis presented to the emergency department with left lower-quadrant abdominal pain. An emergency CT scan revealed an infiltrative mass in the pancreatic head (3.4 × 2.4 cm). Infiltration of the fat around the celiac axis with mild luminal narrowing was also described (Fig. 1). The findings were suggestive of dissection or tumor encasement.

Angio-CT at the referring hospital described a pancreatic head tumor that seemed to encase the celiac axis and the common hepatic artery. The patient was then referred to our tertiary cancer center for further evaluation of the pancreatic head mass.

EUS showed a cystic/solid mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (Fig. 2; Video 1, available online at). The main pancreatic duct was not dilated. EUS-guided FNA was performed. Remote from the tumor, the celiac axis/proximal common hepatic artery appeared to have a thrombus with an approximately 50% reduction in flow (Fig. 3 A and B).

### Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction [^113LEkV1]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

The authors assume full responsibility for all aspects of this study and confirm adherence to recognized ethical standards. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

A 42-year-old man was incidentally found to have a cystic lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas during a routine physical examination. The asymptomatic lesion demonstrated interval growth on surveillance imaging, prompting surgical intervention. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular cystic lesion in the cephalad portion of the pancreatic uncinate process, with no enhancement on post-contrast imaging. Abdominal MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated the irregular cystic lesion (38 × 18 mm), showing suspected communication with the pancreatic duct. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a multicystic lesion in the pancreatic uncinate process measuring up to 40 mm in maximum diameter, with heterogeneous wall thickness and well-defined margins. However, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was not performed.

After preoperative ERCP with the placement of a main pancreatic duct stent, the patient underwent laparoscopic pancreatic neck transection with uncinate process IPMN enucleation and pancreatic reconstruction under general anesthesia on 17 August 2024. The pneumoperitoneum was established using a five-port configuration. Systematic exploration of the abdominal and pelvic cavities showed no abnormalities. The gastrocolic ligament was divided for entrance to the omental bursa.

After exposure of the pancreatic body, meticulous dissection along the inferior pancreatic border identified the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). A retro-pancreatic tunnel was created posterior to the pancreatic neck. The pancreatic neck was divided anterior to the SMV using ultrasonic shears, with scissors transection of the main pancreatic duct. The pre-placed ductal stent was preserved. The pancreatic head was mobilized to expose the uncinate process. Ultrasonic shears dissection and sharp scissor techniques achieved complete enucleation of the multilocular cystic tumor. Intraoperative exploration confirmed communication with the main pancreatic duct. The defect created in the main pancreatic duct after transection of the multilocular cystic tumor at its junction was primarily repaired with interrupted 4–0 polydioxanone sutures (PDS).

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116zG9Cu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — principles of surgical technique emphasize that careful intraoperative staging should rule out peritoneal, liver, and distant lymph node metastases, and resection of the primary tumor should only be done in the absence of distant disease; a pancreatic protocol CT is critical for preoperative planning. Consider frozen section analysis of the pancreatic neck and bile duct and assess approximately 5 mm from the transection margin; if tumor is within 5 mm of margins, consider further excision to ensure at least 5 mm of clearance. Procedure selection is based on tumor location, with pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for head and uncinate lesions and distal pancreatectomy with en-bloc splenectomy for body and tail lesions. Surgery should be done expeditiously and efficiently, optimizing quality of life and cost, and the surgical procedure is based on the location of the primary tumor and relationship to blood vessels.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs on multiphasic multidetector CT: association with clinical and histopathologic features [^112ZuRk2]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the clinical, histopathologic and imaging features of pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs on dynamic CT.

Materials and Methods

Seventy patients (mean age 70 years) with histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent preoperative contrast material-enhanced multiphasic multidetector CT before pancreatic resection. In each patient, clinical data including carbohydrate antigen 19–9, frequency of isoattenuating tumours, and presence of secondary signs and histopathologic findings such as tumour location, tumour stage, and microscopic infiltrative growth grade were evaluated.

Results

Ten tumours (14%) were without secondary signs, and 60 (86%) were with secondary signs. Tumours without and with secondary signs were located in the uncinate process in 5 (50%) and 3 (5%), head in 3 (30%) and 29 (48%), body in 2 (20%) and 22 (37%), and tail in 0 (0%) and 6 (10%), respectively (p = .001). The frequency of isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs was significantly higher than those with secondary signs (p = 0.034). The tumour stage of pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs was earlier than that in tumours with secondary signs (p = 0.041).

Conclusions

Pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs is characterized by the presence of uncinate and isoattenuating tumours and earlier tumour stage compared to tumours with secondary signs.

Key Points

Frequency of pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs on multiphasic CT is 14. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs are common in the uncinate process. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs are common in isoattenuating tumours. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas without secondary signs are characterized by earlier-stage tumours.

### Imaging diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a comprehensive review [^1163Z5R4]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has continued to have a poor prognosis for the last few decades in spite of recent advances in different imaging modalities mainly due to difficulty in early diagnosis and aggressive biological behavior. Early PDAC can be missed on CT due to similar attenuation relative to the normal pancreas, small size, or hidden location in the uncinate process. Tumor resectability and its contingency on the vascular invasion most commonly assessed with multi-phasic thin-slice CT is a continuously changing concept, particularly in the era of frequent neoadjuvant therapy. Coexistent celiac artery stenosis may affect the surgical plan in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this review, we discuss the challenges related to the imaging of PDAC. These include radiological and clinical subtleties of the tumor, evolving imaging criteria for tumor resectability, preoperative diagnosis of accompanying celiac artery stenosis, and post-neoadjuvant therapy imaging. For each category, the key imaging features and potential pitfalls on cross-sectional imaging will be discussed. Also, we will describe the imaging discriminators of potential mimickers of PDAC.

Fig. 3
Patient with "false positive" 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake. a 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET of patient S.J. before surgery in 2004. The images clearly indicate significant accumulation in the pancreatic head/uncinate. b 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC PET (MIP) of patient S.J. after surgery in 2005, 2008, 2011. The images indicate stable accumulation in the follow-up period. Despite the significant accumulation in the pancreatic head/uncinate process, surgical exploration gave a benign histology and further follow-up studies with either PET or CT did not confirm a malignant finding. Therefore, this finding was considered a "FP" PET-result in the follow-up for the publication in 2007. The patient had further follow-up PET/CT scans performed in 2008 and 2011 that were both positive again for the same location. The SUV max calculated for the uncinate process was 26.9 in 2008 and 26.5 in 2011, showing that the SUV max remained stable over time, though the tumour markers chromogranin A (CGA) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) remained elevated in 2011. This patient is still alive in 12/2015 and in good clinical condition

One of the first papers on SUV max -calculation indicated that individual sstr-mediated tumour uptake shows a large range of variation. In this retrospective study the SUV max -values for tumours were ranging between 6.4 and 267, but not all tumours of this study were NETs. The study was aimed at evaluating if calculation would predict a response to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). In seven patients, malignant lesions of the pancreas were used for assessment of treatment response. These seven patients showed high SUV max -values upon the initial visit (mean 43.6; range 20.5–94). Although the reference standard (clinical follow-up by CT or MRI) indicated progressive disease (PD) in four patients and stable disease (SD) in three patients, a significant decline of overall SUV max -values was observed with regard to the pancreatic lesion (mean 28.9; range 18–28.9) after finalisation of PRRT. It is open for discussion as to whether the decline of tracer uptake despite PD presents a partial therapy success in terms of mixed response or whether it indicates a further step towards dedifferentiation at a cellular level.

Post-processing

Multiplanar review of all unprocessed native image sets remains the starting point for each evaluation. For further processing, we recommend a post-processing workflow set including maximum intensity projections (MIP) and curved multiplanar reformations (CMPR). CMPR are to be used for the selection of the point of maximum stenosis and for the identification of the denominator for the NASCET/ECST assessment. However, the correct position of the centerline in the lumen must always be checked, as an asymmetric location outside the center of the vessel will lead to wrongly reformatted images and consequently potential evaluation errors (Fig. 10). Therefore, caution is always required when interpreting CMPR-images, especially in complex anatomical situations with tortuous branches. MIP images are used for anatomy assessment, especially useful in MR (Fig. 11). In some cases, in order to better illustrate the anatomical relationship between arteries and other tissues, the use of volume rendering (VR) images could be considered (e.g. Eagle syndrome). The stenosis degree should be quantified in CMPR views.

The c-MPR-technique and the importance of an adequately positioned centerline. A c-MPR image of the carotid bulb is shown (a, b). The original centerline (green) must be checked in all angles. While it nicely follows the center of the lumen in a frontal view (b), it deviates from it in a sagittal view (a), most notably on the transition from the common carotid artery to the internal carotid artery and more distally in the carotid bulb. As such, it produces in the resulting cross-sectional image an eccentrically positioned lumen (c), which can lead to wrong conclusions. Manual correction (red dotted line in a) is necessary to avoid interpretation mistakes

### Positron emission tomography / computed tomography: protocol issues and options [^1142mPTs]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) became FDA-approved for clinical use in late 2001. There are several design advantages of combined PET/CT over PET and CT acquired on separate devices, including more accurate CT and PET data co-registration, improved lesion localization, consolidation of imaging studies, and reduced scan times compared to dedicated PET. There are several protocols that can used to scan patients on combined PET/CT devices. Although there is no single "correct" protocol for performing a PET/CT scan, the use of oral and intravenous contrast media may improve the diagnostic value of the CT component. Whether to utilize contrast media depends on important clinical variables, including the specific type of tumor and the likelihood of encountering viable abdominal and pelvic malignancy. This article discusses various protocols pertinent to PET/CT imaging, including how the CT portion of a PET/CT scan can be performed and optimized, as well as PET/CT interpretation and reporting issues.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 57-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital due to the discovery of a pancreatic space-occupying lesion 1 week prior. The patient had hypertension for more than 10 years that was controlled by reserpine. Laboratory testing showed that the serum levels of amylase, bilirubin, and tumour markers were not elevated. US showed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head that had no obvious blood echoes; the boundary was clear. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the lesion was approximately 2.9 × 2.3 cm 2 in size and that the internal density was uneven; the lesion showed obvious progressive enhancement. The boundary was clear after enhancement. The unenhanced CT value was approximately 27–68 Hounsfield units (HU). Contrast-enhanced CT scanning showed a focus with inhomogeneous enhancement, and the CT value was approximately 24–85 HU in the arterial phase and 66–155 HU in the venous phase. The MRI indicated a space-occupying lesion on the uncinate process of the pancreas; the shape was regular, the boundary was clear, the internal intensity was slightly uneven, and there were several small cystic lesions. The T1-weighted image (T1WI) showed low-intensity, the T2-weighted image (T2WI) showed iso- to high-intensity, the diffusion-weighted image (DWI) showed iso-intensity, and the mass showed obvious progressive enhancement (Fig. 1). There was no dilation of the main pancreatic duct, no evidence of invasion of the surrounding organs, and no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour was initially diagnosed. As the patient had the desire for surgery, a Whipple resection was performed after the surgical evaluation. The histopathological studies confirmed the diagnosis was PH. So far, the patient has been followed up for 34 months and has remained disease free.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1147Buh7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical planning — computed tomography (CT) imaging provides functional and practical information for surgery, whereas plain films provide little or no definitive information; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone has limitations but can complement CT when soft-tissue assessment is needed. The American College of Radiology (ACR) endorses a maxillofacial CT without contrast as typically appropriate for surgical candidates, and nearly all members of the GDG endorsed a fine-cut protocol with cuts ideally at 1 mm or finer, with radiologist input on parameters such as image acquisition at 1 mm cuts with 50% slice overlap. Surgeons review their patients' images themselves in advance, and CT interpretation assesses mucosal thickening and anatomic abnormalities; although the degree of mucosal thickening may not always correlate with symptoms or directly influence decisions, it provides useful information about disease severity and extent that guides the overall surgical approach.

Ultrasound for neck mass evaluation — Ultrasound can be used to characterize a neck mass, to guide percutaneous tissue sampling, and to search for additional masses, and it is both noninvasive and inexpensive, although it is best suited for superficial tissue and will not adequately visualize most portions of the upper aerodigestive tract. Ultrasound is operator dependent with quality varying by ultrasonographer experience, and it may be considered as a first option for thyroid or salivary masses, when there will be a delay in obtaining CT or MRI, if contrast medium is contraindicated, or as an adjunct to expedite FNA biopsy.

### Techniques and approaches for safe, high-yield CT-guided suprahyoid head and neck biopsies [^117VRPo6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to present imaging approaches and key technical, safety, and patient care best practices critical for safe, successful image-guided biopsy of head and neck masses.

Conclusion

Image-guided sampling is an important adjunct to the diagnosis and management of head and neck masses and may be particularly useful when lesions are not accessible via an endoscope or by palpation-guided sampling. Appropriate workup is mandatory before the patient is scheduled for such a procedure. Once the procedure has been initiated, needle selection and technique are critical for increasing the diagnostic yield. Knowledge of the various head and neck biopsy approaches and their associated complications is important for optimal tissue sampling and minimization of morbidity.

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and radiological features of presacral lesions. CT and MRI are the diagnostic modalities of choice and are complimentary in the assessment of presacral lesions. Imaging findings of presacral lesions on CT and MRI are described with the use of examples. Preoperative biopsy, surgical and non-surgical managements are outlined. While the general radiologist cannot be familiar with every rare presacral condition, characterisation of a presacral lesion based on anatomy, demographics and imaging features can guide us in making a sound differential.

### Current knowledge on the sensitivity of the (68) Ga-somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography and the SUVmax reference range for management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours [^116ZYPex]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Physiologically increased pancreatic uptake at the head/uncinate process is observed in more than one-third of patients after injection of one of the three 68 Ga-labelled octreotide-based peptides used for somatostatin (sst) receptor (r) imaging. There are minor differences between these 68 Ga-sstr-binding peptides in the imaging setting. On 68 Ga-sstr-imaging the physiological uptake can be diffuse or focal and usually remains stable over time. Differences in the maximal standardised uptake values (SUV max) reported for the normal pancreas as well as for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PNET) lesions may be related to several factors, including (a) differences in the peptide binding affinities as well as differences in sstr subtype expression of pancreatic α- and β-cells, and heterogeneity / density of tumour cells, (b) differences in scanner resolution, image reconstruction techniques and acquisition protocols, (c) mostly retrospective study designs, (d) mixed patient populations, or (e) interference with medications such as treatment with long-acting sst analogues. The major limitation in most of the studies lies in the lack of histopathological confirmation of abnormal findings. There is a significant overlap between the calculated SUV max -values for physiological pancreas and PNET-lesions of the head/uncinate process that do not favour the use of quantitative parameters in the clinical setting. Anecdotal long-term follow-up studies have even indicated that increased uptake in the head/uncinate process still can turn out to be malignant over years of follow up. SUV max -data for the pancreatic body and tail are limited. Therefore, any visible focal tracer uptake in the pancreas must be considered as suspicious for malignancy irrespective of quantitative parameters. In general, sstr-PET/CT has significant implications for the management of NET patients leading to a change in treatment decision in about one-third of patients. Therefore, follow-up with 68 Ga-sstr-PET/CT is mandatory in the clinical setting if uptake in the head/uncinate process is observed.

### Altered biodistribution of [Ga] Ga-DOTA-TOC during somatostatin analogue treatment [^112CBAxg]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Study protocol

At Maastricht UMC + site patients were scanned on a 5 ring PET system (GE, Discovery MI, Milwaukee, Michigan, United States). At the Uniklinik Aachen, patients were scanned on a 16 PET/CT system (Gemini TF, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). All scans were performed with a standardized protocol, administrating 1.5 MBq/kg of [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC 40 min prior to the scan (range 30–45 min), with 2–2.5 min per bed position. All data was reconstructed according to standardized protocol using iterative reconstruction.

A low-dose CT scan was acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical correlation. Subsequent to the PET acquisition, diagnostic CT images were acquired with a chest CT and the upper abdomen in the arterial phase and a full abdominal CT in the portal venous phase after intravenous administration of iopromide 300 (Ultravist, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany).

Visual reading was performed by a senior nuclear medicine physician (10 years of experience with [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT) and a research assistant trained for the project. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were quantified in a spherical volume of interest (VOI) of 2 mL at the primary tumor (if applicable), 2 metastases, bloodpool at the height of the aortic arch, spleen, liver and the uncinate process of the pancreatic tail. In the follow-up scans, the VOI was placed in the same region as in the initial scan.

Statistical analysis

Normal distribution of the data was evaluated with the Shapiro–Wilk test. For image quantification, paired t -tests were performed to identify significant differences in uptake of [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC between the scans. Also, linear regression analysis was performed using R² and Pearson correlation coefficients. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with a p -value of < 0.05 considered significant. Analyses were performed in SPSS (version 28, IBM, USA).

### Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction [^113NFGyw]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a common cystic tumor of the pancreas. According to the internationally recognized evidence-based Kyoto guidelines for IPMN management, surgical intervention is preferred over long-term surveillance when worrisome features are present, particularly in patients with acute pancreatitis episodes, elevated serum cancer antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) levels, new-onset or acutely exacerbated diabetes within the past year, cyst larger than 30 mm, enhancing mural nodules smaller than 5 mm, thickened cyst walls, main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilation 5 to 10 mm in size, abrupt MPD caliber changes with distal pancreatic atrophy, peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, or a cyst growth rate of 2.5 mm or more per year. Rational surgical management remains indispensable for IPMN treatment.

Although patients with IPMN lacking high-risk stigmata or worrisome features exhibit low malignant progression rates, the long-term risk of pancreatic cancer increases over time, particularly when concurrent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is present, which may be challenging to differentiate clinically. With the widespread adoption of advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, the detection rate for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts has risen significantly. As a typical benign pancreatic cystic lesion and well-established precursor to pancreatic cancer, IPMN demonstrates an 8% rate of coexistence with resected PDAC.

Located in the pancreatic uncinate process, IPMN poses unique surgical challenges due to its anatomic obscurity. Although pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains the standard procedure for tumors in the pancreatic head or uncinate process, – it carries significant risks of postoperative diabetes, exocrine insufficiency, and hepatic steatosis when applied to benign disease. Recent studiesdemonstrate that parenchyma-sparing local enucleation for pancreatic neoplasms achieves lower rates of pancreatic fistula (21.0%), postoperative hemorrhage (9.9%), and delayed gastric emptying (4.9%), with endocrine/exocrine insufficiency rates of 7.1% and 10.0%, respectively, significantly lower than for conventional pancreatic resection. Notably, this approach showed 0% in-hospital mortality and long-term quality of life comparable with that for the general population.

### Laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the uncinate process and pancreatic reconstruction [^117SupZV]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The procedure demands advanced surgical expertise for precise ductal reconstruction and pancreatic restoration. This innovative approach provides a valuable alternative for local enucleation of benign or low-grade malignant tumors in the pancreatic uncinate region.

In summary, laparoscopic transection of the pancreatic neck with enucleation of a benign uncinate process tumor followed by pancreatic reconstruction represents a novel approach for localized enucleation of tumors in this anatomically challenging region. Integrating endoscopic pancreatic duct-stenting may enhance procedural safety. However, this preliminary case study highlights the need to validate long-term benefits through large-scale, multicenter studies. Furthermore, the successful application of this technique demands substantial surgical expertise in complex pancreatic dissection and meticulous ductal reconstruction.

Pancreatic sstr-imaging — sensitivity, specificity, and SUV max (Table 2)

Table 2
Overview of clinical imaging studies with 68 Ga-Sstr-analogues in PNETs

Sstr-PET is nowadays the established standard method for molecular imaging of NET. A detailed procedure guideline for PET/CT with 68 Ga-sst-analogue imaging was summarised by the Oncology Committee of the EANM This (early) guideline already mentions that physiological focal tracer uptake may mimic tumour disease in the pancreas, most frequently in the head/uncinate process, and also strongly recommends anatomical localisation with other imaging modalities.

Here, we overview the currently available data on the diagnostic performance of 68 Ga-sstr-PET in the detection of PNETs. We understand that patients at various centres occasionally have undergone surgery for suspected PNETs visualised by sst analogs in which no tumours were ultimately identified by pathohistology.

Data for 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC-PET

In the first prospective publication in 84 patients with known or suspected NET we described an increased uptake in the pancreatic head in 57 (67.8%)/84 patients, but we did not quantify the uptake in terms of SUV max. The criteria for visual study interpretation involved a malignant pancreatic head: an irregular or protrusive shape of finding and clear delineation from adjacent tissue with higher uptake than the liver. By these criteria, PET identified 23 findings in the pancreas while there were only 21 identified with SPECT and 19 with CT. Only one false positive (FP) finding with an enhanced tracer uptake in the pancreatic head was found in a patient who had clinical symptoms in terms of persistent diarrhoea suggestive for a PNET (Fig. 3).

### Evaluation of the response to treatment of solid tumours-a consensus statement of the international cancer imaging society [^114PGYvM]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

We agree that intravenous administration of contrast medium is an essential component of examination of the liver. However, there are several potential pitfalls in measurements of liver lesions. For example, there is no indication of whether liver metastases should be measured including the 'enhancing rim' or whether only the 'central lower density component' should be measured on CT.
It is difficult, but becoming increasingly important, to standardise the approach to administering intravenous contrast medium between different centres. We appreciate that this would be difficult, but working towards a standardised approach is of considerable importance. For example, measurement of a liver lesion in the 'arterial phase' of enhancement will produce a different measurement from that produced if the lesion is measured in the 'portal phase' of enhancement (Figure 3 Figure 3 Visualisation of liver metastases is greatly influenced by phase of contrast administration. Note nonvisualisation of lesions in the equilibrium phase (A), which are seen in the arterial phase (B) (arrows).). Although the authors state that 'a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinations for any given patient', there is no attempt to standardise such an approach across a clinical trial. Therefore, in one institution, a completely different method of assessing liver metastases could be conducted compared with another institution within the same study, leading to major discrepancies and probable error!.
It is important to raise our concern regarding the frequency and intensity of imaging required to assess therapeutic response as it relates to radiation exposure. In many clinical protocols, sequential examinations of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are required following every two cycles of chemotherapy. The adoption of multidetector CT scanning and thin collimation slices raises the important issue of radiation dosage to the patient, a topic that is becoming increasingly important, and addressed by other consensus statements in the imaging community.
There is room for debate and discussion regarding the need for CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and sometimes the neck during follow-up in patients with certain tumours in whom multiple CT scans are performed over a considerable length of time (e.g. lymphoma or testicular tumours). Reduction in the radiation dose could be achieved by limiting follow-up CT scans to the area(s) of disease, or the most likely sites of relapse. Radiation dose is also of great concern in the follow-up of paediatric tumours.
Unfortunately, many clinical trials are discussed and agreed with clinical principal investigators and diagnostic radiologists are only involved after the protocol has been agreed. It is the view of the ICIS that a radiologist should be a prominent member of the clinical research team when new clinical trials are being developed. It should be the responsibility of both the principal investigator and of industry to recognise the pivotal role of diagnostic imaging, not only in evaluation of response but also in setting up clinical trials from the outset.
The ICIS would suggest that in selected trials, off-site independent review of imaging data is undertaken by expert oncological radiologists who have experience in this subspecialty of diagnostic radiology. This is frequently not the case. The RECIST criteria have been set up in order to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of reporting of clinical trials among multiple sites and trials, but if the adoption of such criteria is unworkable for technical and practical purposes, the major objective is unlikely to be realised. Currently, commercial organisations, contract research organisations, cooperative groups and governmental agencies conduct independent response assessment. Many aspects of these external reviews, including, but not limited to, the use of film versus digital image data, number of external reviewers, format of the external review, use of clinical data in addition to image data, are not standardised. This lack of uniformity may lead to differences in response assessment, independent of the measurement methodology utilised. These differences have not been well studied or even documented in the oncology or radiology literature. Observer variability is also a major issue in response assessment. Data suggest that measurements made by a limited number of experienced observers should increase the accuracy in quantitative analysis of medical images.
It is interesting to note that several radiologists working in cancer imaging have stated that recent trials have been set up with protocols that state that either RECIST or WHO or modifications of both criteria may be used. Further, disease-specific guidelines have been proposed, which are being used in many cooperative group trials. It seems that a standardised approach is far from being realised.

### 68ga-dotatate (Netspot) [^11152Yej]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Radiation Risk

Gallium Ga 68 dotatate contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation radiolabeling procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Avoid close contact with infants and pregnant women during the first 12 hours after administration of gallium Ga 68 dotatate injection.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions following administration of somatostatin receptor imaging agents predominantly consisted of cutaneous reactions, such as rash and pruritus. Reactions reversed either spontaneously or with routine symptomatic management. Less frequently hypersensitivity reactions included angioedema or cases with features of anaphylaxis.

5.3 Risk for Image Misinterpretation

The uptake of gallium Ga 68 dotatate reflects the level of somatostatin receptor density in NETs. However, uptake can also be seen in a variety of other tumor types (e.g., those derived from neural crest tissue). Increased uptake might also be seen in sites of splenosis or other pathologic conditions (e.g., thyroid disease or subacute inflammation) or might occur as a normal physiologic variant (e.g., uncinate process of the pancreas). PET images with gallium Ga 68 dotatate should be interpreted visually and the uptake may need to be confirmed by histopathology or other assessments [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

A negative scan after the administration of gallium Ga 68 dotatate in patients who do not have a history of NETs, including in patients suspected of ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors, does not rule out the presence of NETs.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116V6W3P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 7 — imaging in candidates for sinus surgery specifies that for an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a CT scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning. Evidence strength: Recommendation based on limited and mostly observational reports, surgeon preference, and availability of imaging with a majority of evidence of moderate quality and moderate correlation with surgical outcomes, and the level of confidence in the evidence is high. Benefits include delineating sinonasal anatomy as part of surgical planning, identifying anatomical variants, ensuring that a proper CT is obtained that fully evaluates the paranasal sinuses to provide adequate information for the surgeon and avoid the need to repeat CT scans, and delineation of the extent of disease and/or coexistent pathology; risks, harms, and costs are additional radiation from a CT and cost of scans, with a benefits-harm assessment noting a preponderance of benefit and a trade-off between slice thickness and radiation exposure. Value judgments note that CT imaging provides an anatomic roadmap for safe surgery; not all CT scans have the requisite resolution for optimal surgery and some may provide inferior information if not obtained with a specific paranasal sinus protocol; image guidance is not mandatory. Intentional vagueness states the specifics of "fine cuts" are not specified, but the general consensus of the GDG is that 1–mm cuts or finer are ideal. Exceptions include revision surgery, for which a current CT scan is required regardless of time frame, and patients who would not pursue sinus surgery. Supporting text states that CT remains the gold standard for planning all types of sinus surgery.

### Solid pseudopapillary tumour of pancreas [^112oCmNo]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm (1%). This tumour primarily affects young women and is usually treated with surgical resection with a relatively favourable prognosis. We report an 18-year-old female patient presenting with moderate grade abdominal pain for 5 weeks. Abdominal examination revealed a lump palpable in the right upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen reported soft tissue lesion arising from uncinate process of pancreas causing adjacent compression. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded a cellular sample comprising pseudopapillary arrangement with bland appearing tumour cells consistent with benign neoplasm. And because of unusual location, Whipple procedure was performed. The patient was discharged under satisfactory conditions. Final histology confirmed the diagnosis. Solid pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas are a rare but treatable pancreatic tumour. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice and can be achieved through an open or minimal access technique.

### Imaging of head and neck cancer with CT, MRI, and US [^112KuAQq]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging of head and neck (HN) cancer is a challenge for many radiologists and largely due to the challenging anatomy in a small volume of the body. Additionally, multiple pathologies and the absence of an agreed-upon standard imaging protocol for staging and surveillance add complexity in choosing the most appropriate imaging study. Computed tomography (CT) is often the first-line imaging tool used as it is readily available, relatively cheaper than magnetic resonance (MR) and is rapidly acquired. In comparison, MR is hampered not just by its greater expense and time involved with an imaging study, but the optimization of MR techniques is difficult in this complex part of the body. Over the last decade, additional advanced techniques have been developed for both CT and MR such as dual-energy CT, and perfusion imaging with CT or MR, which may aid in making a more accurate diagnosis and predication of tumor behavior. Ultrasound (US) plays an important role in HN imaging, particularly in the pediatric age group for new neck masses, and in adult patients with known or suspected thyroid pathology. US is also useful for the evaluation of other superficial masses in the neck and for guiding fine needle aspiration. This article will focus on each imaging modality, reviewing the benefits and drawbacks of CT, MR, and US as well as additional or advanced techniques within each. It will highlight disease processes where a specific modality is strongly favored as the most appropriate imaging study, and specific HN tumor behaviors that require dedicated imaging protocols or techniques. This review will also discuss the entity of carcinoma of unknown primary, which is often imaged with PET/CT, but for which specific guidelines were introduced in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee of Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control Staging Manuals.

### A practical overview of CT and MRI features of developmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic lesions of the sphenoid body and clivus [^112PqPcT]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging techniques, classification, and clinico-epidemiological features of sphenoid/clival lesions

Radiological investigation techniques for the assessment of any lesion involving this area are nowadays represented by CT and MRI, which play a complementary role in the study of the whole skull base. The former is extremely useful in the identification of the sphenoid bone profile, erosions, sclerosis, lysis, intrasinusal content, and extra-sphenoid extension of disease. MRI is instead crucial to define both intracranial and extracranial soft tissue invasions, to evaluate the possible involvement of cranial nerves, and to further characterise intrasinusal contents. Skull X-ray projections are currently considered an outdated examination with a significantly lower accuracy than CT and MRI; therefore, radiographs have no more indications in skull base radiology. While FDG-PET/CT can be used as a support to CT and MRI, especially for staging purposes, its role in sphenoidal conditions falls beyond the scope of this paper.

### Refining the role of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in the staging of presumed pancreatic head and ampullary tumours [^1141eGHi]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

METHODS

All patients referred to our specialist unit with pancreatic tumours were entered onto a pancreatic cancer database. Patients with tumours of the pancreatic head (including uncinate process) or ampulla who had undergone LUS for staging of their intraabdominal disease were selected for analysis. For inclusion in the study a pancreatic CT scan was required to be available for radiological review. Patients with metastatic disease or peritoneal disease present on CT scanning were excluded from analysis. The selection of all patients with presumed tumours reflects the true nature of patients referred for assessment in our unit where we do not routinely pursue confirmation of a preoperative pathological diagnosis. All patients had a clinical presentation and CT scan appearance consistent with a diagnosis of cancer of the pancreatic head, uncinate process or ampulla.

CT assessment

The protocol for CT staging of suspected pancreatic tumours involved triple phase CT scanning with 5 mm slices during the arterial phase. During the study period the same spiral CT with a single detector was used for all scans. CT scanning performed prior to referral was only repeated if deemed unsatisfactory by the radiologist.

A single specialist hepatobiliary radiologist who was blinded to the outcome of each patient reviewed the abdominal CT scans. Each tumour was given a CT grade of vascular involvement based on that described by. This grading system examines the relationship between the tumour and the major vessels (superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery and hepatic artery). Patients with grade A to D tumours are considered potentially resectable while those with grade E or F tumours are invariably not resectable. In addition a grade O was added to this grading system for those patients with pancreatic and biliary duct dilatation without the presence of a pancreatic mass.

For analysis, grade A to D tumours where grouped together, as were grade E and F tumours, while grade O tumours were analysed as one entity.

Follow-up was continued until death and/or by outpatient review or General Practitioner contact. Patients were considered to have had benign disease if there had been resolution or no progression of CT scan changes after 12 months of follow-up.

### Mixed acinar-neuroendocrine-ductal carcinoma of the pancreas: a tale of three lineages [^112CkA7Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Most pancreatic cancers arise from a single cell type, although mixed pancreatic carcinomas represent a rare exception. The rarity of these aggressive malignancies and the limitations of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) pose significant barriers to diagnosis and appropriate management. We report a case of a 54-year-old man presenting with abdominal pain, jaundice and a hypodense lesion within the uncinate process on CT. FNA suggested poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which was subsequently resected via pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pathological analysis yielded diagnosis of invasive mixed acinar-neuroendocrine-ductal pancreatic carcinoma. Given the rare and deadly nature of these tumours, clinicians must be aware of their pathophysiology and do practice with a high degree of clinical suspicion, when appropriate. Surgical resection and thorough pathological analysis with immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy remain the standards of care for mixed pancreatic tumours without gross evidence of metastasis. Diligent characterisation of the presentation and histological findings associated with these neoplasms should continue in order to promote optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: can we differentiate? [^115Xjyi4]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis

AIP is the most common manifestation of IgG4-related systemic disease. AIP type 1 (also known as lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis) is seen mostly in middle aged men, whereas AIP type 2 is frequently a disease of a younger population. Type 1 AIP represents the pancreatic manifestation of systemic IgG4-related disease and type 2 AIP is typically a pancreas-specific disorder with no extrapancreatic involvement (e.g. proximal biliary stricture, submandibular gland involvement, or retroperitoneal fibrosis). Imaging-based differentiation between these two subtypes is currently not possible and differentiation is based mainly on histopathological evaluation.

From an imaging standpoint, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas is a commonly encountered finding but focal or mass-like enlargement is not unusual. Diffuse enlargement was reported in between 11 and 56% of patients, whereas focal or mass-like enlargement was observed in 28–59% of the cases (Fig. 27). Irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct is another important feature. Peripancreatic fat planes are typically preserved with no evidence of fluid collection or peripancreatic inflammation, which are commonly seen in acute pancreatitis.

Fig. 27
A 32-year-old female with no known medical history presented with chronic epigastric pain and weight loss. Abdominal CT showed a questionable and poorly discernible hypoattenuating mass within the pancreatic uncinate process (not shown). a Axial plane T2W MRI clearly demonstrates a hypointense lesion (arrows) in the uncinate process. b Axial plane DWI image shows focal diffusion restriction at the lesion site (arrows). The restricted area is larger than the actual lesion which may be a helpful finding for differentiation from adenocancer. Biopsy with endoscopic US guidance and subsequent immunohistochemical staining revealed IgG4-related pancreatic disease. With this result, the patient was placed on steroid treatment. c Follow-up imaging 3 months later after systemic steroid treatment confirmed complete resolution of the pancreatic pseudomass

Given the overlap of clinical and imaging features between focal AIP and pancreatic cancer, several studies have sought to differentiate AIP from pancreatic malignancies. Dilation of the main pancreatic duct is mild in patients with AIP as compared to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Indeed, upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct is rarely greater than 4 mm in patients with AIP. The pancreatic duct penetrating through the pseudomass, also known as the duct-penetrating sign, is considered to be a helpful sign for differentiating AIP from pancreatic cancer.

Integration of AI solutions into clinical workflows remains however challenging. Currently, quantitative plaque analysis CT software, while available, is not yet used in clinical practice as they prove to be often time-consuming, impacted by e.g. reconstruction parameters. Also, they are not clinically validated, often lacking robust evidence that they could offer a significant impact in terms of risk stratification. For the moment, the development of AI applications in the field of biomedical imaging is highly dynamic. Over time, AI tools will potentially improve in accuracy and reduce analysis time, leading the way for the more routine use of quantitative plaque analysis in future clinical practice.

Choice of modality: CT or MR?

Both CT and MR can provide a complete overview of the full vasculature from the aortic arch to the circle of Willis, a distinct advantage compared to duplex ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis are high for both modalities. The main advantages of MR are the lack of blooming artifacts caused by extensive calcifications, the ability to analyze vessel wall components and characterize plaques in detail, as well as the lack of radiation exposure. Disadvantages of MR include the use of gadolinium contrast agents, the examination duration, and contraindications to MR in certain patients.

The main advantages of CT are defined by the high spatial resolution, direct visualization of both luminal stenosis and carotid plaque with calcifications, fast acquisition, and broad availability including the widely accepted use f CTA of the head and neck vessels in the acute stroke work-up. Furthermore, CT has shown an exciting innovation, and next-generation scanners might provide even more in-depth information about plaque components. Disadvantages of CT include radiation exposure and the need for iodine contrast media which limits usability in patients with severely impaired renal function.

Previous interventions in neighboring anatomy like orthodontic prosthetics can on occasion hamper visualization of the carotid arteries. The extend of the generated artifacts varies with the location, type, and amount of the material used. Some manufacturers have developed proprietary solutions to reduce these artifacts on CT, while in general other more widely available novel reconstruction methods like iterative reconstruction can also help in reducing image quality degradation. On MRI, the generated artifacts vary with the chosen sequences. As a general rule, GE-sequences intravoxel dephasing artifacts can be reduced by decreasing voxel size and shortening echo time. A well-chosen and aligned field-of-view can also help in decreasing artifacts from previous dental work.

### Imaging of non-neoplastic duodenal diseases. A pictorial review with emphasis on MDCT [^114Nmi96]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Anatomy

The duodenum measures about 25 cm to 30 cm in length. It does not form part of the mesenteric small bowel and it has both an extra- and intraperitoneal location. The first portion (duodenal bulb) is suspended intraperitoneally and extends from the gastric pylorus to the gallbladder neck. The second portion (descending duodenum) extends between the superior and inferior duodenal flexures in the anterior pararenal space. The anatomic space between the duodenum and pancreatic head is the pancreaticoduodenal groove. The major and minor duodenal papillae are usually located in the second part of the duodenum. The third portion (horizontal duodenum) runs behind the peritoneum from right to left, crossing over the inferior vena cava and aorta. The major duodenal papilla is located in the third portion in up to 25% of cases; however, other series report a much lower percentage (1.4%). The fourth portion (ascending duodenum) courses superiorly to the duodenojejunal flexure. The duodenum is supplied by the pancreaticoduodenal arcades. The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is an anatomic landmark between the descending duodenum and the pancreatic head, and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is an anatomic landmark between the horizontal duodenum and uncinate process of the pancreas.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaNeuroendocrine imaging [^114APez4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuroendocrine dysfunction includes suspected hyper- and hypofunction of the pituitary gland. Causative lesions may include primary masses of the pituitary such as pituitary microadenomas and macroadenomas, as well as extrinsic masses, typically centered in the suprasellar cistern. Clinical syndromes related to hormonal dysfunction can be caused by excessive hormonal secretion or by inhibited secretion due to mass effect upon elements of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Additionally, complications such as hemorrhage may be seen in the setting of an underlying mass and can result in hormonal dysfunction. MRI with high-resolution protocols is the best first-line test to evaluate the sella turcica and parasellar region. CT provides complementary information regarding bony anatomy, and may be appropriate as a first-line test in certain instances, but it provides less detail and lesion characterization when compared to MRI. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### State-of-the-art CT and MR imaging and assessment of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: standardization of scanning protocols and measurements-a consensus document by the European society of cardiovascular radiology (ESCR) [^111oTEow]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk scores to enable targeted screening of cases in populations with an elevated risk of asymptomatic carotid stenosis have been developed and risk prediction models can be used to select particular individuals for targeted screening to detect asymptomatic carotid stenosis, allowing improved cardiovascular risk management to prevent complications. In a recently published multi-national survey in asymptomatic patients, the first exam used to evaluate carotid bifurcation was ultrasound in 88.8% of cases, CT in 7%, and MR in 4.2%. If a severe degree of stenosis was found in the US analysis, a second level exam was performed (CT in 88% of cases and MR in 12% of cases).

In the case of symptomatic patients, work-up strategies are oriented to the identification of the causes of stroke and therefore imaging of the carotid artery is a mandatory examination. There are significant differences in the imaging strategies according to multiple parameters (geography, level of the hospital (first, second or tertiary level) and the academic / nonacademic institutions) as recently published: In the case of symptomatic patients, half of the centers perform US as the first exam to evaluate carotid arteries (50.4%) followed by CT (41.6%), and then MR (8%). In symptomatic patients that are first studied with US, if a severe degree of stenosis is found, a second level exam is performed (CT in 85% of cases and MR in 15% of cases). Symptomatic persons that are admitted to a hospital with acute stroke symptoms usually undergo CT stroke imaging including a CT angiography of the head and cervical vessels with the ongoing current practice of performing frequently CT of the intracranial vessel at the admission in the symptomatic stroke that could be easily extended from the intracranial level to the cervical level. These data suggest that patients with cerebrovascular symptoms could be directly assessed with second-level imaging. In this scenario, it is also important to underline that in several centers the request for CT or MR after ultrasound is oriented by the detection of a severe degree of stenosis (assessed morphologically or with the PSV values). However, recently published papers have demonstrated that carotid plaque rupture plays a key role also in patients with mild or absence of degree of stenosis (cryptogenic stroke). This information suggests that also subjects that are considered with the absence of severe carotid stenosis could have a vulnerable, eccentric plaque that is the cause of the cerebrovascular symptoms.

### Detection of small (≤ 2 CM) pancreatic adenocarcinoma and surrounding parenchyma: correlations between enhancement patterns at triphasic MDCT and histologic features [^117ExtP1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Patient selection

From a retrospective review of pathological reports and surgical records we identified 127 patients with PDA who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy or total pancreatectomy at our institution between January 2006 and March 2012.

Tumors without histological examination of surrounding tissue or greater than 2 cm, tumors with atrophy of the upstream pancreas (n = 73) and patients with incomplete or inadequate helical Computed Tomography (CT) protocol (n = 16) were excluded from the study.

The final study population consists of 38 patients (26 males and 12 females, mean age 67.6 years, range age 54–88 years) who underwent an identical triphasic MDCT protocol, ultrasonography and/or Magnetic Resonance imaging and in whom the histological and MDCT examination of PDA and pancreas upstream/downstream to the tumor was performed.

For this retrospective study the evaluation of data obtained in the clinical routine were followed and informed consent was obtained in all patients. Information gathered on this population was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles.

Histological evaluation

The surgical specimens of the pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy or total pancreatectomy were examined for the PDA (n = 38) and pancreatic parenchyma upstream (n = 38) and downstream (n = 25) to the tumor. The surgical specimens for pancreatic parenchyma downstream to the tumor were not available in 13 patients because, in these patients, the PDA was localized in the uncinate process.

PDA histologically showed high cellularity of tumor cells with dense mild or abundant fibrosis, mucin and/or necrosis.

Mild chronic pancreatitis histologically showed a limited involvement of pancreatic parenchyma upstream and downstream to the tumor corresponding to fibrosis, dilatation of small ducts and occasional presence of inflammatory cells.

Severe chronic pancreatitis histologically showed diffuse fibrosis, low presence of inflammatory cells, loss of acini and dilatation of the portion of the Wirsung's duct in the upstream pancreatic parenchyma to the tumor.

### Current knowledge on the sensitivity of the (68) Ga-somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography and the SUVmax reference range for management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours [^1152pi15]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Schmid-Tannwald et al. showed that 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE-PET/CT is more sensitive than DW-MRI in the detection of PNETs in 18 patients in the first direct head-to-head comparative study of patients with histologically proven well-differentiated or intermediate PNETs. The cohort comprised five lesions in the head, three in the uncinate process, six in the body and nine in the tail. In this study, the SUV max for the PNETs were 36.46 ± 27.38, range 6.2–120. In Fig. 4 they show the case of a patient with PNET that could neither be visualised by DW-MRI nor CT. Only the fused PET/CT image made the lesion clearly identifiable by its increased uptake of 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE.

Similarly, Etchebehere et al. reported for 19 patients a higher sensitivity of PET/CT over DW-MRI (1.5 T) and SPECT/CT (99m Tc- 6-hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC)-octreotide). This study was performed prospectively and included a biopsy of suggestive lesions. For the pancreas, PET/CT detected more lesions versus SPECT/CT (P = 0.0455) and WB-DWI (p < 0.0455) including a case of unknown primary in the pancreas uncinate (sensitivity 100%, specificity 80%, accuracy 84%), but also reported on one FP-uptake in the process uncinate. Notably, in Fig. 1 the authors demonstrate the case of an unknown primary which was clearly marked only on 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE-PET/CT while neither SPECT/CT nor MRI identified the tumour. Only retrospective analysis detected the primary (0.4 cm lesion) on dedicated CT performed 4 years previously!

Data for other sstr-binding radiopharmaceuticals

68 Ga-DOTA- lanreotide (LAN) and 64 Cu-DOTA-TATE-PET

The only PNET imaged by 68 Ga-DOTA-LAN, which was negative by 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC, exhibited an SUV max of 6.5. Pfeifer et al. reported a case of previously unknown PNET that was only confirmed 6 months later on CT in a patient with MEN I syndrome.

Pancreatic CT and MRI

A-B: Non-enhanced (A) and contrast-enhanced (B) CT images of the pancreas; C-F: DWI (C), T1 (D), T2 (E), and contrast-enhanced (F) MRI images of the pancreas

On November 22, 2020, the re-examination of biochemical tests showed significantly elevated levels: of amylase 483 U/L, lipase 758 U/L, and hs-CRP 56.97 mg/L. Pancreatic MRI showed fullness and heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic uncinate process (accompanied by dilation of the upper segment of the common bile duct and visualization of the pancreatic duct), as shown in Fig. 4 C-F, suggesting the possibility of a tumor. As our hospital did not perform pancreatic endoscopic pathology examinations at that time, the patient sought medical attention at the Tongren Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. On December 17, 2020, the pathology diagnosis from the endoscopic examination indicated minimal fibrin exudate in the pancreas. The pancreatic cytology diagnosis suggested no malignant tumor cells in the puncture smears of the pancreatic mass. After excluding pancreatic tumors, symptomatic treatment was given with pancreatin enteric capsules (300 mg po tid) and pinaverium bromide tablets (50 mg po tid). The patient had good compliance and continued the treatment for 18 months. On July 7, 2021, the re-examination at our hospital showed that amylase (27 U/L) and lipase (6 U/L) were within the normal range. Chest CT scan indicated a CR (Fig. 5). The changes in NSE, amylase, and lipase levels during the patient's entire treatment process are shown in Fig. 6. As of January 2, 2024, the patient visited our outpatient clinic, and the OS period exceeded 95 months. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Quhua Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

### Evaluating the ability to detect pancreatic lesions using a special ultrasonography examination focusing on the pancreas [^114mDytU]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The ability to detect pancreatic cysts was compared between special ultrasonography (US) examination focusing on the pancreas (special pancreatic US) and routine upper abdominal ultrasonography to objectively assess the ability of the former to detect cysts.

Subjects and Methods

Of 3704 patients who underwent special pancreatic US at our hospital, 186 underwent routine upper abdominal US within six months, had pancreatic cysts, and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these patients, 447 cysts measuring ≥ 5mm were detected via MRI, which was used as the gold standard. The ability and sensitivity of the US modalities to detect each cyst was determined.

Results

The sensitivity of special pancreatic US was 92.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.7%-94.7%) and that of routine upper abdominal US was 70.2% (95% CI, 66.0%-74.5%). McNemar test (Stata Version 13.1) revealed a significant difference in the cyst (≥ 5mm) detection sensitivity between the two modalities (p < 0.001). An analysis stratified by patients similarly revealed a significant difference between the two modalities (p < 0.001). The cyst detection sensitivity was also analyzed in various parts of the pancreas. The sensitivity of special pancreatic US was 88.7% for the uncinate process and inferior head, 97.5% for the head, 97.1% for the body, 89.0% for the body-tail, and 66.7% for the tail, whereas that of routine upper abdominal US was 74.2% for the uncinate process, 69.5% for the head, 81.0% for the body, 67.0% for the body-tail, and 26.7% for the tail. The McNemar test revealed significant differences in the sensitivity of the two modalities for all pancreatic parts (p < 0.001–0.016).

Conclusion

Compared with routine upper abdominal US, special pancreatic US had higher sensitivity in detecting pancreatic cysts.

Contrast CT revealed diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with a suspicious lesion in the uncinate process in a 57-year-old man who presented with jaundice. F-FDG PET/CT showed increased radioactivity in the enlarged pancreas with a nodular lesion with even higher uptake in the uncinate process. To differentiate autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, Ga-FAPI PET/CT was performed. It revealed intense Ga-FAPI uptake in the pancreas, but the FDG-avid lesion in the uncinate process was not shown. The patient was finally diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with tumor-induced pancreatitis with endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biopsy.

### Variant human pancreas: aberrant uncinate process or an extended mesenteric process [^114Gtho5]. Pancreas (2003). Low credibility.

Variations in the morphology of pancreas are not very common. We observed a rare variant of the uncinate process of the pancreas that extended in the mesentery of the small intestine. After its origin from the lower part of the head of the pancreas, the mesenteric process (MP) passed over the third part of the duodenum to enter the mesentery of the jejunum and ileum and extended up to the level of the pelvic brim. The branches of the superior mesenteric vessels were embedded in the extended MP of the pancreas. This aberrant extension of the pancreas was drained by a narrow duct, which joined the main pancreatic duct inside the head. We did not observe a separate uncinate process arising from the head. On histology normal acini and endocrine cells were observed in the extension. This variant is important as symptoms of pancreatic disease from such extensions may be confused with other commonly encountered acute or chronic abdominal conditions.

Plaque composition: standard classification

In the following sections, a detailed overview of plaque components and characteristics within their clinical context is provided.

In 1995, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a detailed classification scheme designed to be used as a histological template for images of plaques obtained by a variety of invasive and noninvasive techniques in the clinical setting. In this AHA scheme (Table 2), revised in 2000, the lesions are designated by Roman numerals, indicating the usual sequence of lesion progression: evolving from an initial type I lesion to eventually type VIII with predominant fibrous tissue changes within the plaque. This classification was based on MR and CT imaging studies. Building further on the AHA scheme, Virmani and colleagues focused on erosion, rupture, and thinning of the fibrous cap. This has become the most widely accepted system in use today.

Table 2
AHA classification and AHA-MR based classification from reference

MR is the method of choice over CT for advanced carotid plaque analysis due to improved contrast resolution and superior tissue component analysis. However, as discussed in the next section, promising advances in CT building on good spatial resolution, the availability of advanced software tools and new techniques (e.g. spectral imaging) to extract additional information, together with improved automation and standardization, have the potential to increase the value of CT in this field. On CT, we recommend a simplified plaque classification based on attenuation density (Hounsfield units, HU) with 3 groups: low-attenuated plaques (< 60 HU), mixed plaques (60 to 130 HU), and calcified plaques (> 130 HU).

Fibrous cap

The fibrous cap (FC) is a layer of fibrous connective tissue on the intimal surface of an atherosclerotic plaque, which is thicker and less cellular than the normal intima. FC alterations are considered to be a feature of plaque vulnerability with FC thinning present in 95% of symptomatic plaques but also in 48% of asymptomatic plaques (p = 0.003). The importance of this parameter, first described with MR in 2000, is confirmed by recent MR and histopathological studies. Prospective studies demonstrated that, among other plaque features, a thinning/rupture of the FC as detected with MR is associated with an increased risk for TIA/stroke. MR is to date likely the sole imaging technique to assess this feature non-invasively, with the most accurate characterization by CE-MR.

### An additional challenge for head and neck radiologists: anatomic variants posing a surgical risk-a pictorial review [^1157R7Gy]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Another point of concern for optic nerve injury during surgery is the anterior clinoid process pneumatization. In this case, the risk of iatrogenic damage is related to the thickness of the bony walls of the process and to the degree of pneumatization surrounding the nerve. The prevalence of this variant is low (6–13%).

The infraorbital (or Haller's) cell is an extension of ethmoid pneumatization to the orbital wall, inferolateral to the ethmoid bulla (Fig. 2). This cell may obstruct the ethmoid infundibulum, thereby predisposing the patient to maxillary sinusitis and may increase the hazard of orbital penetration during endoscopic sinus surgery; while opening such a cell, in fact, the surgeon may dangerously leverage on the inferomedial orbital wall.

Fig. 2
Haller's cell. Coronal MDCT reformation shows a huge infraorbital cell (asterisk) along the inferior orbital wall, not affecting the caliber of the ethmoid infundibulum (arrows)

Both clinoid pneumatization and Haller's cell are readily detected on coronal MDCT scans or on cone beam CT (CBCT) scans.

A unilaterally shrunk maxillary sinus may indicate the collapse of the uncinate process along the inferomedial orbital wall. This anomalous position of the uncinate process enhances the risk of accidental orbital penetration during uncinectomy, a frequent procedure in the early stages of endoscopic sinus surgery. The pathophysiology in this anatomic variant is triggered by adhesion between the uncinate process and the orbital wall; in fact, this induces chronic hypoventilation and negative pressure within the maxillary sinus resulting in shrinkage of the lumen and inflammatory thickening of the mucosa. Negative sinus pressure also induces partial collapse of the orbital floor and increased vertical diameter of the orbit. All of these signs are referred to as silent sinus syndrome and can be easily detected on (CB) MDCT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (Fig. 3).

Plaque composition: intraplaque hemorrhage

Thirty years ago, the presence of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) was first described in histopathological studies performed in carotid plaques of symptomatic patients, suggesting that this feature could be considered a marker of plaque instability. With the evolution of imaging techniques, especially MR, the non-invasive detection of blood components (with e.g. high signal on T1-weighted images) within a plaque became possible. In 2003, Moody et al published a landmark paper showing that it was possible to detect IPH within carotid plaques using MR. Currently, MR-detected IPH is considered the lead imaging biomarker of carotid artery plaque vulnerability (Fig. 4). It is important to underline that IPH is also more prevalent in carotid arteries ipsilateral to embolic strokes of "undetermined source".

Fig. 4
A 83-year-old female with a left-sided stroke and intraplaque hamorrhage as detected with MR. A 3D MPRAGE MR image reveals a high-intensity semi-circumferential plaque in the left internal carotid artery (arrow in a, b), corresponding to intraplaque hemorrhage. The excellent tissue contrast resolution of MR makes it the non-invasive imaging method of choice for the detection of blood degradation products in hemorrhagic plaques. MPRAGE: magnetization-prepared 180° radio-frequency pulses and rapid gradient-echo

The prevalence of IPH in the carotid arteries in patients without severe stenosis could be used to reclassify the standard scheme of causative stroke, including plaques without severe luminal stenosis as a potential cause of stroke. In a cohort study of 1190 asymptomatic subjects, IPH detected with MR was shown to be a high-risk factor for a subsequent cerebrovascular ischemic event, with a significantly lower event-free survival rate of patients with IPH p < 0.001). In a recent individual patient data meta-analysis, including 560 patients with symptomatic and 136 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the presence of IPH at baseline increased the risk of ipsilateral stroke in both symptomatic (hazard ratio [HR] 10.2; 95% CI 4.6 to 22.5) and asymptomatic (HR 7.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 47.6) patients. The authors suggested that IPH could be also detected with CT by considering the portion of the plaque with an attenuation value of < 25 to 30 HU. However, there is a limited specificity with CT due to the overlap in attenuation values between IPH, fibrotic, and lipid components.

### Adenocarcinoma of the uncinate process of the pancreas: MDCT patterns of local invasion and clinical features at presentation [^1136aaP3]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the multidetector CT (MDCT) patterns of local invasion and clinical findings at presentation in patients with adenocarcinoma of the uncinate process of the pancreas to patients with adenocarcinomas in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas.

Methods

We evaluated the two cohorts for common duct and pancreatic duct dilatation, mesenteric vascular encasement, root of mesentery invasion, perineural invasion and duodenal invasion. In addition, we compared the clinical findings at presentation in both groups.

Results

Common duct (P < 0.001) and pancreatic duct dilatation (P = 0.001) were significantly less common in uncinate process adenocarcinomas than in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas. Clinical findings of jaundice (P = 0.01) and pruritis (P = 0.004) were significantly more common in patients with lesions in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas. Superior mesenteric artery encasement (P = 0.02) and perineural invasion (P = 0.001) were significantly more common with uncinate process adenocarcinomas.

Conclusion

Owing to its unique anatomic location, adenocarcinomas within the uncinate process of the pancreas have significantly different patterns of both local invasion and clinical presentation compared to patients with carcinomas in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas. Key Points
- SMA encasement and perineural invasion were more common with uncinate process adenocarcinomas.
- Common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation were less common in uncinate process adenocarcinomas
- Jaundice and pruritis were more common with lesions elsewhere in the pancreatic head.

### Adrenal imaging with multidetector CT: evidence-based protocol optimization and interpretative practice [^115PVWgw]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is an integral tool in the assessment of adrenal masses. Dedicated adrenal CT is performed for a range of indications, including hormonal abnormalities suggestive of a functional adrenal mass and adrenal cancer staging. It is important to have an understanding of the published data that guide protocol design and image interpretation. Whether an adrenal mass is identified serendipitously or is being imaged for further characterization, there are several CT findings that contribute to the diagnosis, such as lesion size, precontrast attenuation, level of enhancement at 60 seconds and on delayed images, percentage washout on delayed images, histogram analysis, and extent (involvement of the inferior vena cava and bilaterality). In the past decade, a body of pertinent literature has evolved, addressing each of these measures individually.

MR

A basic guideline for a MR scan protocol is given in Table 7.

MR-scan protocol. Suggested scan parameters and general guidelines

* GRE, gradient echo; TOF, time of flight; IR-TFE, inversion recovery turbo field echo; SPGR, spoiled gradient recalled; TSE, turbo spin echo; SE, spin echo; CE, contrast-enhanced

Technical parameters

As with CT, the fundamental requirements of a MR protocol include the following: (a) isotropic voxel size ≤ 1 mm with ideally 0.5 mm in-plane resolution; (b) optimal blood suppression in plaque burden visualization sequences; and (c) adequate SNR in all sequences for reliable evaluation. The MR protocol may consider either 2D or 3D or a combination of sequences that meet the minimum requirements set forth above. 3D sequences are preferred as they can detect plaques extending beyond the 4-cm coverage centered on the bifurcation. Although it is known that adequate image quality can be obtained with 1.5T, the use of high-field strength 3T scanners and dedicated carotid coils is recommended for improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Anatomic coverage

The longitudinal coverage is two-fold: 3–4 cm centered on the carotid bifurcation for plaque analysis (MR) and from the aortic arch to the circle of Willis for the overall assessment of supra-aortic vessels (MRA).

Contrast injection protocol

Examinations can be performed with or without the administration of contrast material. In the absence of contraindications for Gadolinium-based contrast agents, contrast-enhanced MR is recommended for the detection and quantification of LRNC, the delineation of the fibrous cap, and neovascularization assessment. Contrast material also increases MR sensitivity for the detection of ulcerations. Finally, contrast-enhanced MR angiograms provide an overview of the anatomical situation and DSA-like images.

Similar to CT, contrast injection is preferably performed through an antecubital vein. However, contrast injection rates can be lower than their CT counterparts, with excellent results achievable with a 1–2 mL/s injection speed adapted to body habitus. The use of higher Gadolinium concentrations is recommended (1.0 mmol/mL as they improve SNR for the same contrast volume compared with agents with lower concentrations or achieve the same SNR at half the volume.

MR protocols suitable for 2D/3D approaches, with or without intravenous contrast enhancement, can be found in Table 7.

### Solitary polyps of the uncinate process [^115hFRGB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Cases of a solitary polyp of the nasal cavity are much less common than cases of massive polyposis. The most important factor in the formation of solitary polyps is the anatomic variations that result in mucosal contacts. We report the case of a patient who had bilateral solitary polyps of the uncinate process. Radiologic and clinical examinations revealed a medially bent uncinate process in the right nasal cavity and a bifid uncinate process in the left nasal cavity. These structures were the origins of the polyps.

### Intraoperative pancreatoscopy with narrow band imaging: a novel method for assessment of resection margins in case of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^112YdFWu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is characterized by intraductal proliferation of neoplastic mucinous cells with a variable extent along the main duct or its branches. The lesion may be continuous or discontinuous. Skip lesions have been described in about 6–19% of cases. Complete resection without leaving behind any skip lesions is important, to such an extent that many groups suggest even total pancreatectomy, a major and morbid surgery.

Methods

A 40 year-male patient with chronic pancreatitis presented with recent-onset diabetes mellitus and weight loss. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a cystic lesion in the head and uncinate process of pancreas. Peroral pancreatoscopy showed villous projections with dilated tortuous vessel in the head, suspicious of IPMN. The duct beyond pancreatic head could not be visualized and remained unassessed. At pancreatoduodenectomy, pancreatoscopy with narrow band imaging (NBI) was done using flexible pancreatoscope through the cut end of the duct at the neck to assess the duct in the body and tail.

Results

Pancreatoscopy with NBI showed a normal-looking resection margin and a skip lesion 1 cm beyond it. The revised resection margin confirmed the skip lesion on frozen section and also that the fresh cut margin was negative. The remaining duct in the body and tail was normal on pancreatoscopy. Total clearance of the disease could be achieved without a major procedure such as total pancreatectomy.

Conclusions

Intraoperative pancreatoscopy, especially with NBI, is a good diagnostic tool for IPMN and also helps in intraoperative decision-making of the resection margins.
