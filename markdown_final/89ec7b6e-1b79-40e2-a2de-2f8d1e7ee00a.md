## Question

what diagnostic work up needs to be done for hydroceles

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate diagnostic workup for hydroceles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and physical examination to characterize the lesion and screen for red flags. Then, I should verify when scrotal ultrasound is indicated and how to interpret it. Next, I will consider special scenarios such as acute scrotum, suspected malignancy, and abdominoscrotal hydrocele. After that, I should review age-specific management pathways for infants versus older children and adults. Finally, I will synthesize a concise diagnostic algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: a thorough history and physical examination are the cornerstone of hydrocele diagnosis, and I need to ensure I document onset, fluctuation in size, associated pain, trauma, infection, and systemic symptoms, while also checking for contralateral disease and differentiating from hernia on exam, because fluctuance and transillumination favor hydrocele whereas reducibility and bowel sounds suggest hernia [^1116Vs6W] [^111UjwSx].

> Wait, let me verify the key bedside maneuvers before jumping to imaging: inspection for scrotal asymmetry and skin changes, palpation to distinguish a smooth, nontender, mobile mass that may transilluminate from a firm, irregular, or fixed mass, and attempts to reduce the mass to distinguish reducible hernia from nonreducible processes. I should also assess for cough impulse and examine the contralateral side to detect bilateral disease, as recommended by pediatric urology guidance [^1116Vs6W] [^111UjwSx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — imaging is not always necessary. I need to check indications for scrotal ultrasound, which is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or when malignancy is suspected, and is the first-line modality for characterizing intrascrotal masses and distinguishing hydrocele from hernia, tumor, or other lesions per EAU/ESPU and ACR Appropriateness Criteria [^116KnZSX] [^114Yknyv] [^112Mx2Dd].

> I will now examine the ultrasound protocol and expected findings. I should confirm documentation of both testes in longitudinal and transverse planes, compare side-by-side, and evaluate the hydrocele for simple versus complex fluid, septations, debris, wall thickening, and especially communication with the inguinal canal suggesting a patent processus vaginalis. I need to ensure I assess the underlying testis and epididymis for solid masses or other pathology, and if a mass is identified, I should measure and characterize it with Doppler, following AIUM standards [^1163qvxL] [^112Mx2Dd].

> But wait, what if the presentation is an acute scrotum with pain and swelling? I should double-check that emergent scrotal ultrasound with Doppler is indicated to exclude torsion and guide urgent management, and I must not delay surgical consultation if torsion is suspected, as salvage drops sharply after six hours. Ultrasound can also reveal a reactive hydrocele that may obscure the exam, so I need to interpret Doppler flow and testicular echotexture carefully in this context [^111gKjps] [^116gHceD] [^114CB4wZ].

> Let me consider malignancy risk next. If the hydrocele is new in an adult, especially with a firm or irregular testis, or if ultrasound shows a solid intratesticular mass, I should confirm that serum tumor markers (AFP, hCG, LDH) are obtained and that urgent urologic referral is made, because a solid testicular mass must be treated as malignant until proven otherwise and ultrasound with Doppler is the initial imaging of choice in this scenario [^115QBuvJ] [^111jvo6T].

> I should also review special entities. Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is rare and may present with a large scrotal and abdominal component, so if suspected, I need to ensure careful ultrasound with graded compression to demonstrate the communication, and consider MRI if ultrasound is inconclusive or to better delineate extent before surgical planning, recognizing that most cases historically underwent surgery though some series support initial observation in select cases [^114NELYa] [^114NELYa] [^117DSgQe].

> Next, I should review age-specific pathways. In infants with a communicating hydrocele, I need to ensure observation for at least 12 months given the high rate of spontaneous resolution, reserving surgery for persistence beyond that window or if a hernia is suspected, whereas in older children and adults, persistent, symptomatic, or complex hydroceles warrant surgical evaluation and ultrasound helps confirm diagnosis and exclude underlying pathology before intervention [^116U4VLs] [^111bvb24] [^1138yjxp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine ultrasound might be needed for all hydroceles, but I should correct that — ultrasound is not universally required. It is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, the mass is atypical, the testis is nonpalpable, or malignancy is a concern, aligning with EAU/ESPU and ACR guidance and the principle that most hydroceles are diagnosed clinically [^116KnZSX] [^114Yknyv] [^112Mx2Dd].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm: start with history and physical to distinguish hydrocele from hernia, tumor, varicocele, or other masses. If classic and uncomplicated, no imaging is needed and observation or referral is reasonable. If uncertain, atypical, or if the testis is not palpable, obtain scrotal ultrasound with Doppler. In acute pain, prioritize emergent ultrasound and surgical consultation to exclude torsion. In adults with new hydrocele or suspicious features, obtain tumor markers and urology referral. If abdominoscrotal hydrocele is suspected, use ultrasound and consider MRI for surgical planning [^1116Vs6W] [^116KnZSX] [^111gKjps] [^115QBuvJ] [^114NELYa].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check I am aligned with guidelines: most hydroceles are diagnosed clinically, ultrasound is the first-line imaging when indicated, and management is age- and symptom-driven with observation in infants and surgical repair for persistent or complicated cases, ensuring that torsion and malignancy are always considered and excluded when appropriate [^116KnZSX] [^116U4VLs] [^111bvb24] [^112Mx2Dd].

The diagnostic workup for hydrocele centers on **clinical examination** with transillumination and palpation to confirm fluid and exclude hernia or mass [^1138yjxp] [^114CB4wZ]. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the testis is nonpalpable, or a mass is suspected, **scrotal ultrasound** is the first-line imaging to confirm fluid, assess the testis/epididymis, and distinguish hydrocele from hernia, varicocele, or tumor [^116KnZSX] [^114Yknyv] [^112Mx2Dd]. MRI is reserved for complex or equivocal cases, and routine labs are not needed unless infection or malignancy is suspected [^114NELYa] [^112uAxv1] [^115QBuvJ]. In infants, observe for 12–18 months for spontaneous resolution; operate earlier if hernia or testicular pathology is suspected [^116U4VLs] [^111bvb24].

## Clinical history and physical examination

### Clinical history

- **Onset and duration**: Congenital vs. acquired; acute vs. chronic.
- **Symptoms**: Painless swelling, heaviness, discomfort, or pain (suggesting infection, torsion, or rupture).
- **Fluctuation**: Size changes with activity or position suggest a communicating hydrocele [^111Zu1Vh].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, urinary symptoms, trauma, or systemic illness [^notfound].
- **Past medical history**: Prior surgery, trauma, infection, or malignancy [^notfound].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Scrotal asymmetry, swelling, skin changes [^112Mx2Dd].
- **Palpation**: Smooth, fluctuant, non-tender mass; testis may be difficult to palpate [^notfound].
- **Transillumination**: Positive (red glow) confirms fluid [^notfound].
- **Cough impulse**: Absent in non-communicating hydrocele; present in hernia [^notfound].
- **Examination of the contralateral side**: Assess for bilateral disease [^1116Vs6W].

## Imaging studies

### Scrotal ultrasound

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** modality for hydrocele diagnosis and characterization [^114Yknyv]. Key findings include anechoic or hypoechoic fluid around the testis, a clearly defined testis, and no internal septations or solid components; a patent processus vaginalis indicates a communicating hydrocele [^notfound]. Ultrasound also helps differentiate hydrocele from hernia, varicocele, epididymal cyst, testicular tumor, and other scrotal masses [^116X9qwM].

---

### Indications for ultrasound

Obtain ultrasound when the diagnosis is uncertain, the testis is nonpalpable, or a mass is suspected [^116KnZSX]. Also use it to evaluate contralateral disease and to guide management decisions [^1175KwpV].

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

MRI is reserved for complex or equivocal cases, particularly when ultrasound is inconclusive or malignancy is suspected [^114NELYa]. Typical findings include fluid signal around the testis with well-defined margins and no enhancement of the fluid collection.

---

## Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory tests are generally not required for uncomplicated hydroceles. Consider testing only when **infection or malignancy is suspected**.

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **observation** is appropriate for 12–18 months given the high rate of spontaneous resolution [^113EWQcy]. Early surgery is indicated if a hernia is present or testicular pathology is suspected [^111bvb24].

---

### Adult patients

In adult patients, **evaluation** should include assessment for underlying causes such as infection, trauma, or malignancy [^116A69y7]. Consider surgical intervention for persistent, symptomatic, or large hydroceles [^notfound].

---

## Summary of diagnostic workup

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical history and physical examination | - Initial assessment <br/> - Confirm diagnosis <br/> - Exclude other conditions [^114Yknyv] |
| 2 | Scrotal ultrasound | - Confirm diagnosis <br/> - Differentiate from other scrotal masses <br/> - Guide management [^112oF2w3] |
| 3 | MRI (if needed) | - Complex or equivocal cases <br/> - Suspected malignancy [^114NELYa] |
| 4 | Laboratory tests (if indicated) | - Suspected infection or malignancy [^111jvo6T] |

---

The diagnostic workup for hydrocele includes clinical history, physical examination with transillumination, and **scrotal ultrasound** as the primary imaging modality. MRI is reserved for complex cases, and laboratory tests are only needed if **infection or malignancy** is suspected. Management is guided by patient age, symptoms, and **underlying causes** [^114Yknyv].

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a systematic review [^111TvMqN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon condition characterized by a fluid-filled mass with inguinoscrotal and abdominal components. Controversy exists regarding the best management. We conducted a systematic review of the literature with special interest in presentation, management and outcomes.

Methods

A search was conducted of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Web of Science and Scopus databases. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in each study.

Results

We found 18 case series that met selection criteria, describing 116 patients with 146 hydroceles. Unilateral ASH was found in 59% of cases with almost even distribution between left and right-sided hydroceles. Ipsilateral undescended testicle, testicular dysmorphism, and contralateral pathology (inguinal hernia) often accompanied ASH. Management was always surgical. The most common approaches were inguinal (67.2%), combined laparoscopic + inguinal (11.2%), and scrotal (10.3%). Complications were poorly reported, but were generally minor. There were a decreased number of complications with the scrotal approach because of avoidance of a difficult inguinal dissection.

Conclusions

ASH is a rare entity treated most commonly via an inguinal approach. However, consideration should be given to combining with an extraperitoneal or laparoscopic approach given coexisting pathology, or to the scrotal approach for reducing morbidity.

### MR imaging of the testicular and extratesticular tumors: when Do we need? [^114NELYa]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Testicular ultrasound is typically the first-line imaging examination in evaluating scrotal pathology. However, MR imaging can often provide valuable additional information, especially when ultrasound and/or clinical examinations are inconclusive. This is particularly evident when encountering testicular or paratesticular lesions, where accurate localization and characterization are paramount for management and prognosis. After reviewing normal scrotal anatomy as seen on MR imaging and offering a sample imaging protocol, the article describes specific indications for scrotal MR imaging and highlights imaging findings unique to various benign and malignant causes.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute onset of Scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Imaging of the scrotum in children [^116f67xX]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical examination of the scrotum is difficult due to the small size of the testes and the epididymis in infants and young children, and eliciting patients' history is challenging. Therefore imaging of the scrotum in childhood bears great importance. Ultrasound is the standard imaging technique of choice providing the clinicians with a definitive diagnosis in most cases. However, in conditions of testicular torsion and epididymoorchitis — the most common differential diagnosis of scrotal pain — ultrasound findings can be inconclusive and further evaluation is required. Since there is a large overlap between paediatric and adult pathology, differences from adults in anatomy and pathology must be considered when evaluating the paediatric scrotum.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^113vSmsa]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for hydrocele, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend to perform ligation of the patent processus vaginalis via inguinal incision with distal stump left open in pediatric patients with hydrocele.

### Tension hydrocele: an unusual cause of acute scrotal pain [^1175KwpV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of acute scrotal pain can vary from a benign process such as mild trauma, appendicular torsion, or epididymo-orchitis to an emergent process such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, or rupture. Furthermore, testicular insult often results in a reactive hydrocele that can both cloud the diagnosis and impair the physical examination. Traditionally, the acute scrotum was managed with immediate exploration, but emergency physicians and urologists have increasingly used Doppler ultrasonography to assess vascular flow, aide in the diagnosis, and ultimately guide triage of those patients who require urgent intervention. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with 2 days of increasing testicular pain and swelling, confirmed to have a large hydrocele with compromised testicular perfusion, and was managed by emergent operative drainage and repair of a "tension hydrocele" with immediate return of testicular perfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tension hydrocele causing intratesticular vascular compromise in a pediatric patient.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^1172qjE3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Scope of application for early pregnancy evaluation in the emergency department — This guideline is intended for physicians working in hospital-based EDs, and applies to stable patients in the first trimester with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding without a previously confirmed intrauterine pregnancy; it does not address patients who are clinically unstable, have had abdominal trauma, or are at higher risk for heterotopic pregnancy such as those undergoing fertility treatments.

### Epididymo-orchitis presenting as bilateral hydrocele in a young adult [^111cC1DJ]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

We present a case of young patient who presented with a progressive scrotal swelling and low-grade fever. An ultrasound of the scrotum revealed multiple small well-defined hypoechoic lesions in both testes with bulky epididymis and bilateral hydrocele. The final diagnosis was confirmed on cytology. The typical imaging findings may help to reach the diagnosis and to plan the further management in such cases.

### The treatment of abdominoscrotal hydrocele: is there a role for nonoperative management? [^117DSgQe]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon entity. Until now, the recommended treatment has been surgical. There is only one successful case of nonoperative management reported in literature. We report the largest series of children with ASH, and provide evidence in support of an initial nonoperative approach.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of patients treated from 1994 to 2015 with ASH at a single institution.

Results

Thirty patients were identified with ASH, with 29 included in the analysis. Nine patients (30%) had operative management with an 80% complication rate. Twenty out of 29 patients (70%) were initially managed expectantly. Sixteen (80%) had resolution of their abdominal component, twelve (60%) of which went on to have full resolution of ASH. Four patients (20%) in this group required operative management of ASH.

Conclusions

ASH should be included in the differential diagnosis of pediatric scrotal swelling. The "Springing Back Ball Sign" should be used as a screening tool. If it is positive, a dynamic ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. We recommend observation as the first step in the management of uncomplicated ASH. It can result in avoidance of operation or at least lower the complication risk significantly if operation is required.

### Hernias and hydroceles [^111UjwSx]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Inguinoscrotal abnormalities in children are best understood by understanding the embryology of testicular descent and the failure of the processus vaginalis to properly obliterate. The inguinal hernia, communicating hydrocele, hydrocele of the spermatic cord, and scrotal hydrocele should be differentiated based on a history and physical examination in most cases, with selective use of ultrasonography. The urgency to surgically correct these entities depends on the nature of the hernia or hydrocele and the likelihood of incarceration or spontaneous resolution. Open standard herniorrhaphy remains the most common surgical approach, and concurrent transinguinal laparoscopy allows quick and accurate inspection of the contralateral internal inguinal ring and the need for bilateral repair of an inguinal hernia.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^114H7Lh8]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for varicocele, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients (evaluation), EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain scrotal ultrasound to detect venous reflux without Valsalva maneuver in the supine and upright position and to discriminate testicular hypoplasia.

### Testicular masses… [^116A69y7]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Later, inflammation may occur and produce a hydrocele, which may make physical examination difficult. The time course from onset to resolution of this condition is usually about two weeks. Referral to a urologist is recommended if the patient presents too late for an accurate physical examination and precise diagnosis, although surgery is not usually indicated. Conservative measures such as scrotal support and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will usually suffice. The scrotum should be transilluminated, since a reactive hydrocele may accompany testicular cancer. Scrotal ultrasonography will help define suspected lesions; testicular ultrasound has proved to be highly reliable in differentiating between intratesticular and extratesticular lesions. Benign Causes of Testicular Masses Hydrocele Mechanism. A hydrocele is a collection of peritoneal fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testicle.

In infants, hydroceles are due to incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis. This communicating hydrocele allows the peritoneal fluid to pass between the peritoneal cavity and the layers of the tunica vaginalis. This defect usually closes spontaneously within the first year of life and requires no specific therapy. A noncommunicating hydrocele presenting in an adult may represent an imbalance in the secretory and absorptive capacities of the layers of the tunica vaginalis, such as from injury or infection causing an inflammatory reaction. It may also accompany testicular neoplasm or torsion. Clinical Presentation. A hydrocele appears as a painless scrotal swelling that can be transilluminated. The swelling may be small and soft before the patient arises in the morning but worsen throughout the day, becoming large and tense. Patients may complain of unilateral weight and bulk. Trauma to the scrotum may cause hemorrhage into the hydrocele sac.

A new hydrocele or one that hemorrhages after minor trauma may signal testicular cancer. In adult males, aspiration of the fluid may be necessary to carefully palpate the testis. A scrotal ultrasound should be considered if the diagnosis is in question, since a reactive hydrocele may occur with a testicular neoplasm. Adults do not require therapy for hydrocele unless complications are present, such as discomfort from the bulky mass or a tense hydrocele that may diminish circulation and lead to atrophy. Trauma to the scrotum may cause hemorrhage into the hydrocele sac.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^113Yd2it]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism — imaging and diagnostic laparoscopy (Guideline Statement 6): Providers should not perform ultrasound (US) or other imaging modalities in the evaluation of boys with cryptorchidism prior to referral, as these studies rarely assist in decision making (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). In experienced hands, more than 70% of cryptorchid testes are palpable and need no imaging, while in the remaining 30% of cases with nonpalpable testis, imaging adds little because US is non-contributory in routine use with sensitivity and specificity to localize nonpalpable testes at 45% and 78%, respectively, and prepubertal intra-abdominal testes are typically not detected by US; CT is precluded by cost and ionizing radiation exposure, and MRI (with or without angiography) has greater sensitivity and specificity but is deterred by cost, low availability, and need for anesthesia. There is no radiological test that can conclude with 100% accuracy that a testis is absent; therefore, surgical exploration such as diagnostic laparoscopy (or open exploration) must be performed on all nonpalpable unilateral and many bilateral cryptorchid patients, with diagnostic laparoscopy the gold standard with high sensitivity and specificity, and preoperative radiological studies may yield misleading information and rarely assist in decision making.

### Report on varicocele and infertility: a committee opinion [^1171UCgb]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for varicocele, more specifically with respect to scrotal imaging, ASRM 2014 guidelines recommend to do not obtain imaging studies for the standard evaluation unless physical examination is inconclusive.

### Idiopathic scrotal hematoma in newborns: a case report and literature review [^112V7ybY]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

While Davenport et al. emphasized the need for surgical exploration to differentiate idiopathic scrotal hematoma from testicular torsion and to drain the hematoma, Yeh et al. raised the question of whether surgery was always necessary, especially in neonatal patients with well-known anesthesia-associated risks. Acknowledging that distinguishing idiopathic scrotal hematoma from testicular torsion can be challenging, they proposed that, unlike testicular torsion, idiopathic scrotal hematoma typically does not present with discoloration in the groin, and the spermatic cord appears normal on palpation. Additionally, they suggested that imaging techniques such as radioisotope testicular scanning and Doppler US could evaluate testicular perfusion, aiding in the differentiation between idiopathic scrotal hematoma and testicular torsion.

In recent decades, significant advancements in US techniques have made it increasingly possible to avoid surgery, with diagnostic accuracy now reaching up to 92%. In addition to the absence of blood flow, indicators of testicular torsion include heterogeneity in echogenicity, thickening of the tunica albuginea, irregular margins, and the presence of hydrocele. Our literature review shows that all patients reported over the past 25 years, including our case, underwent testicular Doppler US, but only three (33%) cases of torsion could not be excluded, requiring exploratory surgery. Some researchers also recommend abdominal US to rule out intra-abdominal causes of acute scrotum, such as intra-abdominal bleeding (particularly adrenal hemorrhage) or perforation (e.g. meconium peritonitis). In our review, abdominal US was performed in 15 out of 16 cases (94%) and was negative in all of them.

Based on a testicular doppler US negative for testicular torsion and an abdominal US negative for intra-abdominal causes of acute scrotum, a diagnosis of idiopathic scrotal hematoma can be made by exclusion. Recent studies in the literature consistently support that in such cases surgery can be avoided and a conservative approach can be safely adopted. Exceptions include compressive hematomas that compromise testicular vascularization and those that become infected. In all cases of conservatively treated cases of idiopathic scrotal hematoma reported in the literature, follow-up examinations have shown normal testicular development.

In conclusion, idiopathic scrotal hematoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum in the neonatal period. Doppler testicular US and abdominal US are usually sufficient to distinguish idiopathic scrotal hematoma from other potential causes, particularly testicular torsion, thereby preventing unnecessary surgical exploration.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® newly diagnosed palpable scrotal abnormality [^114Yknyv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palpable scrotal abnormalities are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from indolent benign conditions to aggressive tumors, and infectious and vascular processes. In these patients the diagnostic workup typically begins with a complete clinical, history, and physical examinations, including analysis of risk factors. If imaging is required, ultrasound examination is the diagnostic modality of choice. In few select patients with very large scrotal masses, MRI may be appropriate. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Emergency ultrasound of the scrotum: a review of the commonest pathologic conditions [^114wm8hZ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the first imaging modality to be performed in emergency conditions of the scrotum. The commonest pathologic entities are divided into the 4 following groups: torsion, trauma, infection, and tumors. Sonographic examination should be performed as soon as possible to ensure fast diagnosis and treatment. Less acute conditions can also be noted while scanning on an emergency basis, such as anatomic variants, hydrocele, oscheocele, clinically evident varicocele, calcifications, etc. Although not threatening for scrotal integrity, they should be assessed during an emergency examination or later on. In this article, complex scrotal anatomy is reviewed and the basic examination technique is described. The commonest emergency conditions are analyzed, along with their pathophysiological basis. Nonemergent entities are also briefly mentioned. Ultrasound images of the commonest emergency conditions are demonstrated.

### Quantification and significance of extraprostatic findings on prostate MRI: a retrospective analysis and three-tier classification [^115qTZ3c]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In CT colonography, the C-RADS classification communicates extracolonic findings and their importance by the E category. We believe that this strategy should be adopted by the PI-RADS classification system as well. A category reporting the absence of EPSs is not necessary (< 5% of patients). We suggest that a three-tier system be adopted. A PI-RADS E1 category should encompass all findings that are frequent and bear no clinical significance such as small hydrocele, mild to moderate diverticulosis, degenerative spine disease, preperitoneal lipoma (fat-containing inguinal hernia), and mild to moderate trabecular hypertrophy of the bladder wall. A PI-RADS E2 category raises the possibility of clinical importance, and the E3 category is imperative for further workup and management (Table 2).

In order to simplify the coding, Yee et al. and Sherrer et al. advocated a two-tiered system that would categorize the findings according to their significance to high clinical significance and low to moderate clinical significance. Cutaia et al. preferred a three-tiered system with non-significant, potentially significant, and significant findings which we also advocate. This system has shown a perfect agreement.

A finding with no clinical importance requires no attention. Further management of significant and potentially significant findings must be considered. First, it is necessary to review the clinical history of the patient, whether the finding is known and has already been negotiated. Second, if the finding is not fully characterized, further tests may be required. Third, the clinical relevance of the finding has to be reviewed through the patient's complaints and his general condition. Fourth, the significance or non-significance of the finding has to be communicated to the patient. Fifth, in complex cases, a multidisciplinary team or a specialist may need to be consulted. Although there are white papers on managing common incidental findings available, further work-up must be contemplated with respect to the expected benefit and harm for a particular patient. Specific recommendations can be made for the most common findings, but their description is beyond the scope of this study and spans multiple specialties.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early-stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^111jvo6T]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

American Urological Association guideline — diagnosis and initial consultation for suspected testicular neoplasm states that a solid mass in the testis identified by physical exam or imaging should be managed as a malignant neoplasm until proven otherwise (Clinical Principle). In a man with a solid mass in the testis suspicious for malignant neoplasm, serum tumor markers (AFP, hCG, and LDH) should be drawn and measured prior to any treatment, including orchiectomy (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Prior to definitive management, patients should be counseled about the risks of hypogonadism and infertility (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) and should be offered sperm banking, when appropriate; in patients without a normal contralateral testis or with known subfertility, this should be considered prior to orchiectomy (Clinical Principle). Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler should be obtained in patients with a unilateral or bilateral scrotal mass suspicious for neoplasm (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Testicular microlithiasis in the absence of solid mass and risk factors for developing a germ cell tumor (GCT) does not confer an increased risk of malignant neoplasm and does not require further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Patients with normal serum tumor markers (hCG and AFP) and indeterminate findings on physical exam or testicular ultrasound for testicular neoplasm should undergo repeat imaging in six to eight weeks (Clinical Principle). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) should not be used in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of a testicular lesion suspicious for neoplasm (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele: a rare cause of a cystic abdominal mass in children [^112G9V8m]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele is a rare cause of cystic lower abdominal masses in children. A timely diagnosis is important because early surgical treatment is curative. Graded compression during the ultrasound evaluation might better demonstrate the communication between the abdominal and scrotal components of the fluid collection, thereby avoiding the use of ionizing radiation and/or the sedation required with alternative imaging modalities.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of scrotal ultrasound examinations [^1163qvxL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Scrotal ultrasound — core imaging protocol specifies that the presence of 2 testes should be documented either on a single transverse, coronal, or coronal oblique image, a cine loop survey scan in both longitudinal and transverse projections can be obtained and stored, and the testes should be evaluated in at least 2 planes: longitudinal and transverse. Transverse images should be obtained in the superior, mid, and inferior portions, and longitudinal views should be obtained centrally as well as medially and laterally. Comparison of the testes is best accomplished with a side-by-side transverse image, and in the event that a testis is not identified within the scrotum, the ipsilateral inguinal canal and inguinal rings should be examined. In cases of acute swelling or pain, some authors suggest that the asymptomatic side should be evaluated first and the symptomatic side afterward with the same/similar grayscale and Doppler settings.

### Clinical and economic value of routine pathological examination of hernia sacs and scheduled clinic follow-ups after inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair in a Canadian tertiary care children's hospital [^116a1Wij]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical and economical value of routine submission of hernia sacs for pathological examination and scheduled clinic follow-ups after inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair has been questioned. Herein, we assessed the institutional variability in these routine practices.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele repair, open or laparoscopically, at our institution from 2015 to 2018.

Results

1181 patients were included (1074 inguinal hernias and 157 hydroceles). Of 531 specimens obtained from 446 (38%) patients, 515 (97%) were normal. 16 (3%) abnormal pathological findings included 7 with mesothelial hyperplasia, 5 with nonfunctional genital ductal remnants, 3 with ectopic adrenal cortical tissues, and 1 epidydimal structure which was not recognized at the time of surgery. 418 (35%) patients had scheduled clinic follow-ups 65 (IQR 46–94) days postoperatively. 44 (4%) patients with unexpected postoperative Emergency Department visits within 30 days of surgery were identified. Only one patient required inpatient treatment, and the rest did not require intervention or admission. The total direct cost of analyzing specimens during the study period was $30,798 CAD ($10,266/year). The average cost to detect a potentially significant finding was $1924.88/specimen and $2053.20/patient.

Conclusions

Routine pathological examination of hernia sacs and scheduled clinic follow-ups were associated with significant costs and predominantly nonsignificant findings. They should therefore be reserved for patients with a high clinical suspicion of injuries/abnormalities or risk factors for potential complications.

Level Of Evidence

This is a level III evidence study.

### Scrotal hydrocele in acute pancreatitis [^1118n8Wy]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a common diagnosis. Although extremely rare, extravasated pancreatic fluid has the potential to third space into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneal space. We report the case of a 33-year-old male with idiopathic subacute pancreatitis who developed acute scrotal pain and swelling. Computer tomography of the abdomen/pelvis revealed tracking of peritoneal fluid into the scrotum consistent with a pancreatic hydrocele, confirmed by ultrasound. He was taken to the operating room for exploration and evacuation of the scrotal hydrocele. This case highlights the importance of active surveillance for the potential development of a scrotal hydrocele in acute pancreatitis.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^114b3aAa]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

### Adolescent varicocele: efficacy of indication-to-treat protocol and proposal of a grading system for postoperative hydroceles [^114HaTjj]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Varicocele is a common urologic anomaly in adolescent males; however, evidence-based treatment guidelines do not exist. Hydroceles are known to be a common complication after surgical therapy, with a wide variation in the reported incidence between 1 and 40%.

Aim

This study aimed to introduce a standardized indication-to-treat protocol and prove its efficacy by analyzing the outcome of patients. Secondly, it aimed to better define postoperative hydroceles because the wide variation of reported incidence is attributed to a lack of definition.

Methods

Our standardized treatment protocol included an initial assessment with clinical grading of varicoceles, ultrasound evaluation of testicular volume, and calculation of the atrophy index. Indications for surgical treatment were testicular volume asymmetry > 20%, discomfort and pain, or bilateral varicocele. The Palomo procedure (laparoscopically since 2005) was the standard procedure. Postoperative hydroceles were graded according to clinical findings and symptoms: Grade I, sonographic chance finding without clinical correlate; Grade II, palpable but clinically insignificant; Grade III, symptomatic. All patients treated according to the defined protocol were prospectively monitored between January 2001 and December 2015.

Results

A total of 129 patients with left varicocele were referred to our institution; 70 fulfilled the indication criteria for surgical treatment. Twenty-eight of these patients were treated for volume asymmetry, 26 of these showed catch-up growth. Forty-two patients were treated for discomfort and pain; the symptoms subsided in all of them. Postoperative hydroceles were detected in 36 patients (51%). In 29 patients this was a sonographic chance finding (Grade I). Three patients showed a palpable but clinically insignificant postoperative hydrocele (Grade II) and four patients (5.7%) showed symptomatic hydrocele (Grade III) where treatment was recommended.

Discussion

The treatment protocol allowed judicious indication for surgery and postoperative outcomes similar to previous reports. The high rate of catch-up growth in operated cases represents a proxy for successful treatment in cases where more precise parameters, like semen quality or paternity rate, were not yet detectable. The introduced grading system for postoperative hydroceles provs to be a valid and appropriate instrument, and promises to be a standardized method for comparing outcomes in future studies.

Conclusion

The indication-to-treat protocol proved to be easily applicable, highly efficient, and have outcomes comparable to international literature. The necessity for a standardized grading of postoperative hydroceles was underscored in the data.

### Hydroceles-not just for men [^114TFQVL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroceles develop in females through the canal of Nuck. This canal is formed when the processes vaginalis fails to obliterate during development. The canal of Nuck can lead to the formation of not only hydroceles, but hernias as well. Although physicians typically think of hydroceles occurring in males, on rare occasions, they do occur in females because of this defect. They are often mistaken for incarcerated hernias, making ultrasound an excellent tool to distinguish between them and guide further treatment.

Case Report

We report a rare case of a 46-year-old female with the chief complaint of a painful groin mass. A diagnosis of a hydrocele was made by point of care ultrasonography in the emergency department after being misdiagnosed by computed tomography scan on two previous occasions. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for emergency physicians and can lead to quick diagnoses and appropriate management of the patient. Using ultrasound in conjunction with other imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. POCUS is portable and a powerful tool for immediate answers, and continues to prove its utility for clinical decision making.

### Atypical testicular pain [^115mcT5R]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Testicular tuberculosis (TB) is rare, and, because of this, the lack of pathognomonic clinical features and its tendency to mimic other commoner conditions, the diagnosis is frequently delayed or may be missed. In this case, the initial clinical presentation was typical for bacterial epididymo-orchitis in a 38-year-old man. When the patient failed to improve with standard treatment including broadening of antibiotics, the diagnosis was re-considered because some unusual signs suggested testicular malignancy or lymphoma. Further, history-taking and subsequent cross-sectional imaging with CT/MRI identified co-existent pulmonary nodularity, thoracic and abdominal lymphadenopathy and bony changes that, together, raised the suspicion of TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed on DNA-based testing of the hydrocele fluid, although standard acid-fast bacilli culture was negative. This case prompted a review of the literature to explore the optimal steps in the investigation and diagnosis of this rare disease.

### Benign intrascrotal lesions [^117MUAhT]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We summarize important clinical, pathological and diagnostic features of benign intrascrotal lesions, including paratesticular lesions (adenomatoid tumors, fibrous pseudotumors, cystadenomas, spermatoceles, hydroceles, varicoceles and hernias) and intratesticular lesions (tunica albuginea cysts, testicular simple cysts, epidermoid cysts, cystic ectasia of the rete testis, intratesticular varicocele, adrenal rest tumors and splenogonadal fusion). This review provides the reader with a better understanding of benign lesions that occur in the scrotum.

Materials and Methods

A directed MEDLINE literature review of benign scrotal lesions and of each individual lesion was performed. This information was enhanced with relevant information from select journals and texts. Particular emphasis was placed on clinical, pathological and diagnostic features.

Results

Intrascrotal lesions continue to provide a diagnostic challenge for physicians. A diagnosis can be made with a thorough history, physical examination and understanding of the pathophysiological processes of the structures contained within the scrotum. Lesions that are suspicious for malignancy should prompt urological consultation and radiological imaging. Ultrasound aids in the diagnosis in instances of uncertainty. Ultimately surgery may be necessary to make a histological diagnosis.

Conclusions

Clinical assessment, physical examination and an understanding of benign intrascrotal processes are key to making a diagnosis. Ultrasound has an important role and adds essential information. If surgery is necessary and a benign process is recognized, a testis sparing procedure should be performed.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

### Prenatal hydrocolpos: imaging findings and differential diagnosis [^1146U4gx]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prenatal hydrocolpos is characterized by fluid distension of the vagina. Hydrocolpos can be caused by multiple underlying etiologies and often demonstrates overlapping imaging features compared to other cystic abdominal and pelvic lesions. The purpose of the current pictorial essay is to provide a systematic prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to differentiating the primary etiologies leading to hydrocolpos. After discussing the fundamental embryological processes involved in vaginal development, the current essay discusses the most common causes of hydrocolpos with their associated prenatal and postnatal imaging features. An approach to distinguishing the more common differential diagnoses is provided. Given the implications of parental counseling and postnatal management, this essay provides an important approach for narrowing differential diagnoses based on prenatal imaging.

### Hemorrhagic abdominoscrotal hydrocele. A challenging entity [^1168C3jG]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is a rare condition in childhood. It presents an intraabdominal portion with homogeneous content that is usually excised through a groin approach. A pale child with a recurrent scrotal hydrocele and a huge solid-cystic retroperitoneal mass is reported. Because the diagnostic workup has not ruled out malignancy, a laparotomy was performed; however, ultimate diagnosis was hemorrhagic ASH. The clinical features and surgical management of ASH are addressed. This entity should be considered in front of tense or recurrent hydroceles or coexistent abdominal mass even though with heterogeneous content.

Acute scrotum is a medical emergency that requires prompt accurate diagnosis to appropriately triage potentially surgical conditions. Numerous differential diagnoses with overlapping clinical presentations make this a diagnostic challenge. Ultrasound is the established first-line imaging modality for acute scrotal disease and can be used to diagnose most scrotal disorders promptly and with high accuracy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112hQ1U4]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114gKuXU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A pediatric hydrocele is a pathologic sac filled with serous fluid beneath the scrotal layer which can develop into both sides of the scrotum, called bilateral hydrocele. Although this type of pathology affects males of all ages, it is also commonly seen in children. Besides, the PH can develop spontaneously in adulthood.

There are two types of hydrocele regarding the pathogenesis process; communicating and non-communicating. In the communicating type, the hydrocele is directly in contact with abdominal fluids through the non-closed canal of spermatic cord; besides, the scrotum appears larger or swollen over time. Although the abdominoscrotal passage is blocked naturally in the non-communicating type of hydrocele in infants, some excess abdominal fluid remains in the scrotum surrounding testes. These types of hydroceles could be present at birth or develop for no apparent reason in the future. Non-communicating hydrocele usually remains in the same size or grows slowly over the time. Obstetric testicular edema is usually present at birth and diagnosed in 5% of cases. Premature newborns (≥ 3 weeks) represent a higher risk of hydrocele.

Risk factors of PH in children include scrotal damage, inflammation, and infection (such as sexually transmitted infection). The main symptom of PH is swelling on one or both sides of scrotum. Generally, the hydrocele is not often lethal along with no side-effects on fertility. However, the PH in children reflects an underlying serious disease such as acute infection or the presence of tumors in testis and inguinal canal, the associated treatment completely depends on the type and severity of disease. Although medicinal check-ups are necessary, no special treatments are advised in many cases (spontaneous disease disappearance).

In PH cases with severe swelling or an underlying disease (such as a hernia), surgical treatment may be required. Also, in cases with persistent hydroceles, further medical examinations are strictly needed. Since the PH can induce reproductive-associated pathologies, comprehensive health-based planning seems necessary to accelerate early diagnosis and reduce un-detected hydrocele. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was designed to determine the global prevalence of PH in infants and children.

### Sonography of pediatric blunt scrotal trauma: what the pediatric urologist wants to know [^116biCp4]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric blunt scrotal trauma is most often the consequence of sports injury and presents a diagnostic challenge because swelling and pain make a scrotal physical exam difficult. US with color flow and duplex Doppler is the first-line imaging modality with the goal of accurate and timely diagnosis of injury requiring surgery to preserve fertility and hormonal function. US imaging findings following blunt scrotal trauma include hydrocele, hematocele, testicular hematoma, testicular fracture, testicular rupture, compromised perfusion/testicular torsion and testicular dislocation. Importantly, several of these findings may coexist. Our goal is to present the pertinent intrascrotal anatomy, US imaging findings for each testicular injury, and contemporary management for each, with emphasis on what our pediatric urology colleagues need to know for optimal patient care.

### Sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunting in an elderly patient [^112bTaSW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An 89-year-old man with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus presented for intractable abdominal bloating and scrotal swelling, for which imaging revealed massive ascites, bilateral hydrocele and small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac, hepatic and renal workup were insignificant. Culture and cytology of ascitic fluid were negative for infection or malignancy. Aetiology of the ascites as secondary to Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the VP shunt was confirmed via ligation of the shunt. Sterile CSF ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele are rare complications of VP shunt for hydrocephalus and are mostly presented in paediatric patients. We report the first known case of concurrent CSF ascites, hydrothorax and hydrocele in an elderly patient. We examine the difficulty of shunt replacement as a diagnostic and treatment modality in this age group and propose the use of reversible shunt ligation as a diagnostic modality.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^1132mW4a]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there are well recognized clinical features associated with classic Kawasaki Disease, there have been increasing numbers of atypical clinical presentations with increased dependence on the American Heart Association diagnostic algorithm for incomplete Kawasaki Disease. Timely diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease can reduce cardiovascular morbidity, thus it is important to consider this diagnosis in a child with prolonged fever and unexplainable inflammatory symptoms. We recommend that for any child with prolonged unexplained fever, Kawasaki Disease should be considered, even if an infective process or cause of the fever has already been identified. Acute hydrocele can also be a clinical feature of Kawasaki Disease, and is possibly related to the underlying systemic inflammatory processes, thus clinicians dealing with diagnostic dilemmas involving inflammatory processes should always consider Kawasaki Disease as a potential differential diagnosis.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113EWQcy]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

According to this study, it is suggested that neonates with congenital hydrocele should be monitored for spontaneous resolution for at least 18 months before surgical intervention, as no hydrocele-associated complications were observed during follow-up period. In contrast, the study conducted by Imaizumi et al. entitled "The prevalence at birth of congenital malformations at a maternity hospital in Osaka City, 1948–1990" provided a broader epidemiological perspective on congenital malformations, including hydroceles. In this study, no special focus on hydrocele outcomes or management strategies was considered. While this study documented various congenital conditions over several decades, it lacked detailed findings on hydroceles and prevalence rates or resolution outcomes like those reported by Osifo and Osaigbovo.

Totally, while Osifo and Osaigbovo's research offered specific insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele in a Nigerian context, Imaizumi et al. contributed to a general understanding of congenital malformations without delving deeply into hydrocele specifics. The studies by Lingaji et al. Chu et al. and Nisale provided valuable insights into the prevalence and management of hydrocele and hernia among children, highlighting different aspects of these conditions. Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip reported a prevalence rate of 2.5% for hydroceles among the surveyed school children. Their findings indicated that hydrocele is often associated with inguinal hernias, emphasizing the need for comprehensive screening in pediatric populations.

In contrast, the study by Chu et al. focused on the management of inguinal hernias rather than hydroceles specifically. This research analyzed data from 3,006 cases and found that individualized treatment strategies significantly reduced recurrence rates in adolescents. While this study not directly address hydrocele, it underscored the importance of tailored surgical approaches in managing related conditions, given that hydroceles can occur alongside hernias. Nisale's study reported a prevalence of 1.7% for hydroceles in their cohort study. This study highlighted the significance of early detection and intervention for both hernias and hydroceles to prevent complications and improve outcomes in pediatric patients.

Overall, while Lingaji and Sambhus Dilip emphasized the prevalence of hydrocele in a specific population, Chu et al. provided insights into surgical management strategies for hernias which may also relate to cases involving hydrocele, and Nisale and Warad contributed additional prevalence data supporting the need for vigilant screening in school-aged children.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^117BX9Ur]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — physical examination: The physical examination should include an abdominal, pelvic, and genital examination, with examination of the external genitalia and scrotum performed to rule out masses, induration, hydrocele, hernia, or cutaneous lesions. A DRE may be performed to evaluate for prostatic nodules or tenderness, including palpating the pelvic floor for the presence and location of PFM tenderness. A focused neurological examination should assess for neurologic causes of pain and should include observation of dermatomal distribution of pain, patient posture, and gait, at minimum.

### Sonographic evaluation of inguinal lesions [^116X9qwM]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in the inguinal region are varied. The most common abnormality in the inguinal region is the hernia: direct or indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. There are many hernia-mimicking lesions, such as spermatic cord hydrocele, undescended testis, hematoma, inflammation, abscess, benign or malignant tumors, metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement, round ligament varicosities or mesothelial cyst, and herniated ovary. Ultrasonography is currently the primary imaging modality used in assessing inguinal lesions and helpful for the differential diagnosis of a broad spectrum of these diseases. Familiarity with clinical setting and certain ultrasonography details will facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### The nontraumatic, acute scrotum [^114RR9oX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Regardless of age, any presentation of an acute scrotum requires prompt triage and immediate evaluation. The potential for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality exists if timely diagnosis and treatment are provided. Often overlooked, an early scrotal examination in the emergency department may produce the most accurate information into the underlying pathologic process, be it systemic or localized to the scrotum. Although the immediately lethal conditions presenting as acute scrotal pain should be considered, the combined incidence and morbidity associated with testicular torsion make its exclusion paramount in acute scrotal presentations. Similarly, a painless scrotal mass must be assumed to be a testicular neoplasm until proven otherwise, with appropriate work-up and rapid urologic follow-up assured.

### A review of classification, diagnosis, and management of hydrocele [^1138yjxp]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes and updates a number of issues related to hydrocele including anatomy, embryology, classification, etiology, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and management. Hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serous fluid between the parietal and visceral layers arising from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testis and spermatic cord directly. Hydroceles result from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles can be divided into two types as primary and secondary. The diagnosis should be based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and imaging studies. Understanding the causes and types of hydroceles is useful for accurately diagnosing and treatment strategy. Hydroceles can be managed by conservative treatment, fluid aspiration, or hydrocelectomy.

### Scrotal masses [^114CB4wZ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: is less more? [^113htRiW]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.

Patients and Method

We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.

Results

Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1–14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3–11.2) follow-up.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.

Initial management — diagnosis and initial consultation recommends that a solid mass in the testis identified by physical exam or imaging should be managed as a malignant neoplasm until proven otherwise (Clinical Principle). In a man with a solid mass suspicious for malignant neoplasm, serum tumor markers (AFP, hCG, and LDH) should be drawn and measured prior to any treatment, including orchiectomy (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Prior to definitive management, patients should be counseled about the risks of hypogonadism and infertility and should be offered sperm banking, when appropriate, and in patients without a normal contralateral testis or with known subfertility, this should be considered prior to orchiectomy (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C; Clinical Principle). Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler should be obtained in patients with a unilateral or bilateral scrotal mass suspicious for neoplasm (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Testicular microlithiasis in the absence of solid mass and risk factors for developing a germ cell tumor does not confer an increased risk of malignant neoplasm and does not require further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Patients with normal serum tumor markers (hCG and AFP) and indeterminate findings on physical exam or testicular ultrasound for testicular neoplasm should undergo repeat imaging in six to eight weeks (Clinical Principle). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) should not be used in the initial evaluation and diagnosis of a testicular lesion suspicious for neoplasm (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Does color Doppler sonography improve the clinical assessment of patients with acute scrotum? [^111rnJWQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Our experience concerning the use of color Doppler sonography (CDS) in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum is reported.

Material and Methods

From July 2000 to July 2005, 155 patients (median 17.2 years) were admitted with a diagnosis of acute scrotum (unilateral in 150 cases, bilateral in 5). Along with a careful anamnesis and the physical exam, all patients underwent a CDS study of the scrotal content using a sonograph GE Logiq 500 with a multifrequency (7.5–10 MHz) linear probe Small Part. The following CDS parameters were evaluated: intensity of the color-power signal on the testicular parenchyma and on the epididymis; systolic peak velocity (SPV) and telediastolic velocity (TDV) in correspondence of the gonadal hilum. Ultrasound and flowmetry parameters registered on the painful testis were compared with those registered on the healthy controlateral testis. The reduction/absence versus the increase of color-power signal in the parenchyma and the reduction/absence versus the increase of SPV and TDV in the centripetal intratesticular arteries were considered presumptive of testicular torsion versus orchiepididymitis.

Results

The results only refer to the 150 patients (300 testis) with acute monolateral scrotum. The clinical picture and the physical exam suggested a torsion of the spermatic cord in 40 cases, a spontaneous de-torsion in 5, an orchiepididymitis in 80, a blunt scrotal trauma in 15, a bulky epididymal cyst or a hydrocele in 4 and a testicular pain of unknown etiology in the remaining 6 cases. Standard US was pathological in 95 patients (63.3%); CDS was pathologic in 70 patients and in 42 of them suggested a testicular torsion. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical exploration: among 42 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of testicular torsion, the diagnosis was confirmed in 22 cases, no anomaly was found in 16 cases and in 4 patients a torsion of testicular appendix was found. The rupture of the tunica albuginea was present in six out of seven patients submitted to surgical exploration for previous blunt trauma and the sonographic diagnosis of hematocele was documented in all cases. The single false-negative diagnosis of testicular torsion in CDS occurred in an 18-month-old child. In presence of funicular torsion, the sensitivity and specificity of physical exam and CDS were 100% versus 95.7% and 86.5% versus 85.3%, respectively; sensitivity and specificity of SPV, TDV and color-Doppler signal on the testis were 100% and 94.8% versus 100% and 90.1% versus 95.7% and 90.8%. In the pre-operative assessment of scrotal trauma, the B-mode US showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively; the color Doppler analysis has not supplied with additional elements for planning a surgical exploration. In presence of orchiepididymitis, the sensitivity and specificity of the physical exam in association to CDS was equal to 100%. In all patients with torsion of the testicular appendix, physical exam and CDS parameters were within normal limits.

Discussion and Conclusions

In our experience CDS is an indispensable imaging modality for the clinical assessment of patients with acute scrotum; however, the informations it can afford are operator-dependent and have to be supported by the history and physical exam of the patient. CDS findings constitute probably an important medico-legal support when the necessity of surgical exploration is excluded; anyway, in presence of a clinical suspicion of testicular torsion, even with an apparently normal CDS, the surgical exploration is recommended.

### Identifying the deceiver: the non-neoplastic mimickers of genital system neoplasms [^115Wav5Y]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Paratesticular region

The paratesticular region includes the spermatic cord, epididymis, tunica vaginalis and embryological remnants. While the majority of intratesticular lesions are malignant, a vast majority of paratesticular lesions are benign. Therefore, accurate determination of the lesion location is of great importance for correct patient management.

On US, it is important to be aware of tumor mimickers in this area to prevent any unnecessary surgical or medical intervention. Conditions such as scrotal hernia, hematocele, epididymitis, and testicular appendage torsion can frequently present with a paratesticular mass. However the differential diagnosis of these conditions with their clinical and radiological features is generally straightforward (Fig. 21). On the other hand, some rare inflammatory diseases and congenital anomalies involving paratesticular region may cause diagnostic confusion.

Physical examination revealed left testicular tenderness and a small, firm scrotal mass. a Gray scale US image shows a round mildly heterogeneous solid-appearing extratesticular lesion adjacent to the upper pole of left testis (arrowheads). Minimal hydrocele and scrotal wall thickening were also noticed on US. b Color flow Doppler US shows the absence of vascularity within the lesion (asterisk). As clinical history was more suggestive for torsion of the appendix testis, the patient was placed on supportive treatment. He responded well to treatment, and his symptoms completely resolved within a week

### Sonography of female genital hernias presenting as labia majora masses [^111HCS2f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Inguinal herniation of the ovary or uterus presenting as a labia majora mass is a rare congenital condition that may be complicated by strangulation, torsion, and infertility. A labial mass in a prepubertal female patient can represent an inguinal hernia, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, a congenital labial cyst, leiomyoma, an abscess, lipoma, or lymphangioma. With a large differential diagnosis and an often limited physical examination, imaging plays an importance diagnostic role. We present 3 cases in which a labial mass contained an ovary alone and both ovaries and the uterus. We demonstrate sonographic findings and discuss the utility of sonography in the diagnosis of genital hernias and in detecting potential complications.

### Sonography of the scrotum: from appendages to scrotolithiasis [^117SjP4L]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In this pictorial essay, we review and discuss the varying morphologic characteristics of scrotal appendages and calculi. Characteristic sonograms obtained from patients with coexisting hydrocele are presented, and recent literature is included. Hydrocele greatly facilitates the imaging of these intrascrotal structures, as it acts as a "water path". On the one hand, torsion of a scrotal appendage should always be included in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum, especially in children. On the other hand, scrotolithiasis may occasionally cause mild discomfort. As a consequence, and given the widespread use of sonography for the evaluation of both acute and chronic conditions of the scrotum, radiologists should be familiar with these entities.

### Misdiagnosis of scrotal and retroperitoneal lymphangioma in children [^114f4LAa]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Painless scrotal masses are usually benign, but a few are malignant, such as sarcomas. Scrotal lymphangiomas are uncommon benign masses of the scrotum caused by inadequate drainage of isolated lymphatic vessels, often presenting as a painless mass that grows gradually over time. Masses in the subcutaneous tissue of the scrotum are not linked to the spermatic cord and may show invasive growth, low tension, and unclear borders and are thus often confused with hernia, hydrocele, and varicocele. If the cyst hemorrhages (spontaneously or after trauma), inflammation occurs, or the balance between lymphatic production and drainage is disrupted, the initially painless mass can suddenly and rapidly enlarge, leading to the acute onset of pain, and potential misdiagnosis of acute testicle torsion. Abdominal scrotal lymphangiomas in children are mostly cystic soft tissue masses. Ultrasound is superior to CT for observing the internal structure of the lesion, which shows subcutaneous mesh occupying behind the testis. Color Doppler flow imaging can also indicate low-velocity venous blood-flow signals on the cyst wall of the scrotal lymphangioma and the inner compartment. If the cyst bleeds, light spots may be seen floating in the dark area. If the doctor notes other symptoms besides scrotal swelling, such as skin abnormalities, a large lump that does not change with body posture and a lobular appearance, ultrasound examination should be performed. If ultrasound examination reveals multilocular cystic masses in the inguinal area or the scrotum, the abdominal and pelvic cavity should be routinely scanned and imaging examinations such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging are also recommended. Puncture can also be used to aid diagnosis: the puncture fluid from lymphangiomas growing in deep soft tissue is light yellow, but this becomes dark red and non-coagulated when combined with internal bleeding. The gold standard for diagnosis is pathological examination. Lymphangiomas are often covered with squamous epithelium, smooth muscle fibers, blood vessels, fat, and lymphoid tissues, and immunohistochemical staining for D2–40 is mostly positive.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dmMvK]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric hydrocele (PH) is a curable pathology which can lead to early treatment and complete removal of complications following on-time diagnosis by an experienced delivery team. Untreated hydrocele can eventually lead to infertility. Currently, there are no single global statistics available regarding the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele; thus, it seems that presentation of a valid report in this regard causes the awareness of medical staff and health policymakers. This study was designed to present the global prevalence of PH in two groups of infants and children. The results of this meta-analysis study (statistical population of 349,558 cases) showed that the global prevalence of this disease in infants and children is 1 per 1000 and 3.4 per 1000, respectively. The findings showed that by the age (from infancy to childhood), the rate of pediatric hydrocele increases. This finding represented late or no diagnosis of PH pathology during labor or a few days post-labor. It is also suggested that multiple environmental factors can lead to the occurrence of PH in the post-infant period.

Provision of health solutions for early diagnosis of PH pathology seems a critical approach. Hydrocele in infants is a benign condition commonly disappears with no treatment. However, in persistent cases beyond infancy, careful screening is essential to determine the need for surgical intervention. The exact report of hydrocele's prevalence and ongoing management strategies emphasizes the importance of pediatric surveillance in early childhood health care. The studies conducted by Osifo and Osaigbovo and Imaizumi et al. provided important insights regarding the prevalence and special characteristics of hydrocele in infants, albeit from different geographical and clinical contexts. Osifo and Osaigbovo in a study entitled "Congenital hydrocele: prevalence and outcome among male children who underwent neonatal circumcision in Benin City, Nigeria" found that among 2,715 male neonates circumcised, 4.7% were diagnosed with hydrocele. This study highlighted that 83.4% of the diagnosed cases resolved spontaneously by the age of 18 months, with peak resolution occurring between 4–6 months.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^116foA4o]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There have been previous reports on hydroceles with cases of patients with Kawasaki Disease. Kabani et al. described three patients with atypical Kawasaki Disease and communicating hydrocele, and Sacco et al. described an additional case of hydrocele that developed at onset of typical Kawasaki Disease. A hydrocele can be produced by excessive fluid production within the scrotal sac, defective absorption of fluid, interference with lymphatic drainage of the testicle and scrotum, or by a direct connection with the peritoneal cavity. The majority of hydroceles present at birth, and are due to the presence of a patent processus vaginalis, which usually close spontaneously by 12 months. The mechanism of sudden processus vaginalis opening in acute Kawasaki Disease remains unknown, although it is postulated that the inflammatory process of Kawasaki Disease can contribute to this process. This is supported by case reports of hydroceles developing in testicular infections, with Chesney et al. describing a small hydrocele secondary to Haemophilus influenza type B. Jibiki et al. have nicely summarized case reports into a table, demonstrating the association of Kawasaki Disease with acute scrotum. This suggests that although the incidence of acute scrotum in patients with Kawasaki Disease is unknown, careful observation may identify additional patients with Kawasaki Disease.

In a 2014 study by Xu et al. that studied the trend of C-reactive protein (CRP) in paediatric patients with urinary tract infections pre- and post- antibiotic treatment after 24 h, the pre- and post- treatment CRP levels were 68.17 +/− 39.42 and 26.13 +/− 14.15 mg/L respectively. The significant difference in CRP before and after treatment in the study (P < 0.05) shows that CRP can be used for observing pathogenesis and curative effect. In our patient, CRP downtrended at a slower rate from 294.4 mg/L on day 4 to 90.2 mg/L on day 9, suggesting the possibility of a separate ongoing inflammatory process.

The child in our case only had 1 additional compatible clinical criterion (rash) in addition to fever of more than 5 days duration. However, in view of the presentation of an acute hydrocele, further investigations were conducted to evaluate for Kawasaki Disease. This eventually led to the diagnosis of incomplete Kawasaki Disease, hence facilitating the timely administration of intravenous immunoglobulin prior to day 10 of fever.

### Management of hydrocele in adolescent patients [^111Zu1Vh]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hydrocele is defined as an abnormal collection of serous fluid in the potential space between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis. In the majority of affected adolescents, hydrocele is acquired and is idiopathic in origin. The pathogenesis of idiopathic hydrocele is thought to be an imbalance in the normal process of fluid production and reabsorption. The diagnosis is usually clinical. Taking a thorough history is essential to rule out any fluctuation in size, which is an indication of a patent processus vaginalis. Scrotal ultrasonography is mandatory in nonpalpable testicles to rule out a subtending testicular solid mass requiring inguinal exploration. Otherwise, open hydrocelectomy via a scrotal incision is the standard treatment of idiopathic hydroceles. The second most common cause of hydrocele in adolescents is varicocelectomy. The risk of hydrocele formation is higher with non-artery-sparing procedures or those performed without microsurgical aid, and in surgery requiring cord dissection. If hydrocele occurs after varicocelectomy, initial management should include observation with or without hydrocele aspiration. Large persistent hydroceles are best served by open hydrocelectomy.

Among the most important limitations of the present study, is the limited number of investigations conducted in infants and children was noticed causing higher confidence limits with higher heterogeneity. Also, most of the studies were conducted in Asia and Africa, and no studies were found in Europe or America causing reduced geographical diversity.

Conclusions

SRL in children is a rare disease and its non-specific clinical manifestations lead to a high risk of its misdiagnosis among patients with scrotum masses as non-SRL conditions, including hydrocele and incarcerated inguinal oblique hernia. It is therefore necessary to obtain a detailed and accurate medical history and carry out careful physical examination, imaging, surgery, and pathological tests to make an accurate diagnosis. Unilocular peritoneal scrotal lymphangioma can be resected directly and completely under laparoscopy, while sclerotherapy is a safe and effective method for patients with multilocular lymphangioma.

Scrotal masses can represent a wide range of medical issues, from benign congenital conditions to life-threatening malignancies and acute surgical emergencies. Having a clear understanding of scrotal anatomy allows the examiner to accurately identify most lesions. Benign lesions such as hydroceles and varicoceles are often found incidentally by the patient or physician on routine examination. Epididymitis is bacterial in origin, readily diagnosed on physical examination, and treated with antibiotics. Indirect inguinal hernias usually are palpable separate from the normal scrotal contents and are a surgical emergency if strangulation is suspected based on symptoms of abdominal pain, tenderness, and nonreducibility. Testicular swelling may be caused by orchitis, cancer, or testicular torsion. Orchitis is usually viral in origin, subacute in onset, and may be accompanied by systemic illness. Testicular carcinomas are more gradual in onset; the testis will be nontender on examination. Testicular torsion has an acute onset, often with no antecedent trauma; the involved testis may be retracted and palpably rotated, and will be tender on examination. The swollen testis is always a true emergency. Although history and examination may suggest the diagnosis, testicular torsion can be reliably confirmed only with color Doppler ultrasonography, which must be obtained immediately. If torsion is suspected, surgical consultation should be obtained concurrently with ultrasonography, because the ability to successfully salvage the affected testis declines dramatically after six hours of torsion.
