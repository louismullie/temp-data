## Question

all labs were normal in polyarthralgia work up. next step?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do next when all laboratory tests are normal in the workup for polyarthralgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the pain is truly articular and whether inflammatory features are present. Then, I should verify the pattern of joint involvement and extra-articular features. Next, I will consider imaging to detect subclinical synovitis when suspicion persists. After that, I need to check for mimics and special contexts such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, post-viral syndromes, and fibromyalgia. Finally, I will outline referral thresholds, follow-up intervals, and documentation elements to ensure nothing is missed.

> Let me first confirm the basics: is the pain truly articular rather than periarticular or referred, and are there inflammatory features such as morning stiffness, warmth, swelling, or tenderness that would suggest synovitis, because normal labs do not exclude inflammatory arthritis and clinical assessment alone has limited diagnostic accuracy in early disease [^1124uUZ4] [^111SQgwx] [^114phRLv].

> Wait, let me verify the distribution and symmetry, since symmetric small-joint involvement raises concern for rheumatoid arthritis, axial symptoms point toward spondyloarthritis, and large-joint predominance with girdle pain in older adults suggests polymyalgia rheumatica, even when serologies are negative early on [^1124uUZ4] [^115Fi4XQ].

> I should double-check extra-articular clues such as rash, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, sicca, uveitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, diarrhea, urethritis, or ocular symptoms, because these can pivot the differential toward psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or other systemic inflammatory diseases even with normal initial labs [^1124uUZ4] [^116FyHN4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on seronegativity. I need to ensure I have actually obtained the right serologies for the suspected phenotype, including RF and anti-CCP for RA, ANA with a focused panel if lupus is suspected, and HLA-B27 if spondyloarthritis is on the table, recognizing that early disease can be seronegative and that normal inflammatory markers do not rule out inflammatory arthritis [^1124uUZ4] [^114phRLv].

> Next, I should review imaging because normal labs do not exclude synovitis. Musculoskeletal ultrasound can detect subclinical synovitis and tenosynovitis and meaningfully increases diagnostic accuracy beyond history and exam, while conventional radiographs can show early erosions or osteoarthritis changes, and MRI or FDG-PET/CT can reveal occult inflammatory arthropathy when suspicion remains high despite negative standard tests [^111SQgwx] [^1124uUZ4] [^1168PEeh].

> Let me consider mimics and special contexts systematically. I need to check for fibromyalgia when pain is widespread with hyperalgesia and normal inflammatory markers, consider immune checkpoint inhibitor–related inflammatory arthritis or polymyalgia-like syndromes in oncology patients, and remember post-viral reactive arthritis including after COVID-19, all of which can present with polyarthralgia and normal routine serologies [^113RTssR] [^115NVXQH] [^1119JqWg] [^113zP8Mn].

> I should confirm whether the patient meets features of clinically suspect arthralgia at risk for RA, because combining clinical features with ACPA and imaging improves prediction of progression. If suspicion persists, early rheumatology referral is warranted even without definitive classification criteria, given the window of opportunity for early intervention [^114EbJdZ] [^117FR52n] [^112y78mE].

> But wait, what if the patient is older than 50 with shoulder and pelvic girdle pain and high inflammatory markers? I need to ensure I do not miss polymyalgia rheumatica and its association with giant cell arteritis, and I should obtain RF and anti-CCP to help distinguish PMR from seronegative RA, with imaging such as ultrasound or MRI considered when the diagnosis is uncertain or atypical [^113N8fb9] [^115Fi4XQ].

> I will now examine the need for synovial fluid analysis if any single joint is disproportionately swollen or hot, because arthrocentesis with crystal analysis, Gram stain, and culture remains essential to exclude infection or crystal disease when the presentation is atypical or acute, even if other labs are normal [^1124uUZ4] [^116RqpmU].

> Let me think about follow-up cadence. If inflammatory features are absent and suspicion is low, I should reassess in 3 to 6 months, but if there are inflammatory features or high-risk features for RA, I should arrange rheumatology referral within 2 to 4 weeks and avoid starting immunosuppression empirically without a tissue diagnosis or specialist input, documenting joint counts, functional impact, and extra-articular features at each visit [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked systemic inflammatory mimics such as adult-onset Still's disease in a young adult with spiking fevers, rash, and very high ferritin, or ANCA-associated vasculitis when there is multisystem involvement. In such cases, targeted labs and imaging, and often urgent specialty referral, are indicated despite normal initial screening tests [^1152NyJG] [^112mDBpb].

> In summary, when polyarthralgia workup shows normal labs, I need to ensure I return to the bedside to recharacterize the pain phenotype, add targeted serologies and imaging to uncover subclinical synovitis, actively search for mimics and special contexts, and escalate to rheumatology referral when inflammatory features persist or risk for RA is high, because early detection changes outcomes even when initial tests are unrevealing [^1124uUZ4] [^111SQgwx] [^112y78mE].

---

When all labs are normal in a polyarthralgia workup, the next step is to **reassess the history and physical exam** to distinguish inflammatory from non-inflammatory pain and identify subtle synovitis or periarticular findings [^1124uUZ4] [^114pobUv]. If suspicion for inflammatory arthritis persists, obtain **ultrasound or MRI** to detect subclinical synovitis or erosions that labs can miss [^1124uUZ4] [^1168PEeh]. If imaging is normal and symptoms are non-inflammatory, consider fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, or soft-tissue disorders and manage conservatively with education, exercise, and analgesia [^114f8gKA] [^115hPey4]. Escalate to rheumatology if symptoms persist, evolve, or new red flags arise [^112y78mE].

---

## Clinical reassessment

### Detailed history

- **Inflammatory features**: Morning stiffness > 30 minutes, swelling, warmth, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue) [^1124uUZ4].
- **Joint distribution**: Symmetric vs asymmetric, small vs large joints, axial involvement [^114pobUv].
- **Extra-articular manifestations**: Skin, eyes, mucosa, GI, GU, neuropsychiatric symptoms [^111oEEBP].
- **Functional impact**: ADLs, work, sleep, psychosocial factors [^113DmWoS].

---

### Focused physical examination

On focused physical examination, **joint examination** should assess for synovitis, tenderness, warmth, swelling, and range of motion, while **extra-articular examination** should evaluate for rashes, nodules, nail changes, ocular inflammation, and neurologic deficits [^1124uUZ4] [^114pobUv].

---

## Imaging studies

If clinical suspicion for inflammatory arthritis persists despite normal labs, **imaging is the next step** to detect subclinical synovitis or early erosive disease [^111SQgwx].

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) | Suspected inflammatory arthritis, early RA, synovitis | Synovial hypertrophy, joint effusions, power Doppler signal, erosions [^116tBBP3] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | Suspected early inflammatory arthritis, axial involvement, soft tissue assessment | Synovitis, bone marrow edema, erosions, soft tissue inflammation [^1124uUZ4] [^1168PEeh] |
| Plain radiography | Chronic symptoms, suspected degenerative changes | Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, erosions (late findings) [^notfound] |

---

## Consideration of non-inflammatory etiologies

If imaging is normal and clinical features suggest non-inflammatory pain, consider:

- **Fibromyalgia**: Widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive symptoms, tender points [^112pWusf].
- **Osteoarthritis**: Degenerative joint disease, typically older patients, localized pain, crepitus [^1124uUZ4].
- **Soft tissue disorders**: Tendinopathy, bursitis, myofascial pain syndromes [^116tBBP3].
- **Functional pain syndromes**: Chronic pain syndromes, psychosocial contributors [^112pWusf].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary approach** may involve:

- **Physical therapy**: Exercise, joint protection, functional rehabilitation [^notfound].
- **Pain management**: Analgesics, NSAIDs, topical agents, non-pharmacologic interventions [^notfound].
- **Psychology**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management, coping strategies [^notfound].
- **Rheumatology**: Ongoing monitoring, escalation if symptoms evolve or new features arise [^115tsEiB].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to track symptom evolution and detect emerging inflammatory features; **patient education** should emphasize red flags and when to seek care [^113N8fb9]. Re-evaluation should be pursued if new symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities develop [^113RTssR].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral to rheumatology is indicated when:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Ongoing pain despite conservative management [^1169R1EL].
- **Evolution of symptoms**: New inflammatory features, joint swelling, systemic symptoms [^116FyHN4].
- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Complex presentations requiring specialist input [^115tsEiB].
- **Patient preference**: Request for specialist evaluation [^notfound].

---

When labs are normal in polyarthralgia, **prioritize clinical reassessment and targeted imaging** to uncover inflammatory disease or alternative diagnoses, then apply conservative management and multidisciplinary care, with rheumatology referral if symptoms persist or evolve [^1124uUZ4] [^111SQgwx].

Investigations

Dentist assessment and management

The initial impression was myofascial pain or capsulitis. A thorough workup including a physical exam, imaging (panoramic radiograph, cone-beam CT, MRI) and lab tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor ruled out fractures, inflammation, arthritis and rheumatological disease (figures1 3). Consultations with a rheumatologist, adult ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, neurologist and physiotherapist ensured a multidisciplinary evaluation. The ENT specialist diagnosed otitis media, unrelated to the primary concern.

Medications were prescribed for pain management. Meloxicam 15 mg/day and baclofen 10 mg/day were prescribed for 2 weeks with a follow-up appointment scheduled. After 2 weeks, the patient reported mild improvement.

After 2 weeks, and the symptoms did not improve, the medication regimen continued, but a left pterygoid muscle injection (0.3 mm mepivacaine) was added. However, regular physiotherapy over 2 months yielded no improvement. The patient then experienced a flare-up with worsening pain, decreased and altered mouth opening, and a new red rash on her left cheek. 2 months later, a more aggressive treatment plan was implemented: increased medication frequency (meloxicam, three times a day, baclofen at bedtime (HS), the addition of amitriptyline (three times a day) and bilateral Botox injections to the masseters and temporalis muscles. Unfortunately, despite normal MRI findings, the patient reported no improvement after 2 weeks, including a new allodynia over the affected area (pain from non-painful stimuli). Thus, a referral to a pain rehabilitation team was initiated.

Differentiating arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA from other arthralgias

Before reviewing the accuracy of different types of predictors, appreciation of the population studied is important. Arthralgia is a non-specific symptom and the biological nature of joint pain is diverse. Consequently, the risk to progress to RA is different for patients with arthralgia in different settings.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms are very prevalent in primary care. Primary care data from the Netherlands suggest an annual incidence of non-traumatic MSK symptoms of ~300/1000. In other words, almost one-third of the population visits the general practitioner (GP) at least once a year with an MSK symptom. The vast majority of these patients have explanations for their joint symptoms other than the beginning of a systemic inflammatory arthritis, and inflammatory arthritis is considered by GPs in only a minority of patients (figure 3). A separate Dutch GP study recorded an incidence of suspected arthritis of ~3/1000/year; most patients had a monoarthritis, and 60% had self-limiting symptoms. A small proportion of patients had suspected oligoarthritis or polyarthritis, and symptom persistence was more common in this group. These data support the notion that GPs are able to differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory cases of MSK symptoms and that the incidence of suspected inflammatory arthritis in primary care is low.

Figure 3
Clinical expertise of GPs and rheumatologists in differentiating patients with arthralgia. This figure is constructed based on the following references: The clinical expertise of GPs and rheumatologists is effective in differentiating patients with arthralgia; of all patients with MSK symptoms visiting their GPs (~300/1000/year), only a small subset is suspected for arthritis (~3/1000/year). Of all patients with any MSK symptoms visiting secondary care (~8/1000/year), only 7% were identified as CSA. The incidence of any MSK symptom in secondary care is higher than the incidence of patients with suspected arthritis in primary care, as GPs also refer patients with MSK symptoms in whom they did not suspect arthritis to be present. 74% of patients with CSA had a positive EULAR definition.CSA, clinically suspect arthralgia; GP, general practitioner; EULAR, European League Against Rheumatism; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; MSK, musculoskeletal symptoms.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123cHWZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue and a wide array of multisystem comorbidities. Prevalence is estimated to be 0.8 percent worldwide, with women twice as likely to develop the disease as men. Untreated, 20 to 30 percent of persons with rheumatoid arthritis become permanently work-disabled within two to three years of diagnosis. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in pathogenesis. Although laboratory testing and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis and track disease progress, rheumatoid arthritis primarily is a clinical diagnosis and no single laboratory test is diagnostic. Complications of rheumatoid arthritis may begin to develop within months of presentation; therefore, early referral to or consultation with a rheumatologist for initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. Several promising new disease-modifying drugs recently have become available, including leflunomide, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and anakinra. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and nonpharmacologic modalities also are useful. Patients who do not respond well to a single disease-modifying drug may be candidates for combination therapy. Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease, although patients can go into remission. Physicians must be aware of common comorbidities. Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is monitored according to American College of Rheumatology criteria based on changes in specific symptoms and laboratory findings. Predictors of poor outcomes in early stages of rheumatoid arthritis include low functional score early in the disease, lower socioeconomic status, early involvement of many joints, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level at disease onset, positive rheumatoid factor, and early radiologic changes.

### Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art [^117FR52n]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 4
EULAR-defined characteristics describing arthralgia at risk for RA. The reported AUC, sensitivity and specificity were calculated within newly presenting patients with CSA in outpatient clinics of European expert rheumatologists (who were part of the task force who defined arthralgia at risk for RA) with clinical expertise as reference. A sensitive definition requires the presence of at least three items and a specific definition requires the presence of at least four items. AUC, area under the curve; EULAR, European League Against Rheumatism; MCP, metacarpophalangeal; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; sens, sensitivity; spec, specificity; UA, undifferentiated arthritis.

Altogether, patients with arthralgia in secondary care who are considered as CSA and fulfil the EULAR definition of arthralgia represent a very small proportion of all individuals suffering from joint pain (figure 3). An optimised selection of patients with arthralgia will result in an increased risk of RA in the population, and — as a result of Bayes' theorem — this will also result in higher post-test chances when performing additional tests, such as laboratory or imaging tests, in this subset of patients with arthralgia.

### The ability of rheumatologists blinded to prior workup to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis only by clinical assessment: a cross-sectional study [^111SQgwx]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to study the ability of board-certified rheumatologists, blinded to all prior diagnostic test results, to establish the presence/absence of an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD) or RA among polyarthralgia or arthritis patients, solely relying on clinical assessment.

Methods

We performed a prospective, examiner-blinded, cross-sectional study documenting the diagnostic work in four sequential steps (medical history, physical examination, musculoskeletal ultrasonography and laboratory tests) of board-certified rheumatologists in a convenience cohort of 100 patients referred for inpatient diagnostic workup to a tertiary care rheumatology centre.

Results

The ability to correctly identify patients with or without an IRD (diagnostic accuracy) increased from 27% after the clinical assessment to 53% after the ultrasonography and to 70% after taking laboratory test results into account. The corresponding values for correctly identifying patients with or without RA were 19, 42 and 60%, respectively. Therefore the diagnostic accuracy of solely clinical assessment for determining the diagnosis of IRD or RA compared with the diagnosis established by a consecutive thorough in-patient workup was only 27 and 19% in our cohort, respectively. Pretreatment with corticosteroids (in the prior 7 days) vs none did not alter these results substantially (20 vs 29% for IRD, 15% vs 20% for RA).

Conclusion

Experienced rheumatologists, if deprived of information on prior external imaging and laboratory workup by blinding, were not able to correctly classify the majority of patients presenting with polyarthralgia or arthritis symptoms for inpatient workup, relying only on a brief symptom-focused medical history and physical examination.

### Fever, joint pain, and systemic inflammation in a young adult: recognising adult-onset Still's disease [^116L3RVJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A young man presented with recurrent high-spiking fevers, diffuse arthralgia, hepatomegaly and a transient salmon-coloured rash. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, markedly elevated inflammatory markers and extreme hyperferritinaemia. Extensive infectious and autoimmune workups were negative. The patient met Yamaguchi criteria for adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and responded well to corticosteroids and biologic therapy with canakinumab. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of AOSD and the importance of early consideration in patients with systemic inflammation and prolonged fever who have negative infectious and autoimmune testing.

Table 3.
Advanced diagnostic workup of a patient with unidentified Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia to be considered after basic testing (peripheral blood film, hemoglobin electrophoresis, etc.). Often many of these tests will be indicated in such a patient and may be obtained in a stepwise fashion to diagnose the underlying disorder. Our consensus stepwise approach is given in Figure 1.

Figure 3.
Our consensus, stepwise approach to laboratory workup of a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia. The initial workup includes hemolysis testing performed routinely. The second-pass workup is intended to rule out relatively common inherited entities (including hemoglobinopathies not identified in the initial workup) as well as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, particularly relevant if the patient presents in adulthood. The third-pass workup allows for identification of pyruvate kinase deficiency and red cell membrane abnormalities not diagnosed in prior steps. If this three-step workup is unrevealing, additional testing is recommended to diagnose particularly rare inherited and acquired causes of hemolytic anemia. The diagnostician may narrow or broaden the workup at each step as appropriate and as testing is available; for example, molecular PKLR and KLF1 testing can be reasonably performed earlier in the workup. Additionally, the clinician should be aware that many specialized tests are poorly standardized between laboratories. a Deficiency may result in a hemolytic picture due to ineffective erythropoiesis; folate may be low in chronic hereditary anemias due to rapid cell turnover. b Allows identification of most hemoglobinopathies.

### Approach to a patient with monoarticular disease [^111GVLTH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To reassess the diagnostic approach to a patient with a monoarticular disease in light of the up-to-date medical literature and to examine the practical utility of traditional and newer imaging tools in the setting of monoarthritis.

Results

The monoarticular disease can represent a medical emergency on the one hand and be a diagnostic conundrum on the other. The management rules of patients with monoarthritis have been established long ago, but various pitfalls still lead physicians off the right diagnosis at times. Septic, pseudoseptic arthritis and hemarthrosis are the most common diagnoses made in patients with an acute presentation, and a decision not to perform a diagnostic arthrocentesis is the most prevalent cause of misdiagnosis in this setting. Many rheumatic and infectious diseases can present with more indolent monoarthritis; careful history and physical examination frequently provide clues to the straightforward diagnosis in some cases, but the extensive investigation is needed in others. Imaging methods become indispensable in individuals with the non-inflammatory monoarticular disease, with magnetic resonance imaging being the gold standard for diagnosing pigmented villonodular synovitis, lipoma arborescence, avascular necrosis, or neuropathic arthropathy.

Conclusions

A great variety of medical disorders can present as a monoarticular disease. The disease presentation dictates different diagnostic behavior, while knowing the available imaging methods' diagnostic potential should further shorten the diagnostic process.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^115NVXQH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — frequency, presentation, differential diagnosis, and management are summarized: musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia are common in patients receiving ICI therapy, as reported in up to 40% of those treated in clinical trials, and the most common musculoskeletal and rheumatic irAEs are arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis, which seem to be more frequent with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists and when agents are used in combination. Clinical presentations vary from involvement of large and/or small joints to oligoarthritis of large joints, features of reactive arthritis, or symmetrical polyarthritis with autoantibodies; differentials include degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatic disorders, crystal arthropathies, and septic arthritis, and inflammatory markers are usually very elevated. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required, with intra-articular corticosteroid injections an option if only one or two joints are affected.

An elderly man presented with new-onset hoarse voice, weight loss and arthralgia. Blood tests revealed elevated ESR and CRP with negative RF, anti-CCP and ANA. FDG PET-CT found no evidence of malignancy but revealed widespread symmetrical polyarticular FDG avid arthropathy (Supplementary Fig. S10, available at Rheumatology online). A diagnosis of seronegative RA was made and the patient was commenced on GCs, MTX and HCQ, with an excellent clinical and biochemical response.

RA is a polyarticular inflammatory disease that often presents with pain and swelling of the hands and feet and joint stiffness. Early diagnosis and treatment, the mainstay of clinical management, facilitated by the detection of subclinical synovitis on imaging (US, MRI), helps prevents progression to irreversible joint damage and its associated morbidity. FDG PET-CT typically demonstrates synovial uptake involving several joints (small or large) in a symmetrical distribution with occasional reactive local nodes (e.g. axillae or groins) and can identify other extra-articular manifestations, including aortic and carotid inflammation, which is associated with higher levels of disease activity and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Qualitative and quantitative assessment of FDG avid arthropathy, including volumetric SUV measurements, can help distinguish RA from non-RA diseases, but in most instances the intensity of FDG uptake is similar and it is the distribution of uptake that is the crucial discriminator. For example, sparing of the distal IP joints is more suggestive of RA than OA, while the absence of enthesopathy/bursitis around the femurs, bony pelvis and vertebral column reliably differentiates RA from PMR, except for polymyalgic-onset RA, which can have a combination of the above findings (Supplementary Fig. S11, available at Rheumatology online).

Studies have confirmed a correlation between the intensity of joint uptake and clinical [e.g. 28-joint DAS (DAS-28)], biochemical (CRP, ESR) and radiological (US, MRI) measures of disease activity and some have reported an association between the intensity of pretreatment joint uptake and the risk of developing large joint destruction. FDG PET-CT can demonstrate a reduction in intensity of synovial uptake that correlates with US and MRI assessment of disease following several therapies with early metabolic response after 2 weeks, correlating with DAS-28 at 12 weeks following triple combination DMARD therapy and DAS-28 at 14 and 24 weeks following anti-TNF-α therapy. A reduction in arterial inflammation can also be observed following anti-inflammatory therapies.

### Acute monoarthritis: diagnosis in adults [^116RqpmU]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute monoarthritis can be the initial manifestation of many joint disorders. The most common diagnoses in the primary care setting are osteoarthritis, gout, and trauma. It is important to understand the prevalence of specific etiologies and to use the appropriate diagnostic modalities. A delay in diagnosis and treatment, particularly in septic arthritis, can have catastrophic results including sepsis, bacteremia, joint destruction, or death. The history and physical examination can help guide the use of laboratory and imaging studies. The presence of focal bone pain or recent trauma requires radiography of the affected joint to rule out metabolic bone disease, tumor, or fracture. If there is a joint effusion in the absence of trauma or recent surgery, and signs of infection (e.g., fever, erythema, warmth) are present, subsequent arthrocentesis should be performed. Inflammatory synovial fluid containing monosodium urate crystals indicates a high probability of gout. Noninflammatory synovial fluid suggests osteoarthritis or internal derangement. Pitfalls in the diagnosis and early treatment of acute monoarthritis include failure to perform arthrocentesis, administering antibiotics before aspirating the joint when septic arthritis is suspected (or failing to start antibiotics after aspiration), and starting treatment based solely on laboratory data, such as an elevated uric acid level.

### An 8-year-old boy with prolonged fever and subcutaneous nodules [^116uG1t4]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with asthma presented with prolonged fever, malaise, extremity weakness, polyarthralgias, malar rash, and subcutaneous nodules. Physical examination was remarkable for a faint malar rash, flesh-colored papules on the dorsal aspect of the fingers, arthritis of multiple joints in the hands, and subcutaneous nodules. The nodules were firm, nontender, and distributed over multiple extremities and the trunk. The patient was admitted to expedite workup. Initial laboratory test results revealed leukopenia, mild elevation of the aminotransferases, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal level of creatine kinase. His echocardiogram was normal. Infectious disease studies were negative. Additional examination revealed dilated capillaries in his nail beds and bilateral hip weakness. MRI of his extremities was negative for myositis or calcification of the nodules. We obtained a biopsy of the subcutaneous nodules, and because the patient remained afebrile during the hospitalization, we discharged him from the hospital with outpatient follow-up. Our expert panel reviews the course of the patient's evaluation and investigation, as well as the implications of his diagnosis based on the tissue pathology from the nodule biopsy.

### Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art [^111ZXmGA]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

The relevance of adequate prediction making

Research into the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is important because early treatment is associated with better outcomes. To facilitate this research the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) study group of risk factors for RA has defined several stages of RA development: genetic risk factors for RA, environmental risk factors for RA, systemic autoimmunity associated with RA, symptoms without clinical arthritis and unclassified arthritis (UA). These stages are based on the presumed order in which different risk factors exert their effects. Individuals in the first three stages are generally asymptomatic. Over time symptoms may develop — initially often in the absence of clinically evident arthritis. In patients with established RA, the different phases may be identified retrospectively. However, it is clinically important to be able to predict with accuracy and confidence the future development of RA during its prearthritis stages. During recent years the phase of arthralgia has gained increasing interest as the risk of progression to RA is (in most cases) likely to be higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic 'at risk' individuals. In addition, this is the way individuals typically present to medical care.

### Diagnosing acute monoarthritis in adults: a practical approach for the family physician [^1115Go6u]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute monoarthritis can be the initial manifestation of many joint disorders. The first step in diagnosis is to verify that the source of pain is the joint, not the surrounding soft tissues. The most common causes of monoarthritis are crystals (i.e., gout and pseudogout), trauma, and infection. A careful history and physical examination are important because diagnostic studies frequently are only supportive. Examination of joint fluid often is essential in making a definitive diagnosis. Leukocyte counts vary widely in septic and sterile synovial fluids and should be interpreted cautiously. If the history and diagnostic studies suggest an infection, aggressive treatment can prevent rapid joint destruction. When an infection is suspected, culture and Gram staining should be performed and antibiotics should be started. Light microscopy may be useful to identify gout crystals, but polarized microscopy is preferred. Blood tests alone never confirm a diagnosis, and radiographic studies are diagnostic only in selected conditions. Referral is indicated when patients have septic arthritis or when the initial evaluation does not determine the etiology.

### Mechanisms, impact and management of pain in rheumatoid arthritis [^113DmWoS]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identify pain as their most important symptom, one that often persists despite optimal control of inflammatory disease. RA pain arises from multiple mechanisms, involving inflammation, peripheral and central pain processing and, with disease progression, structural change within the joint. Consequently, RA pain has a wide range of characteristics-constant or intermittent, localized or widespread-and is often associated with psychological distress and fatigue. Dominant pain mechanisms in an individual are identified by critical evaluation of clinical symptoms and signs, and by laboratory and imaging tests. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for effective management, although evidence from preclinical models should be interpreted with caution. A range of pharmacological analgesic and immunomodulatory agents, psychological interventions and surgery may help manage RA pain. Pain contributes importantly to the clinical assessment of inflammatory disease activity, and noninflammatory components of RA pain should be considered when gauging eligibility for or response to biologic agents. Further randomized controlled trials are required to determine the optimal usage of analgesics in RA, and novel agents with greater efficacy and lower propensity for adverse events are urgently needed. Meanwhile, targeted use of existing treatments could reduce pain in people with RA.

### Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art [^115ViXJS]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The processes causing arthralgia to progress to clinically evident RA are insufficiently understood. Most studied predictors are not pathognomonic for this transition or for RA, and the predictive accuracy of most markers has not been validated in different studies. Only ACPA positivity has been observed to associate with RA development across multiple studies. In addition none of the predictors studied, including ACPA, was sufficiently predictive on its own, and the vast majority of studies did not combine different types of predictors. The few studies that did combine different markers (eg, imaging and ACPA) revealed that combinations were also insufficient for adequate risk stratification in many patients (as PPVs were < 80%). Therefore more research is needed to obtain adequate risk stratification in patients with arthralgia.

Ideally, future studies should be performed in homogeneous patient groups, for example, patients fulfilling the EULAR definition of arthralgia at risk for RA. In this way, patients with comparable prior risks for RA will be selected, and validation of findings in different cohorts will be possible. Results of these future studies should provide data to support the development of robust algorithms to differentiate patients with arthralgia likely to progress to RA from those unlikely to do so. Importantly the variables within these algorithms and their weightings may well be different for algorithms designed for use in different contexts, for example, primary and secondary care.

### Contemporary treatment principles for early rheumatoid arthritis: a consensus statement [^115tsEiB]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

RA has a substantial impact on both patients and healthcare systems. Our objective is to advance the understanding of modern management principles in light of recent evidence concerning the condition's diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A group of practicing UK rheumatologists formulated contemporary management principles and clinical practice recommendations concerning both diagnosis and treatment. Areas of clinical uncertainty were documented, leading to research recommendations.

Results

A fundamental concept governing treatment of RA is minimization of cumulative inflammation, referred to as the inflammation-time area under the curve (AUC). To achieve this, four core principles of management were identified: (i) detect and refer patients early, even if the diagnosis is uncertain: patients should be referred at the first suspicion of persistent inflammatory polyarthritis and rheumatology departments should provide rapid access to a diagnostic and prognostic service; (ii) treat RA immediately: optimizing outcomes with conventional DMARDs and biologics requires that effective treatment be started early-ideally within 3 months of symptom onset; (iii) tight control of inflammation in RA improves outcome: frequent assessments and an objective protocol should be used to make treatment changes that maintain low-disease activity/remission at an agreed target; (iv) consider the risk-benefit ratio and tailor treatment to each patient: differing patient, disease and drug characteristics require long-term monitoring of risks and benefits with adaptations of treatments to suit individual circumstances.

Conclusion

These principles focus on effective control of the inflammatory process in RA, but optimal uptake may require changes in service provision to accommodate appropriate care pathways.

### African guidelines for diagnosis and management of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: PAFLAR initiative [^112nJD34]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatologic disease of childhood. JIA is not a single disease but a diagnosis that applies to all forms of arthritis of unknown origin, with an onset before the 16th birthday, lasting more than 6 weeks, and where other causes of arthritis have been excluded. According to the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) classification system, there are different clinical categories of JIA, including oligoarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor (RF) negative), polyarthritis (RF positive) and systemic arthritis. Each form of JIA has a risk of irreversible joint damage and a lower health-related quality of life. The illness can also continue into adulthood, resulting in persistently high morbidity and a reduced quality of life. Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (poly-JIA) is a subset of JIA which is characterized by the presence of more than four affected joints during the first six months of disease, poly-JIA affects about 20 to 30% of JIA patients.

The main aim of JIA treatment is to achieve remission of the disease with normalization of physical findings and laboratory markers of inflammation, to preserve the physical and psychological integrity of the child, and to prevent any long-term consequences related to the disease or its therapy. Clinical evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of inflammation might improve the prognosis and avert chronic consequences. Treatment recommendations are designed to help healthcare professionals in various manners, such as lowering the likelihood of receiving improper care, promoting the appropriate and efficient use of resources, and encouraging the adoption of a consistent approach to care delivery.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published its last recommendations for Non-Systemic Polyarthritis, Sacroiliitis, and Enthesitis in 2019 to provide international guidelines for some JIA subtypes. Africa is a low- and middle-income continent where managing this chronic illness presents major challenges due to scarce resources and inequities. This served as the primary impetus for creating guidelines tailored specifically for African children suffering from JIA. All children JIA have the right to fair access to the best clinical care possible and setting standards of care is one way to realize this right progressively.

The aim of this work is to release updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment based on evidence for children and adolescents with poly-JIA, considering the African-specific nature of the varied spectrum of resources and low income, also on the same time incorporating newly released data and using a treat-to-target approach.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^115Fi4XQ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease affecting people older than 50 years and is 2–3 times more common in women. The most common symptoms are pain and morning stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle and the onset may be acute or develop over a few days to weeks. General symptoms such as fatigue, fever and weight loss may occur, likely driven by systemic IL‐6 signalling. The pathology includes synovial and periarticular inflammation and muscular vasculopathy. A new observation is that PMR may appear as a side effect of cancer treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on symptoms and signs combined with laboratory markers of inflammation. Imaging modalities including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with computed tomography are promising new tools in the investigation of suspected PMR. However, they are still limited by availability, high cost and unclear performance in the diagnostic workup. Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is effective in PMR, with most patients responding promptly to 15–25 mg prednisolone per day. There are challenges in the management of patients with PMR as relapses do occur and patients with PMR may need to stay on GC for extended periods. This is associated with high rates of GC‐related comorbidities, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, and there are limited data on the use of disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics as GC sparing agents. Finally, PMR is associated with giant cell arteritis that may complicate the disease course and require more intense and prolonged treatment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: medical and legal ramifications of clinical variability and experience and perspective of a practicing clinician [^113cUa15]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The sequence of events that occurred in Patient 6 was quite intriguing. Following an initial injury to the right hand and the subsequent development of signs and symptoms of CRPS, he went on to develop polyarthralgia 2 months later, which affected the upper and lower extremities. The results of an extensive rheumatological evaluation were consistent with RA. It is worthy of note that cytokines and peptides, together with immune cells, have been demonstrated in both CRPS and RA. Although a clear conclusion could not be drawn from this sequence of events, the temporal association between physical trauma and the onset of RA has been reported previously and may be significant.

The spontaneous spread of CRPS, without new trauma, is a well-known phenomenon possibly mediated by spinal or supraspinal mechanisms. The spread of vasomotor symptoms occurred in most of the patients studied. Some health care providers may not find this spread credible, leading them to make a diagnosis other than CRPS, resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic obfuscation.

One limitation of the present study is lack of laboratory findings to corroborate the presence of ongoing pain in some patients. The legal system is preoccupied with the demonstration of objective evidence that correlates with the subjective aspect of a patient's symptomatology and, particularly, pain.

However, the presence of associated and discernible clinical signs of autonomic dysregulation in the affected limb (and movement disorder or trophic changes in some cases) is remarkably convincing, diagnostically. In addition, there is no CRPS-specific laboratory procedure. The cost of the procedures followed is high, and they have poor sensitivity. Thus, the demonstration of clinical abnormalities remains the gold standard in the diagnosis of CRPS.

In the past years, some patients with CRPS were told by their physicians that their pain was being imagined or fabricated. However, currently, it is known that the central nervous system plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the condition. A recent study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, have shown reorganization of the somatosensory and motor neuronal networks in CRPS, in response to persistent nociceptive inputs from peripheral neurogenic inflammation.

### Which patients presenting with arthralgia eventually develop rheumatoid arthritis? The current state of the art [^114EbJdZ]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Early initiation of treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis at risk of persistence and/or erosive progression is important because it is associated with a reduced rate of progression of joint damage and functional disability. It has been proposed that a window of opportunity exists, during which disease processes are less matured and disease modification can be more effective. The phase of arthralgia preceding clinical arthritis is likely to be an important part of this window of opportunity, during which treatment might prevent progression to clinical arthritis. Several proof-of-concept trials in individuals with arthralgia are now evaluating this hypothesis. Central to such trials is the ability to identify groups at high risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in whom preventive treatment can be tested. This review describes the relevance of adequate prediction making, as well as the accuracy of different types of predictors (including imaging and serological markers) with their value in predicting the progression of arthralgia to arthritis. Despite promising results, studies have been performed in heterogeneous patient populations and most findings have not been validated in independent studies. Future observational or preventive studies should be conducted with homogeneous patient groups (eg, patients fulfilling the European League Against Rheumatism criteria for arthralgia at risk of RA) in order to increase interstudy comparability and to allow result validation.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^112pWusf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

For G3–4 severe stiffness and pain limiting self-care ADL — "Hold ICPI and may resume, in consultation with rheumatology, if recover to ≤ G2", refer to rheumatology, and "Should initiate prednisone 40 mg/d or equivalent"; if insufficient response or prolonged higher dosing, "may offer a steroid sparing agent such as synthetic drugs (eg, methotrexate) or biologic agents (eg, IL-6 antagonists)", noting "IL-6 inhibition can cause intestinal perforation" and "it should not be used in patients with immune-related colitis", and "Consider admission of patients with severe symptoms". Additional considerations state "IL-6 antagonists may be the preferred steroid-sparing agents for management of polymyalgia-like syndrome as they are already approved for use in patients with GCA".

### Acute monoarthritis: diagnosis in adults [^116tBBP3]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute monoarthritis, characterized by pain or swelling in a single joint, is a diagnostic challenge in the primary care setting. Intra-articular conditions typically manifest with reduced active and passive range of motion, whereas patients with periarticular conditions such as tendinitis or bursitis often maintain passive range of motion. When evaluating a patient with acute monoarthritis, it is essential to remember that many polyarthritic processes can initially present in a single joint. A broad differential diagnosis for monoarthritis should include septic arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, trauma, and Lyme arthritis. Of these, septic arthritis is the most urgent and requires prompt intervention. Bacterial culture of the synovial fluid is the most accurate diagnostic test for a septic joint. However, diagnostic accuracy can be increased in the short term by evaluating additional markers such as synovial white blood cell count, synovial lactate, and serum biomarkers. These supplementary tests aid in early decision-making while awaiting bacterial culture results. Osteoarthritis is often clinically diagnosed and may be confirmed with radiography. Gout, the most prevalent crystalline arthropathy, can be diagnosed using specialized calculators, ultrasonography, and dual energy computed tomography. Gout is typically most painful at night or in the early morning. Ultrasonography is useful for identifying effusions in less-visible joints and facilitating precise joint aspiration.

Arthritides in heel pain (Pathway 4) — systemic causes and adjunct testing may be relevant: Most cases of heel pain encountered in clinical practice are likely to have a biomechanical etiology and respond to recommended therapy, but the clinician should consider that various systemic arthritides are also capable of presentation as heel pain, including the seronegative arthritides, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's disease, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and gout. Patients with arthritides and heel pain may have other joint symptoms and should be questioned regarding concomitant arthralgias, and careful radiographic evaluation and laboratory testing may assist in determining the correct diagnosis and proper treatment for these unresponsive patients. Occasionally, scintigraphy may be useful in the diagnosis process because a pattern of joint involvement will be evidenced; radiographs of the heel may show erosions or proliferative changes specific to one of these diseases, and rheumatologic consultation may be useful in determining the diagnosis and treatment.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Laboratory tests to assess patients with rheumatoid arthritis: advantages and limitations [^114phRLv]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests provide the most definitive information for diagnosing and managing many diseases, and most patients look to laboratory tests as the most important information from a medical visit. Most patients who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a positive test for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). More than 30% 40% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies or a normal ESR or CRP. More than 30% of patients with RA, however, have negative tests for rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and 40% have a normal ESR or CRP. These observations indicate that, although they can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. Physicians and patients would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with RA.

### Characteristics and treatment of new-onset arthritis after checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^114o91tk]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may cause immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Characterisation and data on treatment of musculoskeletal IRAEs are scarce. In this cohort study, patients receiving ICI therapy who experienced arthralgia were evaluated for the presence of synovitis. Data on demographics, ICI regime, time of onset, imaging and response to therapy of synovitis were prospectively collected. Arthritis was demonstrated in 14 of 16 patients of whom 7 showed monarthritis, 5 had oligoarthritis and 2 had polyarthritis. Patients with ICI-induced arthritis were predominantly male (57%) and seronegative (69%). Regarding the detection of synovitis in staging imaging, moderate sensitivity for contrast-enhanced CT with PET-CT as reference was observed. Disease burden at baseline was high and was significantly reduced after anti-inflammatory treatment. Nine patients were treated with systemic and eight patients with intra-articular glucocorticoids. Six patients who flared on glucocorticoid treatment on tapering were given methotrexate resulting in long-term remission. Patients with synovitis were more likely to have good tumour response. Patients with ICI-induced arthritis were predominantly male and seronegative showing different patterns of arthritis with high disease burden. Good efficacy and safety was observed for methotrexate, particularly for ICI-induced polyarthritis.

### Management of adult-onset Still's disease: evidence-and consensus-based recommendations by experts [^1152NyJG]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to reach consensus on diagnosis and treatment of AOSD with the use of a Delphi process. The 29 out of 33 statements that reached consensus between > 80% of 17 panelists form the basis for a treatment guideline to be used in clinical practice (Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs S1–S3, available at Rheumatology online).

Recommendations for the diagnosis of AOSD

When AOSD is considered in the differential diagnosis, standard lab tests, blood and urine cultures, and serum ferritin should be performed. Scoring the Yamaguchi criteria is required (Fig. 1). Individual clinical features determine whether a patient should be tested for alternative diagnoses (infections, non-infectious inflammatory diseases, malignancy). Measurement of soluble IL-2 receptor or IL-18 should be considered to support the diagnosis of AOSD, preferably before initiation of GC. Timely start of treatment is important to avoid damage or a more chronic disease course. In case of prolonged fever or inflammation, PET/CT should be considered before starting GC. Upon suspicion of MAS, bone marrow examination should be performed, but this should not delay MAS-targeted treatment, as this is a potentially life-threatening complication. If doubt remains about the diagnosis, a trial with short-acting IL-1 blockade should be considered while waiting for test results (Fig. 1).

### Chikungunya pathogenesis: from the clinics to the bench [^111byLuX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Chikungunya alphavirus has caused large epidemics worldwide and leads to acute incapacitating polyarthralgia. The inflammatory reaction over several days will drive robust innate and humoral responses essential to control the infection. Critically, fatal cases and mother-to-child transmission have also been described. Chikungunya can give rise to chronic musculoskeletal diseases, which can last for months to years, particularly in elderly individuals, and occasionally leads to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis-like pathologies. Histopathological studies of patient biopsy specimens and animal models have revealed that chikungunya virus can hide in tissue sanctuaries, and ongoing research should help to decipher the inflammatory mechanisms of tissue injuries.

### How well Do current laboratory biomarkers inform clinical decision-making in chronic pain management? [^112xNTKo]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While the use of objective laboratory measures has become commonplace in other areas of medicine, it has been relatively lacking in the field of chronic pain medicine. Ultimately, a biomarker pain panel that highlights metabolic abnormalities, oxidative stressors, and nutritional deficiencies may help to identify the underlying treatable causes of pain and potentially provide evidence of treatment response. Certainly, additional research is necessary before specific recommendations can be made, but the potential benefits for the treatment of chronic pain make this an important and necessary area of future study.

### The utility of laboratory investigations for the assessment and management of rheumatic immune related adverse events [^112EDFT5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have greatly improved survival of several cancers with historically very poor prognosis. ICIs act by stimulating the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. Simultaneously, this immune activation can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including rheumatic manifestations (Rh-irAEs). Rh-irAEs mimic primary rheumatic diseases including arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, myositis, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and sicca. This article summarizes the latest evidence regarding the utility of laboratory investigations in Rh-irAEs.

Low-quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 may trigger reactive arthritis one to four weeks after the infection. Post COVID-19 reactive arthritis resolves within a few days, and no additional treatment is required. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 prompt us to further investigate the immunopathogenic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases. Caution should be exerted when managing post-infectious COVID-19 patient with arthralgia.

### Canadian Pain Society and Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^114f8gKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Methods

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient followup were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and following review were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

Results

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with a pivotal symptom of body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and not requiring specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigation may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should be reduction of symptoms, but also improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested, and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. Outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern and any culture of disablement should be discouraged.

Conclusion

These guidelines should provide the health community with reassurance for the global care of patients with FM with the aim of improving patient outcome by reducing symptoms and maintaining function.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^115gKQdw]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

New patients with clinical suspicion of Cushing's — diagnostic approach during COVID-19: Screening for, and confirmation of Cushing's syndrome (CS) and localization for CD is laborious and requires serial visits and testing procedures; careful questioning and exclusion of external exposure to high-dose oral corticosteroids, intraarticular injections or topical preparations is an important first step. Subsequently, establishing the likelihood and pretest probability of CS is more important than ever now, when testing may be delayed, and some features, although not highly sensitive, are more specific, e.g. easy bruising, facial plethora, large wide > 1 cm violaceous striae, proximal weakness and hypokalemia. Diagnosis of CS is often challenging even under normal circumstances, however, a diagnosis by VV is more nuanced and difficult; conversely, if a patient has a high likelihood of CS, we recommend limited laboratory evaluation (urinary free cortisol (UFC), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), liver panel, basic metabolic panel), preferably at a smaller local laboratory rather than a Pituitary Center, to reduce viral risk exposure. Salivary cortisol samples could represent a hazard for laboratory staff and they are prohibited in some countries; in the US, laboratories have continued to process salivary cortisol samples and salivary cortisol has higher sensitivity compared with UFC and has the convenience of mailing multiple specimens at a time, without travel. Though usually we strongly recommend sequential laboratory testing under normal circumstances, limiting trips to a laboratory is preferred during COVID-19.

For a history of severe PAN with abdominal involvement who become clinically asymptomatic, they "conditionally recommend follow-up abdominal vascular imaging". For suspected PAN involving the skin, they "conditionally recommend obtaining a deep-skin biopsy specimen (i.e., a biopsy reaching the medium-sized vessels of the dermis) over a superficial skin punch biopsy to aid in establishing a diagnosis". For suspected PAN with peripheral neuropathy, they "conditionally recommend obtaining a combined nerve and muscle biopsy over a nerve biopsy alone to aid in establishing a diagnosis". For a history of peripheral motor neuropathy secondary to PAN, they "conditionally recommend serial neurologic examinations instead of repeated electromyography/ nerve conduction studies (e.g., every 6 months) to monitor disease activity".

### Diagnostic approach to polyarticular joint pain [^111oEEBP]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying the cause of polyarticular joint pain can be difficult because of the extensive differential diagnosis. A thorough history and a complete physical examination are essential. Six clinical factors are helpful in narrowing the possible causes: disease chronology, inflammation, distribution, extra-articular manifestations, disease course, and patient demographics. Patients with an inflammatory arthritis are more likely to have palpable synovitis and morning stiffness; if the condition is severe, they may have fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Viral infections, crystal-induced arthritis, and serum sickness reactions are common causes of acute, self-limited polyarthritis. Because chronic arthritides may present abruptly, they need to be considered in patients who present with acute polyarticular joint pain. Joint palpation can help to distinguish inflammatory synovitis from the bony hypertrophy and crepitus that typically occur with osteoarthritis. Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatologic disease may be helpful in arriving at a more specific diagnosis. Many classic rheumatologic laboratory tests are nonspecific. A complete blood count, urinalysis, and a metabolic panel may provide more useful diagnostic clues. Plain-film radiographs may demonstrate classic findings of specific rheumatologic diseases; however, radiographs can be normal or only show nonspecific changes early in the disease process.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^113jsUCX]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of D2T RA

The EULAR definition of D2T-RA provided an effective framework to develop the EULAR points to consider (PtC) in the management of D2T-RA. Indeed, while the definition lends itself towards including a heterogeneous patient group, the PtC advise DMARD strategies based on clear demonstration of persistent active inflammatory pathology, an overarching principle being 'The presence or absence of inflammation should be established to guide pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions'. This clarity is crucial in the management of D2T RA to mitigate unnecessary cycling of further DMARD therapies. One of the specific PtC highlights that musculoskeletal ultrasound may be an effective tool where evaluation of inflammation proves challenging. This may serve to reassure the rheumatologist and the patient if a decision is made not to change DMARD despite ongoing symptoms and measured disease activity. In this regard, acceptance of a low disease activity state as stated in the treat to target recommendations may be more appropriate.

This overarching principle also supports consideration of other factors that may complicate accurate assessment of disease activity state. Obesity and fibromyalgia are highlighted as two prevalent conditions in people with RA that should be accommodated when evaluating disease activity and progression to D2T-RA. Secondary fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis may overestimate patient global health scores and tender joint count assessments. Obesity may make accurate detection of swollen joint count challenging and/or overestimate acute phase reactants and contribute to an excess inflammatory drive and phenotype. A reappraisal of the diagnosis and the need to identify coexistent disease and/or mimics that may interfere with the assessment of disease activity were also recommended. Modern RA paradigms encourage us to seek out new and early diagnoses of RA, risking misdiagnosis at the earliest stages of diseases when often still evolving. The hazards of mimics and coexistent pathology is relevant across a patient's disease course including in the older demographic when conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica and/or osteoarthritis may complicate the clinical assessment.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease affecting children and young people today. However, it is not a single disease entity, but an umbrella term that gathers together a heterogeneous collection of complex, chronic inflammatory conditions with oligoarticular JIA the most common form in both Europe and North America. Due to its relative rarity in daily practice and potential to mimic other conditions, oligoarticular JIA can present a diagnostic and management challenge to healthcare professionals in both primary care and general paediatrics. The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the key aspects of diagnosis, investigation and management of this condition, with the hopes of building clinicians' confidence when facing a possible case of oligoarticular JIA.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Clinical approaches to early inflammatory arthritis [^113LYm8o]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Several advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, as well as in the clinical evaluation and treatment, of early inflammatory arthritis. The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has emerged as a major new biomarker for use in clinical practice. The presence of ACPAs can be used to divide patients with early arthritis into subsets that are phenotypically similar but have varying pathogenetic and prognostic features. Although the detection of ACPAs is a major development in the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), prediction of the outcome of arthritis at the individual level can still be much improved. For patients diagnosed with RA, and who have active polyarthritis, treatment is not dependent on the assessment of prognostic factors, as these patients are best treated with combination therapy; over 40% of these patients achieve remission with such treatment. In patients who present with oligoarthritis, however, management should be based on the assessment of prognostic factors. The success of early treatment of inflammatory arthritis and the recognition of a measurable preclinical phase of RA offer hope that treating the disease before it becomes clinically active might be possible.

There are estimated tens of millions of individuals throughout the world suffering from a variety of postinfectious sequela following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 also commonly referred to as long coronavirus disease (COVID). Long COVID is providing an opportunity for the field of rheumatology to explore the relationship between similar syndromes including fibromyalgia seen in patients with underlying inflammatory and noninflammatory rheumatic diseases, as well as other postacute infectious sequela and bring our field's traditional skill sets to bear on improving our understanding of these disorders and the care of such patients.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.
