## Question

What are the risk factors for developing EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunocompromised patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk factors for EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunocompromised patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities encompassed by EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation. Then, I should verify the overarching pathophysiology linking EBV, B cells, and immune control. Next, I will categorize risk factors into EBV-specific, immunosuppression-related, transplant-specific, and host/demographic domains. After that, I should quantify risk where possible and note modifiers like CMV and HCV. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk hierarchy and highlight special populations and caveats, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities we are discussing. EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunocompromised hosts includes post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) after solid organ or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in other immunodeficiency states, and immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma. I should also remember EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer, which falls under immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferations, even if not always frankly malignant [^1127ukJv] [^113jH5rt] [^115nPtHi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the core biology. EBV infects B lymphocytes and establishes latency. Loss of T-cell immune surveillance permits uncontrolled B-cell proliferation, with transformation events culminating in lymphoma, which is why the intensity and quality of T-cell immunity are central to risk and why T-cell depletion is such a strong driver of PTLD [^113FcJ9q] [^1132zxiL] [^117CwgyR].

> I will now examine EBV-specific risk factors, starting with serostatus mismatch. Recipient EBV seronegativity with donor seropositivity is the single strongest risk factor across transplant settings, reflecting primary EBV infection under immunosuppression; children are disproportionately affected because they are more often EBV-naïve, and this serostatus drives early-onset, EBV-positive PTLD in pediatrics [^1132zxiL] [^114k9hLY] [^113V5DLH]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of this effect in drug-specific contexts: belatacept trials show a roughly 9-fold higher PTLD rate in EBV-seronegative or unknown recipients compared with seropositive recipients, reinforcing the primacy of EBV serostatus in risk stratification and regulatory labeling [^111wRybJ].

> Next, I should review immunosuppression intensity and type. Higher overall immunosuppressive burden correlates with increased PTLD risk, and T-cell–depleting agents such as antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies markedly elevate risk by impairing EBV-specific T-cell control; induction intensity and repeated pulses for rejection further compound this risk [^1132zxiL] [^114Bp61E]. I need to ensure I distinguish class effects from agent-specific signals: calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate, and mTOR inhibitors all increase malignancy risk with intensity/duration dependence, but belatacept carries a specific boxed warning for PTLD and is contraindicated in EBV-seronegative recipients, which operationalizes EBV serostatus into prescribing decisions [^112GGc6C] [^113q2SLX] [^112Ms9S8] [^1126MiSF].

> Let me consider transplant-specific variables. Organ type matters: lung, intestinal/multiorgan, and heart transplants carry the highest PTLD incidence, whereas kidney and liver are lower but nontrivial. Early-onset PTLD is usually EBV-positive and linked to serostatus mismatch, whereas late-onset PTLD is more often EBV-negative and behaves like de novo DLBCL [^117CwgyR] [^114k9hLY]. I should double-check HCT-specific risks: haploidentical or unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood, and in vivo or ex vivo T-cell depletion increase PTLD risk, reflecting impaired EBV-specific T-cell reconstitution [^1132zxiL] [^117CwgyR].

> Now, host and demographic factors. Younger age, especially children, is a major risk due to high prevalence of EBV seronegativity and primary infection post-transplant; older recipient age is a poor prognostic factor after PTLD develops, though it is less clearly a primary risk factor for incidence [^114k9hLY] [^111gf3vU]. But wait, what if we consider non-transplant immunocompromised states? HIV infection remains a key setting for EBV-associated lymphomas, including immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt lymphoma, and EBV-positive DLBCL, reflecting chronic immune dysregulation and B-cell activation [^113jH5rt] [^1118NZ1R].

> I need to check infectious co-factors. CMV donor–recipient mismatch or CMV disease has been repeatedly associated with increased PTLD risk, plausibly via immune activation and shared T-cell exhaustion pathways. Belatacept data suggest higher PTLD rates in EBV-seropositive recipients who are CMV-seronegative, though the clinical significance remains debated and should be interpreted cautiously [^112DF1zD] [^111aKRqD]. HCV seropositivity is associated with B-cell lymphomas, including DLBCL and marginal zone lymphoma, and achieving SVR may reduce lymphoma incidence; while not specific to PTLD, this is relevant when evaluating EBV-associated B-cell proliferations in immunocompromised hosts with viral co-infections [^1136Pxy5] [^1111SuEK].

> Let me quantify risk where possible to anchor clinical decisions. In pediatrics, PTLD incidence ranges from about 1–7% after kidney, 2–6% after liver, 4–13% after heart, 7–20% after lung, and 12–17% after intestinal transplantation; after allogeneic HCT, risk is highest with haploidentical or T-cell–depleted strategies and can exceed 20% in some series, whereas matched related donor transplants are around 1–3% [^114k9hLY] [^117CwgyR]. For belatacept, PTLD occurred in 9/949 patients overall, with an approximately 9-fold higher risk in EBV-seronegative or unknown recipients, and a notable predilection for CNS involvement, which is why EBV serostatus testing is mandatory before use [^112Ms9S8].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and modifiers. Primary EBV infection in children on thiopurines for IBD increases the risk of lymphoproliferative disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; anti-TNF monotherapy has not consistently increased lymphoma risk, but combination with thiopurines elevates concern, particularly in EBV-naïve patients, so EBV serostatus should inform immunomodulator selection in pediatrics [^1165E25a] [^111rLsQ4]. I should also confirm that EBV-negative PTLD represents a distinct biology with complex genetic alterations akin to DLBCL in immunocompetent hosts and is less responsive to reduction in immunosuppression, which affects both risk attribution and treatment planning [^114k9hLY] [^115rCaKE].

> Next, I should review how these risks translate into practice. Pre-transplant EBV and CMV serostatus assessment is essential for risk stratification. In high-risk EBV D+/R− SOT recipients, serial EBV DNA monitoring and preemptive strategies, including rituximab in some protocols, are recommended, whereas routine antiviral prophylaxis has not proven protective against EBV disease or PTLD and is not advised for this purpose [^113V5DLH] [^114Bp61E] [^114DKBfh]. Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: detecting EBV viremia is not diagnostic of PTLD. Tissue diagnosis with EBER-ISH remains the gold standard, so rising EBV loads should trigger closer surveillance and biopsy rather than empiric lymphoma labeling [^115M7cuP] [^1162zSwi].

> Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchical risk model. Tier 1 drivers include EBV serostatus mismatch and T-cell–depleting therapies. Tier 2 includes high-intensity immunosuppression, lung/intestinal/heart transplantation, haploidentical or unrelated HCT, and CMV mismatch or disease. Tier 3 includes younger age, specific agents like belatacept in EBV-seronegative recipients, and HCV co-infection. Tier 4 includes older age and late-onset EBV-negative PTLD, which portend worse outcomes even if they are less clearly incidence drivers [^1132zxiL] [^117CwgyR] [^112Ms9S8] [^1136Pxy5] [^111gf3vU]. I should confirm that this hierarchy aligns with guideline emphasis on EBV serostatus, T-cell depletion, and organ type as the most actionable risk factors for prevention and surveillance strategies [^1132zxiL] [^113V5DLH].

EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunocompromised patients is driven by **EBV serostatus mismatch** (recipient EBV-negative, donor EBV-positive) [^1132zxiL], **T-cell depletion** (ATG, alemtuzumab, ex vivo T-cell depletion) [^114Bp61E], and **intensive immunosuppression** (calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate, belatacept) [^112Ms9S8] [^113q2SLX]. Additional risks include **CMV co-infection** [^112DF1zD], **younger age** (especially children) [^114k9hLY], and **specific organ transplants** (lung, intestine, heart, multiorgan) [^117CwgyR]. These factors converge to impair T-cell control of EBV, enabling unchecked B-cell proliferation and lymphoma [^1132zxiL].

---

## EBV-specific risk factors

### EBV serostatus mismatch

Recipient EBV-negative and donor EBV-positive is the **strongest risk factor**, especially in children [^114k9hLY] due to primary EBV infection under immunosuppression [^1132zxiL]. In contrast, recipient EBV-positive generally confers lower risk, though not negligible [^111wRybJ].

---

### Primary EBV infection

Primary EBV infection after transplantation confers a **higher risk than reactivation**, particularly in EBV-negative recipients [^114k9hLY] [^113V5DLH].

---

## Immunosuppression-related risk factors

### Intensity and type of immunosuppression

Calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) and antimetabolites (mycophenolate, azathioprine) increase risk, with **risk rising with intensity and duration** [^112GGc6C] [^113q2SLX]. Belatacept is associated with a **higher PTLD risk**, especially CNS disease, and is contraindicated in EBV-seronegative patients [^112Ms9S8] [^1126MiSF].

---

### T-cell depleting therapies

- **ATG**: Strongly increases PTLD risk, especially with unrelated or mismatched allografts [^1132zxiL].
- **Alemtuzumab**: Linked to higher PTLD risk [^114Bp61E].
- **Ex vivo T-cell depletion**: Elevates risk, particularly in haploidentical transplants [^117CwgyR].

---

## Transplant-related risk factors

### Type of organ transplantation

Lung, intestinal, heart, and multiorgan transplants carry higher PTLD risk than kidney or liver transplantation [^114k9hLY] [^117CwgyR]. Haploidentical or unrelated donor allogeneic HCT also confers **higher risk**, especially with T-cell depletion [^1132zxiL].

---

### Timing of transplantation

Early-onset PTLD (< 1 year post-transplant) is more often EBV-positive and linked to primary infection; **late-onset PTLD (> 1 year) is more often EBV-negative** [^114k9hLY] [^115nPtHi].

---

## Viral co-infections

CMV co-infection — particularly CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative — increases PTLD risk [^112DF1zD] [^112Ms9S8]. Other herpesviruses may also contribute, though less strongly than CMV [^notfound].

---

## Demographic and clinical factors

Younger age, especially children, is a major risk due to **high EBV seronegativity and primary infection risk** [^1132zxiL] [^113V5DLH]. Underlying immune deficiencies (e.g. HIV, primary immunodeficiencies) further increase susceptibility [^113jH5rt].

## Summary of key risk factors

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| EBV-specific | - Recipient EBV-negative, donor EBV-positive <br/> - Primary EBV infection [^1132zxiL] |
| Immunosuppression | - Calcineurin inhibitors <br/> - Mycophenolate <br/> - Belatacept <br/> - ATG <br/> - Alemtuzumab <br/> - Ex vivo T-cell depletion [^112Ms9S8] [^114Bp61E] |

| Demographic | - Younger age [^1132zxiL] <br/> - Primary immunodeficiencies [^notfound] <br/> - HIV infection [^notfound] |

---

The main drivers of EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation in immunocompromised patients are **EBV serostatus mismatch**, **T-cell depletion**, and **intensive immunosuppression**, with additional contributions from CMV co-infection, younger age, and high-risk transplants. These factors impair T-cell control of EBV, enabling B-cell transformation and lymphoma [^notfound].

Pediatric post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders — cross-cutting management notes — Treatment is based on the unique histology. Rituximab can be used if CD20 is only partially or dimly expressed but is not essential for CD20-negative PTLD, and the status and pattern of CD20 expression by flow cytometry should be reported in all subtypes of PTLD. Response to RIS is variable and patients need to be closely monitored; RIS includes reduction in calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), discontinuation of antimetabolic agents (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and consideration of discontinuation of non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression in patients who are critically ill. Collaboration with a graft transplant specialist is recommended to coordinate immunosuppressive medication assessment, dose modifications, and graft organ function monitoring. Completely resected PTLD without disease elsewhere can be managed without additional therapy with the exception of RIS. EBV viral load cannot be used for response assessment in PTLD. Biopsy should be considered prior to additional therapy. Re-escalation of immunosuppressive therapy should be individualized, taking into account the extent of initial RIS and the nature of the organ allograft. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Mycophenolic acid [^115mBPbW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning].

5.3 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.

5.4 Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of over suppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

Adult liver transplant long-term management — posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) diagnosis: Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may be associated with the development of PTLD, the detection of EBV viremia is not diagnostic for PTLD; a histopathological diagnosis is required (grade 1, level A). The diagnosis of PTLD requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in high-risk individuals who present with undiagnosed fever or unexplained lymphadenopathy or cytopenias. Radiographic studies can identify sites of involvement, especially when pulmonary or intra-abdominal sites are involved. The detection of EBV viremia with nucleic acid testing is not diagnostic of EBV-associated PTLD.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) risk-stratified sequential treatment (PTLD-1) evaluated initial rituximab response–based therapy: 152 patients with PTLD after solid organ transplant (SOT) unresponsive to RI received induction with 4 weekly doses of rituximab. Low-risk (CR after initial rituximab) received rituximab consolidation on days 50, 72, 94, and 116; high-risk (non-CR) received R-CHOP-21 (4 cycles) combined with G-CSF, and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis was recommended. Among the 126 patients enrolled in the risk-stratified protocol, the ORR was 88% (70% CR); the estimated 3-year OS rate was 70%, which compared favorably to the OS rate of 61%; treatment-related mortality was 8%; median OS was 7 years; and the estimated 3-year TTP was 89% for patients in the low-risk group treated with rituximab consolidation.

### Belatacept (Nulojix) [^111wRybJ]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder

Reported cases of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) up to 36 months post-transplant were obtained for NULOJIX by pooling both dosage regimens of NULOJIX in Studies 1 and 2 (804 patients) with data from a third study in kidney transplantation (Study 3, 145 patients) which evaluated two NULOJIX dosage regimens similar, but slightly different, from those of Studies 1 and 2 (see Table 2). The total number of NULOJIX patients from these three studies (949) was compared to the pooled cyclosporine control groups from all three studies (476 patients).

Among 401 patients in Studies 1 and 2 treated with the recommended regimen of NULOJIX and the 71 patients in Study 3 treated with a very similar (but non-identical) NULOJIX regimen, there were 5 cases of PTLD: 3 in EBV seropositive patients and 2 in EBV seronegative patients. Two of the 5 cases presented with CNS involvement.

Among the 477 patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 treated with the NULOJIX regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, there were 8 cases of PTLD: 2 in EBV seropositive patients and 6 in EBV seronegative or serostatus unknown patients. Six of the 8 cases presented with CNS involvement. Therefore, administration of higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of NULOJIX is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

One of the 476 patients treated with cyclosporine developed PTLD, without CNS involvement.

All cases of PTLD reported up to 36 months post-transplant in NULOJIX- or cyclosporine-treated patients presented within 18 months of transplantation.

Overall, the rate of PTLD in 949 patients treated with any of the NULOJIX regimens was 9-fold higher in those who were EBV seronegative or EBV serostatus unknown (8/139) compared to those who were EBV seropositive (5/810 patients). Therefore NULOJIX is recommended for use only in patients who are EBV seropositive [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].

### Belatacept (Nulojix) [^112nNNPQ]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNING: POST-TRANSPLANT LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, OTHER MALIGNANCIES, AND SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Increased risk for developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), predominantly involving the central nervous system (CNS). Recipients without immunity to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are at a particularly increased risk; therefore, use in EBV seropositive patients only. Do not use NULOJIX in transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative or with unknown EBV serostatus [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of kidney transplant patients should prescribe NULOJIX. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of malignancies may result from immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)].

Use in liver transplant patients is not recommended due to an increased risk of graft loss and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) clinical variants and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) associations include endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated BL as the three clinical variants described in the WHO classification. Immunodeficiency-associated BL occurs mainly in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in individuals with congenital immunodeficiency, and in some patients following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The endemic variant is the most common form of childhood malignancy in equatorial Africa and the majority of cases are associated with EBV infection, whereas sporadic BL accounts for 1% to 2% of all adult lymphomas in the United States and Western Europe and can be associated with EBV infection in about 30% of patients.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated B-cell lymphomas — Large population-based or multicenter case-control studies have demonstrated a strong association between seropositivity for HCV and development of B-cell lymphomas, with the prevalence of HCV seropositivity consistently increased among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). In a retrospective study, persistent HCV infection remained a significant independent factor associated with development of malignant lymphomas and the achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) with interferon-based therapy may reduce the incidence of malignant lymphoma in people with HCV infection. Several published reports suggested that treatment with antivirals (typically interferon with or without ribavirin) led to regression of lymphoma, and in indolent B-cell lymphomas not requiring immediate chemoimmunotherapy, initial treatment with interferon (with or without ribavirin) appeared to induce lymphoma regression in a high proportion of patients; in remission after anti-lymphoma therapy, subsequent antiviral therapy may be associated with lower risk of disease relapse. In patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas, an earlier analysis of pooled data from GELA clinical studies (prior to the rituximab era) suggested that HCV seropositivity in patients with DLBCL was associated with significantly decreased survival outcomes due, in part, to severe hepatotoxicity, whereas subsequent studies in the rituximab era showed that HCV seropositivity was not predictive of outcomes in terms of PFS or OS, although the incidence of hepatotoxicity with chemoimmunotherapy was higher among people with HCV infection. For chronic HCV infection, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) administered with pegylated interferon and ribavirin have shown significantly higher rates of SVR in chronic carriers of HCV genotype 1, telaprevir and boceprevir are DAA approved by the FDA for the treatment (in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin) of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, and updated AASLD guidelines recommended that DAA be incorporated into standard antiviral therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1. The Panel recommends initial antiviral therapy in asymptomatic patients with HCV-positive low-grade B-cell lymphomas.

### Emapalumab-lzsg (Gamifant) [^1146Z8Ub]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

The recommended starting dose of GAMIFANT is 1 mg/kg given as a central or peripheral intravenous infusion over 1 hour twice per week (every three to four days). Doses subsequent to the initial dose may be increased based on clinical and laboratory criteria [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Administer GAMIFANT until hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is performed or unacceptable toxicity. Discontinue GAMIFANT when a patient no longer requires therapy for the treatment of HLH.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome

GAMIFANT is administered as a central or peripheral intravenous infusion over 1 hour according to the dosage schedule in Table 1. Doses may be increased based on clinical and laboratory criteria [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Discontinue GAMIFANT when a patient no longer requires therapy for the treatment of HLH/MAS.

Table 1. GAMIFANT Dosage in Patients with HLH/MAS

2.3 Monitoring to Assess Safety

Before Initiating GAMIFANT Treatment

Conduct testing for latent tuberculosis infections using the purified protein derivative (PPD) or IFNγ release assay and evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors prior to initiating GAMIFANT. Administer tuberculosis prophylaxis to patients at risk for tuberculosis, or known to have a positive PPD test result, or positive IFNγ release assay.

During GAMIFANT Treatment

Monitor for Herpes Zoster infection, adenovirus, EBV and CMV as clinically indicated.

2.4 Prophylaxis and Concomitant Medication Information

Prophylaxis

Consider prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and for fungal infections prior to GAMIFANT administration.

Concomitant Medications

For primary HLH patients who are not receiving baseline dexamethasone treatment, begin dexamethasone at a daily dose of at least 5 mg/m2to 10 mg/m2the day before GAMIFANT treatment begins. For patients who were receiving baseline dexamethasone, they may continue their regular dose provided the dose is at least 5 mg/m2. Dexamethasone can be tapered according to the judgment of the treating physician [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Dose Modification Based on Response for Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

The GAMIFANT dose may be titrated up if disease response is unsatisfactory (see Table 2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After the patient's clinical condition is stabilized, decrease the dose to the previous level to maintain clinical response.

In clinical studies with RETHYMIC, 4 out of 4 patients with preexisting CMV infection prior to treatment with RETHYMIC died. The benefits/risks of treatment should be considered prior to treating patients with pre-existing CMV infection.

5.6	 Malignancy

Because of the underlying immune deficiency, patients who receive RETHYMIC may be at risk of developing post-treatment lymphoproliferative disorder (blood cancer). The infant tissue donor is screened for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but patients should be tested for EBV and CMV using PCR prior to and 3 months following treatment with RETHYMIC, or after any exposure to or suspected infection with CMV or EBV.

### Tacrolimus extended-release capsules (tacrolimus) [^114woX2X]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus extended-release capsules, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit exposure to sunlight and UV light by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in patients who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.

5.2 Serious Infections

Immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus extended-release capsules, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include:

Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (especially due to BK virus infection)
JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.

Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.3 Increased Mortality in Female Liver Transplant Patients

In a clinical trial of 471 liver transplant patients randomized to tacrolimus extended-release capsules or tacrolimus immediate-release product, mortality at 12 months was 10% higher among the 76 female patients (18%) treated with tacrolimus extended-release capsules compared to the 64 female patients (8%) treated with tacrolimus immediate-release product. Tacrolimus extended-release capsules is not approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients who received a liver transplant.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) — treatment options and antiviral therapy: Treatment approaches are largely dependent on the PTLD subtype, and published reports have included reduction in immunosuppression (RI), antiviral therapy, rituximab monotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or chemoimmunotherapy regimens. The optimal treatment for PTLD is not well defined due to the lack of randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneity of the disease, and survival outcomes are significantly inferior for patients with DLBCL-type PTLD who achieve event-free survival at 24 months (EFS24; defined as no progression/treatment or death related to any cause within 24 months of diagnosis) compared to de novo DLBCL who achieve a EFS24 because of increased mortality secondary to comorbidities. The role of antiviral therapy is controversial since the majority of PTLD are associated with latent EBV; replicating EBV DNA has been reported in about 40% of EBV associated lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised patients, and antiviral drugs targeting EBV replication may be beneficial in the subset of patients with early or polymorphic PTLD.

### Tacrolimus [^112GGc6C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, examine patients for skin changes; exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.

5.2 Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including tacrolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include:

- Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection

- JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

- **Cytomegalovirus infections**: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor disease are at higher risk of developing CMV viremia and CMV disease.

Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.3 Not Interchangeable with Extended-Release Tacrolimus Products-Medication Errors

Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between tacrolimus immediate-release products and tacrolimus extended-release products were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions due to under-or overexposure to tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is not interchangeable or substitutable for tacrolimus extended-release products. Changes between tacrolimus immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms must occur under physician supervision. Instruct patients and caregivers to recognize the appearance of tacrolimus dosage forms [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)] and to confirm with the healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed.

MEDICATION GUIDE

NULOJIX (noo-LOJ-jiks)

(belatacept)

For Injection, For Intravenous Use

Read this Medication Guide before you start receiving NULOJIX and before each treatment. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about NULOJIX?

NULOJIX increases your risk of serious side effects, including:

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). PTLD is a condition that can happen if certain white blood cells grow out of control after an organ transplant because your immune system is weak. PTLD can get worse and become a type of cancer. PTLD can lead to death.

People treated with NULOJIX have a higher risk of getting PTLD. If you get PTLD with NULOJIX you are at especially high risk of getting it in your brain. Your risk for PTLD is also higher if you:
have never been exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Your doctor should test you for EBV. Do not receive NULOJIX unless you are EBV positive (you have been exposed to EBV).
get an infection with a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV).
receive treatment for transplant rejection that lowers certain white blood cells called T lymphocytes.
Increased risk of getting cancers other than PTLD. People who take medicines that weaken the immune system, including NULOJIX, have a higher risk of getting other cancers, including skin cancer. Talk to your doctor about your risk for cancer. See " What should I avoid while receiving NULOJIX? "
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a rare, serious brain infection caused by JC virus. People with weakened immune systems are at risk for getting PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. There is no known prevention, treatment, or cure for PML.
Increased risk of getting other serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB) and other infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. These serious infections may lead to death. Also, a virus called BK virus can affect how your kidney works and cause your transplanted kidney to fail.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and immunosuppression — Immunosuppressive therapy along with the use of azathioprine and new agents such as belatacept in EBV-negative transplant recipients are associated with increased risks for developing PTLD following solid organ transplant (SOT). The use of ATG solely as rejection therapy prior to PTLD development was an independent prognostic factor for superior overall survival after PTLD diagnosis following SOT. In an analysis of 523 patients who underwent heart transplant, switching from calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression to sirolimus-based immunosuppression was associated with decreased rates of malignancies following heart transplant.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^115nPtHi]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) subtypes — Nondestructive PTLD consist of three histologic subtypes (plasmacytic hyperplasia PTLD, infectious mononucleosis PTLD, and florid follicular hyperplasia PTLD). Nondestructive PTLD typically develop within a year of transplantation and are EBV-positive in almost all instances. Monomorphic PTLD appear to be the most common subtype of PTLD and the majority are of B-cell origin with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most frequent subtype; monomorphic PTLD of T-cell or natural killer (NK)-cell origin tend to occur later after a median of 6 years following transplant in one series, with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) the most prevalent subtype followed by anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL); and indolent B-cell lymphomas in transplant recipients are not included among PTLD except for EBV-positive marginal zone lymphomas. Polymorphic PTLD are mostly EBV positive, can be either polyclonal or monoclonal, and are the most common type of PTLD among children.

### For healthcare providers… [^1113L8ex]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

For Healthcare Providers Epstein-Barr virus can cause illnesses and complications aside from infectious mononucleosis. People with weakened immune systems may develop more severe symptoms and complications from EBV infection. They may also have more severe illness caused by EBV infection. Nervous System EBV infection can affect a person's brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Hematological System EBV infection can affect a person's blood and bone marrow. The virus can cause the body to produce an excessive number of white blood cells called lymphocytes. EBV can also weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight infection. Examples of some of these conditions include —
- Neutropenia with secondary infections
- Hemophagocytic syndrome
- Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia
- X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.

Other Conditions EBV infection can also cause —
- Pneumonia
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pancreatitis
- Myocarditis
- Oral cavity-oral hairy leukoplakia, which is usually seen in people infected with HIV. Cancers associated with EBV infection include —
- Burkitt's lymphoma
- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
- Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
- Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
- Other tumors including leiomyosarcomas and T-cell lymphomas.

Complications of EBV infection include —
- Peritonsillar abscesses
- Acute bacterial sinusitis
- Suppurative lymph nodes
- Mastoiditis
- Sialadenitis
- Blockage of the air passages in the nose and throat.

### Mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride (mycophenolate mofetil) [^115tbn5V]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity

Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Mycophenolate Mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving Mycophenolate Mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) variants — Endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated BL are the three clinical variants of BL described in the updated World Health Organization classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors (WHO5), and an endemic variant of DLBCL has also been described that may be associated with EBV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or John Cunningham virus (JCV) infection. BL associated with EBV infection, formerly known as "endemic variant", is more common in equatorial Africa, South America, and Papua New Guinea, and classically presents in the jaw, orbit, mesentery, and central nervous system (CNS). The sporadic variant (EBV negative) mainly occurs in North America and Europe, with EBV infection found in 15% of the BL occurring in Western countries, and most commonly presents in the abdomen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunodeficiency-associated BL occurs primarily in people living with HIV (PLWH), in individuals with inborne errors of immunology and immune deficiency/dysregulation (IEI/IDD), and in patients after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT) or with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD).

NCCN Recommendations — initial management of PTLD should be individualized by histologic subtype, and RI, if possible, should be a part of the initial treatment approach for all patients. Initial strategies include reduction of calcineurin inhibition (cyclosporin or tacrolimus) by 50% and discontinuation of antimetabolite agents (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil); discontinuation of all non-steroidal immunosuppression should be considered in patients who are critically ill with extensive and life-threatening disease. The response to RI is 20% to 80% in polyclonal or monoclonal subtypes, patients should be closely monitored during RI, graft monitoring is essential to allow for early detection of allograft rejection, and RI should be initiated and managed in coordination with the transplant team to minimize risks for graft rejection.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) after solid organ transplant (SOT) or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) — pediatric epidemiology, EBV association, and risk factors are summarized as follows: PTLD are a heterogeneous group of LPD occurring after SOT or allogeneic HCT that are related to immunosuppression and, in most cases, EBV infection. PTLD remains the most common malignancy diagnosed in children following SOT, and the incidence is higher following lung (7% to 20%), intestinal (12% to 17%) and heart (4% to 13%) transplant compared to liver (2% to 6%) and kidney transplant (1% to 7%). Early-onset PTLD (diagnosed within 1 year after SOT) are EBV-positive in the majority of patients whereas late-onset PTLD (diagnosed > 1 year after transplant) are more likely to be EBV-negative; the onset of EBV-negative pediatric PTLD was at 8.5 years following SOT in one series and survival outcomes were similar to pediatric EBV-positive PTLD. Recipient EBV-seronegativity, donor EBV-seropositivity, and increased immunosuppression after SOT are considered as risk factors, with EBV seronegativity the most important risk factor; a prospective multicenter study that included 34 pediatric patients with EBV-positive PTLD also identified recipient EBV-seronegativity and donor EBV-seropositivity as significant risk factors for PTLD following SOT. Mutations in EBV latent membrane protein 1 (EBV-LMP1) have been reported as indicators of increased risk for developing EBV-positive PTLD in children, and bone marrow and/or CNS involvement is considered a predictor of poor survival. EBV-negative PTLD are clinically and biologically distinct from EBV-positive PTLD and are characterized by complex genetic alterations similar to DLBCL in immunocompetent individuals, whereas EBV-positive PTLD are associated with minor molecular or genetic alterations.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 — Histologic transformation (Richter) workup lists essential evaluations including history and physical exam with attention to node-bearing areas (including Waldeyer's ring) and the size of liver and spleen, performance status, B symptoms, CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH and uric acid, whole body FDG-PET/CT scan or chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast of diagnostic quality, and molecular analysis to establish clonal relatedness between CLL and DLBCL cells. Useful in selected cases are unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy; multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan/echocardiogram if an anthracycline-based regimen is indicated; hepatitis B and C testing; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evaluation by EBV-latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) or Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH); pregnancy testing in patients of childbearing age; discussion of fertility preservation; and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies of CLL and histologically transformed tissue may be performed to establish the clonal relationship, and hepatitis B testing is indicated because of the risk of reactivation during treatment (eg, immunotherapy, CIT, chemotherapy, targeted therapy) with tests including HBsAg and core antibody for a patient with no risk factors; for patients with risk factors or previous history of hepatitis B, add e-antigen; if positive, check viral load and consult with gastroenterology. Fertility preservation options include sperm banking, semen cryopreservation, in IVF, or ovarian tissue or oocyte cryopreservation. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic) [^113kZ48w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Use of Myfortic during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of Myfortic during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe Myfortic. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning].

5.3 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Myfortic, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.

As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.

5.4 Serious Infections

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Myfortic, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution.

Primary CNS lymphoma — systemic therapy footnotes state: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines. Consider glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase G2) for prolonged methotrexate clearance due to methotrexate-induced renal toxicity. Hepatitis B testing is indicated because of the risk of reactivation with immunotherapy + systemic therapy. Tests include hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody for a patient with no risk factors, and for patients with risk factors or previous history of hepatitis B, add e-antigen; if positive, check viral load and consult with gastroenterologist. The NCCN Guidelines for B-Cell Lymphomas (NHDG-B 2 of 5) also have information about hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing for patients considering rituximab. Other combinations with methotrexate may be used. There are concerns about WBRT being used in the trials that evaluated these regimens, especially for patients > 65 years of age. This is a consensus opinion. There are no specific data to define length of time before development of recurrence that would indicate if retreatment with methotrexate should be attempted. Ibrutinib is associated with risk of Aspergillus infection. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Epstein-Barr virus… [^114htWgD]. publications.aap.org (2011). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Epstein-Barr virus infection results in a spectrum of diseases, with the host immune response playing a key role in shaping the clinical manifestations. Infectious mononucleosis is the prototype EBV infection and is characterized by fever, sore throat, cervical and generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and somatic complaints of fatigue and malaise. This condition generally is a benign, self-limited illness in healthy persons. In this article, the term "infectious mononucleosis" refers to the disease caused by primary EBV infection, although other agents can cause "infectious mononucleosis-like" disorders that are clinically similar to the EBV-associated disease. Aggressive, nonmalignant EBV-associated proliferations, such as virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, posttransplant lymphoproliferative syndrome, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, and oral hairy leukoplakia, occur in immunocompromised persons.

EBV also contributes to human malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and leiomyosarcoma. The history of the discovery of EBV as the cause. Comments.

B-cell lymphomas — viral hepatitis screening and risk — HBV reactivation (resulting in liver failure and death) has been reported with anti‑CD20 mAb‑based regimens, and HBV carriers with lymphoid malignancies have a high risk of HBV reactivation and disease, especially when treated with anti‑CD20 mAb‑based regimens; the Panel has included testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) as part of essential workup prior to initiation of treatment in all patients who will receive anti‑CD20 mAb‑based regimens. Large population‑based or multicenter case‑control studies have demonstrated a strong association between seropositivity for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the development of B‑cell lymphomas, with HCV seropositivity consistently increased among patients with DLBCL and MZL; HCV testing is needed in patients with high‑risk disease and in patients with splenic MZL.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^116g3HwS]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Topic 4. Malignancy after heart transplantation — burden and risk patterns are summarized as follows: ISHLT registry data demonstrates a cumulative prevalence of all types of malignancy post-heart transplantation in adults of 16% in 5-year survivors and 28% in 10-year survivors. In a recent UNOS registry analysis, donor history of malignancy was not independently associated with a change in 10-year survival, whereas a history of pretransplant malignancy in the recipient was associated with an increased risk of post-transplant malignancy, especially skin malignancies; older recipient age, male sex, and white race were also risk factors. In the pediatric age group, post-transplant malignancy is less common with a prevalence of 10% in 10-year survivors and almost exclusively due to lymphoma; posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), often driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and usually of B-cell origin, is the most common malignancy in pediatric recipients, and in pediatric heart recipients, the probability of freedom from PTLD is 98%, 95%, and 90% at 1-, 5-, and 10 years post-transplant, respectively.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^113q2SLX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity

Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving Mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^115M7cuP]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) — Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) status and biopsy guidance: Up to 50% of PTLD that develop after SOT are not associated with EBV, and EBV infection status should be evaluated using EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH), the most sensitive method; hematopathology review of all slides (with at least one paraffin block representative of the tumor) is recommended, and rebiopsy of lymph node (preferably the most FDG-avid, accessible lymph node) should be done if consult material is nondiagnostic. Although an association with EBV infection status is not required for the diagnosis of PTLD, evaluation of EBV infection status by EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) is an essential component of the diagnostic workup, and IHC for EBV-LMP1 and EBV-EBNA2 is useful to determine the EBV latency status, which could be helpful to differentiate PTLD from other EBV-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas arising in treatment-related immunodeficiency and non-immunodeficiency settings; CHL PTLD is almost always EBV-positive and are the least common of the four PTLD categories.

### Inebilizumab (Uplizna) [^111tBeyW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation

Risk of HBV reactivation has been observed with other B-cell depleting antibodies. There have been no cases of HBV reactivation in patients treated with UPLIZNA, but patients with chronic HBV infection were excluded from clinical trials. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with UPLIZNA. Do not administer UPLIZNA to patients with active hepatitis. For patients who are chronic carriers of HBV [HBsAg+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)

PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Although no confirmed cases of PML were identified in UPLIZNA clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with other B-cell depleting antibodies and other therapies that affect immune competence. In UPLIZNA clinical trials one subject died following the development of new brain lesions for which a definitive diagnosis could not be established, though the differential diagnosis included an atypical NMOSD relapse, PML, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold UPLIZNA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

Tuberculosis

Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating UPLIZNA. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of UPLIZNA in patients with a history of latent active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consult infectious disease experts regarding whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate before starting treatment.

### Tacrolimus (envarsus) [^113iJ9a8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Immunosuppressants, including ENVARSUS XR, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies,
particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to
the use of any specific agent. Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit exposure to sunlight and UV
light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), has been reported in
immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV
seronegative. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.

5.2 Serious Infections

Immunosuppressants, including ENVARSUS XR, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal
infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious
viral infections reported include:

Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (especially due to BK virus infection),
JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV
seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.

Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.3 Not Interchangeable with Other Tacrolimus Products-Medication Errors

Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between tacrolimus capsules and tacrolimus extended-release
capsules were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other
adverse reactions due to under- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. ENVARSUS XR is not interchangeable or substitutable
with tacrolimus extended-release capsules, tacrolimus capsules or tacrolimus for oral suspension. Instruct patients and
caregivers to recognize the appearance of ENVARSUS XR tablet [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)] and to confirm with their healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed or if dosing instructions have changed.

5.4 New Onset Diabetes after Transplant

ENVARSUS XR caused new onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in kidney transplant patients, which may be reversible in some patients. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk. Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat appropriately [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) — incidence and characteristics across solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are described as follows: PTLD are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas that occur after SOT or allogeneic HCT and are related to immunosuppression and often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); PTLD following SOT are of recipient origin in the majority of patients, whereas PTLD following allogeneic HCT are usually of donor origin. The incidence of PTLD following SOT varies by organ (kidney transplants, 0.8% to 2.5%; pancreatic transplants, 0.5% to 5%; liver transplants, 1% to 5.5%; heart transplants, 2.0% to 8%; lung transplants, 3% to 10%; and multiorgan and intestinal transplants, ≤ 20%). For allogeneic HCT, incidence is highest following haploidentical allogeneic HCT, especially with selective T-cell depletion (> 20%), followed by unrelated donors (4% to 10%), umbilical-cord transplants (4% to 5%), and matched, related donors (1% to 3%). About 50% of PTLD following SOT are considered late-onset PTLD (diagnosed > 1 year after transplant) and are more likely EBV-negative, and EBV-negative PTLD are more likely germinal center B-cell (GCB) type whereas EBV-positive PTLD are usually non-GCB type.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Key points
- Epstein-Barr virus can cause illnesses and complications aside from infectious mononucleosis.
- EBV infection can affect a person's brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
- People with weakened immune systems may develop more severe illness caused by EBV infection. Who is at risk People with weakened immune systems may develop more severe symptoms and complications from EBV infection. They may also have more severe illness caused by EBV infection.
- Guillain-Barré syndrome
- Acute cerebellar ataxia
- Hemiplegia
- Sleep disorders
- Psychoses EBV infection can affect a person's blood and bone marrow. The virus can cause the body to produce an excessive number of white blood cells called lymphocytes. EBV can also weaken the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight infection. Examples of some of these conditions include:

- Neutropenia with secondary infections
- Hemophagocytic syndrome
- Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia
- X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
- Burkitt's lymphoma. EBV infection can also cause:

- Pneumonia
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pancreatitis
- Myocarditis
- Oral cavity-oral hairy leukoplakia, which is usually seen in people infected with HIV For EveryoneAbout Infectious Mononucleosis.

Complications Complications of EBV infection include:

- Peritonsillar abscesses
- Acute bacterial sinusitis
- Suppurative lymph nodes
- Mastoiditis
- Sialadenitis
- Blockage of the air passages in the nose and throat.

Methotrexate — toxicity profile and risk mitigation: "Common and generally minor toxicities of methotrexate include nausea, anorexia, stomatitis, and fatigue that most often occur at the time of methotrexate administration". These effects "may be minimized by administering methotrexate by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, splitting the dose, folate supplementation, or by administering the dose with food or at bedtime". Major toxicities are "myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis". In reported fatalities, "Of 164 possible methotrexate-associated fatalities, 67 were caused by myelosuppression, 30 were caused by pulmonary fibrosis, and 8 were caused by hepatotoxicity". Pulmonary fibrosis is noted as severe and "much less common in patients with psoriasis than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis". Additional reported risks include "Hepatitis, reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), and lymphoma, especially the B-cell type that is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection", and "These observations suggest that practitioners need to maintain a high index of suspicion for these infections in patients being treated with methotrexate".

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) after solid organ transplant (SOT) — retransplantation and autologous HCT outcomes include that retransplantation is feasible in selected patients, and waiting for at least 1 year from control of PTLD to retransplantation is recommended to minimize recurrence risk. In a French cohort of 52 kidney transplant recipients who underwent 55 retransplantations, the median time from PTLD to retransplantation was 90 months and only one patient had PTLD recurrence. A retrospective analysis of 21 patients suggests autologous HCT, while a potential approach after SOT, is associated with high non-relapse mortality primarily due to infectious complications, with a median follow-up of 64 months showing 3-year PFS and OS rates of 62% and 61%, four deaths related to autologous HCT, and a 1-year NRM of 24%.

Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Immunization status and viral susceptibilities in pediatric LT candidates — Children with chronic liver disease are often not fully immunized prior to LT, and development of vaccine preventable disease (VPD) either before or after LT will increase morbidity and mortality and heighten the risk of graft injury or loss. Vaccination of household contacts provides additional protection to the child, and paralytic polio has been described in household contacts of oral polio vaccine recipients; data suggest that administration of live virus vaccines to household contacts, other than oral polio, poses minimal risk to the child. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma (posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children receiving LT; children are at highest risk if they are immunologically naive to EBV and CMV and receive a liver from a serologically positive donor, and LT candidates serologically positive for CMV remain at risk for developing post-LT CMV. Preventive strategies to reduce EBV and CMV disease post-LT include assessment of EBV and CMV status in the recipient and have significantly improved LT outcomes.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after adult liver transplantation — EBV-associated PTLD is an uncommon but serious complication of LT with an incidence in adults of 0.9% to 2.9%. Risk factors include a primary EBV infection, CMV donor-recipient mismatch or CMV disease, and augmented immunosuppression, especially with anti-lymphocyte antibodies. The diagnosis of PTLD requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in high-risk individuals who present with undiagnosed fever or unexplained lymphadenopathy or cytopenias; radiographic studies can identify sites of involvement, and the detection of EBV viremia with nucleic acid testing is not diagnostic of EBV-associated PTLD. The initial treatment of PTLD is a reduction of immunosuppression; if there is no clinical response within 2 to 4 weeks, additional therapies, including anti-CD20 humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), surgical therapy, radiation therapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, may be required, and the addition of antiviral therapy has not been proven to affect outcomes.

5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies

Immunosuppressants, including ASTAGRAF XL, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit exposure to sunlight and UV light by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in patients who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.

5.2 Serious Infections

Immunosuppressants, including ASTAGRAF XL, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include:

Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (especially due to BK virus infection)
JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.

Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.3 Increased Mortality in Female Liver Transplant Patients

In a clinical trial of 471 liver transplant patients randomized to ASTAGRAF XL or tacrolimus immediate-release product, mortality at 12 months was 10% higher among the 76 female patients (18%) treated with ASTAGRAF XL compared to the 64 female patients (8%) treated with tacrolimus immediate-release product. ASTAGRAF XL is not approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients who received a liver transplant.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^117Q8eYJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) — diagnostic workup and virology: Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast and/or whole-body PET/CT are recommended as part of initial diagnostic workup, and brain MRI may be useful in selected circumstances, especially when CNS involvement is suspected. A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram is recommended when considering anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and hepatitis B virus testing should be performed prior to initiation of treatment with immunotherapy given the potential risks for viral reactivation. For Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) assessment, SOT and HCT recipients who develop PTLD may have a higher EBV viral load than those without PTLD, and quantitative PCR amplification of EBV DNA can aid in the diagnosis as well as monitoring of treatment responses. Reported predictive values have varied for SOT at 28% to 100% (positive) and 75% to 100% (negative), and for HCT at 25% to 40% (positive) and 67% to 86% (negative). Plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are useful for measuring EBV viral load, with some studies showing plasma more sensitive; recent studies note cell-free plasma EBV DNA was a better marker than EBV DNA from PBMC; EBV serology to assess primary infection versus reactivation may be useful; CMV infection has been associated with risks for EBV-positive PTLD; and EBV PCR for cell-free plasma EBV DNA and CMV PCR can be useful for selected patients.

Consolidation was rituximab monotherapy, R-CHOP-21 (4 cycles), or 6 cycles of alternating R-CHOP/RDHA-oxaliplatin, respectively. After a median follow-up of 3 years, the ORR was 94% for the entire study population; the estimated 2-year TTP was 78% and the 2-year OS rate was 68%. In the low-risk group, the 2-year EFS rate was not significantly higher than historical CHOP in PTLD-1-ST (66% vs. 52%; p = 0.432), "suggesting that rituximab monotherapy consolidation in an expanded low-risk group (including those achieving a PR) is not superior to consolidation with CHOP chemotherapy". In the very-high group, the estimated 2-year PFS rate was 11% and the median OS was 7 months, and TEAEs were substantial.

Risk factors for developing PTLD — across transplant settings — include EBV serology mismatch (recipient EBV-negative and donor EBV-positive), organ type with highest risks for multiorgan, bowel, lung, and heart/lung transplants, intensity of induction immunosuppression, and type of immunosuppression; the risk is higher among children compared with adults due to primary EBV infection in EBV-negative organ recipients. In allogeneic HCT, unrelated or HLA-mismatched allografts, use of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and T-cell depletion of the allograft are associated with increased risks for PTLD.

### Sirolimus (rapamune) [^111ua61E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.10	Latent Viral Infections

Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Rapamune. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.7)]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy.

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Rapamune. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft.

5.11	Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis

Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.7)].

5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine

The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in liver transplant (LT) recipients — AASLD/AST practice guideline — states that PTLD should be considered in LT recipients (especially high-risk individuals) who present with unexplained fever, lymphadenopathy, or cytopenias (grade 1, level A). Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated PTLD is described as an uncommon but serious complication of LT with an incidence in adults of 0.9% to 2.9%. Reported risk factors include a primary EBV infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor-recipient mismatch or CMV disease, and augmented immunosuppression, especially with anti-lymphocyte antibodies; later onset PTLD is less likely to be EBV-associated. Clinical manifestations include lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, unexplained fever, and disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system.

### Belatacept (Nulojix) [^112Ms9S8]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1 Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder

NULOJIX-treated patients have an increased risk for developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), predominantly involving the CNS, compared to patients on a cyclosporine-based regimen [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. As the total burden of immunosuppression is a risk factor for PTLD, higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of NULOJIX and higher than recommended doses of concomitant immunosuppressive agents are not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Physicians should consider PTLD in patients reporting new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms.

EBV Serostatus

The risk of PTLD was higher in EBV seronegative patients compared to EBV seropositive patients. EBV seropositive patients are defined as having evidence of acquired immunity shown by the presence of IgG antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA).

Epstein-Barr virus serology should be ascertained before starting administration of NULOJIX, and only patients who are EBV seropositive should receive NULOJIX. Transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative, or with unknown serostatus, should not receive NULOJIX [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].

Other Risk Factors

Other known risk factors for PTLD include cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and T cell-depleting therapy. T cell-depleting therapies to treat acute rejection should be used cautiously. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seronegative may be at increased risk for PTLD compared to patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seropositive [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Since CMV seronegative patients are at increased risk for CMV disease (a known risk factor for PTLD), the clinical significance of CMV serology for PTLD remains to be determined; however, these findings should be considered when prescribing NULOJIX.

5.2 Management of Immunosuppression

Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe NULOJIX. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning].

PTLD in EBV Seropositive Subpopulation

Among the 806 EBV seropositive patients with known CMV serostatus treated with either NULOJIX regimen in Studies 1, 2, and 3, 2% (4/210) of CMV seronegative patients developed PTLD compared to 0.2% (1/596) of CMV seropositive patients. Among the 404 EBV seropositive recipients treated with the recommended dosage regimen of NULOJIX, 3 PTLD cases were detected among 99 CMV seronegative patients (3%) and there was no case detected among 303 CMV seropositive patients. The clinical significance of CMV serology as a risk factor for PTLD remains to be determined; however, these findings should be considered when prescribing NULOJIX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Other Malignancies

Malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and PTLD, were reported in Study 1 and Study 2 in 3.5% (14/401) of patients treated with the recommended NULOJIX regimen and 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with the cyclosporine control regimen. Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1.5% (6/401) of patients treated with the recommended NULOJIX regimen and in 3.7% (15/405) of patients treated with cyclosporine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy

Two fatal cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported among 1096 patients treated with a NULOJIX-containing regimen: 1 patient in clinical trials of kidney transplant (Studies 1, 2, and 3 described above) and 1 patient in a trial of liver transplant (trial of 250 patients). No cases of PML were reported in patients treated with the recommended NULOJIX regimen or the control regimen in these trials.

The kidney transplant recipient was treated with the NULOJIX regimen of higher cumulative dose and more frequent dosing than recommended, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids for two years. The liver transplant recipient was treated with 6 months of a NULOJIX dosage regimen that was more intensive than that studied in kidney transplant recipients, MMF at doses higher than the recommended dose, and corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
