## Question

How do hydrocortisone and prednisone differ?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hydrocortisone and prednisone differ, including pharmacology, potency, duration, mineralocorticoid activity, indications, HPA axis effects, practical considerations, safety, and a synthesized takeaway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental drug identities and activation requirements. Then, I should quantify relative anti-inflammatory potency and dose equivalence. Next, I will review duration of action and dosing frequency, followed by mineralocorticoid effects. After that, I need to analyze pharmacokinetics and protein binding. Then, I should examine guideline-based indications and special scenarios such as pregnancy and tapering in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. I will now evaluate HPA axis suppression and recovery, consider practical factors like adherence and cost, appraise safety and outcome data, and finally synthesize key clinical distinctions with a practical takeaway [^112H2qya] [^115wPe2B] [^115DHpmT] [^111Ve9bU].

> Let me first confirm the basic classifications. Hydrocortisone is pharmaceutical cortisol and is immediately active with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects, which is why it is the physiologic replacement standard in adrenal insufficiency, whereas prednisone is a synthetic intermediate-acting glucocorticoid prodrug that requires hepatic 11β-HSD1 conversion to prednisolone to become active, conferring a more selective glucocorticoid profile for anti-inflammatory use [^112H2qya] [^115mb83u] [^115wPe2B].

> I need to verify potency next. Standard equivalence tables designate hydrocortisone as the reference with potency 1 and prednisone/prednisolone at approximately 4, translating clinically to 5 mg prednisone being roughly equivalent to 20 mg hydrocortisone; wait, let me verify the consistency of this ratio with other sources, and yes, FDA-labeled prednisolone data support a 3–5 fold anti-inflammatory potency versus hydrocortisone, which aligns with the 4:1 convention used for systemic conversions [^112cbbz1] [^112rXHU9] [^113CXd3v].

> Now, on duration of action and dosing frequency, I should confirm half-lives and biologic behavior. Hydrocortisone's elimination half-life is about 90 minutes and it is short-acting, necessitating two to three daily doses to approximate the circadian cortisol rhythm; initially I almost equated prednisone's 1-hour prodrug half-life with clinical duration, but hold on, I should correct that to the active prednisolone half-life of around 3 hours, which supports once-daily or twice-daily dosing in many inflammatory indications as an intermediate-acting agent [^111Yb1up] [^115wPe2B] [^113mz7fe].

> I will now examine mineralocorticoid activity. Hydrocortisone retains clinically meaningful mineralocorticoid effect contributing to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and blood pressure effects, whereas prednisone and especially prednisolone, due to Δ1-dehydro modification, have minimal mineralocorticoid activity; I should double-check guideline implications, and indeed, labeling notes that mineralocorticoid supplementation may be needed when prednisone is used for adrenal replacement, which is clinically relevant in primary adrenal insufficiency [^112H2qya] [^115wPe2B] [^115zq33K] [^114k5pJh].

> Next, I should review metabolism and protein binding to understand variability. Prednisone requires hepatic activation to prednisolone, and prednisolone exhibits concentration-dependent CBG binding with non-linear clearance that accelerates at higher doses and is modestly lower in the morning, while hydrocortisone is directly active with more straightforward PK for replacement; I need to ensure I capture the clinical implication that prednisone's PK complexity can influence dose-response and tapering kinetics [^115mb83u] [^115wPe2B] [^112H2qya].

> Let me consider guideline-recommended uses. For primary adrenal insufficiency, I should confirm that hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in divided doses is first-line and that prednisolone/prednisone 3–5 mg/day can be an alternative for adherence or cost considerations; in pregnancy, hydrocortisone is preferred for fetal safety, and in glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, switching from long-acting agents to shorter-acting glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone or prednisone supports HPA axis recovery during taper [^115DHpmT] [^115XL78B] [^116JPBAd] [^111Ve9bU] [^115YqNaN].

> I will now examine HPA axis suppression and recovery. Hydrocortisone's short half-life and daytime dosing can allow periods of lower glucocorticoid exposure that better approximate circadian physiology during taper, potentially facilitating recovery; prednisone's sustained effect can produce carryover suppression, although a single morning dose suppresses less than divided dosing, and here I need to acknowledge an apparent paradox from a retrospective cohort in which prednisolone users had higher recovery rates than hydrocortisone users, but wait, let me verify confounding, and yes, those groups were not dose-matched and had baseline differences, so this should not overturn physiologic principles or guideline strategy [^111Yb1up] [^113mz7fe] [^117CkkqF].

> Next, I should review practical factors that affect real-world prescribing. Hydrocortisone's BID/TID regimens can reduce adherence and impact quality of life, though extended-release hydrocortisone formulations may mitigate this, while prednisone's once-daily simplicity often improves adherence and is generally lower cost; hold on, I should verify cost-outcome data, and observational UK data support lower cost use of prednisolone in some contexts, though patient-reported outcomes frequently cite QoL trade-offs with multi-dosing [^111Yb1up] [^116Nkihe] [^117Mz2nF].

> I need to check safety and efficacy signals across conditions. Modified-release hydrocortisone improves metabolic measures like body weight and HbA1c compared with standard regimens in adrenal insufficiency, and in severe community-acquired pneumonia, hydrocortisone has shown lower mortality versus placebo and a higher SUCRA ranking than prednisolone, yet in adrenal insufficiency cohorts overall mortality was similar between prednisolone and hydrocortisone, with a concerning signal for higher adjusted mortality with prednisolone in primary adrenal insufficiency specifically; I should also emphasize that adverse effects are dose- and duration-dependent across agents, with hydrocortisone's mineralocorticoid action additionally predisposing to sodium retention and hypertension at higher exposures [^1165A4ai] [^114eWhAi] [^117Mz2nF] [^114o24VM].

> Let me synthesize the key clinical differences before concluding. Hydrocortisone is physiologic cortisol with meaningful mineralocorticoid activity and short-acting kinetics ideal for adrenal replacement, whereas prednisone is a synthetic prodrug to prednisolone with roughly fourfold glucocorticoid potency and minimal mineralocorticoid activity favoring anti-inflammatory use; prednisone's hepatic activation and non-linear PK can complicate tapering, while hydrocortisone's shorter action can align with circadian recovery, and guideline consensus still places hydrocortisone first-line for primary adrenal insufficiency with prednisone/prednisolone reasonable alternatives when adherence or cost limits optimal replacement, with emerging evidence suggesting metabolic benefits for modified-release hydrocortisone in selected patients [^112cbbz1] [^115wPe2B] [^115DHpmT] [^1165A4ai].

> Final clinical takeaway: Use hydrocortisone when the goal is physiologic cortisol replacement, especially in primary adrenal insufficiency and in pregnancy, typically 15–25 mg/day divided BID/TID, recognizing its mineralocorticoid contribution and the potential role for extended-release formulations; use prednisone when the goal is pharmacologic anti-inflammatory effect requiring higher potency and simpler once-daily dosing, remembering that 5 mg prednisone is approximately equivalent to 20 mg hydrocortisone and that mineralocorticoid supplementation may be necessary if prednisone is used for adrenal replacement, and during glucocorticoid taper from long-acting agents, consider switching to hydrocortisone or prednisone and taper slowly as physiologic doses are approached to support HPA recovery and minimize withdrawal [^115DHpmT] [^112cbbz1] [^115zq33K] [^111Ve9bU] [^112zPiSU] [^113uLZzA] [^116JPBAd].

Hydrocortisone and prednisone differ in **potency and duration**: hydrocortisone is a short-acting, lower-potency [^112cbbz1] glucocorticoid with significant mineralocorticoid activity [^112H2qya], which makes it the first-line choice for adrenal insufficiency replacement therapy [^115DHpmT]. Prednisone is an intermediate-acting [^112cbbz1], higher-potency glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity [^115wPe2B], used primarily for **anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive** therapy [^115zq33K] in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Prednisone requires hepatic activation to prednisolone [^115mb83u], so hydrocortisone is preferred in liver impairment. Prednisone's longer half-life allows **once-daily dosing** [^112cbbz1], whereas hydrocortisone typically requires multiple daily doses [^111Yb1up]. Both can cause adrenal suppression and metabolic side effects [^114o24VM], but prednisone's higher potency increases the risk of HPA axis suppression with prolonged use [^111Ve9bU].

| **Parameter** | **Hydrocortisone** | **Prednisone** |
|-|-|-|
| Potency | Lower (reference standard) [^112cbbz1] | Higher (≈4× hydrocortisone) [^112cbbz1] |
| Duration of action | Short-acting (8–12 h) [^111Eg3UJ] | Intermediate-acting (12–36 h) [^112cbbz1] |
| Mineralocorticoid activity | Significant [^112SfM4w] | Minimal [^115wPe2B] |
| Clinical use | Adrenal insufficiency replacement [^115DHpmT] | Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive [^115zq33K] |
| Hepatic activation | Not required | Required (prodrug) [^115mb83u] |
| Dosing frequency | Multiple daily doses [^111Yb1up] | Once daily [^112cbbz1] |
| HPA axis suppression | Lower risk | Higher risk with prolonged use [^111Ve9bU] |

---

In practice, **hydrocortisone is used for adrenal replacement** [^115DHpmT], whereas prednisone is favored for anti-inflammatory therapy [^115zq33K] and convenient once-daily dosing [^112cbbz1].

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115DHpmT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically with respect to corticosteroid replacement, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/day PO, divided into two or three doses daily) or cortisone acetate (20–35 mg PO, divided into two or three doses daily) as initial therapy. The highest dose should be given in the morning upon awakening, with the next dose in the early afternoon (two hours after lunch for a two-dose regimen) or at lunch and again in the afternoon (for a three-dose regimen).

### Extended-release hydrocortisone formulations — is there a clinically meaningful benefit [^111Yb1up]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Despite best practice replacement therapy with corticosteroids, patients with adrenal insufficiency report diminished quality of life and face increased mortality and morbidity. Conventional formulations of hydrocortisone have short half-lives (about 90 minutes), requiring multiple dosing during the day. Since 2011, extended-release hydrocortisone (ER-HC) formulations have been available, enabling once-, sometimes twice-daily dosing. Most studies comparing ER-HC formulations with conventional hydrocortisone therapy report reductions in body weight, blood pressure, and glucose levels, along with improved quality of life. However, it is still unclear if the reported beneficial effects are due to differences in cortisol exposure or alterations in pharmacokinetics. Here, we review studies comparing conventional and ER-HC treatment in adrenal insufficiency and discuss whether these novel formulations are safe and offer clinically significant benefits.

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^115wPe2B]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are crucial in understanding the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapies. Structural changes in the basic steroid nucleus and its side groups determine the pharmacological differences between long-acting glucocorticoids regarding bioavailability, GR and MR interaction, and genomic modulation. A decisive structural characteristic is the polarity of the substituent in position 6 or 16. Potency is stimulated by 6-α methyl and 16-methylene hydrophobic substitution, by the Δ1-dehydro-configuration (prednisolone), and by 6α and 9α-fluorination (dexamethasone). The first two mechanisms also attenuate mineralocorticoid potency; hence, prednisone and prednisolone exert minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and dexamethasone has none.

Once in the bloodstream, 60% of the prednisolone binds to CBG, and 99% of dexamethasone binds to albumin. Therefore, dexamethasone has protein-bound fractions (60–70%) that are concentration-independent, whereas prednisolone is concentration-dependent, with an affinity ranging from 90% in lower concentrations to 60% in higher ones. Protein binding patterns create non-linear pharmacokinetics, with higher doses generating more rapid clearance rates. An increase in intravenous dose administration from 5 mg of prednisolone to 40 mg corresponds to a 75% increase in clearance. The moment of administration also influences prednisolone clearance, which is lower by up to 25% in the morning.

Inactivation occurs through the hepatic reduction of the Δ double bond and the 3-keto group, followed by glucuronidation and sulfation. The elimination half-life is 1 hour for prednisone, 3 hours for prednisolone, and 4 hours for dexamethasone.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes individuals to a more pronounced suppression of the HPA axis and subsequent impairment of adrenocortical function. This occurs due to the continuous and non-circadian effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically.

Long-acting glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even at physiologic daily dose equivalents, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during tapering. In the context of continuous administration of these drugs, HPA axis recovery is impossible. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids, due to their shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency, are more likely to enable HPA recovery, provided they are not administered at nighttime. Nighttime administration can more significantly inhibit ACTH production and impede the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer necessary, it is recommended to switch to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to support the recovery of the HPA axis. For patients using non-oral glucocorticoids, such as inhaled steroids, who are at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, transitioning to short-acting oral glucocorticoids is advisable once non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer required. Prednisone and hydrocortisone offer a wider range of available doses, allowing for more tailored patient management.

### Potency and duration of action of glucocorticoids. Effects of hydrocortisone, prednisone and dexamethasone on human pituitary-adrenal function [^112cbbz1]. The American Journal of Medicine (1977). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Steroid Dose Conversion" is used to ensure safe and effective dose equivalence during steroid conversions by leveraging the standard relative potencies of corticosteroids. These corticosteroids differ in potency, duration of action, and mineralocorticoid activity.

The Steroid Conversion Calculator helps convert a user's steroid dose to an equivalent dose of a different steroid. This conversion assists medical professionals in aligning treatments with the intended therapeutic effects when switching from one corticosteroid to another. For this conversion, the user must provide three inputs: the type of the steroid, the dose of that steroid in milligrams (mg), and the target steroid they wish to convert to.

The available steroid types for both initial and target steroids are:

- **Hydrocortisone**
- **Cortisone**
- **Prednisone**
- **Prednisolone**
- **Methylprednisolone**
- **Dexamethasone**
- **Betamethasone**
- **Triamcinolone**

The relative potencies of these steroids compared to hydrocortisone (assigned a potency of 1) are as follows:

| **Steroid** | **Relative potency** |
|-|-|
| Hydrocortisone | 1 |
| Cortisone | 0.8 |
| Prednisone | 4 |
| Prednisolone | 4 |
| Methylprednisolone | 5 |
| Dexamethasone | 25 |
| Betamethasone | 25 |
| Triamcinolone | 5 |

The computation for the equivalent dose begins by extracting the potencies of the initial and target steroids from the table.

### Prednisone [^115zq33K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prednisone tablets, USP, are indicated for use in the following conditions:

- **Endocrine disorders**: Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the first choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and nonsuppurative thyroiditis.

- **Rheumatic disorders**: As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, where selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy), ankylosing spondylitis, acute and subacute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, acute gouty arthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, synovitis of osteoarthritis, and epicondylitis.

- **Collagen diseases**: During an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic dermatomyositis (polymyositis), and acute rheumatic carditis.

- **Dermatologic diseases**: For conditions such as pemphigus, bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, severe psoriasis, and severe seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Allergic states**: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions that are intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment.

### Prednisolone versus dexamethasone for croup: A randomized controlled trial [^112LUMHy]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Use of either prednisolone or low-dose dexamethasone in the treatment of childhood croup lacks a rigorous evidence base despite widespread use. In this study, we compare dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg with both low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg.

- **Methods**: Prospective, double-blind, noninferiority randomized controlled trial based in one tertiary pediatric emergency department and one urban district emergency department in Perth, Western Australia. Inclusions were age > 6 months, maximum weight 20 kg, contactable by telephone, and English-speaking caregivers. Exclusion criteria were known prednisolone or dexamethasone allergy, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, steroid therapy or enrollment in the study within the previous 14 days, and a high clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A total of 1252 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg; n = 410), low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg; n = 410), or prednisolone (1 mg/kg; n = 411). Primary outcome measures included Westley Croup Score 1-hour after treatment and unscheduled medical re-attendance during the 7 days after treatment.

- **Results**: Mean Westley Croup Score at baseline was 1.4 for dexamethasone, 1.5 for low-dose dexamethasone, and 1.5 for prednisolone. Adjusted difference in scores at 1 hour, compared with dexamethasone, was 0.03 (95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.15) for low-dose dexamethasone and 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.17) for prednisolone. Re-attendance rates were 17.8% for dexamethasone and 19.5% for low-dose.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^114hwxW8]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids exert pleiotropic effects on all tissues to regulate cellular and metabolic homeostasis. Synthetic forms are used therapeutically in a wide range of conditions for their anti-inflammatory benefits, albeit with dose- and duration-dependent side effects. There is significant variability between tissues, disease states, and individuals regarding both the beneficial and deleterious effects. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is the site of action for these hormones, and a vast body of work has been conducted to understand its function.

Traditionally, it was thought that the anti-inflammatory benefits of glucocorticoids were mediated by transrepression of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, while the adverse metabolic effects resulted from direct transactivation. This canonical understanding of the GR function has been brought into question over the past two decades. Advances in the resolution of scientific techniques and the discovery of multiple isoforms of the receptor present in most tissues have contributed to this reassessment. Here, we review the structure and function of the GR, the nature of the receptor isoforms, and the contribution of the receptor to glucocorticoid sensitivity or resistance in health and disease.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^116RSd7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

All glucocorticoids (GCs), both endogenous and synthetic, bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with differing potencies, and they have various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Many GCs can also activate the mineralocorticoid (MC) receptor (MR) to varying degrees. There are numerous routes of administration, including oral, intravenous, inhaled, and topical. Consequently, there is a vast array of available drugs and formulations. The precise choice of agent is determined by its clinical utility and efficacy, which must be balanced against the potential for adverse effects.

Steroidal synthetic GCs are structurally related to hydrocortisone (cortisol) but are often modified to bind to the GR with higher affinity, to have more potent GC actions, or to possess a prolonged half-life. Most synthetic GCs are 21-carbon polycyclic compounds with a basic steroid structure. This includes a fused 17-carbon atom ring system, an aliphatic side chain at carbon-17, a keto-group at carbon-3, one or two double bonds in the A-ring, and an oxygen at carbon-11. Differences in GR and MR activation are determined by the side groups. GC potency is increased by an 11-hydroxy group, while MC potency is enhanced by a 9α or a 6α-fluoro substituent. Conversely, a hydrophilic substituent at position 16 decreases both MC and GC properties. The metabolism of GCs, both endogenous and synthetic, is crucial in determining their ability to activate both GR and MR.

### Prednisone [^117PuJ1E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Certain corticosteroids, due to their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy. Examples include dexamethasone and betamethasone.

The adrenal cortex exhibits maximal activity between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m., with minimal activity occurring between 4 p.m. and midnight. Administering exogenous corticosteroids during periods of maximal activity results in the least suppression of adrenocortical activity.

When using alternate day therapy (ADT), it is crucial to tailor treatment to the individual patient, as complete symptom control may not be achievable for all. Educating patients on the benefits of ADT can help them understand and tolerate potential symptom flare-ups in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Additional symptomatic therapy might be necessary during this time.

In case of an acute flare-up of the disease, resumption of a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose may be required for effective control. Once the disease is managed, alternate day therapy can be reinstated.

While ADT can minimize many undesirable effects of corticosteroid therapy, clinicians must carefully consider the benefit-risk ratio for each patient undergoing corticoid therapy.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend considering switching long-acting corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, to shorter-acting corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone or prednisone, when long-acting corticosteroids are no longer needed.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^116YSvLq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

The critical functions of glucocorticoids for survival involve the presence of receptors for these molecules in the regulation of gene transcription processes. The glucocorticoid receptor can function at least at three levels: first, recruitment of the general transcription machinery; second, modulation of transcription factor action through direct protein–protein interactions; and third, modulation of chromatin structure to allow the assembly of other gene regulatory proteins and the general transcription machinery on the DNA. Interactions between corticosteroid receptors and target genes, especially the ones related to the immune system, seem to be among the mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects observed with pharmacological doses of these medications.

In addition to the genomic effects, glucocorticoids have non-genomic actions of significant therapeutic relevance. These effects are mediated by three different mechanisms: physicochemical interactions with cellular membranes, membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects, and cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects. Although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood, the non-genomic actions of glucocorticoids may play a role in the management of inflammatory diseases.

Since 1950, when cortisol was first synthesized, several studies have been carried out with the aim of synthesizing a steroid with specific anti-inflammatory action. It quickly became clear that it was possible to alter the steroid molecule so that the glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid actions could be…

### Do we need to administer fludrocortisone in addition to hydrocortisone in adult patients with septic shock? An updated systematic review with Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and an observational study with target trial emulation [^113MJPUG]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: Is administering fludrocortisone in addition to hydrocortisone to adult patients with septic shock necessary?

	- **Findings**: We conducted an updated systematic review using a Bayesian network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone alone, or placebo in adult patients with septic shock. Among the tested therapies, hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone showed the highest likelihood of improving short-term survival.

	- **Meaning**: On the basis of the aforementioned evidence, the combined administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone may be considered for adult patients with septic shock.

Despite the implementation of aggressive treatment approaches, septic shock continues to exhibit high mortality rates exceeding 30% in numerous studies. This is mainly due to the activation of proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways. Corticosteroids have been considered as a potential strategy for modulating the dysregulated immune response associated with septic shock.

Growing concerns among intensivists are centered around critical-illness-related corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies. The International Guideline of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign conditionally recommended the administration of IV hydrocortisone at a typical dose of 200 mg/d to adult patients with septic shock necessitating vasopressor support. However, the 2020 Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sepsis and Septic Shock proposed the adjunctive use of fludrocortisone with hydrocortisone based on a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials.

### Solu-Medrol [^114McPoe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily utilized for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.

Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects and modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Methylprednisolone is a potent anti-inflammatory steroid with greater anti-inflammatory potency than prednisolone and even less tendency than prednisolone to induce sodium and water retention.

Methylprednisolone sodium succinate has the same metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions as methylprednisolone. When administered parenterally and in equimolar quantities, the two compounds are equivalent in biologic activity. Following the intravenous injection of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, demonstrable effects are evident within one hour and persist for a variable period. Excretion of the administered dose is nearly complete within 12 hours; thus, if constantly high blood levels are required, injections should be made every 4 to 6 hours. This preparation is also rapidly absorbed when administered intramuscularly and is excreted in a pattern similar to that observed after intravenous injection.

### Drug insight: Selective agonists and antagonists of the glucocorticoid receptor [^113p6Bfb]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid hormones exert a wide spectrum of metabolic and immunological effects. They function through the glucocorticoid receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Glucocorticoids are particularly effective as anti-inflammatory agents but often cause severe side effects.

The structure of the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor has now been elucidated. A series of studies have shown that even subtle changes to the ligand structure alter the final conformation of the ligand-receptor complex, with consequences for both protein recruitment and the function of the receptor. This has led to concerted efforts to find selective ligands for the glucocorticoid receptor that preserve the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity but reduce the side-effect profile.

The direct healthcare benefits of such a simple, safe, orally active agent targeting the underlying inflammatory process in, for example, rheumatoid arthritis would be considerable in terms of reduced patient suffering. Furthermore, the indirect benefits in terms of reducing the costs of therapeutic delivery and preventing loss of productivity would be even greater.

### Prednisone [^113mz7fe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing's disease, which is a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, and electrolyte imbalance. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be observed during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It appears that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle, with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night, may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels, even for short periods, may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects.

During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited, leading to suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity varies depending on the dose and duration of treatment. During this time, the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) compared to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, evidence suggests that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may carry over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been demonstrated that a single dose of certain corticos

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111XJUZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is related to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral corticosteroids (OCS) used, such as bioavailability, protein-binding affinities, plasma half-life, and metabolic inactivation and clearance. Repeat courses of OCS are also a risk factor for AI. Patients with a predisposition to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, due to other underlying conditions or medications, may be particularly susceptible to AI caused by OCS. Nevertheless, the risk of AI can be mitigated, though not entirely eliminated, by employing the lowest effective dosage of OCS for the shortest duration necessary.

Although the absolute risk of developing AI following a short course of OCS is often assumed to be low, clinically relevant HPA axis suppression may be significantly under-recognized and under-reported in clinical practice. In a study by Schuetz and colleagues, a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids (40 mg methylprednisolone injection followed by 13 days of 40 mg oral prednisone) led to HPA axis suppression, as assessed by response to the 1 µg corticotropin (synthetic ACTH 1–24) stimulation test, in 7 of 9 patients on the first day following commencement of corticosteroid treatment; this increased to 8 of 9 by the last day of therapy. Moreover, 21 days after discontinuation of treatment, 3 patients still exhibited evidence of adrenal dysfunction. Although all 9 patients had an underlying diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5 were on inhaled corticosteroids at the time of admission, none had received systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 6 months.

Perhaps even more compelling are the…

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^116DvVeH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In therapeutic uses, the dosage of glucocorticoids is disease-specific and often protocol-driven. For systemic, high-dose glucocorticoids used to treat autoimmune or inflammatory diseases or in organ transplantation, regimens typically begin at moderate to high doses, with or without an initial very high-dose induction "pulse". Many regimens use a 1 mg/kg prednisolone equivalent starting dose and wean down over time, often over months. Reduction in dosage is dependent on clinical or biochemical measures of underlying disease activity and/or the emergence of side effects, with consideration of HPA axis suppression once approaching physiological dosing. The addition of alternative immunosuppressants is often used to reduce steroid exposure. Alternatively, in oncology regimens, high doses of glucocorticoids are delivered intermittently to coincide with cytotoxic medications.

For many of these uses, aside from the initial weight-based commencement dose, little consideration is made to interindividual sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Currently, there is no mechanism or biomarker to assess the extent of glucocorticoid activity, which is likely to result in many patients being unnecessarily exposed to excess glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a key regulator of glucocorticoid sensitivity, and further understanding of how it does so may provide a promising avenue by which to assess an individual's sensitivity.

### Update on glucocorticoid action and resistance [^116uBHnc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Extensive development of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids has resulted in highly potent molecules that have been optimized to target activity to the lung and minimize systemic exposure. These have proved highly effective for most asthmatic subjects. However, despite these developments, there are a number of subjects with asthma who fail to respond to even high doses of inhaled or oral glucocorticoids.

Advances in delineating the fundamental mechanisms of glucocorticoid pharmacology, especially the concepts of transactivation, transrepression, and cofactor recruitment, have resulted in a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. The existence of multiple mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity raises the possibility that this might indeed reflect various diseases with a common phenotype. Studies examining the efficacy of potential new agents should be targeted toward subgroups of patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant asthma, who clearly require effective new drugs and other approaches to improved asthma control.

### A retrospective study on weaning glucocorticoids and recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^117CkkqF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there is only one study comparing the reactivation of the HPA axis between patients on prednisolone and hydrocortisone. Although comparing the weaning success between the two glucocorticoids was not the primary aim of their study, the authors reported a recovery rate in the prednisolone group higher than in the hydrocortisone group (71% vs. 27%). However, it was a retrospective study of rheumatology patients who were not matched for glucocorticoid doses, and the mean baseline cortisol in the hydrocortisone group was lower than in the prednisolone group, limiting the direct comparison between the two glucocorticoids. In addition, little information was provided on potential confounding factors.

In our study, we questioned whether converting patients on long-term prednisolone, who were symptomatic on physiological dosing and who failed their AST, to hydrocortisone had any impact on their rate of recovery. In our dose-matched analysis between these patients and those on long-term prednisolone, converting to hydrocortisone did not improve the recovery rate. This was irrespective of there being no difference in the duration of glucocorticoids, underlying etiology, or mean baseline cortisol/ACTH between the groups. There were more females (non-significant) in the hydrocortisone group; however, this is unlikely to have impacted on tertiary AI rate recovery as there is no such reported association in the literature. We also found that there was a statistical difference in the use of opioids between the groups, but all the users were in our prednisolone rather than hydrocortisone group. Nonetheless, our analysis…

### Factors impacting on the action of glucocorticoids in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy [^11625w1s]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones essential for life. They are secreted by the adrenal cortex under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoids are crucial for the normal functioning of most organ systems, with both excess and deficiency leading to significant adverse consequences.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by insufficient production of corticosteroid hormones.

- **Primary adrenal insufficiency**: Defined by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids despite normal or increased adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH).

- **Secondary adrenal insufficiency**: Adrenal hypofunction due to an insufficient amount of ACTH produced by the pituitary gland.

Conventional treatment for both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiencies involves lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. The role of cortisol deficiency and the impact of hydrocortisone replacement on morbidity and mortality in this patient group are under increasing scrutiny. Established glucocorticoid replacement regimens do not completely mirror endogenous hormonal production, and their monitoring to ensure optimum therapy is hampered by the lack of reliable biomarkers of hormone sufficiency.

A further confounding issue is the tissue-specific regulation of glucocorticoids through the two isozymes of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). Research is focusing on the role of this pre-receptor regulation in the development of adverse metabolic features in patients. This review defines the factors involved in these processes.

### Unintended consequences: Risk of opportunistic infections associated with long-term glucocorticoid therapies in adults [^112tQE9p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widespread anti-inflammatory medications used in medical practice. The immunosuppressive effects of systemic glucocorticoids and increased susceptibility to infections are widely appreciated. However, the dose-dependent model frequently used may not accurately predict the risk of infection in all patients treated with long-term glucocorticoids. In this review, we examine the risks of opportunistic infections (OIs) in patients requiring glucocorticoid therapy by evaluating the influence of glucocorticoid dose, duration, and potency, combined with biological and host clinical factors and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy.

We propose strategies to prevent OIs, which involve screening, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and immunizations. While this review focuses on patients with autoimmune, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases, the potential risks and preventative strategies are likely applicable to other populations. Clinicians should actively assess the benefit-harm ratios of systemic glucocorticoids and implement preventive efforts to decrease their associated infection complications.

### Glucocorticoids: Action and new therapeutic insights in rheumatoid arthritis [^111gdUCT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

To summarize the mechanism of action of glucocorticoids, the direction that research is taking, and what this might mean for clinicians, new cellular actions of glucocorticoids have been identified and offer new drug targets. There is increasing competition to find a glucocorticoid formulation or analogue that enhances therapeutic effects while reducing adverse effects. Clinically, there is increasing evidence for the disease-modifying effects of glucocorticoids, which makes these developments topical and relevant. A better understanding of the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis and the circadian variation in symptoms, a hallmark of the disease, may also affect the way we use these drugs.

Glucocorticoids are about to enter a renaissance based on a better understanding of how they work and novel approaches to new therapeutic targets.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the metabolic effects of modified-release hydrocortisone versus standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy in adults with adrenal insufficiency [^1165A4ai]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Published studies explore the metabolic effects of modified-release hydrocortisone (MR-HC) replacement in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI). The objective is to compare the metabolic effects of MR-HC with standard glucocorticoid (SG) replacement in adults with AI. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were meta-analyzed, while non-RCT studies were described narratively with critical appraisal.

Data was sourced from PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL to identify relevant articles published before August 2019. The study selection included all study types that reported metabolic profiles — such as anthropometric, glucose, and lipid-related parameters — on patients switched from SG to MR-HC replacement. Following independent screening by two reviewers, 390 studies were identified, of which 9 studies were included for review (RCT, n = 2; non-RCT, n = 7).

Two independent reviewers assessed each paper for bias and data extraction. The meta-analysis from RCTs (n = 2) involved 104 patients switched from SG to MR-HC replacement. At 3 months post-therapy switch, combining treatment effects showed a significant reduction in body weight (-0.82 kg; 95% CI: -1.24 kg to -0.40 kg; P < .001) and HbA1c (-0.13%; 95% CI: -0.214% to -0.045%; p = 0.003). In the subgroup with diabetes mellitus (DM), the reduction in HbA1C was more pronounced (-0.52%; 95% CI: -0.82% to -0.23%; P < .001). Non-RCT studies demonstrated improved anthropometric measures and glucose metabolism up to 48 months following the switch from SG to MR-HC replacement.

In conclusion, in adults with AI, replacement with MR-HC as…

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^112dbcVm]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Physiologically, the overarching function of glucocorticoids on the immune system is to enhance innate immunity and control inflammation, supporting efficient clearance of pathogens while limiting tissue damage and preventing an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response, thereby returning homeostasis. These contrasting pro- and anti-inflammatory effects are determined by the cell type, cellular activation state, stage of the inflammatory response, and dosage of glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoids are involved in enhancing the innate immune response through upregulation of some pattern-recognition receptors (toll-like receptor 2 [TLR2]; NOD-like receptors [NLR]P1, NLRP3, NLRC4) to enhance recognition of evolutionarily conserved pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs). This increases activation of transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and subsequent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a synergistic fashion to aid with chemotaxis and initiation of the immune and acute-phase response to an insult. The resultant secretion of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α enhances glucocorticoid secretion, providing a feed-forward mechanism to limit inflammation.

Subsequent direct inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB and upregulation of their inhibitors by glucocorticoids downregulates the inflammatory response. In the resolution phase of inflammation, glucocorticoids impair neutrophil recruitment and stimulate neutrophil and lymphocyte apoptosis with recruitment and activation of macrophages.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: Isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^115mb83u]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Over time, there has been the development and discovery of a wide range of glucocorticoids with varying potencies, degrees of mineralocorticoid activity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Hydrocortisone is the pharmacologic name for cortisol, and progressive alterations of the molecule have yielded a range of synthetic glucocorticoids. The common feature among these is a 17-carbon androstane structure consisting of three hexane rings and one pentane ring, with a hydroxyl group at carbon-11 being critical for glucocorticoid activity. Cortisone acetate and prednisone are inactive precursors requiring conversion by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) to become the active forms, hydrocortisone and prednisolone, respectively.

Adverse effects from glucocorticoid treatment are predictable and dose- and duration-dependent. They contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in those being treated. In hormone replacement for adrenal insufficiency, traditional doses were supraphysiological, based on earlier estimates of endogenous cortisol production. More recent studies have focused on replicating the 5 to 8 mg/m² (body surface area) per day. Guidelines recommend hydrocortisone 15 to 25 mg per day, with consideration of weight-based dosing for some patients. Weight-based dosing and administration of hydrocortisone in the fasted state have been shown to reduce cortisol area under the curve (AUC) variability and to provide levels closer to physiological replacement than fixed dosing.

### The optimal use of steroids in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: no easy answers [^1167Vdxh]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are an integral component of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but usage differs between cooperative group protocols. All groups use glucocorticoids during induction but vary on whether to use dexamethasone or prednisone.

- **Issues to consider in the choice of induction steroid**: Impact on event-free and overall survival, acute morbidity such as infection risk, diabetes, and behavioural disturbances, and long-term complications such as avascular necrosis. It is generally agreed that dexamethasone is the steroid of choice for groups using a delayed intensification phase, but dosing schedules (intermittent versus continuous) vary. There is no consensus on the potential benefit of steroid administration during maintenance therapy.

This review will summarize the available data on steroid use in paediatric ALL, highlighting outcomes as well as major toxicities.

### Interpretation of steroid biomarkers in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and their use in disease management [^113zpWgp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Wide variability of adrenal steroid concentrations can be observed within a 2-hour time frame after the morning hydrocortisone dose in a representative child with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD). Observed cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), as well as androstenedione (A4) concentrations were monitored over 6 hours. The shaded area depicts a 2-hour time window, 1 to 3 hours post-morning 6 mg hydrocortisone dose. Concentration levels of each adrenal steroid showed a greater than 60% change within the 2-hour time frame. The child's regular total daily hydrocortisone dose was 12 mg/m²/day.

Discordance between 17OHP and A4 concentrations can be observed, with one adrenal biomarker disproportionately high while the other remains in the normal range, all of which can confound the interpretation of disease control. In a large cohort of adults and children with 21OHD, Jha et al. found a discrepancy between 17OHP and A4 concentrations in 17% of over 2700 laboratory assessments. Among those with discrepant biomarkers, elevated serum 17OHP with A4 within the range was the most frequent finding (86%), with a higher prevalence in children (92%). Among 46 patients who either had elevated 17OHP but A4 within range or vice versa, 65% of the patients were categorized as being in good clinical control. Among the 41 patients with elevated 17OHP but A4 within the reference range, the study reported a median elevation of 11KT as high as 2.5 times relative to control; 13 of these 41 patients (28%) were in poor clinical control, indicating that abnormally high levels of 17OHP in the absence of concomitant high A4 can impact clinical assessments.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses a risk for adrenal insufficiency is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

- **Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: 3–4 weeks or greater
- **Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency**: Any dose greater than a daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

- **Physiologic daily dose equivalent**: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above-mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability.
- **Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy**: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above).
- **Short-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks' duration.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (e.g. greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose approaches the physiological daily dose equivalent (greater than the equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone — see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4).

In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiological daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

- **Suggested tapering regimen**: Depending on glucocorticoid dose.

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (e.g. 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, a taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example, transplant or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering.

Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states.

### Why is the management of glucocorticoid deficiency still controversial: a review of the literature [^1148DpSe]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

All endocrinologists aim to make glucocorticoid replacement therapy for their hypoadrenal patients as physiological as possible. Many seek a method of monitoring such treatment to confirm they are achieving this goal. Advances in our knowledge of normal physiology are relevant to our attempts to achieve this. Research indicates that the cortisol production rate in normal subjects is lower than previously believed. The normal pattern of glucocorticoid secretion includes both a diurnal rhythm and a pulsatile ultradian rhythm. Glucocorticoid access to nuclear receptors is 'gated' by the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, which interconvert active cortisol and inactive cortisone. These complexities make achieving the target of physiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy difficult.

The available evidence suggests that conventional treatment of hypoadrenal patients may result in adverse effects on some surrogate markers of disease risk, such as lower bone mineral density than age-sex matched controls, and increased postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations. Although the quality of life of hypoadrenal patients may be impaired, there is no evidence of improvement with higher doses of steroids. However, quality of life is better if the hydrocortisone dose is divided, with the highest dose taken in the morning. Thus, the evidence suggests that most patients may be safely treated with a low dose of glucocorticoid (e.g. 15 mg hydrocortisone daily) in two or three divided doses, with education about appropriate action in the event of illness.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116QSan5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids suppress HPA axis activity by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. This inhibition induced by exogenous glucocorticoids is similar to the mechanisms involved in the physiologic cortisol negative feedback. Prolonged duration of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often leads to a reduction in the overall responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland. In rodent models, glucocorticoids exert pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells. This ultimately results in atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Conversely, following withdrawal of glucocorticoids, there is a resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most instances, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate levels of cortisol. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis is highly variable.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure. Factors include the potency of the glucocorticoid, glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility. Notably, any route of administration has the potential to suppress the HPA axis.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of synthetic glucocorticoids: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Mj64S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely used drugs because of their anti-inflammatory effects, with an annual prevalence estimated at approximately 24% in 2022 in The Netherlands, including systemic, inhaled, nasal, and topical glucocorticoids. Although these drugs are very efficacious, they can be accompanied by severe side effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders such as mood changes, depression, anxiety, mania, delirium, and even suicidality, with devastating effects on quality of life.

While at low doses, many synthetic glucocorticoids do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier; their use has been associated with a higher likelihood of mood and anxiety disorders. This includes particular types of inhaled glucocorticoids. In terms of biological effects, van der Meulen et al. (2022) found associations of systemic and inhaled glucocorticoid use with reduced white matter integrity in the brain in a large sample from the UK Biobank. In addition, Kachroo et al. (2022) found systemic effects in metabolomic profiles of inhaled glucocorticoids, even in the use of low-dose glucocorticoids. Next to macroscopic and metabolomic changes, there is a plethora of neurochemical processes that may be affected by glucocorticoid medication.

The endogenous glucocorticoid hormones cortisol and corticosterone target two receptor types: the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast, synthetic glucocorticoids have been developed based on a high affinity for GR, which mediates their many and potent anti-inflammatory effects.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^114o24VM]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 2% to 3% of the population are currently prescribed systemic or topical glucocorticoid treatment. The potent anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids to deliver therapeutic benefit is not in doubt. However, the side effects associated with their use, including central weight gain, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and osteoporosis, often collectively termed iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, are associated with a significant health and economic burden.

The precise cellular mechanisms underpinning the differential action of glucocorticoids to drive the desirable and undesirable effects are still not completely understood. Faced with the unmet clinical need to limit glucocorticoid-induced adverse effects while ensuring the preservation of anti-inflammatory actions, several strategies have been pursued. The coprescription of existing licensed drugs to treat incident adverse effects can be effective, but data examining the prevention of adverse effects are limited.

Novel selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators have been designed to specifically and selectively activate anti-inflammatory responses based on their interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor. Several of these compounds are currently in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy. More recently, strategies exploiting tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism through the isoforms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase have shown early potential, although data from clinical trials are limited.

### The influence of foetal prednisone exposure on the cortisol levels in the offspring [^115pjNwq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnant women suffering from autoimmune disease use glucocorticoids; these can partly diffuse to the foetus and may influence the development of the foetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, especially in the early stages of pregnancy. The objective was to investigate whether prednisone exposure in utero influences the cortisol levels of prepubertal children.

Mothers participated in a prospective cohort study on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and pregnancy. Children were either exposed (n = 44) or non-exposed (n = 65) to prednisone in utero. Salivary cortisol levels were collected from all children during one day: at awakening, 30 minutes after awakening, 1 p.m., and at bedtime. Cortisol levels between groups were also analysed using area under the curve (AUC), cortisol awakening response (CAR), and slope.

The mean age (SD) of the children was 6.98 (1.23) years. The difference in the mean (SD) cortisol level at 1 p.m. was 5.42 nm (4.08) in the prednisone-exposed group compared to 3.97 nm (4.00) in the non-exposed group (P = 0.03). Prednisone-exposed children had a higher AUC (β = 13.28; P = 0.02), even after correcting for RA disease activity. No differences were found in CAR, slope, or blood pressure. The cortisol levels of the non-exposed were more similar to the age-specific references than those of the prednisone-exposed.

Prednisone use during pregnancy is associated with a higher daytime cortisol level in the prepubertal offspring, not yet accompanied by clinical outcomes. This conclusion will have no consequences at this moment, but it does raise questions concerning prednisone.

Summary of methods used for guideline development

The methods used for establishing the guideline have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions, followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded.

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences, including patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, and feasibility of implementation. The recommendations are worded as "recommend" for strong recommendations or "suggest" for weak recommendations. The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons — clinicians, policymakers, and patients — would want the management in accordance with the recommendation. For a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not.

Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints" section). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience were provided where formal grading was not applicable.

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency, which involves the suppression of the entire HPA axis. For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy, as well as the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients — at least 1% of the general population — is too large, with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods.

### Clinical pharmacology of corticosteroids [^111Eg3UJ]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have numerous applications in treating inflammation and diseases of immune function due to their significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. They modulate immune function through various effects in the nucleus of numerous cells. When used in pharmacological doses to suppress allergic responses or inflammation, these agents can cause numerous adverse effects associated with an excess of glucocorticoid activity.

Prolonged use (greater than two weeks) results in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, necessitating the tapering of doses. Dosing strategies for systemic corticosteroids are designed to minimize the risk of HPA axis suppression. Topical administration, including oral inhalation, is often used to avoid significant adverse effects associated with chronic use. Inhaled corticosteroids are potent synthetic agents that exert their actions locally in the airways, but can cause systemic effects based on several factors influencing systemic bioavailability.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of asthma therapy and are important options for COPD in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations. Administered nasally, they are the most effective therapy for treating moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis.

### Current practice of glucocorticoid replacement therapy and patient-perceived health outcomes in adrenal insufficiency - a worldwide patient survey [^116Vsg62]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

This international survey showed that glucocorticoid replacement regimens in adrenal insufficiency (AI) differ to some degree between countries. Three-quarters of the AI patients participating in the survey received hydrocortisone administered two or three times daily. A large majority of the participants reported that their disease and treatment have an impact on quality of life (QoL), leading to alterations in physical activity, social life, work life, and family life. Furthermore, 76% of the participants reported concerns about the long-term side effects of their treatment. These data demonstrate, from the AI patients' perspective, an obvious need for improvement in the management of AI, including the regimen of glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

Glucocorticoid treatment regimen

Overall, hydrocortisone was used by 75% of the participants, prednisone/prednisolone by 11%, cortisone acetate by 6%, and dexamethasone by 4% of the participants. A high proportion of participants (40%) in Australia reported using cortisone acetate. Among the countries with at least 20 respondents, the use of prednisone/prednisolone was most common in Canada (27%), the US (14%), and Australia (11%), while dexamethasone was most commonly used in Australia (5%) and the US (4%). The distribution of therapies was similar between patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI). The majority of the patients were on a BID (42%) or TID (32%) regimen, while 10% were on an OD regimen. Of the patients on a BID regimen, 58% took their medication in the morning and afternoon, and 42% in the morning and evening. Patients with secondary AI took their BID dosing in the morning and afternoon (39%) rather than in the morning and evening (9%). Additionally, 53% of the patients on prednisone/prednisolone were on BID and 5% on TID. For details on the treatment regimen by therapy, please see Table 2.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

A slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, the baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg of prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess. This calculation may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper. A slower taper is recommended for patients with a high clinical severity score, while a more rapid taper may be employed for patients with a lower clinical severity score. In patients with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily may be necessary.

### Medrol [^112SCi3F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

When considering alternate day therapy (ADT), several principles must be observed. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should always be applied, and the benefits of ADT should not promote the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is primarily designed for patients expecting long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy.

In less severe diseases where corticoid therapy is indicated, treatment may begin with ADT. More severe disease states generally require daily divided high-dose therapy for initial control. The initial suppressive dose should be continued until a satisfactory clinical response is obtained — usually within four to ten days for many allergic and collagen diseases. It is crucial to keep the initial suppressive dose period brief, especially if subsequent ADT use is planned.

Once control is established, two courses of action are available:

- **Course A**: Transition to ADT and gradually reduce the corticoid dosage every other day.
- **Course B**: After controlling the disease process, rapidly reduce the daily corticoid dosage to the lowest effective level, then switch to an alternate-day schedule.

Theoretically, course A may be preferable. Due to the advantages of ADT, it might be desirable to try this therapy on patients who have been on daily corticoids for extended periods, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis. Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing the transition…

### Mortality risk in patients with adrenal insufficiency using prednisolone or hydrocortisone: A retrospective cohort study [^117Mz2nF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Prednisolone has been recommended rather than hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal insufficiency due to its longer duration of action and lower cost.

- **Objective**: To determine mortality rates with prednisolone versus hydrocortisone.

- **Methods**: In this observational study, we used data extracted from a UK primary care database (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) to measure the relative mortality of patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, who were treated with either prednisolone or hydrocortisone, and control individuals who were individually matched for age, sex, period, and place of follow-up.

- **Results**: As expected, mortality in adrenal insufficiency irrespective of cause was increased, based on 5,478 patients (4,228 on hydrocortisone; 1,250 on prednisolone) and 54,314 controls (41,934 and 12,380, respectively). Overall, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was similar with the two treatments (prednisolone, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.54–2.01] vs. hydrocortisone 1.69 [1.57–1.82]; P = 0.65). This was also the case for secondary adrenal insufficiency. In primary disease (1,405 on hydrocortisone vs. 137 on prednisolone; 13,965 and 1,347 controls, respectively), prednisolone users were older, more likely to have another autoimmune disease and malignancy, and less likely to have mineralocorticoid replacement. Nevertheless, after adjustment, the HR for prednisolone-treated patients remained higher than for those taking hydrocortisone (2.92 [2.19–3.91] vs. 1.90 [1.66–2.16]; P = 0.0020).

- **Conclusion**: In primary but not in secondary adrenal insufficiency, mortality rates differ.

### Dexamethasone [^114k5pJh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. These glucocorticoids cause varied metabolic effects and modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, which also have sodium-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs, including dexamethasone, are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders affecting many organ systems.

At equipotent anti-inflammatory doses, dexamethasone almost completely lacks the sodium-retaining property of hydrocortisone and its closely related derivatives.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^113fTF6g]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

While glucocorticoids (GCs) are extremely potent for their intended target, as discussed earlier, they are associated with debilitating side effects (see The Adverse Effects of Prescribed GCs section). Therefore, substantial work has aimed to develop so-called selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) to attempt to separate the negative side effects from the beneficial anti-inflammatory actions (Fig. 3). This was often based on the idea that a monomer/dimer dichotomy existed regarding repression/activation. However, as discussed in the Classical Steroid Hormone Action section, this model of GC action is no longer clear-cut. Monomers have been found to activate and not simply repress gene expression, and also to activate anti-inflammatory genes required for the full effects of GCs to act as anti-inflammatory agents. Early reports identified compound A as a selective agonist that seemed to have a limited ability to activate genes via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but efficiently repressed genes involved in inflammation. However, recent work highlighted that the differential effects of compound A are likely through alternative cofactor recruitment rather than an effect on tethering, and data supporting selective binding of compound A to the GR is unconvincing.

- **Genomic effects of classic glucocorticoids (left) and Selective Glucocorticoid Receptor Agonists (SEGRAs, right)**.

Preclinical studies demonstrated early enthusiasm for pursuing selective GR ligands based on the idea that changes in ligand structure could result in selective activation of transactivation mechanisms without the associated side effects.

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in an age, education level, and learning style-appropriate format, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members or care providers and disease-oriented support groups. We recommend the inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential to prevent severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. Confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis was demonstrated to be low in a large study that surveyed patients with adrenal insufficiency, including patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives have proved useful for sustainably improving the level of knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis, as well as self-confidence in dealing with the disease.

The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for an adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors, including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose, and treatment duration.

### Glucocorticoid dosing and implications for vaccination: Evolution of global definitions [^116QnqEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunization guidelines (i.e. prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20 mg/day or > 2 mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone 20 mg/day, antibody titres and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20 mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent pediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunization programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

### Rayos [^112BkPP8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naturally occurring corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and cortisone, which also have salt-retaining properties, are utilized as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs, such as prednisone, are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects across various organ systems.

Corticosteroids, like prednisone, exert significant and diverse metabolic effects. They also modify the body's immune responses to various stimuli. Prednisone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid drug with predominantly corticosteroid properties. Some of these properties replicate the physiological actions of endogenous glucocorticosteroids, while others manifest only after the administration of large therapeutic doses and do not necessarily correspond to the normal functions of adrenal hormones.

The pharmacological effects of prednisone, due to its corticosteroid properties, include: the promotion of gluconeogenesis; increased glycogen deposition in the liver; inhibition of glucose utilization; anti-insulin activity; increased protein catabolism; augmented lipolysis; stimulation of fat synthesis and storage; increased glomerular filtration rate, resulting in a heightened urinary excretion of urate (creatinine excretion remains unchanged); and increased calcium excretion. Additionally, while there is depressed production of eosinophils and lymphocytes, erythropoiesis and the production of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are stimulated.

### Comparative effect of different corticosteroids in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^114eWhAi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Of the 11 trials included, the primary outcome of all-cause mortality was pooled across 2,042 participants, comparing hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and placebo. The network meta-analysis revealed that hydrocortisone was significantly more effective in reducing mortality than placebo (RR, 0.35; 95% CrI, 0.14–0.64). No significant differences were observed between dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and placebo. Additionally, we combined individual head-to-head studies to evaluate the differences in efficacy between corticosteroids. No evidence was found to suggest that any corticosteroid treatment was superior to others. These data for the primary outcomes are summarized in the league table (Fig. 3).

- **Network meta-analysis results for all-cause mortality**: (A) A forest plot comparing all corticosteroid treatments with placebo. (B) The league table displays the network meta-analysis estimates for all treatment comparisons, with relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals. Items in bold indicate statistical significance. (C) A SUCRA-based cumulative probability graph for all-cause mortality.

In terms of mortality for severe CAP, hydrocortisone appears to be the most effective treatment, as indicated by a SUCRA value of 88.7%. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone yielded SUCRA values of 56.9% and 41.9%, respectively, while prednisolone was found to be the least beneficial, with a SUCRA of 36.3% (Fig. 3). We did not observe significant overall heterogeneity in mortality (heterogeneity test results, I² = 7).

### Prednisolone acetate [^113CXd3v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prednisolone acetate is a glucocorticoid that, based on weight, exhibits 3 to 5 times the anti-inflammatory potency of hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoids inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration during the acute inflammatory response. They also prevent capillary proliferation, collagen deposition, and scar formation.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including comorbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency, or by the medical context, such as training and experience of the treating clinician, or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Figure 2: Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**. Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation. Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery.

If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoids should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7.
