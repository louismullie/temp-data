## Question

Vaginal lump

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a vaginal lump. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and red flags. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by age and location. Next, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including history, exam, and imaging. After that, I need to consider when to biopsy and how to interpret pathology. Finally, I will map management pathways and highlight special scenarios and pitfalls, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: a vaginal lump is a symptom, not a diagnosis, and requires a structured approach to avoid anchoring bias and missed malignancy, so I need to keep a broad differential and escalate thoughtfully based on risk and findings [^7017b225] [^368d257e].

> I will now examine the initial assessment and red flags, because I need to ensure I do not overlook urgent or high-risk conditions. Age, onset, growth, pain, bleeding, discharge, urinary or bowel symptoms, and sexual history matter, and I should double-check for fever, weight loss, or constitutional symptoms that could signal malignancy or systemic disease. In children, I should verify whether there is primary amenorrhea, cyclic pain, or a bluish bulge suggesting hematocolpos from an imperforate hymen, and in adults, I should confirm menopausal status, prior surgeries, and mesh or prolapse history. Any rapidly growing, firm, fixed, ulcerated, or bleeding mass warrants expedited evaluation for malignancy [^d00bc8b3] [^f55f21bc] [^678c1b9c].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis organized by age and likelihood, but hold on, let me verify that I am not prematurely narrowing the list. In reproductive-age women, benign cysts (Gartner, Müllerian, Skene, Bartholin), leiomyoma, urethral diverticulum, and endometriosis are common, whereas in postmenopausal women, I must prioritize malignancy and atypia, including vaginal and vulvar cancers, while still considering cysts and prolapse. In prepubertal girls, congenital obstruction and rhabdomyosarcoma are key, and in adolescents, Müllerian anomalies and yolk sac tumor enter the differential. Rare entities like myeloid sarcoma, GIST, and Castleman disease should remain on the radar when the presentation is atypical or refractory [^65eafb5a] [^d88b19ae] [^b32a5b09] [^46073b0c] [^be269193] [^11277e88] [^eb680020].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging hierarchy before I commit to a sequence. Ultrasound is first-line to characterize cysts, solid masses, and relationship to bladder or urethra, but MRI provides superior soft-tissue detail and is the modality of choice for complex or equivocal cases, surgical planning, and suspected fistulous tracts or deep extension. CT is less sensitive for vaginal pathology but can help when malignancy is suspected or for preoperative staging. In suspected prolapse, dynamic MRI or fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography can be considered if imaging is needed after clinical assessment [^65eafb5a] [^5737c0e4] [^33f3ac67].

> I need to ensure the physical examination is systematic and complete. Inspection with a speculum allows visualization of the entire vaginal wall and cervix, palpation defines consistency, mobility, and tenderness, and bimanual exam assesses extension beyond the vagina. I should confirm whether the mass is cystic or solid, mobile or fixed, tender or painless, and whether it moves with the urethra or cervix, as these features guide the differential. For pediatric patients, examination under anesthesia may be required for adequate visualization and to avoid distress [^a0745bf3] [^d00bc8b3].

> Hold on, I should verify when to biopsy, because misclassification risks harm. Any solid, fixed, ulcerated, pigmented, rapidly growing, or persistent mass should be biopsied, ideally with a punch or excisional sample, and lesions that fail to respond to appropriate therapy or recur should be re-biopsied. In children, biopsy is mandatory for suspected rhabdomyosarcoma or yolk sac tumor. If malignancy is suspected, I should coordinate with gynecologic oncology for staging and management planning [^7017b225] [^f55f21bc] [^b32a5b09].

> Let me consider the common benign entities and their distinguishing features, and I should double-check that I am not overcalling prolapse. Gartner duct cysts are typically asymptomatic, thin-walled, and lateral on the anterior vaginal wall. Müllerian cysts can occur anywhere and may contain mucinous epithelium. Skene duct cysts are periurethral and may cause obstruction. Bartholin cysts are at 4 and 8 o'clock and may become abscesses. Leiomyomas are firm, solid, and may be pedunculated, often requiring MRI for characterization and surgical planning. Urethral diverticula present with the three Ds and may require MRI or urethroscopy for diagnosis [^0240aec4] [^d88b19ae] [^a5f2c482].

> But wait, what if the "cyst" is actually a prolapse or a mass from above? I should confirm the possibility of prolapsed polypoid adenomyoma or even uterine inversion in the right context, as these can mimic vaginal masses and require MRI for diagnosis and avoidance of injurious biopsy. Similarly, a prolapsing cervical or endometrial polyp can present as a vaginal mass and should be distinguished from primary vaginal lesions [^b9d24bae] [^55313d6f].

> Next, I should review malignant and premalignant conditions and ensure I do not miss subtle signs. Vaginal cancer is rare and often presents with bleeding, discharge, or a mass; biopsy is essential, and management is typically extrapolated from cervical cancer protocols with referral to experienced centers. Vulvar cancer can present as a lump or ulcer and requires biopsy for diagnosis. In adolescents and infants, vaginal yolk sac tumor is a key consideration with elevated AFP and excellent outcomes with chemotherapy. Myeloid sarcoma is rare but aggressive and mandates hematologic evaluation [^f55f21bc] [^adfc5ce6] [^b32a5b09] [^be269193].

> I should confirm the pediatric-specific pathway, because delays here are common. Imperforate hymen with hematocolpos presents with primary amenorrhea, cyclic pain, and a bluish bulge at the introitus; ultrasound confirms hematocolpos, and MRI helps if the anatomy is uncertain or if other obstructive anomalies are suspected. Rhabdomyosarcoma presents as a grape-like mass with bleeding and requires urgent biopsy and oncologic management. Urethral polyps can mimic vaginal masses and are diagnosed by location and endoscopy [^d65bae3a] [^d00bc8b3] [^46073b0c] [^ec5a08e9].

> Let me think about management principles and ensure I align with guidelines. Asymptomatic benign cysts may be observed, but symptomatic or large cysts are treated with excision or marsupialization. Leiomyomas are managed with surgical excision after appropriate imaging. Urethral diverticula are treated surgically once infection is controlled. Malignancies require oncologic staging and multimodal therapy. In children, conservative management is preferred when feasible, and obstructive anomalies are corrected surgically with attention to estrogenization and fertility preservation [^d88b19ae] [^a5f2c482] [^f55f21bc] [^d00bc8b3].

> I should double-check special scenarios and pitfalls so I do not repeat common errors. A vaginal bulge is not always prolapse; cysts, diverticula, and fibroids can mimic prolapse and are distinguished by imaging and exam. Foreign body reactions to mesh or tape can present as firm masses and require surgical excision. Endometriosis can implant in the vagina after surgery and present as a tender mass that recurs unless all tissue is excised. Aggressive angiomyxoma is a locally infiltrative tumor that often requires wide excision and may recur, sometimes benefiting from hormonal therapy [^0240aec4] [^8caa6215] [^54846856] [^fb538ac8].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and patient education are explicit. Any mass that is observed should have clear return precautions for growth, bleeding, or new symptoms. Patients should be counseled that persistent or atypical lesions warrant biopsy. In children, parents should be educated about normal genital anatomy and red flags. And across ages, timely referral to gynecology, urogynecology, or oncology should occur when malignancy is suspected or when management exceeds primary care scope [^7017b225] [^d00bc8b3] [^f55f21bc].

A vaginal lump most often reflects a **benign cyst** (Gartner, Müllerian, Bartholin, or Skene) [^0240aec4], a **leiomyoma** [^d88b19ae], or a **urethral diverticulum** [^a5f2c482], but malignancy must be excluded [^f55f21bc]. Start with a focused history and exam [^a0745bf3], then use **transvaginal ultrasound** for cysts and **MRI** for solid or complex masses [^65eafb5a]; biopsy any solid, fixed, or suspicious lesion [^7017b225]. Management is lesion-specific: cysts may be observed or excised, leiomyomas are excised, and urethral diverticula are repaired; refer to gynecology or oncology for malignancy or complex cases [^f55f21bc].

---

## Common causes of vaginal lumps

### Benign cysts

- **Gartner duct cysts**: Wolffian remnants; anterior/lateral vaginal wall; usually asymptomatic [^7fa343fa].
- **Müllerian cysts**: Endocervical-type epithelium; any vaginal wall; often incidental [^0240aec4].
- **Bartholin gland cysts**: Posterior vaginal introitus; can abscess [^notfound].
- **Skene gland cysts**: Paraurethral; may cause obstruction [^notfound].

---

### Benign tumors

Benign tumors include **leiomyomas** (fibroids) [^d88b19ae], which are rare, solid, and often anterior; excision is curative [^6663af79], and **endometriosis**, which presents as tender, firm nodules, often post-surgical, and is managed surgically or medically [^54846856].

---

### Urethral diverticulum

Urethral diverticulum presents as a **midline anterior vaginal wall mass** with the "three Ds" (dysuria, dyspareunia, dribbling) [^a5f2c482]; MRI is diagnostic [^a5f2c482], and surgical repair is definitive [^notfound].

---

### Malignant tumors

- **Vaginal cancer**: Rare; presents with bleeding, discharge, or mass; biopsy required [^f55f21bc].
- **Vulvar cancer**: Lump or ulcer; biopsy required [^adfc5ce6].
- **Myeloid sarcoma**: Rare; aggressive; biopsy required [^be269193].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a **history** covering onset, duration, symptoms, sexual/reproductive history, and risk factors [^a0745bf3], and a **physical exam** assessing location, size, consistency, mobility, and tenderness [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: First-line for cysts; evaluates size, location, and vascularity [^notfound].
- **MRI**: Gold standard for solid/complex masses; defines extent and surgical planning [^65eafb5a].
- **CT**: Limited; use if MRI contraindicated or for staging [^notfound].

---

### Biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for solid, fixed, ulcerated, rapidly growing, or suspicious lesions to exclude malignancy [^7017b225].

---

## Management strategies

| **Diagnosis** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Benign cysts | Observation vs excision/marsupialization [^7fa343fa] |
| Leiomyoma | Surgical excision [^d88b19ae] |
| Urethral diverticulum | Surgical repair [^notfound] |
| Malignancy | Oncologic referral; surgery, radiation, chemotherapy [^f55f21bc] |

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **infection** (abscess formation, cellulitis), **obstruction** (urinary or sexual dysfunction), and **malignancy** if lesions are untreated or misdiagnosed [^notfound].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek care for **new or changing vaginal lumps**, associated bleeding, discharge, pain, dyspareunia, urinary symptoms, or systemic features (fever, weight loss) [^7017b225].

---

A vaginal lump is most often benign, but a **structured approach** — history/exam, targeted imaging, and selective biopsy — ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management, with referral for complex or malignant disease [^7017b225].

### Looks can be deceiving [^f5e781f6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A thorough history, physical examination, and comprehensive work-up is important to differentiate the etiology of a cervical mass in unusual cases.

Case

A 36-year-old white female presented with heavy vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and an exophytic cervical mass extending to the anterior vaginal wall. She underwent cold knife cone with biopsies of the vagina. Pathology revealed dysgerminoma. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated pelvic lymphadenopathy, an enlarged uterus, and a 4 cm complex ovarian mass. The final pathology helped establish the true diagnosis.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of rare tumors requires a broad differential diagnosis and careful review of the pathologic findings and clinical scenario.

### Diagnosis and management dilemma in leiomyoma of the anterior vaginal wall [^6663af79]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Vaginal leiomyomas, rare benign tumours arising from the vaginal wall, present a diagnostic challenge due to their varied clinical manifestations. We report the case of a woman in her mid-40s who sought medical attention for heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. Initial examinations revealed a palpable mass within the vaginal canal, prompting further investigation with imaging modalities that confirmed a solid lesion suggestive of leiomyoma. A Tru-Cut biopsy was performed to rule out malignancy, after which surgical excision was carried out. Subsequent histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis. The case underscores the importance of considering leiomyomas in the differential diagnosis of vaginal masses and highlights the successful management through appropriate surgical strategies with excellent postoperative outcomes.

### An unusual vaginal lump [^fb538ac8]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of a painless golf ball sized lump in her vagina. Despite transvaginal ultrasound scan, biopsy and MRI, it was only after surgery had been performed that it became clear what the nature of the mass actually was. Immunohistochemistry revealed the lump to be an aggressive angiomyxoma. Follow-up MRI showed residual (or recurrence of) angiomyxoma which was successfully treated with monthly injections of Prostap (leuprorelin acetate), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Further MRI showed complete resolution of the lesion.

### Vaginal cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^00dc51ee]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features Although early vaginal cancer may not cause noticeable signs or symptoms, possible signs and symptoms of vaginal cancer include:

- Metrorrhagia.
- Dyspareunia.
- Pelvic pain.
- Vaginal mass.
- Dysuria.
- Constipation.
- VaIN 1 is defined as involvement of the upper one-third of the epithelial thickness.
- VaIN 2 is defined as involvement of the upper two-thirds of the epithelial thickness.
- VaIN 3 is defined as involvement of more than two-thirds of the epithelial thickness. VaIN 3 lesions that involve the full thickness of the epithelium are called carcinoma.
- Laser therapy after biopsy to rule out invasive components that could be missed with this treatment approach.
- Wide local excision with or without skin grafting.
- Partial or total vaginectomy, with skin grafting for multifocal or extensive disease.
- Intravaginal chemotherapy with 5% fluorouracil cream. This option may be useful in the setting of multifocal lesions.

Women with VaIN 1 can usually be observed carefully without ablative or surgical treatment because the lesions often regress spontaneously. VaIN 2, the intermediate grade, is managed by careful observation or initial treatment. Although the natural history of VaIN is not precisely known because of its rarity, patients with VaIN 3 are presumed to be at substantial risk of progression to invasive cancer and are treated immediately. Lesions with hyperkeratosis respond better to excision or laser vaporization than to 5-FU.
- Surgery.
- For lesions in the upper third of the vagina, radical vaginectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy should be considered. Construction of a neovagina may be performed if feasible and if desired by the patient.
- In lesions of the lower third, inguinal lymphadenectomy should be considered. In cases with close or positive surgical margins, adjuvant radiation therapy should be considered.
- Surgery.
- Total radical vaginectomy and hysterectomy with lymph node dissection are indicated because the tumor spreads subepithelially.
- The deep pelvic lymph nodes are dissected if the lesion invades the upper vagina, and the inguinal lymph nodes are removed if the lesion originates in the lower vagina.

### Pelvic castleman disease presenting as vaginal occlusion [^eb680020]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Castleman disease is a lymphoreticular disorder, which may be clinically silent. However, systemic manifestations can occur, which include generalized adenopathy and life-threatening bronchiolitis obliterans.

Case

A woman presented with vaginal mucosal lesions recalcitrant to initial treatment efforts. Progression of the disease required hospitalization for pulmonary involvement. Castleman disease was diagnosed after extensive multidisciplinary evaluation and excision of a pelvic mass. The patient's symptoms dramatically improved postoperatively.

Conclusion

Castleman disease should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with paraneoplastic symptoms and a pelvic mass.

### Vaginal bulge is not always prolapse [^0240aec4]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this video is to review a case of a patient that presented to urogynecology clinic for prolapse but was noted to have anterior vaginal cyst. In this video, we review differential diagnosis, embryologic origin of vaginal cyst, excision procedure, imaging, and pathology of the vaginal cyst.

Setting

Urogynecology clinic/operating room PARTICIPANT: Patient who presented with anterior vaginal cyst INTERVENTION: Thirty-four-year-old G0 referred to Urogynecology for a vaginal bulge. On exam, she had a 4 cm anterior vaginal cystic mass. The differential diagnosis for benign vaginal cysts is broad, including Müllerian or Gartner's (mesonephric) ducts, Skene duct, Bartholin gland, epidermal inclusion, or endometriotic cysts, adenosis, or urethral diverticulum [1,2]. Most are secondary to embryological remnants or trauma [3]. Müllerian ducts form the fallopian tubes, broad ligament, uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina. Müllerian epithelium is replaced with squamous epithelium of the urogenital sinus; however, Müllerian epithelium can persist anywhere along the vaginal wall. Thus, Müllerian cysts can be found at any location in the vagina [4]. During vaginal cyst work-up, imaging can be helpful to further differentiate the cyst and aid in surgical planning. Our patient had an in-office translabial ultrasound that revealed a fluid-filled vaginal cyst that had possible bladder connection. Pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed a 4 cm non-communicating fluid-filled cyst that was abutting the bladder in its entirety. We present imaging and a surgical excision video demonstrating the importance of meticulous dissection directly on the bladder wall. The video also presents histopathology slides with bland, endocervical-type columnar epithelium, leading to the final diagnosis of a Müllerian duct cyst.

Conclusion

Vaginal cysts require careful examination and imaging. Understanding their location is crucial for surgical planning, counseling, and successful patient outcomes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Prenatal hydrocolpos: imaging findings and differential diagnosis [^790d94e1]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prenatal hydrocolpos is characterized by fluid distension of the vagina. Hydrocolpos can be caused by multiple underlying etiologies and often demonstrates overlapping imaging features compared to other cystic abdominal and pelvic lesions. The purpose of the current pictorial essay is to provide a systematic prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to differentiating the primary etiologies leading to hydrocolpos. After discussing the fundamental embryological processes involved in vaginal development, the current essay discusses the most common causes of hydrocolpos with their associated prenatal and postnatal imaging features. An approach to distinguishing the more common differential diagnoses is provided. Given the implications of parental counseling and postnatal management, this essay provides an important approach for narrowing differential diagnoses based on prenatal imaging.

### Prepubertal genital bleeding: examination and differential diagnosis in pediatric female patients [^4ca9cd72]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prepubertal genital bleeding can be caused by a variety of etiologies including trauma, infection, structural, hematologic disorders, precocious puberty, and malignancy. Urethral prolapse can be seen in prepubescent girls due to a relative estrogen deficiency. Urethral prolapse classically presents with urethral mass and vaginal bleeding, often associated with constipation.

Case Report

A healthy 6-year-old White girl presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department (ED) with vaginal bleeding for 1 day preceded by a few months of constipation. In the ED the patient's physical examination was remarkable for a tender, nonmobile mass at the vaginal introitus. Transabdominal pelvic and renal ultrasounds were unremarkable. The emergency physician's working diagnosis was a vaginal mass concerning for sarcoma botryoides. Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (PAG) was consulted. They performed an examination under anesthesia (EUA) with cystoscopy and vaginoscopy. The EUA confirmed a urethral prolapse approximately 2 cm in diameter. The patient was treated with conjugated estrogen vaginal cream. At her 1-month follow-up, the urethral prolapse had resolved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Performing a proper pelvic examination of a prepubescent girl presenting with vulvovaginal bleeding is crucial to form an accurate diagnosis in the ED setting. By placing the young girl in the frog-leg or knee-chest position and using both lateral and downward traction of the vulva, one can adequately visualize the external genitalia and outer 1/3 of the vagina. This can help streamline diagnosis and avoid unnecessary examinations and anxiety.

### Imaging of diseases of the vagina and external genitalia in children [^0221b0b6]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

A wide range of congenital or acquired conditions, some pretty rare, may affect the vulva and vagina in children. Swelling, visible or palpable masses and abnormal discharges are common symptoms of conditions affecting the vulva and/or the lower genital tract. The majority of these diseases are benign. Ultrasonography is pivotal to elucidate the anatomical origin of these conditions and make the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be relevant to improve diagnostic confidence and, if needed, to plan more accurate surgical treatment. The aim of this pictorial essay is to review the related imaging findings to help make radiologists familiar with these conditions.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS

Vaginal Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for vaginal cancer or its precursors. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is predominantly asymptomatic. Vaginal cancers are more commonly symptomatic and may present with vaginal bleeding, unexplained vaginal discharge, pain, palpable mass, or other nonspecific symptoms. In most studies, painless vaginal bleeding was the most common symptom.

Vulvar Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for vulvar cancer or its precursors. Most patients with vulvar cancer present with at least one symptom such as pain, pruritus, or a visible lesion. Sixty percent of vulvar cancers are diagnosed without distant spread, likely because of the symptomatic nature of these lesions. Symptoms of vulvar precancers are similar but less severe. Nonhealing vulvar ulcers carry particularly high risk. In one study of nonhealing ulcers, 63% were diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, and 36% had at least HSIL.

Anal Cancer

We found no studies of the predictive value of symptoms for anal cancer or its precursors. Forty-five percent of patients with anal cancer are diagnosed with localized disease and 34% with regional disease. Most studies on anal cancer symptoms are quite old, published well before the beginning of our search window. One contemporary study noted that rectal bleeding was the most frequent presenting symptom (64.6%), followed by noticing a lump (34%), pain (32.6%), perianal itch (15%), and tenesmus (13.9%). Other symptoms included altered bowel habits, diarrhea, thinner feces, mucous, and an inguinal mass.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^bf8086bc]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Sinus tracts differ from VF in that they do not connect to an organ but are blind-ending or terminate into an abscess collection.

Rare conditions that may mimic a VF both clinically and at imaging are peritoneal and lymphatic fistulas (Fig. 17), in which communication is established between the vaginal dome and a post-operative fluid or lymph collection. Differentiation relies on correct identification of the abnormal collection that does not fill with enhanced urine.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pelvic organ prolapse, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AUGS 2017 guidelines recommend to evaluate symptoms of vaginal bleeding to rule out premalignant or malignant conditions.

### Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm: a life-threatening cause of vaginal bleeding in the emergency department [^41c3c6c0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vaginal bleeding is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED); life-threatening hemorrhage is rare. Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening cause of vaginal bleeding that is most likely to present primarily to EDs, given its delayed postpartum or postoperative presentation.

Case Report

A 25-year-old female gravida two, para one, who was 19 days post dilation and evacuation for an elective termination of a pregnancy at 20 weeks, presented to the ED with profuse vaginal bleeding. She was hypotensive and tachycardic at presentation, requiring resuscitation with 0.9% normal saline and transfusions of packed red blood cells. Transvaginal ultrasound completed in the ED demonstrated a pulsatile mass in the cervix with internal "ying-yang" flow on Doppler images, suggestive of a uterine artery pseudoaneurysm within the cervix. The patient underwent emergent uterine artery embolization with resolution of bleeding and improvement in her hemodynamic status. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? UAP is an uncommon cause of vaginal bleeding, but UAP rupture can be life-threatening. UAP is an important differential diagnosis for vaginal bleeding, particularly in the postpartum or postoperative setting. Delaying diagnosis may worsen bleeding in the setting of a ruptured UAP if treatment is pursued for alternative diagnosis; for example, treating retained products of conception with a dilation and curettage. Being aware of UAP and how to diagnose it will allow early proper treatment and more favorable patient outcomes.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^2663dbe5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Differential diagnosis of a unique vulvar mass in an adolescent [^726c4331]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvar masses in adolescents have a broad differential diagnosis, yet few reports exist detailing masses of mammary origin.

Case

A nulliparous, healthy 16-year-old adolescent presented with a longstanding, ulcerated, 17-cm vulvar mass of unknown origin and pronounced inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent a left radical partial vulvectomy, with pathology revealing terminal duct lobular units consistent with polymastia.

Conclusion

Differential diagnosis of a vulvar mass in an adolescent should include polymastia.

### Congenital megaureter presenting in an adult as a vaginal wall cyst [^e7bd4f4a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal cysts are a common finding. The differential diagnosis includes epidermal inclusion, Bartholin gland, Gartner duct, and Skene gland cysts and Müllerian anomalies. Rarely, leiomyomas, cancers, or ectopic ureters or megaureters are found.

Case

A 31-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 3, presented with a 12-year history of intermittent abdominal pain and involuntary loss of urine. She was diagnosed with ectopic vaginal megaureter after evaluation and subsequently underwent a nephroureterectomy with a marsupialized distal ureter. She remains asymptomatic.

Conclusion

Consideration of a rare diagnosis such as an ectopic ureter is important when patients repeatedly present with involuntary urinary incontinence in conjunction with a vaginal cyst and an otherwise negative evaluation. Using magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to assess urinary tract involvement, particularly in patients with known urinary tract malformations.

### Pelvic hemorrhagic lesions in women: MRI findings and differential diagnosis [^a2c1b61a]. Clinical Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

A large spectrum of pathologic pelvic conditions can present with hemorrhage in structures or organs. These may present acutely, subacutely, chronically or as incidental findings. Clinical history and MRI characteristics can often narrow the differential diagnosis and guide management. The purpose of this article is to showcase a wide array of pelvic lesions, in which the presence of blood is a key imaging feature, and their differential diagnosis.

### Approach to the patient with vulvovaginal complaints [^f2e9a58e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Although vulvovaginal diseases may seem daunting, dermatologists possess all of the requisite tools and skills necessary to comprehensively assess and accurately diagnose primary cutaneous, systemic, and inflammatory diseases that affect the vulva. A simple but comprehensive dermatologic approach to the patient with a vulvovaginal complaint is presented. We begin with a review of the normal vulvar anatomy and normal variants and proceed to the clinical approach with special emphasis on the history, physical examination, and common diagnostic procedures.

### MRI of prolapsed polypoid adenomyoma: expanding the differential diagnosis for the broccoli sign [^b9d24bae]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

We report a 44 year old previously healthy premenopausal woman who presented with a three month history of vaginal bleeding and a 5 cm vaginal mass obscuring the cervix on physical examination. Ultrasound evaluation was non diagnostic. Pelvic MRI demonstrated a 6 cm soft tissue mass in the vagina prolapsed from the uterine cavity with a visible connecting stalk, which is termed the broccoli sign. The initial radiological differential diagnosis included prolapsed uterine malignancy or leiomyoma. Surgical pathology revealed a polypoid adenomyoma. We conclude polypoid adenomyoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for prolapsed uterine tumor demonstrating the broccoli sign.

### Abdominal wall lump after cesarean delivery [^e15817e9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

An abdominal wall desmoid tumor is a rare event, has a strong tendency for local invasion and recurrence, and usually presents as an abdominal lump.

Case

A 35-year-old multiparous woman presented with a painful abdominal lump that had been slowly increasing in size. The pain was not associated with menstruation. Clinical examination, ultrasonography, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging were performed and suggested a large, sharply defined mass measuring approximately 11 × 7.1 cm in the right anterolateral abdominal wall. There was no family history of familial adenomatous polyposis. The mass was excised and sent for histopathologic examination, which indicated abdominal wall desmoid tumor.

Conclusion

Abdominal wall desmoid tumors can be diagnostic dilemmas and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for lumps in the abdomen in women.

### Microbiome and vulvovaginitis [^5db889ba]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginitis occurs in mostly reproductive aged women. Recurrent vaginitis affects overall quality of life, with a large financial burden on the patient, family, and health system. This review discusses a clinician's approach to vulvovaginitis with specific attention to the 2021 updated Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The authors discuss the role of the microbiome in vaginitis and evidence-based approaches for diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis. This review also provides updates on new considerations, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vaginitis. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis and genitourinary syndrome of menopause are discussed as differential diagnosis of vaginitis symptoms.

### A general approach to the evaluation and the management of vulvar disorders [^21d3c6cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of the vulva should always begin with a detailed clinical history. The clinician should be very familiar with vulvar anatomy and the changes it undergoes depending on the patient's age and hormonal status. A systematic approach should be developed when examining the vulva so as to not leave out any parts. Finally, there is a wide array of ancillary tests and diagnostics procedures that can be pursued to arrive at the correct diagnosis and begin proper management.

### Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis as a cause of vaginal bleeding&discharge: a case report [^68a9f988]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepubertal vaginal bleeding is a common presentation for pediatric adolescent gynecologists with a broad differential diagnosis that historically may not have included complex lymphatic anomalies. However, given recent consensus criteria and imaging capabilities, this may be a condition that pediatric adolescent gynecologists see more frequently in the future.

Case

We present a case of a 5-year-old pre-pubertal girl whose only presenting symptoms of a rare complex lymphatic anomaly was copious vaginal bleeding. After three vaginoscopies, two hysteroscopies, two pelvic MRIs, and a percutaneous ultrasound guided core needle biopsy, this patient was eventually diagnosed with Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis at age 9 years-old, and she is now being treated medically with sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, with improvement in her symptoms.

Summary and Conclusion

Complex lymphatic anomalies should be considered after initial and secondary workups for pre-pubertal vaginal bleeding or copious vaginal discharge are negative. Furthermore, this case illustrates the value of pelvic MRI in the setting of unknown cause of vaginal bleeding when typical workup is negative.

### Cancer of the vagina: 2021 update [^f55f21bc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

4 MANAGEMENT OF INVASIVE CANCER OF THE VAGINA

Women usually present with bleeding or a malodorous discharge. Locally advanced disease may also result in pain, and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the site of metastases.

Diagnosis of vaginal cancer is made with directed biopsy of the lesion and a clinical assessment that ensures there is no evidence of tumor on the cervix or the vulva. Biopsy can be performed in an outpatient setting; however, sometimes examination under anesthesia is required for diagnosis and adequate assessment, particularly in young girls and elderly women where the exam can become painful or limited by narrowness of the introitus.

As primary vaginal cancer is rare, treatment is complex, often individualized, and much of the management is extrapolated from cervical cancer owing to its similar etiology and anatomical location. Therefore, it is recommended that women diagnosed with primary vaginal cancer are referred to a tertiary unit whenever possible. Accordingly, outcomes are influenced by the experience of the medical team in treating this type of rare tumor.

### A clinical approach to vulvar ulcers [^fed5c375]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

This article discusses the differential diagnosis of vulvar ulcers and describes a general clinical approach to this common but nonspecific examination finding. The differential diagnosis includes sexually and nonsexually transmitted infections, dermatitides, trauma, neoplasms, hormonally induced ulcers, and drug reactions. Patient history and physical examination provide important clues to the cause of a vulvar ulcer. However, laboratory testing is usually required for accurate diagnosis because the clinical presentation is often nonspecific and may be atypical due to secondary conditions.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^4cdaa3b5]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy," and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy," options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Leiomyoma presenting as an anterior vaginal mass [^d88b19ae]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Leiomyoma, otherwise known as a fibroid, is commonly encountered in the uterus. Vaginal leiomyomas are extremely rare with a relative paucity of cases reported in the literature. Due to the rarity of the disease and complexity of the vaginal anatomy, definitive diagnosis and treatment are challenging. The diagnosis is often only made postoperatively after resection of the mass. They usually arise from the anterior vaginal wall and women may present with dyspareunia, lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or dysuria. Imaging with a transvaginal ultrasound scan and MRI can confirm the vaginal origin of the mass. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The diagnosis is confirmed following histological assessment. The authors present the case of a woman in her late 40s presenting to the gynaecology department with an anterior vaginal mass. Further investigation with a non-contrast MRI was suggestive of a vaginal leiomyoma. She underwent surgical excision. Histopathological features were in keeping with the diagnosis of a hydropic leiomyoma. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis as it can be mistaken for a cystocele, Skene duct abscess or Bartholin gland cyst. Although it is a benign entity, local recurrence following incomplete resection and sarcomatous changes have been reported.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^119d9893]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Vaginal mullerian cyst presenting as a cystocele [^43c782e7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal cysts occur rarely, are usually discovered incidentally on examination, and can cause a variety of symptoms.

Case

This article discusses a 34-year-old para 2 female with a large anterior vaginal wall cyst that arose at 20 weeks' gestation and was originally diagnosed as a cystocele. The unusual timing of its occurrence and the characteristics of the anterior vaginal wall prompted ancillary testing and reexamination.

Conclusion

The timing of onset and general characteristics of prolapse as well as defecography and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to aid the gynecologist in diagnosing vaginal cysts instead of the more common condition of vaginal prolapse.

### Two unusual presentations of bladder diverticula [^6a5ecf53]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder diverticula are protrusions of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the bladder through the muscular wall of the bladder. We discuss the identification and management of two unusual presentations of bladder diverticula.

Case

In two cases of bladder diverticula, one presented as pelvic organ prolapse and the other largely replaced the anterior cervix and was incidentally encountered during a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. Both were discovered intraoperatively and repaired surgically.

Conclusion

Alternatives to pelvic organ prolapse must be in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with complaints of vaginal bulging.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^d00bc8b3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies — ACOG Committee Opinion Number 779 — outlines presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies may present after puberty with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, recurrent vaginal discharge, or infertility, and the evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging, with the genital examination critical to differentiate key causes. Pelvic ultrasonography is the initial imaging method recommended for a patient with cyclic pain and amenorrhea or a patient with persistent dysmenorrhea, but diagnosis of a uterine or vaginal anomaly by imaging before puberty can be challenging and misleading. If the diagnosis is not certain or there is a concern for specified distal obstructive anomalies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended, and consultation with a radiologist experienced with imaging of uterovaginal anomalies may be helpful to determine the most accurate diagnosis.

### The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the rare pathologies of the vulva [^6de41bd9]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathologies of the vulva encompass a wide range of mesenchymal and epithelial benign and malignant lesions. Suspicion is raised by non-specific symptoms or clinical findings detected during routine gynecological examinations, and histopathology is essential for the diagnosis. The role of imaging has often been limited, but it can be essential in guiding treatment and, in some cases, in helping differential diagnosis. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can play a central role in identifying the extent of disease and planning surgical treatment. To this aim, rigorous image acquisition, correct disease evaluation in the context of vulvar anatomy and understanding of the possible differential diagnosis are essential. The aim of this article is to review the role of MRI in the evaluation of rare vulvar pathologies, focusing on different sites of origin, imaging characteristics, and local extent.

### Are you a lumper or a splitter? [^95b06fb0]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The current goal of evidence-based medicine, prospective therapeutic interventions in large numbers of patients, may not always reach an accurate conclusion. Individual variations in genetic characteristics need to be acknowledged and taken into account in the analysis. Some women with recurrent vulvo-vaginal candiosis (RVVC) have polymorphisms in genes that directly contribute to their increased susceptibility to these infections. Similarly, genetic polymorphism analyses of mother and fetus, along with highly sensitive non-culture methods of microbial detection, have identified patients at elevated risk for premature labor and delivery. Utilization of more complete information provides the basis for more specific and individualized therapeutic interventions.

### Urachal duct carcinoma complicating pregnancy [^3b50b532]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Degenerating myomas are common explanations for pain associated with abdominal masses in pregnancy. However, masses arising from other pelvic organs should be included in the differential diagnosis.

Case

We present a case of an abdominal mass in pregnancy that was originally misdiagnosed as a uterine leiomyoma. Attention to the patient's history along with judicious use of imaging modalities led to the correct diagnosis of urachal duct carcinoma. This was treated appropriately and resulted in a term vaginal delivery. We present a review of the literature on this tumor and its management in pregnancy.

Conclusion

Urologic malignancies are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any woman presenting with pain and an abdominal mass in pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach optimizes outcomes.

### Imaging of the vagina: spectrum of disease with emphasis on MRI appearance [^65eafb5a]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

The vagina is a median fibromuscular structure of the female reproductive system that extends from the vulva inferiorly to the uterine cervix superiorly. As most vaginal lesions are detected at gynecologic examination, imaging performed for nongynecologic indications can frequently cause concomitant vaginal pathologic conditions to be overlooked. The vagina is often underevaluated at routinely performed pelvic transvaginal US because of a narrow scan area and probe positioning. MRI has progressively become the imaging method of choice for vaginal pathologic conditions, as it provides excellent soft-tissue detail with unparalleled delineation of the complex pelvic floor anatomy and helps establish a diagnosis for most vaginal diseases. It is important that radiologists use a focused approach toward understanding and correctly recognizing different vaginal entities that may otherwise go unnoticed. In this case-based review, the authors discuss the key imaging features of wide-ranging vaginal pathologic conditions, with emphasis on appearance at MRI. Knowledge of vaginal anatomy and embryology is helpful in evaluating congenital anomalies at imaging. Often seen incidentally, vaginal inflammation can cause diagnostic confusion. Because of its central location in the pelvis, the vagina can form fistulas to the urinary bladder, colon, rectum, or anus. Vaginal masses can be neoplastic and nonneoplastic and include a myriad of benign and malignant conditions, some of which have characteristic imaging features. Therapeutic and nontherapeutic vaginal foreign bodies include pessaries, vaginal mesh, and packing that can be seen with or without associated complications.

### Uterine mass after caesarean section: a report of two cases [^922c9a3b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The two patients described here both have a history of scar pregnancy, and their clinical presentations were irregular vaginal bleeding. Larger lesions could be detected in the lower part of the anterior wall of the uterus by ultrasound. Unlike previous case reports, these two cases have similar ultrasound images showing a huge mass in the lower anterior wall of the uterus but completely different clinical diagnoses. Through comparison, we summarized our diagnosis and differential diagnosis considerations based on the similar images. When transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) cannot confirm the specific location of the lesion and the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered to further clarify the relationship between the mass and the uterine scar, which helps to achieve definitive diagnosis.

### Retrorectal tumour simulating vaginal birth: an exceptional case of emergency surgery indication [^311e514f]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic retrorectal tumours are a very rare entity that pose a problem in differential diagnosis between congenital cyst and other lesions. We present a 49-year-old female patient presenting a perineal bulge which was discovered simulating a vaginal birth associated with prolapsed haemorrhoids grade IV. The interest of this case resides in the surgical indication of a big presacral cyst demonstrated via CT causing acute intense pain due to pelvic organ compression, as no emergent surgery management has been reported up to date.

### Committee opinion No 673: persistent vulvar pain [^efa8b550]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvodynia — diagnosis and evaluation emphasize that vulvodynia is a diagnosis of exclusion and that excluding other treatable causes before assigning this diagnosis is imperative; although distinguishing generalized from localized vulvodynia is fairly straightforward using a simple cotton swab test, it has not been determined whether generalized and localized vulvodynia represent different manifestations of the same disease process, and given the variable presentation and individualized responses to treatment, causation is very likely multifactorial.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^55313d6f]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Uterine inversion

Uterine inversion (UI) refers to inside-out overturning and protrusion of the uterine fundus downwards up to or through the cervix that may occur either as an acute (within 24 h) life-threatening obstetric complication of mismanaged labour or in multiparous post-menopausal women from pulling effect of submucosal or pedunculated leiomyomas attached to the fundus; in the latter case, symptoms include pelvic tenderness or pain, vaginal discharge and irregular uterine bleeding. Physically, the vagina is occupied by the inverted uterus, but the clinical diagnosis is challenging without a high index of suspicion. Imaging is crucial to avoid misinterpretation as cervical tumour and to obviate biopsy which may cause profuse bleeding.

Whereas the nature of the "mass" protruding into the vagina is difficult to identify at US, MRI generally clinches the diagnosis. The hallmark of UI on sagittal viewing is a U-shaped uterus with indentation and depression of the fundus, and a "bulls-eye" transverse configuration reflecting the zonal anatomy (Fig. 7 d, f). Additionally, MRI may detect the possible presence of T2-hypointense submucosal fibroids or heterogeneously hyperintense mass-forming tumours. Albeit with limited contrast resolution, in acute settings, CT with adequate image reformation may also allow recognition of UI (Fig. 7 a, c).

Fig. 7
Surgically confirmed, spontaneous uterine inversion without mass lesions in a 79-year-old woman experiencing muco-haemorrhagic vaginal discharge. Precontrast (a) and contrast-enhanced (b, c) CT images showed a solid, mass-like enhancing structure (plus sign) surrounded by air coursing through the dilated uterine cervix. Loss of the normally convex uterine fundus (thin arrows) was noted. Physically, the upper vagina was occupied by the inverted uterus. Sagittal (d) and axial (e) T2-weighted MRI images confirmed the diagnosis by showing lost convexity and depression of the uterine fundus (thin arrows), U-shaped inverted uterus (plus sign) with preserved zonal anatomy for age and normal homogeneous enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted image (f), which coursed downwards through the hypointense uterine cervix walls (thin arrows) [adapted from Open Access ref. no]

Treatment of UI should consider the fertility and reproductive wishes of the patient, stage of inversion and underlying (benign or malignant) pathology. Whereas in puerperium manual repositioning is possible, post-menopausal UI requires abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^a9e22364]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Etiology and prevalence in symptomatic patients explains that vaginitis has a broad differential diagnosis and successful treatment frequently rests on an accurate diagnosis; it states that the most common causes include vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis and quantifies that among patients with vaginal symptoms, vaginal candidiasis is diagnosed in 17–39% of cases, bacterial vaginosis in 22–50% of cases, and trichomoniasis in 4–35% of cases, while vaginitis may remain undiagnosed in 7–72% of patients; it adds that other etiologies include vulvar skin diseases, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

### Benign cystic lesions of the vagina: a literature review [^7fa343fa]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Knowledge of the etiology, evaluation and treatment of cystic lesions of the vagina is essential as these lesions are often encountered in urological and gynecological practices.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE and MeSH for literature from the last 50 years referring to cysts of the vagina. Review of the literature regarding etiology, clinical and pathological diagnosis, prognosis and treatment identified 18 journal articles and 6 books.

Results

Benign cystic lesions of the vagina present a spectrum, from small asymptomatic lesions to cysts large enough to cause urinary obstruction. History, physical examination and radiological imaging, including voiding cystourethrogram and magnetic resonance imaging, are useful in diagnosis. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms.

Conclusions

Cystic lesions of the vagina are relatively common and usually represent benign conditions. A vaginal cyst may be an embryological derivative, ectopic tissue or urological abnormality. Awareness of the various diagnoses of benign cystic lesions of the vagina and associated abnormalities will aid in evaluation and treatment.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: definition of a concept and pathologic description [^5fc61727]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

- Nonsclerotic LS refers to a pathologic situation in which there are clinical and microscopic features to suggest LS but dermal sclerosis is absent.

- Nonsclerotic LS always has a histopathologic differential diagnosis, so it requires clinical correlation to confirm a diagnosis of LS. Nonsclerotic lichenoid reactions may be grouped into 1 of 4 categories with a comment if LS is favored.

- If clinical features are consistent with LS and the pathology is nonspecific, the assigned diagnosis remains LS.

- When the pathologist includes NSLS in the differential diagnosis but clinical features are not specific, the diagnosis remains unclear. In cases with skin abnormality, it is often appropriate to manage with topical corticosteroids, serial photography, and follow-up; the diagnosis may become apparent over time in the context evolving clinical findings, extragenital or vaginal involvement, and response to treatment.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^7e9b7201]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The results from the current study support the potential utility of the investigational test in the differential diagnosis of vaginitis. While some laboratory tests take 2 to 7 days to provide results, the investigational test results are generally available within 24 h. Although future work is required to establish the cost/benefit ratio regarding the application of this investigational test in a practical setting, its high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (across a large spectrum of disease prevalence) should impart benefits and decrease the chance of needless treatment of patients that are negative for the disease. This may prove especially important with cases of vaginitis that involve multiple causes, where the sensitivity of clinician diagnosis may be limited.

### Brittany's cancer survivor story… [^a17506d7]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know "You know your body better than anyone. If there are any changes, get it checked out". In September 2015, I was completing Squadron Officer School when I noticed a lump on my vulva one day when getting out of the shower. I didn't pay much attention to it at first because I thought maybe I had pulled something during training. I was in great physical health, having just accomplished a Commanders Challenge, and besides the lump, I had no other symptoms. After I graduated SOS, I noticed the lump on my vulva was still there, it was growing, and it was uncomfortable when I wore jeans. It was at this point that I decided to get it looked at by my doctor. I was diagnosed in November 2015 with a Bartholin's cyst and was scheduled to have a quick outpatient procedure to drain it. glands are located on each side of the vaginal opening. These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina.

Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin's cyst.]. However, when the doctors cut into the cyst, no liquid came out, and instead they found a solid mass. They decided to biopsy the tissue, and I feared the results would come back indicating I had cancer. A few days later, the biopsy results showed I had a ruptured polyp — no cancer. As it turned out, my margins tested positive for sarcoma of the vulva and I was referred to a specialist. Less than a month later, I had a radical, partial vulvectomy. Part of my vulva was removed as well as some tissue around it. Luckily the cancer had not spread. Since the surgery, I have received good results during medical checkups.

When I tell my story, my message to other women is that you know your body better than anyone. If there are any changes that you cannot possibly connect the dots to how or why something happened, get it checked out. I am a strong believer that early diagnosis saved my life.

### Clinical and histopathologic differential diagnosis of venous malformation of the uterine cervix [^289b73e7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Venous malformations of the uterine cervix are extremely rare. Most lesions are asymptomatic and incidental, but sometimes, they may present with abnormal and/or intractable vaginal bleeding. The study aimed to describe a case of venous malformation of the uterine cervix and discuss the clinical and histopathologic differential diagnosis of this entity.

Case

A 50-year-old woman attended to the gynecology clinic for postcoital spotting and postmenopausal bleeding. Gynecologic examination revealed polypoid, lobulated, bluish, vascular nodular lesions 4 to 1 cm in size surrounding the cervical introitus. The lesions were completely excised via loop electrosurgical excision procedure method. Pathologic diagnosis revealed venous malformations of the uterine cervix.

Conclusions

Venous malformations of the uterine cervix should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cervical mass and vaginal bleeding. Pathologic examination is necessary in such a case to exclude the possibility of malignant vascular tumor or cervical neoplasm.

### Ectopic pregnancy after cesarean hysterectomy [^4f0f6808]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy after a total abdominal hysterectomy is rare and, for this reason, delay in diagnosis may occur when such a patient presents with abdominal pain.

Case

A multiparous patient with a history of cesarean hysterectomy 12 years before presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and incidental positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). A computed tomography scan revealed a loculated left cystic mass in the pelvis. Laparotomy findings revealed a left adnexal mass; pathology revealed chorionic villi consistent with pregnancy.

Conclusion

Ectopic pregnancy may occur after hysterectomy, but typically presents near the time of surgery and is more commonly associated with vaginal hysterectomy. However, because ectopic pregnancy is possible after hysterectomy, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adnexal mass in such a patient.

### Primary fallopian tube carcinoma: review of MR imaging findings [^ccf75a63]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The aetiology of this type of tumour has not been completely explained. Hormonal, reproductive, and genetic factors may play a role, along with the presence of chronic inflammation of the pelvis.

PFTC may have a constellation of characteristic symptoms, namely colicky abdominal or pelvic pain and adnexal mass, relieved by intermittent, profuse, serosanguineous vaginal discharge, which constitute Laztko's triad (seen in only 15% of patients). Hydrops tubae profluens is a syndrome characterized by the relief of pain and shrinkage of the abdominal or pelvic mass by a vaginal discharge, which is caused by filling and emptying of a sub-occluded fallopian tube (seen in only 5% of patients). Typical symptoms, however, occur in only a minority of patients with PFTC, and most women present with less specific symptoms at the time of diagnosis. The age of presentation is commonly between 40 and 60 years, with a mean age of 55 years. The pre-operative diagnosis of PFTC is rarely performed, with clinical signs and symptoms pointing towards the more frequently occurring ovarian cancer or pelvic inflammatory disease. Tumour markers, particularly CA-125, have no role in the diagnosis of PFTC. Elevated CA-125 levels are, nevertheless, indicative of poor prognosis, and can be used during follow-up, as a marker of disease recurrence.

PFTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with postmenopausal bleeding with negative diagnostic curettage, cervical smear with intermittent suspicious abnormalities, and unexplained persistent vaginal discharge.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8240382a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Obstetrical and gynecological conditions — differential diagnosis outlines hallmark presentations and timing for abruptio placenta, placenta previa, ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placenta "Most frequently occurs in third trimester of pregnancy; placenta prematurely separates from the uterus causing intrauterine bleeding," with features including "Lower abdominal pain, uterine rigidity (often not present until abruption is advanced)," that "Vaginal bleeding – this symptom may not occur in cases of concealed abruption," and possible "Shock, with minimal or no vaginal bleeding." Placenta previa is described as "placenta covers part or all of the cervical opening," occurring "Generally, late second or third trimester" with "Painless vaginal bleeding, unless in active labor." Ectopic pregnancy is "First trimester" with "Abdominal/pelvic pain with or without minimal bleeding" and that "Shock is possible even with minimal or no vaginal bleeding." Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is "Generally, first trimester" with "Intermittent pelvic pain (uterine contractions) with vaginal bleeding/passage of clots or tissue."

### Myeloid sarcoma of the vagina: a report of 2 cases [^be269193]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe 2 cases of myeloid sarcoma of the vagina, in a patient without a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in another whose condition was previously diagnosed with AML.

Materials and Methods

The clinical histories of 2 patients whose conditions were diagnosed with myeloid sarcoma of the vagina were obtained from their medical records.

Results

Case 1: A 77-year-old woman with no systemic illnesses presented with a vaginal lump. Clinically, there was a 6-cm periurethral mass that was examined by biopsy. The histopathologic specimen was evaluated on routine and immunohistochemical stains, and myeloid sarcoma was diagnosed after extensive immunohistochemical analysis. The patient was treated with pelvic radiation. She developed extensive myeloid sarcoma of the skin and AML 4.5 months later; she died 2 weeks later, 5 months after the initial presentation. Case 2: A 36-year-old woman with a known history of AML who has had multiple leukemic and extramedullary recurrences presented with a pelvic mass. Physical findings revealed large masses in the vagina and rectovaginal septum, which were confirmed as myeloid sarcoma after biopsy and histologic examination. The patient was treated with pelvic/vaginal radiation. Five months later, she had another leukemic relapse and died within 1 day of palliative chemotherapy.

Conclusions

Myeloid sarcoma of the vagina is extremely rare. Most patients have a poor prognosis and either have a history of or will subsequently develop AML.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 728: Müllerian agenesis: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^398ef28a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Müllerian agenesis — background and typical presentation summarize incidence, anatomic features, and common evaluation context. Müllerian agenesis has an incidence of 1 per 4,500–5,000 females and is caused by embryologic underdevelopment of the müllerian duct with resultant agenesis or atresia of the vagina, uterus, or both. The vaginal canal is markedly shortened and may appear as a dimple below the urethra; a single midline uterine remnant may be present or uterine horns (with or without an endometrial cavity) may exist. The ovaries are typically normal in structure and function, though they may be found in atypical locations. Patients usually are identified when evaluated for primary amenorrhea with otherwise typical growth and pubertal development, and it is one of the most common causes of primary amenorrhea in patients with typical thelarche and adrenarche. On physical examination, patients have normal height, breast development, body hair, and external genitalia; the vagina is present and may appear as a small flush dimple, or longer, without a cervix at the vaginal apex. The differential diagnosis for primary amenorrhea with a shortened lower vagina includes obstructing vaginal or uterine anomalies such as imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or cervical atresia, and 46, XY differences (or disorders) of sex development may present with primary amenorrhea and absent uterus, including androgen insensitivity syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^957f4970]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Medical history and physical examination for vulvar symptoms — The medical history should include questions about the onset, duration, location, and nature of vulvar symptoms; the relationship of symptoms to the patient's menstrual cycle; and any possible precipitating or known risk factors, and in evaluating vulvar pruritus, separately grouping patients with acute and chronic symptoms can be helpful to guide the differential diagnosis. Patients who present with pain first should be evaluated to rule out an underlying clinically identifiable disorder, including inflammatory conditions, neoplasias, infections, or neurologic disorders; when other causes are ruled out, the diagnosis of vulvodynia can be made, and patients may have both a specific disorder and vulvar pain. Vulvar skin disorders can cause changes in the color, texture, and architecture of the vulvar anatomy, and clinicians should be familiar with normal vulvar anatomy and variations, should examine the entire vulva from clitoris to below the anus to confirm there are no changes in architecture, note that the clitoral hood should be mobile and easily retracted, and the entire vulva should be examined for changes in color and texture and to detect the presence of fissures, excoriations, erosions, ulcers, and other lesions.

### Diagnosis and management of gestational trophoblastic disease: 2021 update [^08593c3f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

4 CLINICAL PRESENTATION, INVESTIGATIONS, AND DIAGNOSIS

4.1 Molar pregnancy

Patients usually present with second trimester vaginal bleeding. As diagnosis is often made in the first trimester with ultrasound examination, complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum, pre‐eclampsia, and hyperthyroidism are less and less common. If there is vaginal passage of the gestational product, vesicles may be seen.

The typical honeycomb appearance of a complete mole is rarely seen, especially in the first trimester. Typically, there is absence of fetal parts and cystic appearance of the placenta. Hence, molar pregnancies should be diagnosed on histologic examination after evacuation for a spontaneous abortion or a suspected molar pregnancy.

4.2 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia

Postmolar GTN is usually diagnosed by hCG surveillance without symptoms. At the FIGO Gynecology Oncology Committee meeting in 2000, the definition of postmolar GTN based on hCG level changes, histology, and specific investigations was agreed (Box 1 and 2).

Box 1
FIGO criteria for diagnosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia

Box 2
Tools for investigation of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia

4.3 Human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring

For monitoring of GTN, an hCG assay that can detect all forms of hCG including beta‐hCG, core hCG, C‐terminal hCG, nicked‐free beta, beta core, and preferably the hyperglycosylated forms, should be used when possible. A persistently low hCG level needs continuous monitoring as some may progress to GTN with rising hCG levels. To exclude a false‐positive result, retest with another assay kit or a test for urine hCG may be used.

4.4 Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after nonmolar pregnancy

As only about 50% of GTN follows molar pregnancy, the rest can occur after a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or a term pregnancy. Aside from postpartum abnormal vaginal bleeding, other clinical presentations can include bleeding from metastatic sites such as the liver, spleen, intestines, lung, or brain, pulmonary symptoms, and neurological signs from spine or brain metastasis.GTN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unusual presentations and serum hCG should be performed as part of the workup of such patients.

### Vaginal yolk sac tumor: a case series and review of the literature [^b32a5b09]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of vaginal yolk sac tumor (YST) cases at a single institution and review literature on vaginal YST to outline advancements in diagnosis, treatment, and survival.

Design

Retrospective chart review of female patients less than 21 years of age with pathologic diagnosis of vaginal YST treated at a large children's hospital, and summary of a 100-year review of the literature on vaginal yolk sac tumor.

Setting

Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a tertiary center in Atlanta, GA.

Participants

Female patients less than 21 years of age diagnosed with vaginal YST.

Results

Two cases of vaginal YST at our institution are outlined. Both patients presented within the first 2 years of life with vaginal bleeding and were treated successfully with chemotherapy alone. After review of the literature, 137 cases of vaginal YST were found. The mean age at diagnosis was 11 months, and all patients presented with vaginal bleeding. Before 2000, more radical treatments were pursued, and 40% resulted in death. Since the year 2000, treatment has shifted toward chemotherapy and more conservative surgical management, with 51% of vaginal YST cases treated with chemotherapy alone with 92% of patients alive at time of publication.

Conclusion

Our cases contribute to the limited literature demonstrating the efficacy of conservative management of rare cases of vaginal YST with chemotherapy alone. This case series and review of the literature provide mounting evidence that vaginal YST should be in the differential diagnosis in young girls with vaginal tumors, and conservative management of vaginal YST has excellent outcomes.

### Atypical vaginal location of endometriosis following repeated urogynaecological surgery [^54846856]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We outline a case of vaginal endometriosis in scar tissue located in the distal part of the anterior vaginal wall close to the urethra following repeated urogynaecological surgery. Our case presents a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis in her youth. She underwent several vaginal surgeries due to pelvic organ prolapse, symptoms of stress incontinence and decreased urinary flow. One year after her most recent vaginal surgery, she developed a tender lump in the lower part of the anterior vaginal wall. A urethral diverticulum was suspected, but a diagnostic puncture and biopsy unexpectedly showed histologically verified endometriosis. As the cyst recurred, surgical excision of all visible endometriosis tissue was performed. After 3years of follow-up, the patient remained without recurrence. This case illustrates the risk of atypical implantation of endometriosis related to repeated urogynaecological surgery and that treatment requires surgery with thorough removal of all visible tissues.

### Committee opinion No 673: persistent vulvar pain [^2440b50b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Persistent vulvar pain — classification and diagnostic evaluation — states that vulvar pain can be caused by a specific disorder or it can be idiopathic, and idiopathic vulvar pain is classified as vulvodynia; the classification of vulvodynia is based on the site of the pain; whether it is generalized, localized, or mixed; whether it is provoked, spontaneous, or mixed; whether the onset is primary or secondary; and the temporal pattern. A thorough history should identify the patient's duration of pain, medical and surgical history, sexual history, allergies, and previous treatments, and cotton swab testing is used to identify the areas of pain (classifying each area of pain as mild, moderate, or severe) and to differentiate between generalized and localized pain. The vulva and vagina should be examined, and infection ruled out when indicated using tests, including wet mount, vaginal pH, fungal culture, and Gram stain, or other available point-of-care testing or polymerase chain reaction testing, and a musculoskeletal evaluation would help rule out musculoskeletal factors associated with vulvodynia, such as pelvic muscle overactivity and myofascial or other biomechanical disorders.

### Sexually active cisgender female adolescent with red urine and abdominal pain [^101d1af0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical Course

A sexually active cisgender female adolescent with a two-week history of back pain presented to clinic with red urine, dysuria, nausea, and diarrhea. On examination, she was found to have CMT and negative STI screens. She was diagnosed with PID. The patient visited the ED for continued abdominal pain three days after initiating treatment for PID. Imaging ruled out tubular ovarian abscess (TOA). She later returned to her PCP's office with improved nausea and pain.

Final Diagnosis

Pelvic inflammatory disease.

Making a Diagnosis of PID

PID is a clinical diagnosis, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends presumptive treatment for women at risk of STIs with pelvic or lower abdominal pain AND at least one of the following four criteria: (1) no other cause for the illness can be identified, (2) CMT, (3) uterine tenderness, or (4) adnexal tenderness.

Supportive examination and laboratory findings include fever, vaginal discharge with white blood cells (WBCs) on microscopy, elevated CRP and ESR, and positive STI tests. These are not required for diagnosis. This patient had abdominal pain, CMT, and mildly elevated ESR. Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment should not wait for laboratory results and are imperative to avoid complications. Frequently, as with this patient, STI results may be negative as testing for many implicated pathogens is not readily accessible (see section "Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female") and the available STI testing is conducted on a sample collected from the lower reproductive tract, not the upper reproductive organs.

Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female

Several diagnoses were considered for this patient (Table 1). The differential diagnosis for PID can be even more broad.

### Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma presenting as a female periurethral mass [^54fdd8c9]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Periurethral mass in women is an uncommon diagnosis, which is a challenge to the medical professionals due to the nonspecific clinical presentation and a broad differential diagnosis. Urethral diverticulum is the most common pathology (84%), whereas vaginal cyst (6%) and leiomyoma (7%) comprise the majority of the remaining pathologies. Most of the periurethral lesions are benign and malignant lesions are extremely rare. Although the risk of malignancy is small, differentiating between benign and malignant lesions is important for management and surveillance. Imaging techniques including MRI and CT can provide useful information to aid diagnosis. when a preliminary diagnosis cannot be made based on physical examination and radiologic studies, biopsy should be performed.

Intestinal-type adenocarcinomas are aggressive malignancies which are most frequently localized in in the sinonasal tract. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of intestinal-type adenocarcinoma arising in the periurethral region. In present case, immunohistochemical stains showed positive reaction for CK20 and CDX2, supporting the diagnosis of intestinal-type adenocarcinoma. As the tumor mimic the appearances of carcinomas or adenomas of intestinal origin, extensive research including gastrointestinal tract fiberscope, cystoscopy and CT scan should be performed to rule out the primary colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Due to the rarity of this tumor, there is no data in literature regarding strategy for their optimal treatment. As Intestinal-type adenocarcinomas behave as high-grade malignancies, radical cystourethrectomy with a wide resection of the paraurethral tissue and anterior vaginal wall, may offer superior local control. In this case, the patient refused radical cystourethrectomy and received surgical resection of the periurethral mass with entire urethra and part of the anterior vagina wall. Since the distal end of the mass is firmly adjacent to the vaginal wall, transperineal approach may be necessary for the complete excision of the mass. For patients with locally advanced disease, a multimodal therapeutic approach is required. In this case, the palliative chemotherapy was administered to our patient because of positive surgical margin. The inclusion of systemic therapy may offer improvement of local control and reduction of distant metastasis.

In conclusion, we have reported the first case of the primary periurethral adenocarcinoma of intestinal type. There are currently no standardized protocols for the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of this rare tumor. This case study can aid decision-making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of this tumor.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^706540ec]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. Treatment Short-course topical formulations effectively treat uncomplicated VVC.

Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy. Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents. Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days OR Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days. OR Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days OR Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days. Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Severe VVC is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses is recommended.

### Pelvic prolapse [^512a48e7]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pelvic prolapse is a common problem affecting women of all ages. We reviewed the pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation and treatment of pelvic prolapse.

Materials and Methods

We comprehensively reviewed the literature using MEDLINE, resources cited in those peer reviewed articles and abstracts from recent international meetings.

Results

Pelvic prolapse involves the herniation of various portions of the vaginal wall. Symptoms vary according to the area of the vagina affected. Proper evaluation is imperative for providing proper treatment. Various surgical approaches to repair have been developed and techniques continue to evolve.

Conclusions

With the increasing involvement of urologists in the treatment of pelvic prolapse it is essential for us to become familiar with the anatomy, and the evaluation and management options available. We provide an overview of the care of patients with pelvic prolapse.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 780 [^5e7caa78]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

At puberty, a patient with an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by the hematocolpos behind it. Other findings that may be present include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia. On evaluation, the goal is to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies, such as labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia. Surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients. After confirmation of the diagnosis, surgical intervention usually is deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. It is important to complete an abdominal and a perineal examination. If the physical examination reveals a bulging hymen and ultrasonography reveals hematocolpos, further imaging is not required. However, if the diagnosis is not certain or there is a concern for a distal vaginal atresia, cervical atresia, an obstructed uterine horn, or transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum, magnetic resonance imaging is recommended. The ideal time for surgical intervention on hymenal tissue is before the onset of pain and after onset of pubertal development, when the vaginal tissue is estrogenized. Surgical management of clinically significant hymenal variations involves excision of the hymenal tissue and rarely is associated with long-term sequelae. If there is concern that the patient has a distal vaginal atresia or a transverse vaginal septum, the patient should be referred to a center with expertise in the management of these conditions.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^d65bae3a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — diagnosis of imperforate hymen at puberty highlights typical presentation and evaluation steps. At puberty, an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia. On evaluation, the goal is to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies such as labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia.

However, if the diagnosis is not certain or there is concern for a distal vaginal atresia, cervical atresia, an obstructed uterine horn, or transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended. Typically, an imperforate hymen is an isolated issue and does not have long-term effects on fertility, sexual function, or obstetric outcomes.

### Congenital urethral polyps in girls: as a differential diagnosis of interlabial masses [^ec5a08e9]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To present the clinical appearance, differential diagnosis, long-term follow-up, and the surgical result of single-center experience with female urethral polyps presenting as an interlabial mass, and to report the common causes of interlabial masses in infants.

Design

All 12 girls who presented with an interlabial mass and intermittent bleeding have been included in this study; however, the benign urethral polyps are discussed in detail and are the subject of this study.

Setting

All patients were referred to our national referral pediatric urology center with initial impression of vaginal bleeding; however, rhabdomyosarcoma of bladder and urethra (n = 2) or vagina (n = 3) and urethral polyp (n = 7) was the final diagnosis.

Participants

The records of 12 girls who presented with external genitalia bleeding were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 7 had fibroepithelial polyps and underwent initial polypectomy between 2001 and 2011with mean age of 21.5 months (range: 1–90 mo). All girls underwent endoscopic surgical removal of polyps.

Main Outcome Measures

No postoperative polyp recurrence was observed following endoscopic polyp resection.

Results

The postoperative period was uneventful except in 1 girl who had immediate postoperative urethral bleeding which stopped spontaneously. There was no major complication or polyp recurrence after operation during the long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

The interlabial mass must be considered as a urethral polyp and should be differentiated from the vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma with protrusion of vaginal tumor from the vaginal outlet or other benign lesions. Physical examination in frog legged position or examination under anesthesia with urethrocystoscopy may confirm the final diagnosis.

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^5d26c5d3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In our population-based cohort of patients with cancer, certain presenting symptoms, such as neck lump, had stronger associations with stage IV disease than others, but for most symptoms we found that large proportions of patients were diagnosed at stages other than stage IV. The relative order of symptom-specific associations was broadly comparable whether symptoms were seen alone or with other symptoms. Adjustment for confounders including cancer site made little difference to the overall pattern of associations between symptoms and stage at diagnosis.

With regard to associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis, direct comparisons with existing literature are challenging because published studies are cancer-site specific. Evidence from such studies provides an incomplete picture of associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis, because individuals who present with the same symptoms could be diagnosed with cancers of different sites. By contrast, in this study, we evaluated the presenting symptoms of patients with a range of common and rarer cancers and examined associations with and without adjustment for the case-mix of cancer sites in our study population. Nevertheless, in previous studies, among patients with colorectal cancer, rectal bleeding has been associated with earlier stage at diagnosis compared with abdominal pain and change in bowel habit, whereas in patients with ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal symptoms (including abdominal pain, digestive bowel symptoms, and distension) have been more strongly associated with advanced stage cancer than gynaecological symptoms such as vaginal bleeding.

Except for one published study (which examined three symptoms and their combinations with stage), the existing literature does not differentiate symptoms according to when they are reported on their own or when they are reported with other symptoms. By contrast, our study characterised associations between symptoms and stage, both when a symptom was reported alone and when it was reported together with other symptoms, which allowed us to adjust for potential interactions between all possible symptom combinations.

A key strength of our study is that it examined the association between presenting symptoms and stage in a well-characterised population-based incident cohort of patients with different cancers. The NCDA represents a unique combination of information provided by GPs and other health-care professionals based on clinical insight and judgment, with high-quality information about patient and tumour characteristics from the national cancer registry in England.

### Clinical presentation of childhood soft tissue sarcomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^46073b0c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Time to diagnosis (TTD) of childhood soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is significantly associated with survival. This review aims to identify pre-diagnostic symptoms/signs to inform earlier diagnosis interventions.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cochrane and Web-of-Science were searched between January 2010 and February 2021 for studies including children (< 18 years) diagnosed with STS, with no language restrictions. Pooled proportions of symptoms/signs were calculated and subanalysed by tumour location and age.

Results

Fifty-nine eligible studies were identified, totalling 2462 cases. The most frequent symptoms were lump/swelling (38%, 95% CI 27% to 51%), pain (6%, 95% CI 3% to 10%), cutaneous changes (4%, 95% CI 0 to 9%), localised eye swelling (3%, 95% CI 0 to 7%), cranial nerve deficits (2%, 95% CI 0 to 5%) and constitutional symptoms (2%, 95% CI 0 to 5%). Symptoms varied by location and age. Localised eye swelling (20%, 95% CI 3% to 45%), cranial nerve deficits (14%, 95% CI 4% to 28%) and impaired visual function (6%, 95% CI 0 to 17%) were frequent in head and neck tumours. For abdomen/pelvic tumours, urinary symptoms (24%, 95% CI 5% to 15%), abdominal distension/discomfort (22%, 95% CI 4% to 47%), genital lump/swelling (16%, 95% CI 1% to 42%), constitutional symptoms (9%, 95% CI 0%] to 23%), vaginal bleeding (7%, 95%C I 0 to 21%) and bowel habit changes (6%, 95% CI 0 to 17%) were frequent. In < 5 years, consumptive coagulopathy (16%, 95% CI 0 to 48%), cutaneous changes (5%, 95% CI 0 to 40%), genital lump/swelling (4%, 95% CI 0 to 14%), reduced mobility (3%, 95% CI 0 to 11%), vaginal bleeding (2%, 95% CI 0 to 11%) and bleeding/bruising/petechiae (2%, 95% CI 0 to 20%) were frequent compared with lump/swelling, constitutional symptoms, pain and headaches which were frequent among > 11 years.

Conclusions

For STS, pre-diagnostic symptoms differ by age and location, highlighting the need to tailor early diagnosis interventions.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^e9e7364d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrophic dermatitis should be high on the differential for postmenopausal women with acute or chronic itch or women taking medications that modulate or suppress estrogen. Timing of itch onset in relation to hormonal medications should be considered. Another important differential to consider is GSM, a chronic, progressive condition caused by estrogen deficiency, which affects the vulvovaginal and lower urinary tract. GSM commonly presents with symptoms such as vulvovaginal dryness, burning, irritation, and pruritus, making it a potential cause of unexplained itching in postmenopausal women. If GSM is suspected, referral to gynecology is warranted for further evaluation and management. The presence of vaginal atrophy can be assessed on physical exam.

Other causes of vulvovaginal pruritus should be considered when common infectious and inflammatory causes have been ruled out and the clinical picture suits another domain, especially in cases of chronic pruritus or when treatment has failed to improve symptoms. Neuropathic itching may arise from conditions such as vulvodynia, small fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN), scars and burns, postherpetic neuralgias, radiculopathies, or spinal nerve compression. The presence of risk factors for neuropathy, associated burning pain or neurological symptoms, pruritus with a dermatomal distribution or in the location of previous lesions, or sensory abnormalities may be associated. Nerve conduction studies, imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower spine to assess for spinal stenosis, mapping of pruritus by neural distribution, and assessment for an itch response to a nonpruritic stimulus may be used to assess for neurologic vulvovaginal pruritus. Laboratory studies that can assess for causes of SFPN include hemoglobin A1C, hepatic and renal disease panels, HIV testing, and vitamin B 12 level. However, these conditions would not likely cause itch limited only to the vulvar region.

Neoplasms, such as squamous cell carcinoma and syringomas, are rare causes of vaginal itch but should be considered when associated with unclear, abnormally pigmented, ulcerated, or persistent, ulcerating lesions or a history of vulvar or cervical dysplasias. Lesions are often slow-growing, painless, and multifocal. A low threshold to biopsy lesions that do not respond to treatment may prevent delayed diagnosis and dermal invasion. Figure 2 provides a visualization of the diagnostic algorithm for the majority of these conditions.

### Urethral diverticulum mimicking anterior vaginal wall prolapse: case report [^5d2cfa86]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Unfamiliar cystic formations may develop in the anterior vaginal wall. In view of the close proximity of the anterior vagina to the urethra and bladder, it is important that management of such masses is carefully planned after detailed examination and investigation. Herein, we present the case of an unusual painful swelling in the anterior vaginal wall that was first diagnosed as vaginal wall prolapse. Despite thorough preoperative investigations, the origin of the mass as a urethral diverticulum was confirmed only at pathologic analysis.

### Large foreign body reaction to tension-free vaginal tape masquerading as inguinal hernia [^8caa6215]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 73-year-old woman who presented to general surgery with a tender lump in the groin 5 years after insertion of a tension-free vaginal tape. The lesion was thought to be an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Emergency surgical exploration revealed a 7 × 5 × 4 cm soft tissue mass which was adherent to the external inguinal ring, emanating from the end of the tension-free vaginal tape at the level of the symphysis pubis. Resection and histological examination revealed a central track of granulation tissue with a surrounding foreign body inflammatory response. The surgery was complicated by an infected seroma requiring surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy, following which the patient made a full recovery. Large foreign body reaction is a rare but an important complication of tension-free vaginal tapes and may be mistaken for a groin hernia or lymphadenopathy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pelvic organ prolapse, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that many patients with POP on physical examination do not report symptoms of POP. Offer treatment only if the prolapse is causing bothersome bulge and pressure symptoms, sexual dysfunction, lower urinary tract dysfunction, or defecatory dysfunction.

### CT angiography of the lower abdomen should be considered with vaginal trauma and excessive bleeding, even though there are no pelvic fractures present [^732809a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The blunt trauma to the pelvis caused a rupture of the vaginal back wall without osseous injuries. The bleeding identified in the ED was initially suspected to be caused by venous bleeding from the vaginal wall rupture, but after persistent and increased blood loss during the first attempt at closure, it was suspected that there was a missed arterial bleed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^ed674afc]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis considerations — OAB must be distinguished from polydipsia and diabetes insipidus (DI); frequency that is the result of polydipsia and resulting polyuria may mimic OAB but the two can only be distinguished with the use of frequency-volume charts, and in polydipsia urinary frequency occurs with normal or large volume voids and the intake is volume matched, while DI is associated with frequent, large volume voids and should be distinguished from OAB. The clinical presentation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without urgency incontinence; however, bladder and/or pelvic pain, particularly dyspareunia, is crucial in contradistinction to OAB, and in menopausal female patients atrophic vaginitis can contribute to incontinence symptoms with some evidence for symptom improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen.

### A 14-year-old girl with recurrent vulvar abscess [^88de91a1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease is a relatively common condition that may present in a myriad of fashions, from the more frequently seen symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain to the less likely presentations with fistulas and abscesses.

Case

A 14-year-old female with a presumed diagnosis of a Bartholin's gland cyst was treated for over 1 year with both medical and surgical interventions without her symptoms ever completely resolving. It was later found that these recurring vulvar abscesses were a manifestation of Crohn's disease.

Conclusion

While the patient's history and physical are both very important in determining cause for pathology, we must also realize the importance of re-examining and broadening our differential diagnosis when faced with a patient who has failed multiple avenues of care.

### Unique presentation of hematometrocolpos mimicking cauda equina syndrome: severe back pain and urinary incontinence in an adolescent girl [^b7558626]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Imperforate hymen with hematometrocolpos in adolescent females is a rare pediatric condition. Classical presentation includes abdominal pain or a pelvic mass in female patients with primary amenorrhea. Atypical complaints and reluctance among emergency physicians to perform genital examination in the emergency department or the pediatric emergency department (PED) may delay correct diagnosis.

Case Report

We report a unique, cauda equina syndrome-like presentation of hematometrocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen in a 13-year old, previously healthy girl with primary amenorrhea. In the PED, the unusual clinical presentation of severe back pain and urinary incontinence initially mimicked cauda equina syndrome and led to delayed correct diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The novelty of this case is a cauda equina-like presentation of imperforate hymen secondary to hematocolpos. This report illustrates the highly variable clinical presentation of this rare gynecological pediatric entity. It underlines the importance of considering this rare condition in the differential diagnosis of severe upper or lower back pain alongside voiding abnormalities including urinary retention and incontinence in adolescent females with primary amenorrhea. Above all, the importance of performing a thorough history and genital examination in this subgroup early in the investigation process in the PED emerges from this case. Essentially, excellent clinical judgment and genital examination by the emergency physician may minimize unnecessary radiological investigations and ultimately, accelerate correct diagnosis and expedite appropriate surgical treatment. However, not only pediatric and adult emergency physicians, but also pediatricians and general practitioners should be aware of this entity and its diverse clinical presentation.

### Gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting as a recurrent vaginal mass [^11277e88]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are CD117 (c-Kit)-positive mesenchymal neoplasms with histologic and ultrastructural features of the interstitial cell of Cajal. While tumors outside of the gastrointestinal tract have been described, to our knowledge the case we present is the first such case in the vagina. We describe a 75-year-old woman with a recurrent vaginal gastrointestinal stromal tumor without apparent rectal involvement. This tumor was characterized by short intersecting fascicles of spindled cells, focal necrosis, and 12 to 15 mitoses per 50 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for CD117 (c-Kit), CD34, vimentin, and h-caldesmon. Tumor cells were negative for S100, desmin, actin, and CAM 5.2. The differential diagnosis in this case included a vaginal smooth muscle tumor. While histologically similar to a smooth muscle neoplasm, the immunohistochemical profile ruled out smooth muscle differentiation. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vaginal mesenchymal neoplasms.

### Diagnostic criteria for differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and vulvar aberrant maturation [^fe5465de]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a white plaque within abnormal skin includes lichenified LS, LS with mycotic superinfection, the border of erosive LP, VAM, and HSIL. Indicators of mycosis include erythema, labial edema, vaginal discharge, satellite lesions, erosions, fissures, and keratin debris. White plaques associated with erosive LP are thin, well demarcated, located beside a glazed red patch, and homogenous in color and texture. Vulvar aberrant maturation is well demarcated and thick or verrucous. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is variable in size, shape, number of lesions, and thickness but usually presents as a white, gray, red, pink, tan, brown, and/or black plaque, sometimes showing punctuation and mosaicism. Despite these clues, expert physical examination may not reliably distinguish between diagnoses, so histopathologic assessment is necessary.

Summary of Clinical Findings Consistent With dVIN and VAM

Differentiated VIN presents as treatment-resistant lesions different to surrounding abnormal skin. Color, texture, location, size, and focality are variable. The 3 most common appearances are a thick white plaque, a thin pink-red plaque, and a red glazed patch. Vulvar aberrant maturation manifests as a white nodule or plaque in a field of lichenoid dermatitis. If areas identified histologically as VAM persist despite potent topical and/or intralesional steroids, excision is recommended.

Histopathology of dVIN and VAM

General Principles for Evaluation of Vulvar Squamous Neoplasia

The traditional approach begins with H&E and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)–stained slides, reviewed first at low power and then sequentially higher power. At each step, interpretation is associated with greater interobserver disagreement. At low power, pathologists identify architectural features such as epithelial thickness, rete ridge length and shape, stromal collagen, and lymphocytic infiltrate (Table 1). At medium power, pathologists assess for surface features, intercellular breakdown, and epithelial maturation (Table 2). Evidence of dyskeratosis emerges, to include intracellular vacuoles, suprabasilar apoptotic bodies, and premature maturation defined as large suprabasilar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. At high power, pathologists inspect nuclei for atypical features: abnormal chromatin, pleomorphism, increased and/or abnormal mitoses, and enlargement (Table 3). A decision about IHC occurs after review of H&E and PAS.

### Cancer of the vulva [^565f2516]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar cancer is an uncommon gynecological malignancy primarily affecting postmenopausal women. There is no specific screening and the most effective strategy to reduce vulvar cancer incidence is the opportune treatment of predisposing and preneoplastic lesions associated with its development. While vulvar cancer may be asymptomatic, most women present with vulvar pruritus or pain, or have noticed a lump or ulcer. Therefore, any suspicious vulvar lesion should be biopsied to exclude invasion. Once established, the most common subtype is squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment of vulvar cancer depends primarily on histology and surgical staging. Treatment is predominantly surgical, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma, although concurrent chemoradiation is an effective alternative, particularly for advanced tumors. Management should be individualized, and carried out by a multidisciplinary team in a cancer center experienced in the treatment of these tumors.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^877fbe29]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Imperforate hymen — neonatal and pubertal presentations and initial management are described as follows: the imperforate hymen may present in the neonatal period as a hydrocolpos or mucocolpos with a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass at the introitus, and surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients with intervention usually deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, typical findings include a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos that distends further with the Valsalva maneuver; pain may be pelvic or abdominal, cyclic or acute, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^e4171721]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a cardinal symptom of carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix but not one of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this unusual mode of presentation is important.

Case

We report a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a 60-year-old woman, who presented primarily with postmenopausal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a "thickened" area on the posterior vaginal wall. Repeated vaginal biopsies showed fibrosis and inflammatory tissue only. Immunohistochemistry revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges such a complex case presents.

Conclusion

This case not only represents a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with genital involvement but also highlights the importance of diagnosis and management of such complex cases.

### Executive summary of the lower anogenital tract cancer evidence review conference [^7017b225]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Techniques for Evaluation

We found no studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of any lower genital tract evaluation tool in patients with symptoms. The most commonly used tools found in our search were pelvic examination, rectal examination, digital anorectal examination, cytology, vaginal or vulvar colposcopy, or high-resolution anoscopy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pelvic examination when indicated by medical history or symptoms. Symptoms may include, but are not limited to, abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, or vaginal bulge. Detection of vulvar cancers or precancers is limited to visual assessment and confirmation by histopathology. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends performing biopsy for visible lesions when
Lesions are atypical (eg, new pigmentation, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated)
Concern for malignancy exists
Lesions are in a patient who is immunocompromised (including those living with HIV)
The diagnosis is uncertain
Lesions do not respond to standard therapy
The disease worsens during therapy

### Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor-a pictorial review [^33f3ac67]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Functional evaluation of the three compartments

Functional disorders of the pelvic floor may result from various causes. It is important to realize that, although prolapses may coexist with relaxation/laxity of the support structures, and themselves may induce functional disorders from external compression, pelvic prolapses can be independent from functional disorders. Pelvic organ prolapses are defined as abnormal descent/bulge of the walls of the vagina, caused by protrusion of adjacent pelvic viscera. This is a consequence of an anatomic defect in the support structures. Pelvic floor relaxation/laxity is triggered by lack of response and/or weakness of both the pelvic diaphragm and endopelvic fascia. This presents clinically as dysfunction of the normal continence mechanisms and/or constipation, related to widening and descent of the pelvic floor.

Anterior compartment disorders

Anterior compartment disorders, especially in the female patient, are always a clinical challenge, due to the nonspecific signs they usually present, such as urinary frequency, urinary urgency, incontinence, dysuria, or pelvic pain. MR Defecography is, nowadays, the imaging modality of choice for the preoperative assessment of the anterior compartment dysfunctions. The main role of this study is to detect the actual position and mobility of the bladder, the bladder neck, and the urethra, while it can also search for associated or other diseases of the lower urinary tract, such as urethral diverticulum, which in 60% of cases presents as urinary incontinence, mimicking other dysfunctions and usually being referenced for surgical treatment.

The main functional differential diagnosis in these patients is the presence of a cystocele, with or without associated urethral hypermobility, which presents as a spectrum of abnormalities with its associated range of symptoms.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^cb78b284]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — physical and gynecologic examination to exclude organic etiologies: In a patient with suspected FHA, we recommend excluding pregnancy and performing a full physical examination, including a gynecological examination (external, and in selected cases, bimanual), to evaluate the possibility of organic etiologies of amenorrhea. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) A full physical examination, including weight, height, and an external gynecologic and bimanual examination, enables consideration of the broad differential diagnosis and should include evaluating fundi and visual fields (to rule out papilledema or visual field deficits) and examining for galactorrhea, thyromegaly, hirsutism, acne, or clitoromegaly; lateralizing neurologic signs might indicate intracranial pathology; FHA also manifests symptoms such as bradycardia, mottled, cool extremities, and dermal manifestations of hypercarotenemia; signs of androgen excess and hyperinsulinism should raise concerns of PCOS or other causes of androgen excess; external examination may reveal reddened, thin vaginal mucosa in estrogen-deficient young women and a bluish tinge in patients with an imperforate hymen; the bimanual examination can be helpful to rule out an adnexal mass and is most critical in cases of primary amenorrhea to evaluate for imperforate hymen, Müllerian anomaly (with a shortened vagina and absent or rudimentary uterus), or androgen insensitivity (blind vaginal pouch); depending on clinician skill and patient preference/cooperation, patients with amenorrhea (and some young adolescents) might consider a transabdominal or transvaginal pelvic sonogram on initial presentation instead of the bimanual examination.
