## Question

how do I evaluate eye twitching

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate eye twitching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the movement and distinguishing eyelid myokymia from mimics. Then, I should verify the key history elements that separate benign from worrisome causes. Next, I will review the focused examination and when to escalate to labs or imaging. After that, I need to consider the differential diagnosis and red flags. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including when to observe, when to treat, and when to refer, and I should double-check any controversial remedies like tonic water before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and core definition so I don't anchor incorrectly: eyelid myokymia is an involuntary, rhythmic, fascicular contraction of the orbicularis oculi, most often unilateral and in the lower eyelid, and it is typically benign and self-limited, resolving within hours to days, though chronic cases can persist for weeks to months [^113cXV26] [^1138rmMK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — excess blinking or eyelid closure can reflect other entities such as tics, blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, or ocular surface disease, so I need to check the phenomenology carefully: tics are sudden, nonrhythmic, suppressible movements with premonitory urges. Blepharospasm is stereotyped, bilateral, synchronous orbicularis oculi spasms causing eyelid narrowing or closure and often responds to sensory tricks. Hemifacial spasm is unilateral and may persist during sleep, distinguishing it from myokymia and blepharospasm [^111giW8U] [^111X8w6V] [^116GYiZS].

> I should confirm the key history elements that stratify risk: onset and duration (hours to days versus weeks to months), laterality, triggers such as stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and caffeine, associated ocular symptoms (dryness, irritation, foreign body sensation), neurologic symptoms (facial weakness, ptosis, diplopia, limb weakness, sensory changes), medication and supplement use (SSRIs, stimulants, antipsychotics), and systemic symptoms (weight change, heat intolerance, rash, arthralgia), because these can pivot the evaluation toward ocular surface disease, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, or medication-induced movements [^113cXV26] [^114UGnNJ] [^113DuAGJ].

> Wait, let me verify the focused examination steps so I don't miss mimics: inspect the lids and ocular surface for blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or dry eye. Observe the spasm pattern for laterality, synchrony, and persistence. Check for ptosis, diplopia, or ophthalmoplegia suggesting cranial nerve or neuromuscular junction disease. Perform a fatigability assessment for myasthenia (prolonged upgaze, ice or rest test). And screen the facial nerve for other weakness patterns that would raise concern for hemifacial spasm or Bell's palsy sequelae [^112kyft6] [^116z2eZE] [^116GYiZS].

> I need to ensure I don't over-order tests in straightforward cases: for isolated, brief, unilateral eyelid myokymia without neurologic or ocular signs, no labs or imaging are indicated. If there are atypical features, persistent symptoms beyond 3 months, or neurologic signs, consider brain MRI to exclude structural lesions, and if myasthenia is suspected, pursue acetylcholine receptor antibodies and consider edrophonium or sleep/ice testing with neurology referral. Routine labs are not recommended for uncomplicated Bell's palsy and should be reserved for suspected systemic disease or atypical presentations [^113ujmPt] [^112SgANq].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis systematically so I don't anchor on myokymia: benign eyelid myokymia, blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, tics, ocular surface disease with reflex blepharospasm, medication-induced movements, and, less commonly, neuromuscular junction disorders such as myasthenia gravis; red flags that warrant expedited workup include persistent symptoms beyond 3 months, spread beyond the eyelid, facial weakness, ptosis or diplopia, systemic neurologic signs, or medication associations [^113cXV26] [^116GYiZS] [^1166zDEp].

> I should double-check management for benign myokymia: reassurance, trigger mitigation (reduce caffeine, improve sleep, manage stress), and observation are first-line. Most cases resolve spontaneously within days to weeks, and chronic cases may respond to botulinum toxin injections, though I need to confirm the diagnosis before proceeding to chemodenervation and screen for myasthenia if suspected to avoid worsening weakness [^113cXV26] [^1156j3Ui].

> But wait, what about tonic water — does it help myokymia? The proposed mechanism is quinine's membrane-stabilizing effect, and a short trial of one to two glasses daily for a few days is unlikely to cause harm in most patients. However, I should confirm there is no quinine hypersensitivity, arrhythmia risk, or interacting medication, and I must emphasize that evidence is anecdotal and the condition is self-limited, so any perceived benefit may be coincidental [^1138rmMK].

> For blepharospasm, I should confirm that botulinum toxin is the first-line therapy with high response rates in open studies, while acknowledging that randomized controlled trial quality is limited. Counseling should include risks of reduced blinking, corneal exposure, and the need for periodic reinjection, and I must avoid botulinum toxin in undiagnosed myasthenia gravis because it can exacerbate weakness [^111Nuhxc] [^1136n4jQ].

> For hemifacial spasm, let me verify that botulinum toxin is effective symptomatic therapy and that microvascular decompression is a definitive option for vascular compression at the root exit zone. I should also consider that persistent unilateral spasms, especially if spreading or present during sleep, strengthen the diagnosis and justify imaging to exclude compressive lesions [^116GYiZS].

> I will now examine when to refer so I don't delay specialty input: refer urgently for new-onset facial weakness or Bell's palsy with impaired eye closure for eye protection and steroid management. Refer to neurology for suspected myasthenia gravis, hemifacial spasm, or atypical movement disorders. Refer to ophthalmology for ocular surface disease, refractive error, or persistent symptoms beyond 3 months without resolution [^1164UxKM] [^1166zDEp].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure coherence: define the movement and exclude mimics, elicit targeted history for triggers and systemic or neurologic red flags, perform a focused ocular and neurologic examination with fatigability testing when indicated, reserve imaging and serologic testing for atypical or persistent cases, manage benign myokymia conservatively with observation and trigger reduction, and escalate to botulinum toxin or disease-specific therapies for blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm while ensuring timely referral for suspected neuromuscular or structural disease [^113cXV26] [^112kyft6] [^113ujmPt].

Eye twitching is usually **benign and self-limited** [^113cXV26], most often due to fatigue, stress, or caffeine [^113cXV26]. Evaluate with a focused history and exam to confirm **simple myokymia** and exclude red flags (facial weakness, diplopia, ptosis, or systemic symptoms) [^112kyft6]. No routine labs or imaging are needed for isolated eyelid twitching; **reassure, reduce triggers, and treat only if persistent or bothersome** [^111q81SB]. Consider botulinum toxin for chronic cases [^113cXV26]; avoid quinine/tonic water due to limited benefit and safety concerns [^115AYkzP].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Benign | - Eyelid myokymia (simple, self-limited) [^113cXV26] <br/> - Stress/fatigue-related twitching [^113cXV26] <br/> - Caffeine/alcohol-induced twitching [^notfound] |
| Neurologic | - Hemifacial spasm [^116GYiZS] <br/> - Blepharospasm [^111X8w6V] <br/> - Facial nerve disorders (e.g. Bell's palsy) [^1164UxKM] <br/> - Multiple sclerosis [^113cXV26] <br/> - Parkinson's disease [^notfound] |

| Systemic | - Electrolyte imbalances (calcium, magnesium, potassium) [^notfound] <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction [^notfound] <br/> - Medication side effects (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants) [^1129vztQ] |

---

## Diagnostic tests

Routine laboratory tests are **not indicated** for isolated eyelid twitching without systemic symptoms [^notfound]. Imaging (MRI or CT) is reserved for persistent symptoms with neurologic signs or suspicion of structural lesions [^notfound]. Electromyography (EMG) is rarely needed; consider if hemifacial spasm or other neuromuscular disorders are suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

- **Observation and reassurance**: most cases resolve spontaneously [^113cXV26].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: reduce stress, improve sleep, limit caffeine/alcohol [^113cXV26].
- **Treat underlying conditions**: dry eye, blepharitis, refractive errors, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid dysfunction [^117Szz48] [^113DuAGJ].
- **Medications**: botulinum toxin injections for persistent or severe cases (e.g. hemifacial spasm, blepharospasm) [^111Nuhxc].
- **Avoid quinine/tonic water**: limited evidence, potential toxicity [^115AYkzP].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent symptoms**: lasting > 3 months without resolution [^112T6ec3].
- **Neurologic signs**: facial weakness, diplopia, ptosis, or other neurologic deficits [^112T6ec3].
- **Suspected structural lesions**: based on history or examination [^115YnfZz].
- **Refractory cases**: despite conservative management [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** for most cases of simple eyelid twitching, which resolve spontaneously or with conservative management [^113cXV26]. Persistent cases may require ongoing treatment but generally have a favorable outlook [^113cXV26].

---

Eye twitching is usually benign; use a focused history and exam to confirm simple myokymia and exclude red flags. Most cases resolve with reassurance and trigger reduction; **reserve imaging or labs for atypical or persistent cases with neurologic signs** [^112kyft6].

Conclusions

We have reviewed IEM in which the onset of symptoms can occur relatively late in life and in which ocular motor abnormalities can be a prominent sign. Recognition of these patterns of abnormalities of eye movements is important because they may be the key to accurate early diagnosis and thus to a timely start of treatment. Unfortunately, there continues to be a lack of information about eye movement disorders in many IEMs because little attention is given to them in daily practice. Examination of the vestibular system, in particular, is neglected in most studies even though it often provides essential information about localization and diagnosis. Disorders of hearing are commonly recognized in many IEMs, but vestibular function is rarely commented upon. A standard, focused examination of the different subtypes of eye movements (range of motion, gaze‐holding, saccades, pursuit, and vestibular responses) can be performed relatively quickly in most patients during routine physical examination. Testing with video‐oculography has also become more user‐ and patient‐friendly and helps to quantify the eye movement abnormalities, making these abnormalities a valuable biomarker for following the natural course of disease or the response to therapies.

Bell's palsy — algorithm of guideline key action statements: For a patient presenting with acute onset, unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, assess with history & physical exam to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis/paralysis, prescribe oral steroids, and offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids. If the Bell's palsy patient has incomplete eye closure, implement eye protection. If the Bell's palsy patient has complete facial paralysis, offer electrodiagnostic testing. When any of the following are present — new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, ocular symptoms developing at any point, or incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial onset — reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist or ocular specialist for ocular symptoms; if none apply, acute management of patient complete.

### Development and validation of a clinical scale for rating the severity of blepharospasm [^114iEnzj]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Existing scales for rating the severity of blepharospasm (BSP) are limited by a number of potential drawbacks. We therefore developed and validated a novel scale for rating the severity of BSP. The development of the scale started with careful examination of the clinical spectrum of the condition by a panel of experts who selected phenomenological aspects thought to be relevant to disease severity. Thereafter, selected items were first checked for reliability, then reliable items were combined to generate the scale, and clinimetric properties of the scale were evaluated. Finally, the confidence with which the scale could be used by people without high levels of movement disorders skill was assessed. The new scale, based on objective criteria, yielded moderate to almost perfect reliability, acceptable internal consistency, satisfactory scaling assumptions, lack of floor and ceiling effects, partial correlations with a prior severity scale and with a quality of life scale, and good sensitivity to change. Despite a few limitations, the foregoing features make the novel scale more suitable than existing scales to assess the severity of BSP in natural history and pathophysiologic studies as well as in clinical trials.

### Physical examination in functional unresponsiveness [^1113as1X]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Functional unresponsiveness can present a diagnostic challenge, but there are many positive physical examination findings that may help to confirm this diagnosis. Some of these are associated with pain or potential tissue damage for the patient, and potentially ethical and legal risk for the practitioner, but several lesser-known physical examination techniques do not carry these risks. Such examination techniques include non-damaging irritative stimuli, a modification to the conventional hand drop test and evaluation of eyelid opening.

### Acupuncture and herbal formulation compared with artificial tears alone: evaluation of dry eye symptoms and associated tests in randomised clinical trial [^111v3taK]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who achieved any improvement in symptom (SPEED) score at week 4 compared with the baseline (symptom responder). This proportion was compared between the AC and AT groups, and between the HB and AT groups.

These secondary efficacy outcomes were assessed at week 4 and baseline visits and differences were computed: tear evaporation rates, non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT), Schirmer I, corneal fluorescein staining (five zones), tear osmolarity, tear cytokine levels and TCM score (lung–kidney yin-deficiency). The differences were then compared between AC vs AT and HB vs AT groups.

Proteins were eluted using our previous protocol. The Schirmer strips were longitudinally halved, and from the half strip, tear cytokines were evaluated using the multiplex bead-based indirect immunofluorescent assay (Milliplex; Merck-Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Cytokine concentrations were normalised to the length of wetting of the Schirmer strips+3 mm. The advantage of this technique was that 15 cytokines could be assayed using a minimum amount of tear.

Potential adverse events of HB consumption were monitored: nausea, insomnia, headache, loss of appetite, malaise, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Side effects after AC that were monitored include soreness, bruises, fatigue, lightheadedness and involuntary twitching of muscles. Intraocular pressures were measured using non-contact tonometry, and presenting visual acuity was measured with the LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) charts.

Study treatment

All participants used Systane ultra (Alcon) eye-drops four times a day. AC patients undergone twice weekly AC over eight sessions, and HB patients used 'qi ju gan lu yin' twice daily. (Details of treatments are provided in online esupplementary materials, etable 2 and supplementary efigure 2).

### Clinical reasoning: an unusual cause of diplopia and ptosis in a 67-year-old woman [^111VKPa5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diplopia is a relatively common chief complaint encountered in an outpatient neurology clinic and carries a broad differential diagnosis. In this case, a 67-year-old woman presented with new horizontal, binocular diplopia and ptosis of 8-month duration, which persisted without significant progression. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses for patients with acquired ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Key learning points include an illustration of the stepwise diagnostic approach to evaluate for common etiologies, the importance of interpreting test results in the appropriate clinical setting, and the significance of recognizing specific signs and symptoms in achieving the correct diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and classification of blepharospasm: recommendations based on empirical evidence [^114hPFYn]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Blepharospasm is one of the most common subtypes of dystonia, and often spreads to other body regions. Despite published guidelines, the approach to diagnosis and classification of affected body regions varies among clinicians.

Objective

To delineate the clinical features used by movement disorder specialists in the diagnosis and classification of blepharospasm according to body regions affected, and to develop recommendations for a more consistent approach.

Methods

Cross-sectional data for subjects diagnosed with all types of isolated dystonia were acquired from the Dystonia Coalition, an international, multicenter collaborative research network. Data were evaluated to determine how examinations recorded by movement disorder specialists were used to classify blepharospasm as focal, segmental, or multifocal.

Results

Among all 3222 participants with isolated dystonia, 210 (6.5%) had a diagnosis of focal blepharospasm. Among these 210 participants, 34 (16.2%) had dystonia outside of upper face region. Factors such as dystonia severity across different body regions and number of body regions affected influenced the classification of blepharospasm as focal, segmental, or multifocal.

Conclusions

Although focal blepharospasm is the second most common type of dystonia, a high percentage of individuals given this diagnosis had dystonia outside of the eye/upper face region. These findings are not consistent with existing guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of focal blepharospasm, and point to the need for more specific guidelines for more consistent application of existing recommendations for diagnosis and classification.

### Managing essential tremor [^112QbxCo]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of essential tremor covers two important aspects. The first is diagnostic with the main questions is for accuracy of diagnosis and not to overlook specifically treatable etiologies. A new tremor classification has laid new foundations for this. The second is to understand and interpret the needs of the patient. The spectrum of complaints varies considerably from patient to patient. Essential tremor (ET) is a lifelong lasting syndrome and young patients may have different demands than the elderly. Essential tremor is a progressive syndrome and patients early during the course of the disease may have different problems from those with advanced ET. Men and female can both have essential tremor but the complaints may differ for them. For all these aspects, it is important to know about the spectrum of manifestations of the condition but also about the ways to measure tremor severity and complaints. The selection of treatment is critically depending on the knowledge of these subjective complaints.

### Motor and non-motor symptoms in blepharospasm: clinical and pathophysiological implications [^113rFsyH]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with blepharospasm in addition to involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle also have non-motor symptoms (psychiatric, sleep, cognitive, and ocular). In this paper, we investigated the relationship of non-motor with motor symptoms and the total burden of non-motor symptoms in patients with blepharospasm. Results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

Methods

We enrolled 60 patients with blepharospasm and 40 age-matched healthy controls. In all patients, the severity of blepharospasm was assessed clinically with the Blepharospasm Severity Rating Scale. All the participants underwent a psychiatric, sleep, cognitive, and ocular symptom evaluation. We investigated the correlations between motor, non-motor symptoms, and patients' clinical and demographic features.

Results

The frequency of psychiatric, sleep, and cognitive disorders and ocular symptoms was higher in blepharospasm patients than in healthy controls. Non-motor symptoms coexisted in the majority of patients and there was no correlation between non-motor and motor symptoms. The total burden of non-motor symptoms did not associate with motor symptoms and demographic features in blepharospasm.

Conclusions

Non-motor symptoms are independent of motor features and likely belong to the clinical spectrum of blepharospasm. The presence of non-motor symptoms possibly reflects a complex network disorder of blepharospasm.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112T6ec3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### Clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of primary lateral sclerosis with overlapping features of progressive supranuclear palsy [^114em1wN]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of clinical characteristics of patients withduring their first neurological evaluation

Case 1: A 49‐year‐old right‐handed woman presented with symptoms that had begun 6 years earlier with progressive speech difficulty, characterized by dragging out certain vowels. Over the years, she developed impairment of motor skills, imbalance, gagging, choking episodes, occasional involuntary movements of her face, urinary incontinence, and mild behavioral and personality changes. On neurological examination, her gait was slightly abnormal, and she stepped slightly high. She exhibited a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and had a harsh speech. She had mildly brisk jaw reflex, and deep tendon reflexes were brisk throughout especially in the left lower extremity. She had mild rigidity in both the upper and lower extremities and exhibited moderate spasticity in the left lower extremity.
Case 2: A 65‐year‐old left‐handed man presented complaining of symptoms that had started 18 months earlier with difficulty with walking and arising from a seated position, imbalance, whole body stiffness, and personality and behavioral changes. Furthermore, he developed memory impairment, executive dysfunction, changes in handwriting, and choking episodes. On neurological examination, he exhibited a slightly wide‐based and unsteady gait, with characteristics of a spastic‐type gait. On the pull test, he took 8–10 steps backward. His vertical extraocular movements were slow, and saccadic eye movements were impaired. He exhibited some axial rigidity and mild spasticity in the right upper extremity. In the lower extremities, his reflexes were brisk, with a slight predominance on the right. Sustained clonus on the right side and some degree of clonus on the left side were observed.
Case 3: A 65‐year‐old left‐handed man presented for enrollment in a study on PSP. His symptoms had started 5 years earlier with frequent falls and imbalance. Furthermore, he developed calf muscle cramps and tightness, and his speech became affected. He reported left foot toe curling, slowness in the movements of the left upper and lower extremities associated with freezing, muscle twitching in the left arm, and festination. On neurological examination, he had spastic dysarthria and occasional spasmodic dysphonia. His extraocular movements were essentially normal, and he had mild facial hypomimia. During the motor examination, he exhibited a spastic tone throughout his body, more pronounced on the left side. He had a stiff gait and a spastic left leg that was held extended. He exhibited very brisk reflexes, including bilateral Hoffmann sign and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Pathologically brisk deep tendon reflexes throughout his body were observed. Rapid alternating movements were slow, and he displayed postural instability.
Case 4: A 54‐year‐old left‐handed man presented for enrollment in a study on PSP. His symptoms had started 3.5 years earlier with progressive changes in his speech, notably softer speech, and imbalance. He reported tremulous movements of the right leg and finger movements, where he would rub his thumb and index finger together, as well as changes in his handwriting. Furthermore, he began to experience falls, postural instability, and freezing episodes, and was unable to drive or work. He developed cognitive impairment, a tendency for excessive laughter, occasional apathy, and slowed thinking. On neurological examination, arising from a seated position was difficult, and he had a positive pull test. Gait was slow, arm swing was reduced on the right, and he had instability mainly at turns. A mild slowing of vertical saccades was observed, with the amplitude remaining normal. He exhibited slightly increased axial rigidity. His reflexes were slightly brisk, particularly in the lower extremities, with a Babinski sign on the left.
Case 5: A 62‐year‐old right‐handed man presented complaining of symptoms that had begun 2 years earlier, with progressive weakness in the right upper and lower extremities. Furthermore, he developed speech difficulties, limping, stiffness in the right leg, and falls. On neurological examination, he had difficulty with naming tasks. His extraocular movements were slow but relatively preserved. Muscle strength weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern in both upper and lower extremities was observed. He exhibited slowness in performing rapid alternating movements and had moderate bilateral spasticity. His reflexes were brisk in upper and lower extremities, particularly in the lower extremities, with sustained clonus in right and left lower extremities. He exhibited a wide‐based slightly ataxic gait. When walking with a walker, both legs appeared stiff and the right leg was slightly spastic. He was unable to arise from a seated position without pushing himself up. He had mild apraxia of speech, of the phonetic subtype.
Case 6: A 64‐year‐old right‐handed man presented complaining of symptoms that had begun 9 months earlier with speech difficulties and voice changes. He reported difficulty with movements of his left side, tightness and spasm, and postural instability leading to frequent falls and had urinary urgency with occasional incontinence. On neurological examination, apraxia of speech with mild hypophonia was observed. He had increased latency of saccadic eye movements that were both hypometric and hypokinetic. His upgaze was restricted and had vertical slowing. He exhibited spasticity in the upper and lower limbs on the left side, and brisk reflexes with pathological hyperreflexia were observed throughout, more pronounced on the left side. His gait was characterized by spasticity primarily in the left leg, with limited knee flexion and an absent heel strike. His left arm exhibited significantly reduced swing. Rapid alternating movements were slow on the left side.

### The diagnosis of dystonia [^114gp9xo]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Dystonia is a movement disorder with many presentations and diverse causes. A systematic approach to dystonia helps to ensure that patients with this disorder receive optimum care. This Review begins with a summary of the clinical features of dystonia, followed by a discussion of other disorders to be considered and excluded before assigning the diagnosis of dystonia. Next, we emphasise the importance of classifying dystonia along several dimensions, and we explain how doing so aids in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The more common forms of dystonia are discussed in detail. Finally, we describe how to apply the clinical information for selection of appropriate laboratory investigations.

### Is this dystonia? [^114gX6jm]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Torsion dystonia is characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements and abnormal postures. The diagnosis can be made difficult, delayed, and often misled by several factors: variability of dystonia presentation, uncertain recognition of the specific physical signs, lack of diagnostic tests, wide etiological spectrum, and coexistence of other movement disorders. Diagnostic tools are of limited assistance for the diagnosis of dystonia, which remains based on clinical diagnostic skills. We propose here, a new diagnostic algorithm to systematize the clinical diagnostic workout. A correct recognition of the physical signs that constitute the hallmark of most dystonia syndromes provides the grounds to perform a structured diagnostic sequence and share a consistent methodology. This clinical algorithm may be enhanced by adding diagnostic tools for dystonia, once their diagnostic value is assessed.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^113DuAGJ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

TED diagnosis — history: A detailed medical and ocular history should include specific questions about weight gain or loss, tachycardia, and unexplained fatigue potentially secondary to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Strabismus is likely to be associated with diplopia and, in some cases, a compensatory head posture (i.e., ocular torticollis, often a chin-up position in this population). Because the incidence of myasthenia is increased in patients with TED, assessment for the coexistence of myasthenia is suggested if indicated by findings on clinical examination.

### Oculogyric crises: a review of phenomenology, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment [^116wQ679]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Oculogyric crises are a rare movement disorder characterized by paroxysmal, conjugate, tonic, usually upwards, deviation of the eyes. Causes for oculogyric crises are limited and include complications of dopamine-receptor blocking medications and neurometabolic disorders affecting dopamine metabolism, suggesting that an underlying hypodopaminergic state is important to the pathogenesis. Mimickers of oculogyric crises exist, and we propose diagnostic criteria to distinguish true oculogyric crises. Recognition of oculogyric crises is important for the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of rare disorders, and an approach to investigations in oculogyric crises is proposed. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant eyelid movements and pupillary spasms: a case report [^116VRyQ1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The present case is similar to Tian et al.'s report in that both demonstrated a miotic pupil in the affected eye under room light, accompanied by alternating paralysis and spasm. In addition, as described by Tian et al. the patient's eyelid retracted slightly and exhibited a subtle "twittering" movement occurring simultaneously with pupillary constriction. However, Tian et al.'s case was associated with the degree of exotropia along with ptosis and pupillary response, whereas the present case is characterized by intermittent pupil miosis that was accompanied by spasm of the right upper eyelid and slight elevation coincident with pupil miosis. Furthermore, during the paretic phase, the pupil dilates but may not reach the full mydriatic size of the fellow eye, likely due to aberrant regenerative components frequently observed in congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with cyclic spasms.

Furthermore, Loewenfeld and Thompson emphasized that pupillary spasms are slower than normal pupillary movements and exhibit an abnormal movement pattern, which matches our patient's pupillary movement. In our patient, the right pupil demonstrated twitch-like, spasmodic movements even when already miotic, which is inconsistent with simple sustained miosis or normal pupillary light reactions. For this reason, the term 'pupillary spasm' seems more appropriate than 'miosis'.

Meanwhile, tadpole pupil, which is an episodic pupillary distortion, can be considered in the differential diagnosis, as it can occur unilaterally with variable and often long intervals between episodes. In contrast, our case's pupillary abnormalities were concurrent with exotropia and ptosis in the same eye. This indicates that they were associated with aberrant regeneration of oculomotor nerve palsy, which can serve as a distinguishing feature.

Each timeline provides the patient number, gender and age (black box), health events such as inciting trauma, evaluations, surgeries, etc. (green boxes), recommendations/orders offered in the W-TBI clinic (red boxes), month and year (vertical grey arrow)

Patient 2

Patient 2 is a 66-year-old woman who suffered two falls with secondary brief loss of consciousness in 2009 and 2014 and was diagnosed with concussion at those times. She presented to the W-TBI clinic in May 2016 after having trouble reading for many months in addition to episodes of double vision which subsided with naps since 1997. Review of systems was positive for constipation, dysautonomias (including trouble urinating and sexual dysfunction), muscle twitching and gait problems, stuttering, hyperthyroidism, chronic respiratory problems, poor memory, large changes in blood pressure, and PTSD. The patient demonstrated hypermobile joints (Beighton score 5/9) and confirmed that she was "double jointed". Her past medical history was significant for syncope and GERD. Patient 2 was found to have convergence insufficiency, deficiency of smooth pursuit movements, diplopia, eye pain, suspected postconcussion syndrome, and dysautonomia. An MRI of the brain and orbits was ordered and the patient was provided orthoptic exercises and asked to use a walking stick for balance with re-evaluation in three months. The MRI indicated mild anterolisthesis and possible impingement upon the spinal cord. Patient 2 returned in August 2016 and reported decreased eye pain and diplopia. Review of systems was unchanged except for a new complaint of back and hip pain. A referral to a geneticist was made to consider the possibility of a hypermobility disorder due to the patient's dysautonomia and hypermobility and the diagnosis of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type III, was confirmed in April 2017; notably, the Beighton score was 5/9. The patient returned to the W-TBI clinic in August 2017 and reported improved vision, although infrequent blurred vision and/or orbital discomfort still occurred. Review of systems was newly positive for GERD and possible gastroparesis, dysautonomia, pain hypersensitivity, fibromyalgia, and balance problems. The vision improvement with orthoptic therapy supported the diagnosis that the visual symptoms were secondary to concussion.

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus and non-convulsive seizures in neurological ICU patients [^115KJFQq]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Non-convulsive seizures (NCS) or non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) has been reported in 8–20% of critically ill patient populations, and delayed diagnosis and treatment of NCSE may lead to increased mortality. This study seeks to better understand the risk factors, characteristics, and outcome of NCS/NCSE in the neurological ICU.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study, recruiting consecutive patients admitted to the adult neurological ICU with altered mental status. Patients with anoxic brain injury were excluded from the study. Data were collected and analyzed for prevalence of NCSE/NCS, EEG patterns, associated risk factors, treatment response, and final outcome.

Results

NCSE/NCS was detected in 21% of 170 subjects. Clinical seizures preceded EEG diagnosis of NCSE/NCS in 25% of cases. Significant risk factors for NCSE/NCS were a past medical history of intracranial tumor, epilepsy, or meningitis/encephalitis, or MRI evidence of encephalomalacia. Subtle clinical findings such as twitching of oral or ocular muscles and eye deviations were found on exam in 50% of the NCSE/NCS group. Mortality was increased in NCSE cases as 31% of NCSE/NCS patients died compared to 14% in non-NCSE/NCS group.

Conclusions

Specific clinical features along with history and imaging findings may be used to identify patients at high risk of NCSE/NCS in the neurological ICU.

### Will tonic water stop my eyelid twitching? [^113cXV26]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Eyelid myokymia, also known as "eyelid twitching", refers to the involuntary, rhythmic, fascicular contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle, most often presenting unilaterally in the lower eyelid. Though rarely secondary to multiple sclerosis, cerebral tumors, or drug toxicity, eyelid myokymia is generally a benign condition that resolves without pharmacologic treatment.–The etiology of eyelid myokymia remains incompletely understood, but it has been associated with stress, anxiety, fatigue, and excess caffeine consumption – in other words, the components of a typical workday. Eyelid myokymia almost always subsides within a matter of hours to days with rest and stress removal; however, chronic cases can persist for several weeks to months and serve as a nuisance to patients. Risk factors for the development of chronic eyelid myokymia include female gender and cold weather. Chronic eyelid myokymia has been treated successfully with botulinum toxin in the United States of America. Several potential treatments for chronic eyelid myokymia have been proposed such as calcium, folic acid, phosphorus, potassium, and various vitamins; to date, no clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of these supplements in reducing the frequency or duration of eyelid twitching.

### Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? [^112SgANq]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians must be able to diagnose myasthenia gravis, since delays in establishing the diagnosis may put patients at risk for complications from this treatable disease.

Objective

To determine if items in the history and examination or results of simple tests change the likelihood of myasthenia gravis as a diagnosis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles (January 1966-January 2005) using the terms myasthenia gravis, diagnosis, and test, and a search of bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating a particular symptom or sign in patients both with and without myasthenia gravis. Of 640 articles retrieved, 33 were eligible for review. Of these, 15 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using previously published criteria.

Data Synthesis

A history of "speech becoming unintelligible during prolonged speaking" and the presence of the peek sign increase the likelihood of myasthenia gravis (likelihood ratio [LR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–17.0 and LR, 30.0; 95% CI, 3.2–278.0, respectively). Their absence does not significantly reduce the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. The identified studies only assessed 1 other historical feature and sign each ("food remaining in the mouth after swallowing" and quiver eye movements, respectively), and neither of these significantly changes the likelihood of myasthenia. The ice test is useful when the response is abnormal (summary positive LR, 24.0; 95% CI, 8.5–67.0) and diminishes the likelihood of myasthenia gravis when the response is normal (summary negative LR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09–0.27). A positive response to an anticholinesterase medication (mainly edrophonium test) increases the probability of a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (summary positive LR, 15.0; 95% CI, 7.5–31.0), and a negative response reduces the diagnostic probability of myasthenia (summary negative LR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.21). An abnormal sleep test result is useful in confirming the diagnosis (LR, 53.0; 95% CI, 3.4–832.0). The rest and sleep tests make the probability of myasthenia unlikely when results are normal (LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.95 and LR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00–0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

Items in the history and physical examination along with results of certain simple tests performed in the office (ice test, sleep test, and edrophonium test) are useful in predicting the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. These results must be interpreted with caution, however, given the high prevalence of disease in the populations reported in clinical studies. This review is limited by the small number of signs and symptoms scientifically studied and reported in the literature. Future studies evaluating the value of common historical features and easy maneuvers commonly known and practiced by experts in the clinical diagnosis of myasthenia are needed.

### The microstructure of REM sleep: why phasic and tonic? [^1154vDwW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a peculiar neural state that occupies 20–25% of nighttime sleep in healthy human adults and seems to play critical roles in a variety of functions spanning from basic physiological mechanisms to complex cognitive processes. REM sleep exhibits a plethora of transient neurophysiological features, such as eye movements, muscle twitches, and changes in autonomic activity, however, despite its heterogeneous nature, it is usually conceptualized as a homogeneous sleep state. We propose here that differentiating and exploring the fine microstructure of REM sleep, especially its phasic and tonic constituents would provide a novel framework to examine the mechanisms and putative functions of REM sleep. In this review, we show that phasic and tonic REM periods are remarkably different neural states with respect to environmental alertness, spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, information processing, and seem to contribute differently to the dysfunctions of REM sleep in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We highlight that a distinctive view on phasic and tonic REM microstates would facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms and functions of REM sleep in healthy and pathological conditions.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission as (a) auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); (b) autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents; (c) active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease; and (d) antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG. Siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate and severe manifestation. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles including the M. levator palpebrae and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to generalized muscle fatigability and weakness within 24 months after the disease onset. Generalized myasthenia is defined as any clinical affection of muscle groups other than outer ocular muscles independent of its severity.

The fluctuating muscle fatigability and weakness is illustrated by a typical decremental response of the amplitude and/or area under the curve of the elicited muscle compound action potential of the fifth compared to the first stimulus upon repetitive supramaximal stimulation of the accessory or facial nerve with a frequency of 3 Hz before and after isometric tetanic contraction. The lack of an incremental response of amplitudes and areas under the curve of the compound muscle action potential upon supramaximal repetitive nerve stimulation using a frequency of 30 Hz or upon pre- and post-tetanic single stimulation proofs the post-synaptic nature of the neuromuscular transmission defect. Single fiber electromyography typically shows increased jitter and intermittent conduction blocks reflecting instable neuromuscular transmission.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^1134pb9s]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — natural history and treatment rationale indicate that onset in adults is usually in the third to fourth decade of life but sometimes much later in males, and if generalized it may involve bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles with risk of life-threatening respiratory failure. Fifty percent of patients with myasthenia present with ocular symptoms only, and 50% to 80% of these patients develop generalized systemic myasthenia within a few years. Minimizing extraocular motility impairment, diplopia, and compensatory head position that can affect visual function, quality of life, and its socioeconomic consequences warrant treatment.

### Clinical reasoning: a 76-year-old man remaining comatose after cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^111TJ5ZD]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after having a "cardiac arrest" while riding his bicycle and subsequently falling into a canal. Thirty minutes after the accident, he was resuscitated by an ambulance crew. They detected a ventricular tachycardia, which responded to defibrillation. Thereafter, there was a sinus bradycardia, which was treated with atropine and adrenaline. After 30 minutes of resuscitation, there was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). At admission to our hospital, the patient was comatose, with a body temperature of 30°C and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of E1M1V1. According to protocol for presumed acute hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, he was started on therapeutic hypothermia. The body temperature of the patient was kept at 32°C to 34°C for 24 hours. A few hours after starting hypothermia, twitches around the eyes and mouth were noticed and a neurology consultation was requested. Neurologic examination during hypothermia and under sedation showed a deeply comatose patient with intact pupillary reaction to light bilaterally and present oculocephalic reflex. He had multifocal random twitching movements involving the face, arms, and legs. These shock-like movements were found to increase by external stimuli.

### Neuromuscular junction disorders: mimics and chameleons [^1114nYqw]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders represent a heterogenous group of acquired and congenital disorders that present in variable and distinctive ways. The diagnosis is typically reached through a combination of clinical, serological, pharmacological and electrophysiological evaluation. While the diagnosis can be fairly straightforward in some cases, the overlap with other neurological disorders can make diagnosis challenging, particularly in pure ocular presentations and in seronegative patients. The over-reliance on serological tests and electrophysiological evaluation in isolation can lead to misdiagnosis. In this article, we provide an overview of the NMJ disorders, discuss red flags for the key differential diagnoses (mimics) and report the atypical ways in which NMJ disorders may present (chameleons).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116z2eZE]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — diagnosis and examination emphasize that variable incomitant strabismus may be accompanied by variable ptosis, both of which worsen with fatigue, and patterns may change with fatigue or repetition; rest or an ice pack test may temporarily eliminate extraocular motility disturbances and ptosis. Ptosis worsens with fatigue (prolonged upgaze) and may have associated Cogan lid-twitch sign, ocular saccades are often slow, and pupils are typically not affected but may rarely show impaired or slow responses, with pupillary involvement prompting consideration of other etiologies such as 3rd nerve palsy. Application of an ice pack over the closed eyes for 2 minutes for ptosis and for 5 minutes for strabismus may demonstrate a reduction of ptosis of about 2mm and reduced misalignment; a rest test without an ice pack can also aid diagnosis. Tensilon (edrophonium) testing may be considered but is best performed by an experienced practitioner because associated muscarinic activity such as excess tearing, salivation, sweating, abdominal cramping, bradycardia, bronchospasm hypotension, and syncope can occur.

### Signs of essential blepharospasm… [^114QKuKz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Motion pictures of 15 patients with essential blepharospasm were studied. Previously unrecognized signs indicated multiple cranial nerve involvement. These signs include impersistence of gaze, lid retraction, tongue thrust, head tilts, head jerks, vertical gaze spasms, and asymmetry. The signs were also observed in a patient with bilateral blepharospasm who had a history of Bell's palsy suggesting facial nerve injury as a possible factor in blepharospasm. The presence of these signs can be explained by known neural pathways, but the site, or sites, of the lesion remains obscure. These signs may be important in assessing severity and in treatment evaluation. Coles WH. Signs of Essential Blepharospasm: A Motion-Picture Analysis. Arch Ophthalmol. 1977; 95: 1006–1009.

### Will tonic water stop my eyelid twitching? [^115AYkzP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

The potential use of quinine in the treatment of eyelid myokymia must be weighed against the known risk for toxicity. Various online resources swear by the anecdotal benefits of tonic water in providing relief of chronic eyelid twitching. However, the improvement of the symptoms may not be attributable to tonic water alone given the self-limiting nature of the condition. It is unlikely that clinical trials will be performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quinine in eyelid myokymia due to the benign nature of the disease. While the amount of quinine obtained through moderate intake of tonic water is not likely to affect patients with the aforementioned medical conditions, the frequency and total volume of tonic water intake is an important consideration in these cases. For most patients, physicians should feel comfortable recommending a short trial of one to two glasses of tonic water daily for a few days without concern for significant harm; nonetheless, obtaining a thorough medical history is essential to identify patients to whom the risk for serious adverse outcomes associated with larger doses of tonic water must be conveyed.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: a review for emergency clinicians [^116kTj6V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is divided into convulsive status epilepticus and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).

Objective

This review provides a focused evaluation of NCSE for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

NCSE is a form of status epilepticus presenting with prolonged seizure activity. This disease is underdiagnosed, as it presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms, most commonly change in mental status without overt convulsive motor activity. Causes include epilepsy, cerebral pathology or injury, any systemic insult such as infection, and drugs or toxins. Mortality is primarily related to the underlying condition. Patients most commonly present with altered mental status, but other signs and symptoms include abnormal ocular movements and automatisms such as lip smacking or subtle motor twitches in the face or extremities. The diagnosis is divided into electrographic and electroclinical, and although electroencephalogram (EEG) is recommended for definitive diagnosis, emergency clinicians should consider this disease in patients with prolonged postictal state after a seizure with no improvement in mental status, altered mental status with acute cerebral pathology (e.g., stroke, hypoxic brain injury), and unexplained altered mental status. Assessment includes laboratory evaluation and neuroimaging with EEG. Management includes treating life-threatening conditions, including compromise of the airway, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypo- or hyperthermia, followed by rapid cessation of the seizure activity with benzodiazepines and other antiseizure medications.

Conclusions

An understanding of the presentation and management of NCSE can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### Botulinum toxin type A therapy for blepharospasm [^111Nuhxc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by chronic intermittent or persistent involuntary eyelid closure due to spasmodic contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Other facial and neck muscles are also frequently involved. Most cases are idiopathic and blepharospasm is generally a life-long disorder. Its severity can range from repeated frequent blinking to persistent forceful closure of the eyelids with functional blindness. Botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is the current first line therapy.

Objectives

To determine whether botulinum toxin (BtA) is an effective and safe treatment for blepharospasm.

Search Strategy

We identified studies for inclusion in the review using the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, handsearches of the Movement Disorders Journal and abstracts of international congresses on movement disorders and botulinum toxin, communication with other researchers in the field, reference lists of papers found using above search strategies, and contact with authors and drug manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review if they evaluated the efficacy of BtA for the treatment of blepharospasm. They must have been randomised and placebo-controlled.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used a paper pro-forma to collect data from the included studies using double extraction by two independent reviewers. The two reviewers separately assessed each trial for internal validity and they settled differences between them by discussion. The outcome measures used included adverse events, improvement in symptomatic rating scales, subjective evaluation by patients and clinicians, and changes in quality of life assessments.

Main Results

We found few controlled trials. They were of short duration and enrolled small numbers of patients. Because of their poor internal validity, the characteristics of the populations studied, and the types of interventions and outcomes, none of the trials fitted our criteria for inclusion. However, all these trials found BtA to be superior to placebo as did large case-control and cohort studies, which reported that around 90% of patients benefited.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no high quality, randomised, controlled efficacy data to support the use of Bt for blepharospasm. Despite this, other studies suggest that BtA is highly effective and safe for treating blepharospasm and support its use. The effect size (90% of patients benefit) seen in open studies makes it very difficult and probably unethical to perform new placebo-controlled trials of efficacy of BtA for blepharospasm. Future trials should explore technical factors such as the optimum treatment intervals, different injection techniques, doses, Bt types and formulations. Other issues include service delivery, quality of life, long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.

### Oculomotor fatigability with decrements of saccade and smooth pursuit for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis [^113pdZcn]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Decrements in the saccadic range seem to provide greater discriminatory power than pursuit decrements, despite having similar best cutoff values in ROC curve analysis (Fig. 3). The respective sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values were 78.3%, 95.8%, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.841–0.979) with an optimal cutoff value of 6.401% for decrement in vertical saccadic ranges and 60.9%, 95.8%, and 0.797 (95% CI, 0.694–0.9) with an optimal cutoff value of 6.399% for vertical smooth pursuit. The stimulus for a saccade is the target position with respect to the fovea, whereas the stimulus for a smooth pursuit is the target velocity relative to the retina. In humans, the differential response of eye movements has been explained based on the composition of muscle fibers recruited among electrically designated fast- and slow-twitching types. Ocular muscles contain multiply innervated fibers that function similarly to slow fibers in addition to singly innervated fibers classified based on contraction speed and fatigue resistance. Correlative anatomical, molecular, and physiological studies of ocular muscles have revealed that all motoneurons and all ocular muscle fiber types participate in all eye-movement classes and support the heterogeneity of ocular muscle fiber types as a consequence of their recruitment at specific eye positions requiring a range of contractile and fatigability properties. Therefore, based on the physiologic characteristics of the ocular muscles, oculomotor fatigability may be observed similarly in saccadic and smooth-pursuit movements.

### Mal de debarquement syndrome: a systematic review [^116QWbwA]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria are not uniformly decided upon, however, there are some similarities among studies to which criteria are used to diagnose MdDS. All of the inclusion criteria used in previous studies, if any, are listed in Table 1.

The most prominent symptoms associated with MdDS are the subjective feeling of rocking, swaying and/or bobbing. Hain and colleagues reported rocking in 93% of the patients and swaying in 81%. Other symptoms include disorientation, postural instability, imbalance, fatigue, impaired cognition and kinesiophobia. In one study, the following symptoms were also associated with MdDS (in order of how frequently they appeared): ear symptoms (non-specified), tilting, nausea, headache, jumping vision, blurred vision, perioral tingling, spinning (vertigo), diplopia, vomiting, eye twitches, fuzzy-headed/woozy, pulling/numbness in foot or lower leg. It has to be noted here that these are symptoms that MdDS patients reported when filling in questionnaires from a survey in 27 patients. It does not necessarily mean that all these symptoms are associated directly with MdDS. In the same study, a high occurrence of otological symptoms (fullness, tinnitus, hyperacusis, otalgia and decreased hearing) was found, which is not in accordance with the findings in other studies.

In general, standard brain imaging (MRI) and oto-vestibular tests such as measured by electronystagmography, videonystagmography and audiograms are normal or non-specifically abnormal. A normal neurological and oto-vestibular exam is therefore often used as an inclusion criterion (Table 1. for an overview). A positional nystagmus has been reported in two articles; however, the authors did not attribute this directly to the MdDS.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^113GxZcy]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2002 version of "Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient".

Design

A Task Force comprising 17 members of the Society of Critical Medicine with particular expertise in the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents; a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert; and a medical writer met via teleconference and three face-to-face meetings and communicated via e-mail to examine the evidence and develop these practice guidelines. Annually, all members completed conflict of interest statements; no conflicts were identified. This activity was funded by the Society for Critical Care Medicine, and no industry support was provided.

Methods

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert on the Task Force created profiles for the evidence related to six of the 21 questions and assigned quality-of-evidence scores to these and the additional 15 questions for which insufficient evidence was available to create a profile. Task Force members reviewed this material and all available evidence and provided recommendations, suggestions, or good practice statements for these 21 questions.

Results

The Task Force developed a single strong recommendation: we recommend scheduled eye care that includes lubricating drops or gel and eyelid closure for patients receiving continuous infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. The Task Force developed 10 weak recommendations. 1) We suggest that a neuromuscular-blocking agent be administered by continuous intravenous infusion early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome for patients with a PaO2/FIO2 less than 150. 2) We suggest against the routine administration of an neuromuscular-blocking agents to mechanically ventilated patients with status asthmaticus. 3) We suggest a trial of a neuromuscular-blocking agents in life-threatening situations associated with profound hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, or hemodynamic compromise. 4) We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents may be used to manage overt shivering in therapeutic hypothermia. 5) We suggest that peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring may be a useful tool for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade but only if it is incorporated into a more inclusive assessment of the patient that includes clinical assessment. 6) We suggest against the use of peripheral nerve stimulation with train of four alone for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade in patients receiving continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 7) We suggest that patients receiving a continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agent receive a structured physiotherapy regimen. 8) We suggest that clinicians target a blood glucose level of less than 180mg/dL in patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. 9) We suggest that clinicians not use actual body weight and instead use a consistent weight (ideal body weight or adjusted body weight) when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agents doses for obese patients. 10) We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents be discontinued at the end of life or when life support is withdrawn. In situations in which evidence was lacking or insufficient and the study results were equivocal or optimal clinical practice varies, the Task Force made no recommendations for nine of the topics. 1) We make no recommendation as to whether neuromuscular blockade is beneficial or harmful when used in patients with acute brain injury and raised intracranial pressure. 2) We make no recommendation on the routine use of neuromuscular-blocking agents for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest. 3) We make no recommendation on the use of peripheral nerve stimulation to monitor degree of block in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 4) We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular blockade to improve the accuracy of intravascular-volume assessment in mechanically ventilated patients. 5) We make no recommendation concerning the use of electroencephalogram-derived parameters as a measure of sedation during continuous administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 6) We make no recommendation regarding nutritional requirements specific to patients receiving infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 7) We make no recommendation concerning the use of one measure of consistent weight over another when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agent doses in obese patients. 8) We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents in pregnant patients. 9) We make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. Finally, in situations in which evidence was lacking or insufficient but expert consensus was unanimous, the Task Force developed six good practice statements. 1) If peripheral nerve stimulation is used, optimal clinical practice suggests that it should be done in conjunction with assessment of other clinical findings (e.g., triggering of the ventilator and degree of shivering) to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 2) Optimal clinical practice suggests that a protocol should include guidance on neuromuscular-blocking agent administration in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 3) Optimal clinical practice suggests that analgesic and sedative drugs should be used prior to and during neuromuscular blockade, with the goal of achieving deep sedation. 4) Optimal clinical practice suggests that clinicians at the bedside implement measure to attenuate the risk of unintended extubation in patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. 5) Optimal clinical practice suggests that a reduced dose of an neuromuscular-blocking agent be used for patients with myasthenia gravis and that the dose should be based on peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring. 6) Optimal clinical practice suggests that neuromuscular-blocking agents be discontinued prior to the clinical determination of brain death.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^11776ExT]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis — clinical objectives and thymectomy: Clinical objectives are to "Recognize the disorder to initiate an appropriate workup and referral to other subspecialties, including neurology" and to "Ensure that proper medical and surgical treatment is provided, and initiate short-term and subsequent long-term management of associated ptosis and strabismus". Thymectomy is indicated, certainly in the presence of thymoma but also for specific age-based and immune-based characteristics for which it may substantially reduce clinical symptoms.

### Stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders; more than meets the eye [^114oeh5s]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders (SPSD) are a group of rare neuroimmunological disorders that often include painful spasms and rigidity. However, patients have highly heterogeneous signs and symptoms which may reflect different mechanistic disease processes. Understanding subsets of patients based on clinical phenotype may be important for prognosis and guiding treatment. The goal of this review is to provide updates on SPSD and its expanding clinical spectrum, prognostic markers, and treatment considerations. Further, we describe the current understanding in immunopathogenesis and highlight gaps in our knowledge appropriate for future research directions. Examples of revised diagnostic criteria for SPSD based on phenotype are also presented.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Zoloft) [^1129vztQ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of ZOLOFT-treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials. For men and all indications, the most common adverse reactions (> 2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most common adverse reaction (≥ 2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients

In 281 pediatric patients treated with ZOLOFT in placebo-controlled studies, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. Adverse reactions that do not appear in Table 3 (most common adverse reactions in adults) yet were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients and at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate include fever, hyperkinesia, urinary incontinence, aggression, epistaxis, purpura, arthralgia, decreased weight, muscle twitching, and anxiety.

Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of ZOLOFT

Other infrequent adverse reactions, not described elsewhere in the prescribing information, occurring at an incidence of < 2% in patients treated with ZOLOFT were:

Cardiac disorders - tachycardia

Ear and labyrinth disorders - tinnitus

Endocrine disorders - hypothyroidism

Eye disorders - mydriasis, blurred vision

Gastrointestinal disorders - hematochezia, melena, rectal hemorrhage

General disorders and administration site conditions - edema, gait disturbance, irritability, pyrexia

Hepatobiliary disorders - elevated liver enzymes

Immune system disorders - anaphylaxis

Metabolism and nutrition disorders - diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypoglycemia, increased appetite

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders - arthralgia, muscle spasms, tightness, or twitching

### Lofexidine [^112D8S1e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) total score on Days 1–7 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 7 days of treatment. The SOWS-Gossop, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, evaluates the following opioid withdrawal symptoms: feeling sick, stomach cramps, muscle spasms/twitching, feeling of coldness, heart pounding, muscular tension, aches and pains, yawning, runny eyes and insomnia/problems sleeping. For each opioid withdrawal symptom, patients are asked to rate their symptom severity using four response options (none, mild, moderate, and severe). The SOWS-Gossop total score ranges from 0 to 30 where a higher score indicates a greater withdrawal symptom severity. The SOWS-Gossop was administered at baseline and once daily 3.5 hours after the first morning dose on Days 1–7.

Of the randomized and treated patients, 28% of placebo patients, 41% of lofexidine tablet 2.16 mg, and 40% of lofexidine 2.88 mg patients completed 7 days of treatment. The difference in proportion in both lofexidine tablet groups was significant compared to placebo. See Figure 1. Patients in the placebo group were more likely to drop out of the study prematurely due to lack of efficacy than patients treated with lofexidine tablet.

### The diagnostic value of the neurological examination in coma of unknown etiology [^115RMqHH]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting

Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum is a tertiary care university hospital located in Berlin, Germany, caring for approximately 70,000 emergency patients per year.

Patients/study size

We previously reported on n = 1027 prospectively recruited adult emergency patients presenting with CUE between May 2013 and January 2017. By the time of the first neurological assessment, 173 of them had spontaneously regained consciousness. The remaining 854 unconscious patients were examined neurologically immediately after the assessment of vital parameters and rapid ABC management.

Data were collected by neurologists in the emergency department who consulted the patients immediately, following a predefined management procedure. Patients' final diagnoses were unknown at the time of examination and added to their datasets after completion of diagnostic procedures.

Examination protocol

Neurological examinations were performed according to a predefined protocol. Results were documented electronically in the hospital's patient information system. Neurologists determined the ability to communicate verbally or by eye, head or limb movements and quantified the level of consciousness by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) evaluation. We scored GCS values following a "rate-what-you-see"-principle (e.g. verbal score = 1 when intubated) to describe the level of consciousness in the real-life study cohort regardless of different etiologies. The examination protocol (Fig. 1, left) required examiners to assess the following items: intubation (yes/no), sedation (yes/no), meningism, pupil size, pupil reaction to light, position of gaze, vestibulo-ocular reflex, corneal reflex, gag reflex (in non-intubated patients only), movement of all limbs (incl. reaction to painful stimuli), muscle tone of all limbs, tendon reflexes of all limbs, pyramidal tract signs and the presence or absence of seizure activity. Clinical findings were documented as predefined categorized variables (Fig. 1, right) including optional customized additions.

### Botulinum toxin: evidence-based medicine criteria in blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm [^11494BNA]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Botulinum A toxin is recognized and approved for symptomatic treatment of hemifacial spasm and blepharospasm. The state of trials is good, although double-blind placebo-controlled studies have been carried out involving only a small number of cases. Open case control studies have been done with large patient collectives. In both indications, treatment with botulinum toxin reaches the highest EBM degree in a critical evaluation.

### Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant eyelid movements and pupillary spasms: a case report [^117GyxnT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a case of congenital oculomotor nerve palsy presenting with aberrant eyelid movements and an involuntary pupillary reaction.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old woman presented with mild anisocoria with no significant medical history. Her ocular history included a history of strabismus and levator muscle surgery. Examination revealed exotropia, hypotropia, and ocular motility impairment, consistent with right oculomotor nerve palsy. Pupillary examination revealed mild anisocoria with the right pupil being unreactive to dim light, followed by involuntary pupillary spasms unassociated with eye position. Twitch-like movements of the upper eyelid were also observed during the spasm phase. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial rectus. No intracranial lesions were found and blood tests excluded conditions such as thyroid eye disease. Based on these findings, congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant regeneration was diagnosed. The patient remained asymptomatic and was managed conservatively. Six months later, no complications due to pupillary spasms or restriction of ocular motility were observed.

Conclusions

This case highlights an unusual pupillary response in congenital oculomotor nerve palsy characterized by involuntary pupillary spasms accompanied by upper eyelid twitching, which has not been previously reported. The prognosis was likely favorable for asymptomatic patients without associated underlying causes.

### The eye examination in the evaluation of child abuse – 2023 [^116DmgGn]. AAO (2023). High credibility.

AHT screening in neurologically asymptomatic potential victims is addressed. In potential victims of abuse who are neurologically asymptomatic, a retinal examination is not an appropriate screening test for brain injury; rather, such children should undergo brain imaging (such as an MRI or CT) as the appropriate screen if indicated, and if the neuroimaging result is normal, yet concern still exists about possible AHT, then eye examination may still be considered.

### Excessive blinking in childhood: a prospective evaluation of 99 children [^116hrGrV]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the characteristics and causes of excess blinking in children and to determine outcomes after treatment.

Design

Prospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series.

Participants

Ninety-nine consecutive children who presented for evaluation of excessive blinking over a 2 year period.

Methods

Children less than 16 years of age who had excessive blinking as their sole or major chief complaint underwent detailed history and ophthalmologic examination. Treatment was recommended based on clinical examination findings. Follow-up evaluations were performed at least 2 months after initial examination.

Main Outcome Measures

Etiology of excess blinking and patient characteristics in each diagnostic group.

Results

The majority (89%) of children presented with bilateral excessive blinking. Boys outnumbered girls at a ratio of almost 2:1. The most common etiologies were anterior segment and/or lid abnormalities (37%), habit tics (23%), uncorrected refractive errors (14%), intermittent exotropia (11%), and psycogenic blepharospasm (10%). A history of neurologic disease was present in 22% of the patients but was not causally related to the excessive blinking in most cases. Vision-threatening disease was noted in 6% and was easily detected on standard clinical examination. Life-threatening disease was the cause in 4% of the children, but the presence of life-threatening disease was already known in all such patients.

Conclusions

Excessive blinking in children can occur because of a large number of potential problems. Most cases are caused by benign and/or self-limiting conditions. The cause can usually be determined after careful history and clinical examination and routine neurologic evaluation and neuroimaging is unnecessary.

### Blepharospasm 40 years later [^114tXW29]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Forty years ago, C.D. Marsden proposed that blepharospasm should be considered a form of adult-onset focal dystonia. In the present paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the findings regarding blepharospasm reported in the past 40 years. Although prolonged spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscles remain the clinical hallmark of blepharospasm, patients with blepharospasm may be characterized by various types of involuntary activation of periocular muscles. In addition to motor features, blepharospasm patients may also have nonmotor manifestations, including psychiatric, mild cognitive, and sensory disturbances. The various motor and nonmotor symptoms are not present in all patients, suggesting that blepharospasm is phenomenologically a heterogeneous condition. This emphasizes the need for tools for severity assessment that take into account both motor and nonmotor manifestations. The cause of blepharospasm remains elusive, but several lines of evidence indicate that blepharospasm is a multifactorial condition in which one, or several, as yet unknown genes together with epigenetic and environmental factors combine to reach the threshold of the disease. Although blepharospasm was originally believed to be solely a basal ganglia disorder, neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence point to anatomical and functional involvement of several brain regions. The contribution of multiple areas has led to the hypothesis that blepharospasm should be considered as a network disorder, and this might reflect the varying occurrence of motor and nonmotor manifestations in blepharospasm patients. Despite advances in the aetiology and pathophysiology, treatment remains symptomatic. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Infantile spasms of unknown cause: who can have a good outcome? [^112k3Agw]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

To return to our original questions, we have evidence supporting preferred evaluation with MRI and genetic testing. We have evidence to treat with vigabatrin, ACTH, or corticosteroids, using vigabatrin preferentially in patients with TSC and ACTH in patients with unknown etiology. Can we predict who will do better?

Thus far, children with IS of unknown cause are thought to have better outcomes. However, as testing improves, the concept of "unknown etiology" appears to be a moving target. Even within this large multicenter EPGP cohort, additional evaluation provided an etiology in nearly 15%. Can children have IS without etiology? Is the lack of identifiable cause a marker for less severe disease? In those without an obvious cause at the time of IS diagnosis in the NISC cohort, an etiology was more likely to be identified if there was severe developmental delay. An etiology was identified in 32.5% of patients with clearly abnormal development versus 8.3% with normal development. The EPGP study also supports this. Overall, 67% had seizures after IS, consistent with previous studies. Predictors of subsequent seizures were consistent with markers for more severe disease: earlier age of IS onset, seizures prior to IS onset, and IS refractory to initial treatment.

### Smartphone video-based early diagnosis of blepharospasm using dual cross-attention modeling enhanced by facial pose estimation [^1156j3Ui]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharospasm (BSP), the most common subtype of dystonia affecting up to 732 per 100,000 individuals, is characterized by involuntary, repetitive blinking and eyelid closure caused by abnormal contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscles. The condition significantly impairs visual function and diminishes the quality of life of the patients. Patients often experience functional blindness, social embarrassment, and emotional distress, contributing to an overall reduction in life satisfaction and mental health. BSP can be highly complex spatiotemporally heterogeneous, such as facial muscle fibrillation, brief or prolonged spasms and a narrowing or closure of the eyelids occurring on variable time scales and exacerbated or alleviated by certain movements. These manifestations are easily overlooked, and the narrowing or closure of the eyelids is often misdiagnosed as dry eye, ptosis, or myasthenia gravis (MG), which can lead to unnecessary treatments and exacerbation of symptoms. Considering that botulinum toxin may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with MG, it is imperative to optimize the management of MG before administering botulinum toxin to those with concurrent MG and BSP. Despite its profound impact, diagnosis remains challenging, predominantly due to its episodic nature. Symptoms may not manifest during clinical evaluations, complicating timely and accurate diagnosis. Observable symptoms, electromyography (EMG) and physical examination are often used for the diagnosis of BSP. However, the transient and unpredictable occurrence of symptoms often leads to negative EMG results and misdiagnosis.

### Development and validation of a clinical guideline for diagnosing blepharospasm [^111X8w6V]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To design and validate a clinical diagnostic guideline for aiding physicians in confirming or refuting suspected blepharospasm.

Methods

The guideline was developed and validated in a 3-step procedure: 1) identification of clinical items related to the phenomenology of blepharospasm, 2) assessment of the relevance of each item to the diagnosis of blepharospasm, and 3) evaluation of the reliability and diagnostic sensitivity/specificity of the selected clinical items.

Results

Of 19 clinical items initially identified, 7 were admitted by content validity analysis to further assessment. Both neurologists and ophthalmologists achieved satisfactory interobserver agreement for all 7 items, including "involuntary eyelid narrowing/closure due to orbicularis oculi spasms", "bilateral spasms", "synchronous spasms", "stereotyped spasm pattern", "sensory trick", "inability to voluntarily suppress the spasms", and "blink count at rest". Each selected item yielded unsatisfactory accuracy in discriminating patients with blepharospasm from healthy subjects and patients with other eyelid disturbances. Combining the selected items, however, improved diagnostic sensitivity/specificity. The best combination, yielding 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity, was an algorithm starting with the item "stereotyped, bilateral, and synchronous orbicularis oculi spasms inducing eyelid narrowing/closure" and followed by recognition of "sensory trick" or, alternatively, "increased blinking".

Conclusion

This study provides an accurate and valid clinical guideline for diagnosing blepharospasm. Use of this guideline would make it easier for providers to recognize dystonia in clinical and research settings.

### Computer vision detects covert voluntary facial movements in unresponsive brain injury patients [^1158sekf]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Many brain injury patients who appear unresponsive retain subtle, purposeful motor behaviors, signaling capacity for recovery. We hypothesized that low-amplitude movements precede larger-amplitude voluntary movements detectable by clinicians after acute brain injury. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel, as far as we are aware, computer vision-based tool (SeeMe) that detects and quantifies low-amplitude facial movements in response to auditory commands.

Methods

We enrolled 16 healthy volunteers and 37 comatose acute brain injury patients (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) aged 18–85 with no prior neurological diagnoses. We measured facial movements to command assessed using SeeMe and compared them to clinicians' exams. The primary outcome was the detection of facial movement in response to auditory commands. To assess comprehension, we tested whether movements were specific to command type (i.e., eye-opening to open your eyes and not stick out your tongue) with a machine learning-based classifier.

Results

Here we show that SeeMe detects eye-opening in comatose patients 4.1 days earlier than clinicians. SeeMe also detects eye-opening in more comatose patients (30/36, 85.7%) than clinical examination (25/36, 71.4%). In patients without an obscuring endotracheal tube, SeeMe detects mouth movements in 16/17 (94.1%) patients. The amplitude and number of SeeMe-detected responses correlate with clinical outcome at discharge. Using our classifier, eye-opening is specific (81%) to the command open your eyes.

Conclusion

Acute brain injury patients have low-amplitude movements before overt movements. Thus, many covertly conscious patients may have motor behavior currently undetected by clinicians.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation preferred practice pattern ® [^1174yTHD]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation — category II: patients with risk factors — defines increased risk when the evaluation reveals signs that are suggestive of a potentially abnormal condition or when risk factors for developing ocular disease are identified but the patient does not yet require intervention. These situations may merit closer follow-up to monitor the patient's ocular health and to detect early signs of disease with additional testing. The ophthalmologist determines an appropriate follow-up interval for each patient based on the presence of early symptoms and signs, risk factors, the onset of ocular disease, and the potential rate of progression of a given disease.

### A review of acquired blepharoptosis: prevalence, diagnosis, and current treatment options [^112xJJZP]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Acquired ptosis identification and differential diagnosis

Accurately identifying ptosis, as well as its underlying aetiology and severity, is essential to successful management. Thorough clinical examination and differential diagnosis is also needed in order to rule out similar conditions or most importantly, diagnose any serious underlying cause requiring more immediate medical intervention (Table 3).

Table 3
Diagnostic testing approaches for acquired ptosis.

CPEO chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, MRD-1 marginal reflex distance 1.

The initial diagnostic step is a review of patient history to understand timing of ptosis onset, as a sudden appearance may signal serious underlying pathology. If patient history suggests that ptosis may be secondary to a more serious condition, subsequent evaluation can be conducted based on the observable clinical signs. The serious neurological or muscular conditions most commonly encountered in clinical practice include Horner's syndrome, 3 rd cranial (oculomotor) nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis, and CPEO. In a study of patients referred for ptosis surgery, 5.6% of cases had a neurogenic cause, and among these cases, the majority were due to serious underlying aetiologies (35.7% palsy of the 3 rd cranial nerve, 28.6% myasthenia gravis, 14.3% aberrant regeneration, 7.1% Horner's syndrome). While myogenic causes (which broadly include conditions such as OPMD, CPEO, and myotonic dystrophy) were likewise uncommon in the study population (4.0% overall), 30% of the patients in this group had an underlying diagnosis of CPEO.

Myasthenia gravis — definition and ocular involvement: The term myasthenia gravis refers to a group of B-cell mediated autoimmune disorders that profoundly affect activity at the neuromuscular junction causing variable weakness exacerbated by fatigue. Ocular myasthenia gravis affects only the levator, orbicularis oculi, and the extraocular muscles, and it can mimic many types of incomitant strabismus with or without ptosis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies have been demonstrated in nearly all patients with generalized myasthenia and in 40% to 77% of patients with ocular myasthenia.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^1119eTGX]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common autoimmune disease affecting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) clinically characterised by fatigable weakness of the ocular, limb and bulbar (speech, swallowing and respiratory) muscles. The incidence of MG varies between 1.7 to 21.3 per million person-years. The estimated United Kingdom (UK) prevalence of MG is 15 per 100,000 population. There is significant social, economic and emotional burden for patients with MG, which can often be more troublesome than the disabling symptoms and hospitalisations.

Most patients with MG present with ocular symptoms (mainly ptosis and ophthalmoplegia) and in ~20% of patients the disease remain localised to the eye muscles (ocular MG). In the remaining patients the disease can cause generalised symptoms which can range from being mild fatigue to those needing ventilatory support for respiratory crisis. The most commonly described antibodies are against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).

Continuing advances have rendered the neural control of eye movements one of the best understood motor systems, from molecules to complex behaviors. Nevertheless, new discoveries have required re-evaluation of established concepts, from the genetics of disorders that affect extraocular muscles to the way in which the cerebral cortex governs behaviors that encompass several functional classes of eye movements.

### Evaluation of intraocular pressure after water drinking test in patients with unilateral hemifacial spasm [^116GYiZS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a movement disorder of the muscles innervated by the facial nerve, characterized by progressive clonic or tonic movements. It is typically unilateral and begins with involuntary spasms of the orbicularis oculi, extending gradually to other facial muscles, with symptoms persisting during sleep. In most cases, an ectatic or aberrant blood vessel, usually an artery, compressing the facial nerve at the root exit zone, is the cause of the disease. Rarer causes include space-occupying lesions in the cerebellopontine angle or within the brainstem, demyelinating disease and brainstem infarction. In contrast, benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a facial dystonia that affects the orbicularis oculi but not the other muscles supplied by the facial nerve, and typically progresses to bilateral involvement.

The main morbidities associated with HFS are psychosocial stress and impaired vision during episodes of eyelid spasms. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is an effective and minimally invasive treatment option for HFS but has the disadvantage that multiple injections are required at 3–4 monthly intervals and there are dampening effects after many years of treatment in some patients. Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve is a definitive treatment modality but only in patients with vascular compression of the facial nerve at the root exit zone. Little is known about the long-term sequelae of untreated HFS. Some patients may develop low-grade paralysis of the facial nerve after many years.

Spasms of the orbicularis oculi have been hypothesized to cause glaucomatous optic nerve head damage. Many reports have described increases of 5–10mmHg in intraocular pressure (IOP) with blinking and up to 50–100mmHg with forced eyelid closure.–Furthermore, high IOP fluctuations have been implicated in glaucoma progression, most notably in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study. There are few reports in the literature that examine the risk of glaucoma in persons with HFS or BEB.–Killer et al reported a case of HFS associated with unilateral glaucoma. Erdogan et al compared 24 consecutive patients with HFS and 25 age- and gender-matched randomly selected subjects and found no statistically significant difference in IOP measurements between the 2 groups, as well as between the involved eye-side and uninvolved eye-side of HFS patients.

Abstract

Eyelid myokymia, commonly referred to as "eyelid twitching", is a common, benign condition that resolves in most individuals within hours to days; however, chronic cases can persist for several weeks to months, prompting the search for home remedies that may reduce the frequency or duration of symptoms. In this article, we discuss the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism and safety concerns surrounding tonic water as a treatment for eyelid myokymia.

Strength of clinical recommendation levels — A Strong Recommendation is used when the benefits clearly exceed the harms (or the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B), and this recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A Recommendation applies when the benefits exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C), and this recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information. An Option applies when the benefits exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is low (Grade D) or well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage of one approach versus another, and there should be an awareness of this recommendation, but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information.

### Clinical-radiologic correlation of extraocular eye movement disorders: seeing beneath the surface [^115YnfZz]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Extraocular eye movement disorders are relatively common and may be a significant source of discomfort and morbidity for patients. The presence of restricted eye movement can be detected clinically with quick, easily performed, noninvasive maneuvers that assess medial, lateral, upward, and downward gaze. However, detecting the presence of ocular dysmotility may not be sufficient to pinpoint the exact cause of eye restriction. Imaging plays an important role in excluding, in some cases, and detecting, in others, a specific cause responsible for the clinical presentation. However, the radiologist should be aware that the imaging findings in many of these conditions when taken in isolation from the clinical history and symptoms are often nonspecific. Normal eye movements are directly controlled by the ocular motor cranial nerves (CN III, IV, and VI) in coordination with indirect input or sensory stimuli derived from other cranial nerves. Specific causes of ocular dysmotility can be localized to the cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem, the cranial nerve pathways in the peripheral nervous system, and the extraocular muscles in the orbit, with disease at any of these sites manifesting clinically as an eye movement disorder. A thorough understanding of central nervous system anatomy, cranial nerve pathways, and orbital anatomy, as well as familiarity with patterns of eye movement restriction, are necessary for accurate detection of radiologic abnormalities that support a diagnostic source of the suspected extraocular movement disorder. © RSNA, 2016.

### Lofexidine hydrochloride [^114ofJ7T]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) total score on Days 1 to 7 of treatment and the proportion of patients who completed 7 days of treatment. The SOWS-Gossop, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, evaluates the following opioid withdrawal symptoms: feeling sick, stomach cramps, muscle spasms/twitching, feeling of coldness, heart pounding, muscular tension, aches and pains, yawning, runny eyes and insomnia/problems sleeping. For each opioid withdrawal symptom, patients are asked to rate their symptom severity using four response options (none, mild, moderate, and severe). The SOWS-Gossop total score ranges from 0 to 30, where a higher score indicates greater withdrawal symptom severity. The SOWS-Gossop was administered at baseline and once daily 3.5 hours after the first morning dose on Days 1 to 7.

Of the randomized and treated patients, 28% of placebo patients, 41% of lofexidine 2.16 mg and 40% of lofexidine 2.88 mg patients completed 7 days of treatment. The difference in proportion in both lofexidine groups was significant compared to placebo. See Figure 1. Patients in the placebo group were more likely to drop out of the study prematurely due to lack of efficacy than patients treated with lofexidine.

Similar in BSP is the lack of universal diagnostic criteria. Based on their earlier work on BSP, Defazio et al. have identified four clinical items: stereotyped, bilateral, and synchronous orbicularis oculi spasms, presence of a sensory trick, increased blinking frequency, and inability to suppress the spasms. Accuracy of these diagnostic items in a large population has been validated, and their use in practice is endorsed in multiethnic, multicenter cohorts. The development and use of universal clinical guidelines is important as it improves consistency and accuracy of diagnosis.

### Uncovering consciousness in unresponsive ICU patients: technical, medical and ethical considerations [^1119GmC7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Technical considerations

How can we probe consciousness in unresponsive patients?

Clinical exam

Intensivists are used to probing the consciousness of brain injured patients during rounds using standard neurological examination techniques. The general principle of the clinical approach for assessment of consciousness is to probe behavior that is non-reflexive and can be considered as intentional. The most common items assessed are reactivity to sound and touch and, if necessary, responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli: is the patient able to open his/her eyes, is he/she attentive or eventually tracking? Clinicians also use simple verbal commands such as "stick out your tongue" and "show me two fingers". These commands are often combined with a visual cue of the expected response also known as 'mimicking'. This is employed for patients to minimize the impact of acoustic (i.e. deafness) or speech perception problems (i.e. aphasia). This clinical assessment requires good neurological examination skills to minimize the risk of misinterpretation (e.g. motor responses as part of reflexive responses to pain are thought to be intentional). However, even when performed by experienced clinicians, non-standardized neurological examinations have a high error rate (estimated to be as high as 40% in the chronic setting).

### Value and mechanisms of EEG reactivity in the prognosis of patients with impaired consciousness: a systematic review [^111eDmaM]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a clinical neurophysiology tool used to evaluate cerebral cortex activity that possesses demonstrated efficacy for the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of brain disorders in critically ill patients. Guidelines of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology and the American Society of Clinical Neurophysiology provide standardized methods for EEG recording and analysis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. EEG analysis relies mainly on the analysis of basic parameters such as the dominant frequency of background activity and its continuity, reactivity to stimuli, and the symmetry and occurrence of paroxysmal activities. Many abnormal EEG patterns predict a poor outcome in critically ill patients. Several EEG scores have been described. Several studies point out that electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG-R) or the absence thereof was particularly useful for prognostication in patients with impaired consciousness. Although there is no consensus regarding the definition or the methods to use in assessing EEG-R, EEG-R could be defined as diffuse and transient changes in scalp recorded EEG activity in response to sensorial external stimuli. Such stimuli may be auditory (clapping and loudly calling the patient's name), nociceptive (pinching of limbs or nipples, compression of the fingernails or of the periosteal surfaces of bones), or visual (spontaneous or forced eye opening, intermittent photic stimulation). The amplitude and/or frequency of EEG activity may change in response to external stimulation (Fig. 1). However, EEGs merely exhibiting stimuli-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges or muscle activity or eye blink artifacts are not considered as reactive by many authors. Because visual analysis of reactivity is prone to subjectivity, automated quantitative approaches have been proposed. EEG-R to nociceptive, auditory, and/or photic stimulation requires the functional integrity of peripheral sensory pathways, the brainstem, subcortical structures, and the cerebral cortex. Absent EEG-R could therefore result from a severe dysfunction of any of these structures, precluding the cortical activation by the afferent somatosensory stimuli. The importance of EEG-R in predicting patient outcome in postanoxic coma has been documented in many studies since the 1960s. Lack of EEG-R has been shown to be of prognostic value in postanoxic, posttraumatic, or hepatic encephalopathies. The present review highlights and discusses the mechanisms and particular usefulness of EEG-R for determining the prognosis of patients with impaired consciousness.

### Paroxysmal eye-head movements in glut1 deficiency syndrome [^115Qp8gb]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Description of 3 representative cases.

Patient 1.

A 10-year-old boy developed episodes of unusual eye movements, associated with nodding head movements that appeared to follow the direction of the eyes, at age 1 month (video 1 at). During the episodes, he was awake and at times responded by smiling, and at other times appeared upset. Episodes seemed to be precipitated by excitement and typically lasted 10–20 minutes. Rarely, episodes lasted up to 1 hour. A peak frequency of 10–15 episodes per month occurred at age 4–5 months. Episode frequency decreased towards the end of infancy and ceased by age 8 years.

The patient developed intractable epilepsy at age 3 months. His first seizures were myoclonic and atonic. At age 2 years, he developed absence seizures, and at age 3 years, generalized tonic seizures. He experienced other paroxysmal events including episodic choreoathetosis, limb dystonia associated with crying and drooling, and episodes of lethargy and generalized paralysis.

The patient was started on a KD at age 7 years. His seizures, paroxysmal neurologic events, motor and language skills, attention span, and mood all improved.

Brain MRI was normal and investigations for occult neuroblastoma were negative. Glut1 DS was diagnosed at age 10 years (table 1, patient 1). Examination at age 10 years revealed a head circumference at the 25th percentile, lower limb spasticity, and cerebellar dysfunction with dysarthria, limb dysmetria, and a mixed spastic-ataxic gait.

### The wrong end of the telescope: neuromuscular mimics of movement disorders (and vice versa) [^112zmshP]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The rapid advances in modern neurology have led to increased specialisation in clinical practice. Being an expert in a neurology subspecialty offers advantages for diagnosing and managing specific disorders. However, specialisation also risks tunnel vision: interpreting symptoms and signs within one's own framework of reference, while ignoring differential diagnostic options from other subspecialties. This is particularly relevant when the patient's presentation potentially belongs to different neurological subspecialties. We illustrate this challenge by highlighting a series of clinical features that partially overlap between two common subspecialties: movement disorders and neuromuscular disorders. An overlap in clinical presentation is not rare, and includes, for example, involuntary eyelid closure (which could be active eye closure due to blepharospasm, or ptosis due to weakness). Other overlapping features include abnormal postures, involuntary movements and gait changes. We describe two of these overlapping features in more detail and emphasise the possible consequences of 'looking through the wrong end of the telescope' in such patients, as this may lead to a wrong differential diagnosis, unnecessary investigations and a delayed treatment start.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^116sweur]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — definition, phenotypes, and manifestations are described as seizure activity seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) without clinical findings associated with GCSE; two distinct phenotypes include the "wandering confused" patient presenting to the emergency department with a relatively good prognosis or chronic epileptic syndromes, and the acutely ill patient with severely impaired mental status with or without subtle motor movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation in the setting of acute brain injury; for these guidelines the focus is on the acutely ill patient with impaired mental status, a type that frequently follows uncontrolled GCSE and is often encountered in the intensive care setting; the semiological spectrum is highly variable with negative symptoms including an increase in confusion, aphasia, lethargy, and staring, and positive symptoms including agitation/aggression, automatisms, blinking, crying, delirium, delusions, echolalia, facial twitching, laughter, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus/eye deviation, perseveration, psychosis, and tremulousness.

### Transient loss of consciousness through the eyes of a witness [^114XNych]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of eyewitness observations of transient loss of consciousness.

Methods

Two sequential cohorts of psychology students unexpectedly viewed videos of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (n = 125) and of reflex syncope (n = 104) during a lecture on an unrelated subject. Directly afterward, the students filled in a multiple-choice questionnaire regarding muscle tone, twitches, head deviation, eye closure, gaze deviation, drooling, and facial color. The consensus of experienced neurologists served as a gold standard. Even though not all items could be ascertained from the videos, the full range of questions was included to simulate clinical practice.

Results

Of all responses to the observable items on the syncope video (flaccid limbs, twitches of one shoulder, head deviation), 44% were correct, 28% erroneous, and 29% had "I do not know" responses. The observable items on the epilepsy video (stiff limbs, twitches of all limbs, normal facial color, drooling, no head deviation) yielded 60% correct responses, 18% erroneous responses, and 22% "I do not know" responses. Regarding features that were not visible on the videos, 77% of the responses were accurate ("I do not know"), whereas 23% erroneously provided an observation. Of all items observable on both videos, muscle tone was the most accurately recalled item.

Conclusions

An eyewitness account of a single episode of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) should be interpreted with caution because salient features are frequently overlooked or inaccurately recalled. However, the accuracy of the eyewitness observations of TLOC differs per item; muscle tone was reported with high accuracy.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^111giW8U]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Phenotype

Step 1. Is it a movement disorder?

The first step is to distinguish normal, physiological developmental motor patterns and pathological movement disorders. Infantile fidgety movements and startles resembling chorea and myoclonus normally disappear around the age of 3 months. 4 Dystonic‐like features may appear from birth and can persist until the age of 16 years. 4 The development of goal‐directed movements (3–6mo) coincides with the occurrence of ataxic‐like features which can persist until the age of 12 years. 4 It may be difficult to distinguish physiological developmental motor patterns from pathological movement disorders. Children should be monitored to evaluate how the movement pattern develops. In general, physiological patterns will subside with typical psychomotor development. Besides developmental features, other neurological diseases (such as epilepsy) may resemble movement disorders.

Step 2. Classify the movement disorder phenotype and which movement disorder is the most prominent

The second step is to classify the movement disorder phenotype and denote which movement disorder is the most prominent. Clinical clues can be used to distinguish between different movement disorder phenotypes. Movement disorders are classified into three major groups: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders and ataxia. In children, hyperkinetic movement disorders are more prevalent and include tics, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are rare in children. Ataxia is not a hypo‐ or hyperkinetic movement disorder, but includes disorganized and poorly executed movements, and is relatively common in children. 5

Hyperkinetic movement disorders

Tics

Tics are defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, non‐rhythmic movements or vocalizations (Video S1, online supporting information; descriptions of the videos are found in Appendix S1, online supporting information). 6 A distinction is made between motor and phonic tics and each is subdivided as simple or complex. Simple motor tics comprise a single muscle or localized muscle group, such as eye blinking. Complex motor tics involve either a cluster of simple actions or a coordinated sequence of movements. Simple phonic tics include sounds and noises such as humming or sniffing, whereas complex phonic tics comprise the repetition of words, syllables, or phrases. Positive clues are a waxing and waning course, worsening by stress or excitement, the report of a premonitory sensation, and brief voluntary suppressibility followed by a rebound. 1, 7

### Clinical reasoning: a 43-year-old man with subacute onset of vision disturbances, jaw spasms, and balance and sleep difficulties [^113ogyrp]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1

A 43-year-old man, with previous left testicular torsion, presented with 2 weeks of imbalance, gait incoordination, double and blurred vision, vertigo, and right lower extremity weakness. He denied confusion, disorientation, or associated memory issues. Observed eye movement abnormalities and ataxia on initial evaluation, and elevated white cell count and protein in the CSF, led to a Miller Fisher syndrome diagnosis. He was treated with IVIg, accompanied by improvement in vertigo. Eight weeks later, diplopia and oscillopsia occurred, and he had jaw opening difficulties and clenching episodes (trismus) and hypersialorrhea. He required pureed diet and subsequently gastrostomy tube for nutrition. He developed severe daytime hypersomnolence and sleep-related complex motor behaviors, with violent, thrashing limb movements and screaming and shouting vocalizations. He was briefly hospitalized after a possible isolated seizure, though never confirmed (EEG did not reveal epileptiform discharges). Sixteen weeks into his illness, he developed choking episodes, nocturnal stridor, and hypoxia. He was hospitalized again. He developed acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation.

On examination, he had horizontal plane ophthalmoplegia (not overcome with vestibular ocular reflex), esotropia, jerk see-saw vertical nystagmus (Video 1), and superimposed opsoclonic bursts (Video 2). He experienced mixed flaccid hyperkinetic dysarthria and jaw-closing dystonia (Video 2). He experienced oral phase and pharyngeal dysphagia. He was wheelchair bound, only taking steps with a walker and maximum assistance. He had moderate upper extremity dysmetria (minimal in the lower extremities) and normal limb tone and strength. Jaw jerk and deep tendon reflexes were brisk, and sensory examination was normal. Hoffman and Babinski signs were negative. A left inguinal mass was detected. Episodic shortness of breath accompanied by cyanosis (laryngospasm) was noted. Tracheostomy placement precluded polysomnographic studies.

Questions for Considerations:

What is the significance of symptom onset and progression?
Where do the symptoms and signs localize to?
What is the differential diagnosis?
What tests would you perform?

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111Sxg5a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus diagnosis — history indicates that the medical history should include the following elements: a description of ocular misalignment in an adult with a history of persistent or recurrent childhood strabismus; strabismus angle and direction may be the same as the original presentation in childhood or different as a result of aging of the extraocular muscles or the impact of prior strabismus surgery; history of chronicity is important, and an acute change or newly symptomatic diplopia may warrant evaluation for other causes such as cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease (TED), and myasthenia gravis; formal neuro-ophthalmic evaluation may be indicated in some cases where presentation suggests other neurologic or systemic disease; and an attempt should be made to acquire and review past clinical and surgical records as well as any prior imaging studies, although this is not always possible.

### Eye movements in patients with neurodegenerative disorders [^113ZrA8g]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

The neural pathways and brain regions involved in eye movements during ocular fixation and gaze control include the cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum, and abnormal eye movements can indicate the presence of neurodegeneration. In some patients, oculomotor signs are key to making a diagnosis. Careful clinical examination of eye movements in patients with neurodegenerative disorders is, therefore, an invaluable adjunct to neurological and cognitive assessments. Eye movement recordings in the laboratory are generally not necessary for diagnostic purposes, but can be a useful addition to the clinical examination. Laboratory recordings of eye movements can provide valuable information about disease severity, progression or regression in neurodegenerative disease, and hold particular promise for objective evaluation of the efficacy of putative neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies. For example, aspects of saccade performance can be tested to probe both motor and cognitive aspects of oculomotor behaviour. This Review describes the oculomotor features of the major age-related movement disorders, including Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. Findings in presymptomatic individuals and changes associated with disease progression are discussed.
