## Question

Common trazodone side effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common side effects of trazodone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "common" using regulatory labeling and high-quality evidence. Then, I should verify which adverse effects recur across multiple authoritative sources. Next, I will quantify frequencies where available and distinguish very common from common. After that, I need to check for serious but less frequent risks that clinicians must counsel on. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, prioritized list with caveats about evidence quality and patient-specific modifiers.

> Let me first confirm the hierarchy of evidence I'll rely on so I don't overstate anything. Regulatory FDA labeling is the most authoritative for frequency categories, followed by large systematic reviews and network meta-analyses, then randomized trials and observational studies; I should flag when I'm using lower-credibility sources like case reports or older labeling tables so we don't jump to conclusions about incidence [^be2ca6f2] [^b20ce656] [^36e1d3f5].

> I need to check the FDA's most recent labeling to anchor what counts as "very common" versus "common". The current FDA materials list very common adverse reactions as blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting, which aligns with the traditional ≥ 10% threshold for "very common" in regulatory summaries [^be2ca6f2] [^8c5ee211].

> Wait, let me verify the "common" category and not conflate it with "very common". The FDA also enumerates common adverse reactions in the 1–10% range, including abdominal pain, akathisia, back pain, bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, chest pain, confusion, constipation, decreased libido, diarrhea, difficulty concentrating, dysgeusia, dyspnea, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, flatulence, hallucinations, delusions, hematuria, hostility, hypersalivation, insomnia, memory impairment, menstrual irregularity, myalgia, nasal congestion, nervousness, nightmares, palpitations, paresthesia, retrograde ejaculation, speech disturbance, syncope, tachycardia, tinnitus, tremor, urinary frequency, urinary retention, urinary urgency, visual disturbances, ventricular tachycardia, weight gain, and weight loss; I should note that exact percentages vary by study and population, so these are best viewed as representative of the 1–10% band rather than precise incidences [^2e825d90].

> Hold on, I should verify the insomnia-specific data because many patients encounter trazodone off-label for sleep. In the AASM guideline's analysis of a 50 mg insomnia RCT, trazodone produced significantly more side effects than placebo, with headache 30% vs 19% and somnolence 23% vs 8%, and an overall adverse event rate of 75% on trazodone vs 65.4% on placebo; importantly, the guideline concludes harms may outweigh benefits given limited efficacy signals, so I need to emphasize that these frequencies come from a single moderate-quality study in a specific population [^36e1d3f5] [^0833545c].

> Next, I should review serious but less frequent risks that must be disclosed. Priapism is rare but clinically urgent; FDA labeling repeatedly warns that erections lasting more than 4–6 hours require immediate discontinuation and emergency care, and disproportionality analyses show trazodone has one of the highest signals for drug-induced priapism among commonly implicated agents, so I should not understate this risk, especially in men with predisposing conditions [^7034deb4] [^09354054]. I also need to ensure we cover QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, which have been reported even at doses ≤ 100 mg in patients with risk factors or interacting drugs; this mandates avoidance in congenital long QT, significant bradycardia, hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia, and with other QT-prolonging or CYP3A4-inhibiting agents [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7]. Finally, I should confirm bleeding risk with serotonergic platelet effects, particularly with NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants, and remind myself of hyponatremia risk, especially in older adults or those on diuretics [^7034deb4] [^773f91ef].

> Let me consider special populations because the balance of benefits and harms shifts. In older adults, orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and falls are more salient; observational data associate trazodone with increased fall risk, and geriatric guidance highlights postural hypotension and sedation as principal adverse effects, reinforcing caution and dose minimization when used for agitation or insomnia in dementia [^1efdf215] [^650f2af6]. In children, I should double-check that safety is not established and that case series of accidental ingestion show mostly minor CNS effects but also rare priapism, supporting conservative triage and avoidance of routine pediatric use [^6d0fdbcb].

> But wait, what if the patient is using trazodone for PTSD-related nightmares or other off-label indications? I should acknowledge that while some reports suggest benefit, adverse effects like daytime sedation and dizziness remain common and priapism led to discontinuations in cohorts of veterans, so shared decision-making should explicitly weigh these trade-offs and document counseling on emergent adverse effects [^55621cbd].

> I will now examine dose-related considerations to avoid overgeneralizing. Low hypnotic doses (commonly 25–100 mg) are frequently used off-label, yet even at 50 mg, RCT data show higher rates of somnolence and headache versus placebo, and mechanistic modeling suggests that low doses may still engage alpha-1 blockade and histamine H1 effects contributing to hypotension and sedation, which helps explain why adverse effects persist even when antidepressant serotonergic occupancy is incomplete [^36e1d3f5] [^e3f2e519].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list while keeping the evidence caveats front and center. Very common effects that patients are likely to experience include somnolence/sedation, dizziness/lightheadedness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, blurred vision, and vomiting; these should be anticipated and managed proactively, for example by dosing at bedtime, rising slowly, and maintaining hydration [^be2ca6f2]. Common effects that warrant counseling and monitoring include orthostatic hypotension, palpitations/tachycardia, constipation or diarrhea, confusion or difficulty concentrating, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and weight changes; I should confirm that patients on antihypertensives or with fall risk get extra precautionary advice [^2e825d90] [^773f91ef]. Serious but rare risks that require explicit warnings and action plans include priapism, QT prolongation/torsades, serotonin syndrome with other serotonergics, and bleeding with antiplatelets/anticoagulants; I need to ensure patients know when to seek urgent care and that we review interacting medications at each visit [^7034deb4] [^59fd6a5b] [^0caa2b23].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've addressed the original question succinctly. The most common trazodone side effects, across regulatory labeling and corroborating studies, are sedation/somnolence, dizziness/lightheadedness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, blurred vision, and vomiting, with orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, cognitive effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight changes also occurring commonly; priapism, QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome, and bleeding are less frequent but clinically critical and must be discussed upfront [^be2ca6f2] [^2e825d90] [^36e1d3f5] [^7034deb4] [^59fd6a5b].

---

Trazodone's most common side effects are **sedation/somnolence** [^be2ca6f2], **dizziness/lightheadedness** [^7e0ad5bf], and **dry mouth** [^8c5ee211], with **orthostatic hypotension** [^7c0374c7] and **headache** also frequent [^2e825d90]. These effects are dose-related and often improve with time or dose adjustment [^notfound]; patients should be cautioned about falls [^1efdf215], especially older adults [^7f40e22a], and advised to rise slowly from sitting or lying positions [^notfound]. Less common but serious risks include **priapism** [^7034deb4], **QT prolongation** [^59fd6a5b], and **serotonin syndrome** [^0caa2b23]; patients should report prolonged erections, palpitations, or signs of serotonin toxicity promptly [^ad04f228].

---

## Very common side effects (> 10%)

- **Sedation/somnolence**: Very common; often desired for insomnia but can cause daytime drowsiness and impaired alertness [^be2ca6f2] [^0caa2b23].

- **Dizziness/lightheadedness**: Very common; often related to orthostatic hypotension and CNS effects [^be2ca6f2] [^7e0ad5bf].

- **Dry mouth**: Very common; anticholinergic effect [^be2ca6f2] [^8c5ee211].

- **Headache**: Very common; typically mild and transient [^be2ca6f2] [^8c5ee211].

- **Nausea**: Very common; usually mild and self-limited [^be2ca6f2] [^8c5ee211].

---

## Common side effects (1–10%)

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Common; risk of falls, especially in older adults [^2e825d90] [^1efdf215].

- **Fatigue**: Common; often overlaps with sedation [^2e825d90].

- **Blurred vision**: Common; anticholinergic effect [^2e825d90] [^7e0ad5bf].

- **Constipation**: Common; anticholinergic effect [^2e825d90] [^7e0ad5bf].

- **Diarrhea**: Common; gastrointestinal effect [^2e825d90].

- **Confusion**: Common, especially in older adults or at higher doses [^2e825d90] [^650f2af6].

- **Decreased libido/sexual dysfunction**: Common; includes erectile dysfunction and delayed orgasm [^2e825d90] [^c17aa6ec].

- **Weight changes**: Both weight gain and loss reported [^2e825d90].

---

## Less common but serious side effects

- **Priapism**: Rare but serious; requires immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage [^7034deb4] [^09354054].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Rare but potentially fatal; avoid in patients with cardiac risk factors or interacting drugs [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Rare but life-threatening; risk increases with other serotonergic drugs [^0caa2b23] [^ab8bdbb5].

- **Hyponatremia**: Particularly in older adults or those on diuretics [^773f91ef] [^f7895da2].

---

## Factors influencing side effect severity and frequency

- **Dose**: Higher doses increase sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and cognitive effects [^e3f2e519] [^040154a5].

- **Age**: Older adults are more prone to sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and falls [^1efdf215] [^7f40e22a].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, liver impairment, and renal dysfunction increase risks [^59fd6a5b] [^a7a29af3].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors, QT-prolonging drugs, and other serotonergic agents increase adverse effects [^7c0374c7] [^10e05d1b].

---

## Management strategies

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at low doses and titrate gradually to minimize side effects [^08c2aeaa] [^a7a29af3].

- **Dose timing**: Take at bedtime to leverage sedation and reduce daytime drowsiness [^08c2aeaa] [^650f2af6].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on orthostatic precautions, fall risk, and warning signs (e.g. priapism, palpitations) [^773f91ef] [^7034deb4].

- **Monitor for serious effects**: Watch for QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome, and hyponatremia, especially in high-risk patients [^59fd6a5b] [^0caa2b23].

---

Trazodone's most common side effects are **sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, and nausea** [^be2ca6f2], with orthostatic hypotension and fatigue also frequent [^2e825d90]; these are dose-related and often manageable with dose adjustment and patient counseling [^08c2aeaa]. Serious risks — priapism, QT prolongation, and serotonin syndrome — are rare but require vigilance and patient education [^7034deb4] [^59fd6a5b] [^0caa2b23].

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^0f792cb9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for treatment of insomnia.

Data Sources

In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms trazodone and insomnia and trazodone and sleep and restricted to 1980–2003, human subjects, and English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the term cardiac and trazodone.

Study Selection

All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

Data Extraction

Because so few studies were identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described.

Data Synthesis

Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects, such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance related to use of trazodone.

Conclusion

Given the relative absence of efficacy data in patients with insomnia and the adverse events associated with trazodone's use in general, it is uncertain whether the risk/benefit ratio warrants trazodone's use in nondepressed patients with insomnia.

### The use of trazodone as a hypnotic: a critical review [^20fb2631]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The last few years have seen a remarkable rise in the off-label use of trazodone for inducing sleep in nondepressed patients, to a degree that it is prescribed for this purpose as commonly as the leading hypnotic. In view of this widespread popularity, it seems prudent to review what is known of the safety and efficacy of trazodone when used in this context.

Data Sources and Selection

A MEDLINE search of the literature published in English between 1975 and 2003 that included the keywords sleep, trazodone, Desyrel, depression, sleeping pill, and sedative-hypnotics was conducted.

Data Synthesis

From this review, it is concluded that there are very few data to suggest that trazodone improves sleep in patients without mood disorder, though it does increase total sleep in patients with major depressive disorder. There are virtually no dose-response data for trazodone vis-à-vis sleep and, similarly, no available data on tolerance to its possible hypnotic effects. Areas of concern with its use include reports of significant dropout rates and induction of arrhythmias, primarily in patients with histories of cardiac disease, as well as the development of priapism.

Conclusion

In summary, there are few data to support the use of trazodone in nondepressed subjects. When the risk-benefit ratio of trazodone is assessed, its side effect profile, which is much more significant than that of conventional hypnotics, should be considered.

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^ec41abca]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^36e1d3f5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Trazodone 50 mg — primary insomnia efficacy and harms: A single study of trazodone 50 mg met inclusion criteria with no meta-analysis available and the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to potential publication bias; patient-reported outcomes showed a modest reduction in sleep latency below the clinical significance threshold, while increases in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset did not reach clinical thresholds, quality of sleep was not significantly improved, and reductions in number of awakenings fell just below clinical significance, so none of the sleep outcome variables improved to a clinically significant degree. There was no meta-analysis of harms; in the Walsh study the trazodone group experienced significantly more side effects than placebo, with headache 30% versus 19% and somnolence 23% versus 8%, and overall adverse events in 75% of trazodone subjects compared to 65.4% with placebo. Given the absence of demonstrated efficacy on numerous critical outcomes and limited harms data, the task force judged the harms to potentially outweigh the benefits, yet determined that the majority of patients would be likely to use trazodone compared to no treatment.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because the frequency of adverse drug effects is affected by diverse factors (e.g., drug dose, method of detection, physician judgment, disease under treatment, etc.) a single meaningful estimate of adverse event incidence is difficult to obtain. This problem is illustrated by the variation in adverse event incidence observed and reported from the inpatients and outpatients treated with trazodone HCl. It is impossible to determine precisely what accounts for the differences observed.

Clinical Trial Reports

Table 2 below is presented solely to indicate the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trazodone HCl.

The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those which prevailed in clinical trials. These incidence figures, also, cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.

TRAZODONE HYDROCHLORIDE- trazodone hydrochloride tablet Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ----------. Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone hydrochloride. Cases of priapism have been reported in men receiving trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention.

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances, tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including trazodone hydrochloride tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^046c95c8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Trazodone for obsessive-compulsive disorder — a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 11 patients who completed the trazodone trial (mean dose 235 mg/day) and 6 patients who completed the placebo trial found no evidence of efficacy; nevertheless, the trial may have been too short (6 weeks at ≥ 250 mg/day). If trazodone is used, sedation is likely to be a limiting side effect, torsades de pointes has been reported on rare occasions, and patients must be warned of the risk of priapism, which may occur in from 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 men.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^1efdf215]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this national Medicare administrative claims data study, older adult beneficiaries taking common insomnia medications demonstrated significantly elevated risk of falls, all-cause mortality, HCRU, and costs compared with non-sleep disordered controls. In addition to highlighting adverse outcomes associated with common insomnia treatments, our most novel findings pertain to substantial risks associated with trazodone, which is often perceived as a safe, albeit off-label, approach to insomnia medication treatment. Note, however, as this study was observational and not a randomized controlled trial, the results show association and not causality. Specifically, residual confounding due to potential misclassification of medication exposure and lack of availability of clinical variables such as severity of insomnia and other underlying illnesses cannot be ruled out.

This study's findings are consistent with two previous studies among older adults which suggested increased risk of falls associated with trazodone use and comparable risk of fall-related injury associated with use of low-dose trazodone or benzodiazepines. Very few studies have examined the impact of trazodone in insomnia, particularly among older adults. Roth and colleagues conducted a small, placebo-controlled study and found trazodone to be associated with impairments in next day balance and arm muscle strength among older adults with insomnia. Low-dose trazodone is commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia, yet it remains understudied and controversial. Indeed, the most common side effects associated with trazodone include drowsiness and dizziness. Nonetheless, many prescribers perceive trazodone as a relatively safe treatment – and some payers may require off-label use of low-dose trazodone as first line therapy for insomnia – although AASM Clinical Guidelines do not recommend trazodone due to limited efficacy/safety study data. AASM asserts that this physician perception of trazodone as a "safer" sleep-promoting agent and consequent prescribing practices of those physicians have engendered the widespread use of trazodone for insomnia. In this vein, findings from the current national study add an important population health perspective to the literature.

Trazodone for agitation in dementia — adverse effects and dosing — When trazodone is used, the principal side effects are postural hypotension, sedation, and dry mouth, and priapism can occur but is uncommon. Trazodone is generally given before bedtime but can be given in two or three divided doses per day, can be started at 25–50 mg/day, and gradually increased to a maximum dosage of 150–250 mg/day.

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^e3f2e519]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression, but it is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans. In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict the brain concentrations of trazodone for different drug-dosing regimens and calculating occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available. Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect, and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone (e.g. dry-mouth, hypotension and priapism).

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^7f40e22a]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (ie, age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia, a common sleep–wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or both, is more prevalent among older adults and older adults are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia – including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) – can have adverse effects that may pose elevated risk for older adults. Benzodiazepine adverse effects include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction. Z-drugs are associated with next day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments and risk of dependence and addiction. Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk–benefit ratios. Clinicians often prescribe off-label the heterocyclic trazodone for insomnia management. Trazodone may be perceived as a safer alternative in older adults due to the lack of anti-cholinergic activity and cardiotoxicity, although limited published data are available to support efficacy or safety in this population. The most common adverse effects associated with trazodone use include daytime sleepiness and orthostatic hypotension, which may pose a risk of falls in an older population, particularly upon awakening from sleep. National data suggests that zolpidem and low-dose trazodone are the most frequently prescribed medications used for insomnia management in the US, followed by benzodiazepines; use of low-dose trazodone for insomnia has increased in recent years while zolpidem use has decreased.

### Single-substance trazodone exposures reported to US poison centers from 2000 to 2019 [^e2fef30b]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Individual case reports describe trazodone overdose resulting in QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. The clinical effects and outcomes associated with trazodone exposures on a large-scale basis are less well known.

Objective

The primary objective was to characterize the severity of single substance trazodone exposures and identify any relationships that may exist between dose of trazodone and severity of exposure. The secondary objective was to describe these exposures from a demographic and clinical symptom standpoint.

Methods

A retrospective review of single-substance trazodone exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2019 was performed. The primary objective was to characterize the severity of trazodone exposures and relationships between ingested dose and level of care required or medical outcome.

Results

A total of 118,773 cases were included in the analysis of demographics and level of care required. A majority (59.5%) of cases did not require medical admission. Of the 81,698 cases with known medical outcomes, the most common clinical effects included mild-moderate CNS depression (49.7%), QTc prolongation (12.2% of cases in 2019), vomiting (9.0%), hypotension (7.0%), and tachycardia (7.0%). The median ingested dose associated with treatment, and release from the emergency department was 600mg compared to 1500mg in those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Regarding medical outcome, median ingested dose ranged from 600mg in those experiencing no effect to 1500mg in those experiencing major effects. Cardiac-related clinical effects and the need for cardiac-specific interventions were overall infrequent. A dose-response relationship was identified for level of care and medical outcome.

Conclusions

Many trazodone exposures can be characterized as low severity due to the infrequent need for healthcare facility admission and large proportion of cases that experienced no effects or only minor effects.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone HCl should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during the first week with optimal antidepressant effects typically evident within two weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who respond to trazodone HCl require more than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug administration.

Usual Adult Dosage: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every three to four days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Maintenance: Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should be kept at the lowest effective level. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy of trazodone beyond 6 weeks, it is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug treatment should be continued for several months.

### Trazodone in the elderly: risk of extrapyramidal acute events [^040154a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Trazodone is a second-generation atypical antidepressant exercising selective inhibitory action on the transport of serotonin. It also has an antagonist effect, similar to nefazodone, on the 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, probably due to the therapeutic effects of such substances. It is very effective in the treatment of depression, in anxiety and insomnia. Its known side effects mainly occur with prolonged use of daily doses of 150–200 mg. The ability to enhance drowsiness may be associated with some risk in elderly patients. This clinical case illustrates an acute extrapyramidal event induced by a low dose of trazodone.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing trazodone.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in men receiving trazodone. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

Trazodone should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with trazodone or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^efcce357]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, trazodone, nortriptyline) for tinnitus management reports evidence from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a network meta-analysis (NMA) that failed to show a significant benefit in reducing tinnitus functional impact. The use of fluoxetine alone or in combination with alprazolam improved the tinnitus functional impact (THI) and VAS scores compared with placebo in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus at 4 weeks, whereas TSI scores decreased in both treatment groups without a significant difference between the single therapy and the combination treatment. The use of trazodone in a small study (n = 43) showed no difference in quality of life (QoL) compared with placebo in individuals at up to 8 weeks of follow-up, and there was also no difference in QoL after administration of nortriptyline versus placebo. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of antidepressants because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, with the RCT showing a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory in the treatment groups while the severity of anxiety in the fluoxetine and control group increased significantly (p = 0.003) and Seven individuals left the combination group as a result of side effects; commonly reported side effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^6b93bed3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — antidepressants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 7 RCTs and 1 Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. Although 4 of 7 trials showed improvement, these trials had significant methodological limitations, and the Cochrane review included 4 trials of tricyclic antidepressants, 1 trial of trazodone, and 1 trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine); of these trials, 4 are double blind, 1 is single blind, and 1 does not clearly state blinding. Three tricyclic trials showed modest improvement possibly related to depression/anxiety modulation rather than tinnitus change, and commonly reported side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth with more subjects dropping out of treatment groups than placebo; tinnitus is listed as a rare side effect of all available antidepressants.

Other outcomes

Other outcomes for which some evidence of an association with antidepressant use exists include all cause mortality, seizures, road traffic accidents, and adverse drug reactions, but results are not consistent and evidence in older people with which to compare our findings is lacking.

Clinical implications and future research

Some of our findings are unexpected — in particular, that contrary to expectations tricyclic antidepressants seem to be the safest class of antidepressant in older people for the adverse outcomes considered in this study. Tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed at lower doses than the other drugs, but some evidence shows that low dose tricyclic antidepressants are similar to higher dose tricyclics in reducing symptoms of depression. Little evidence exists as to whether low dose tricyclic antidepressants are as efficacious as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at higher doses in the treatment of depression; in addition, tricyclic antidepressants may be associated with higher discontinuation rates owing to side effects such as sedation and dry mouth. The potential risks and benefits of different antidepressants therefore need careful consideration when these drugs are prescribed to older people.

Further research is needed to confirm our findings. Few randomised trials of antidepressants have been done in older people, in a primary care setting, with sufficient size and length of follow-up to assess adverse outcomes as well as benefits, so a long term randomised trial of antidepressants in older people with depression in primary care is needed to compare benefits and risks of more common adverse events between a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a low dose tricyclic antidepressant. Research is also needed to confirm our findings with other data sources of older people in a community setting and to assess any risks associated with switching between antidepressant drugs. If our findings are confirmed in other studies, this would have implications for the selection of antidepressant treatment in older people, who are already at higher risk of many of these adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

This study has found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among the most commonly prescribed individual drugs, trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest rates for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding. Other differences in characteristics may exist between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs, which we have not adjusted for and which may account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Antidepressants

Trazodone

Short term (2 months)

Administration of 100 mg trazodone daily for the first 4 days followed by 200 mg for 8 weeks significantly decreased patients' VNS pain intensity against baseline (MD −13.9, p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference with the placebo group (SMD −0.06, 95% CI −0.72 to 0.59; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.61–1.49). If the assessment was based on the "Patients' Global Assessment of Improvement" evaluation, trazodone and placebo groups reported improvements in pain intensity of 73% and 76%, respectively, and were not significant (p > 0.05). One patient in the trazodone group reported a worsening of symptoms. Both the trazodone and placebo groups significantly improved their BDI depression scores (p < 0.01). The most common side effects were dizziness and drowsiness, with seven patients dropping out due to dizziness. Other side effects included abdominal pains, headache, palpitation, tremor, xerostomia, and urinary incontinence.

Citalopram

Short term (11 weeks)

The use of citalopram 10 mg daily followed by an increment to 20 mg after 1 week showed an improvement of VAS score of 87.45% (MD: −7.8, p < 0.001). However, comparison with crocin reported no significant difference between their post treatment VAS scores (p = 0.98). The Hamilton questionnaires analysis revealed a significant reduction of depression and anxiety scores, with an average recovery percentage of improvement of 30.57% (SD 15.81) and 15.44% (SD 11.86), respectively. There was no significant difference in comparison between both groups in depression (citalopram: 19.4, SD 4.65; crocin: 19.0, SD 3.97, p = 0.76) or anxiety (citalopram: 18.6, SD 5.11; crocin: 18.0, SD 4.38, p = 0.76).

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^4f0ba7d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit is due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors critically appraised the retrieved studies and extracted data independently. Where necessary we contacted study authors for further information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 610 patients were included. Trial quality was generally low. Four of the trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. One study investigated trazodone, an atypical antidepressant, versus placebo. Only the trial using the SSRI drug reached the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop-out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results showed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment, but in neither case reached statistical significance. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is as yet insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TRAZODONE PRESCRIPTION

Trazodone has been in use in the US since 1981, so there is a great deal known about its benefits and side-effects. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. Trazodone also causes sedation and can cause uncomfortable feelings. Trazodone is predominantly metabolized in liver microsomes, so patients with liver damage are more sensitive to this medication and should have lower doses prescribed. The half-life of trazodone is 3 to 5 hours. Because of the individual variability of potency and side-effects, dosing must be done carefully for each patient (start low: 12.5 mg at bedtime; go slow: 12.5 mg increments).

Trazodone has minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, in contrast to older anti-depressant medications. Trazodone produces a higher quality of sleep for those patients who work with the dosing than the GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anti-cholinergics, or anti-histamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), which are widely used but impair cognitive function short-term and are now being considered as contributors to the development of dementia and AD pathology long-term.

Trazodone has a generally positive effect on sexual desire and male erectile function, but it is also known to cause priapism, an emergency condition, similar to what can be associated with medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is estimated that abnormal erectile function occurs in about one in 6,000 male, mostly younger, patients treated with trazodone.

Trazodone is also useful for agitation. (There are anecdotes that 12.5 mg under the tongue decreases road-rage.).

Trazodone is relatively safer than most other anti-depressants in overdose situations. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200 mg.

Trazodone may also be effective as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea with worsening hypoxemia, which could also be beneficial for cognition and AD prevention. This effect could be related to serotonin, norepinephrine, or histamine mechanisms.

Sedative-hypnotics and related agents — adverse effects in older adults and dementia: General adversities attributed to sedative-hypnotics include increased risks for falls, headaches, nausea, medication-medication interactions, and drug dependence, with elderly patients at specific high risk. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased confusion, impaired motor performance, anterograde amnesia, daytime sleepiness, and physiologic dependence. Over-the-counter antihistamines have very high rates of side effects, including cognitive impairment, daytime somnolence, and anticholinergic responses. Trazodone is widely used off-label as a hypnotic despite virtually no evidence-based data supporting efficacy with older adults and carries significant risks including priapism, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Off-label neuroleptic use for dementia-related disturbances has a black box warning for increased mortality risks approximately twofold higher than with placebo-treated patients, mostly due to cardiovascular or infectious causes.

### Are we overstating the risk of priapism with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors? [^14ccd5f2]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Priapism is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) associated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

Aim

The purpose of this study was to identify the true data about PDE5i-associated priapism to properly counsel patients.

Methods

We queried the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Reporting System Public Dashboard to identify cases of drug-induced priapism among medications commonly associated with priapism. Next, a systematic review and analysis of publications describing cases of drug-induced priapism were carried out.

Outcomes

The main outome of this study is incidence of PDE5i-induced priapism.

Results

We found 411 cases of drug-induced priapism secondary to Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra reported to the Food and Drug Administration since 1998. Compared with PDE5is, drug-induced priapism was 2.6 (n = 1,065) and 2.0 times (n = 817) more commonly reported for second-generation antipsychotics and the antidepressant/sleep aid trazodone, respectively. A total of 240 manuscripts describing cases of drug-induced priapism in patients with non-sickle cell disease were identified. PDE5i-induced priapism accounted for only 2.9% (n = 7) of drug-induced priapism cases. Second-generation antipsychotics (33.8%), a group of "other" medications (11.3%), and alpha-adrenergic antagonists (8.8%) accounted for the greatest percentage of published drug-induced priapism cases.

Clinical Implications

Extensive counseling about priapism as an ADR for PDE5i for the routine treatment of erectile dysfunction is likely unnecessary.

Strengths & Limitations

The study used national-level data to identify drug-induced priapism cases. Reported and published cases of drug-induced priapism may reflect more severe and atypical cases of this ADR, which may have underestimated our results.

Conclusion

PDE5i-induced priapism is a rare event. Drug-induced priapism should be attributed to a wider spectrum of medications that can cause this condition. Rezaee ME, Gross MS. Are We Overstating the Risk of Priapism With Oral Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors? J Sex Med 2020;17:1579–1582.

### Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation and the risk of fall-related fractures among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^a8605d19]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and trazodone, a sedating antidepressant, are the most common medications used to treat insomnia in the United States. Both drugs have side effect profiles (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive and motor impairment) that can heighten the risk of falls and fractures. Despite widespread zolpidem and trazodone use, little is known about the comparative safety of these medications in patients receiving hemodialysis, a vulnerable population with an exceedingly high fracture rate.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Using data from the United States Renal Data System registry (2013–2016), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the initiation of zolpidem versus trazodone therapy and the 30-day risk of hospitalized fall-related fractures among Medicare-enrolled patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We used an active comparator new-user design and estimated 30-day inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios and risk differences. We treated death as a competing event.

Results

A total of 31,055 patients were included: 18,941 zolpidem initiators (61%) and 12,114 trazodone initiators (39%). During the 30-day follow-up period, 101 fall-related fractures occurred. Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation was associated with a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture (weighted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.63; weighted risk difference, 0.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.07% to 0.29%). This association was more pronounced among individuals prescribed higher zolpidem doses (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 3.01; and risk difference, 0.20%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04% to 0.38% for higher-dose zolpidem versus trazodone; and hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.55 and risk difference, 0.14%; 95% confidence interval, 0.03% to 0.27% for lower-dose zolpidem versus trazodone). Sensitivity analyses using longer follow-up durations yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis, zolpidem initiators had a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture compared with trazodone initiators.

### Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction during treatment with fluoxetine, sertraline and trazodone; a randomized controlled trial [^c17aa6ec]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are common treatments for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, adverse effects of SSRIs on sexual function are common in the treatment of patients with MDD. There is a discrepancy in the reported frequency of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. On the other hand, there is also less evidence about sexual dysfunction with serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs). Therefore, we aimed to assess sexual dysfunction in MDD patients who received fluoxetine, sertraline and trazodone.

Method

In a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in Kermanshah, Iran, during 2009–2010, 195 patients who met the DSMIV-IR criteria for MDD were enrolled. The patients completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the sexual function questionnaire (SFQ). Eligible patients were allocated in three treatment groups (receiving fluoxetine, sertraline or trazodone) for 14 weeks randomly. Measurement of HAMD was repeated in 4-week interval. Analysis for comparing sexual dysfunction among three groups and men and women was performed.

Results

There were 102 men and 93 women in the three groups receiving fluoxetine (n = 64), sertraline (n = 67) and trazodone (n = 64). There was no significant difference in the sexual dysfunction of the patients in the three groups at baseline (P > .05). After treatment, both men and women who had received fluoxetine had the most impairment in desire/drive items (43%-51% and 44%-50%, respectively), while patients receiving trazodone had the least impairment in these items (12%-18% and 23%-24%, respectively). Trazodone was also induced with a lower rate of impairment in arousal/orgasm items in men (9%-15%) compared with the other two drugs. Compared with fluoxetine and trazodone, sertraline was associated with intermediate impairment in sexual function (39%-42% in desire/drive items and 32%-39% in arousal/orgasm items) that was lower than that with fluoxetine and more than that with trazodone.

Conclusion

There were different rates of sexual dysfunction with different antidepressants drugs in under treated patients. Compared with fluoxetine, and sertraline, trazodone was associated with the fewest sexual dysfunction. Fluoxetine was also associated with more sexual dysfunction than sertraline. Further research to better identify the differences among antidepressant drugs is recommended.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of trazodone HCl has been demonstrated in both inpatient and outpatient settings and for depressed patients with and without prominent anxiety. The depressive illness of patients studied corresponds to the Major Depressive Episode criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, lll.a

Major Depressive Episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least two weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least four of the following eight symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigability, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and suicidal ideation or attempts.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing trazodone.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in men receiving trazodone. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

Trazodone should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with trazodone or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^7c0374c7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs

Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of trazodone HCl or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Trazodone HCl is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

### Adverse effects of psychotropic medications: a call to action [^36605966]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Adverse effects are common, bothersome, and a leading cause of discontinuation of treatment. The methodology for evaluating adverse effects of medications has been greatly neglected, however, especially in comparison to the methodology for assessment of efficacy of medications. Existing methods for assessment and reporting of adverse effects have important limitations leading to lack of much-needed data related to adverse effects. Lastly, there is little systematic research into management of most adverse effects. A series of recommendations are made in this article about how to improve identification, assessment, reporting, and management of adverse effects.

### QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular conduction caused by acute ingestion of trazodone [^e473538c]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Trazodone possesses minimal anticholinergic properties and, therefore, is generally regarded as having less cardiotoxic potential than other antidepressants. This report describes a young woman who developed significant QT prolongation and delayed atrioventricular nodal conduction after acute trazodone overdose. The case adds to the existing literature because it has a number of strengths, namely that confounding drugs and alcohol were lacking, trazodone exposure was confirmed by drug assay, and early presentation to hospital gave a valuable opportunity to study the time-course of the cardiac effects. This case reminds us to consider the possibility of cardiotoxic effects after trazodone overdose, even in young patients with no established cardiovascular disease.

### Effect of viloxazine and trazodone in obstructive sleep apnoea: a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study [^849385a7]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Combination of the noradrenergic atomoxetine with either the antimuscarinic aroxybutynin or trazodone has been shown to improve obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity. However, atomoxetine may contribute to apnoea-cycling and reduced drug tolerability due to wake-promoting, especially in a subgroup (poor cytochrome 2D6 metabolisers leading to higher blood concentration of medication). We investigated the effect of a potentially more manageable noradrenergic, viloxazine, with and without trazodone, on OSA severity.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 24 patients with OSA (18–75 years) were analysed and randomised to 500 mg viloxazine, 500/75 mg viloxazine-trazodone (vilo-trazo) or placebo; taken before bed for 2 weeks with 1-week washout between treatments. In-laboratory polysomnography was performed at the end of each cross-over period. Mixed-model analyses compared the effect of vilo-trazo versus placebo on AHI 4 (apnoea-hypopnoea index with 4% desaturations; primary outcome) and hypoxic burden (secondary outcome). Additional outcomes examined the effects of vilo-trazo versus viloxazine on total sleep time (TST) and wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Safety endpoints (patient-reported outcomes, heart rate and adverse events) were also assessed.

Results

Vilo-trazo reduced AHI 4 (mean difference (95% CI): 10.5 (6.6, 13.6) events/hour, p < 0.001) and hypoxic burden (16.7 (9.6, 21.8) %min/hr, p < 0.001) versus placebo. Compared with viloxazine, TST tended to be longer on vilo-trazo (22.3 (-1.4, 46.0) min, p < 0.065), while WASO was unchanged. TST and WASO remained significantly reduced on vilo-trazo versus placebo. Both interventions worsened patient-reported outcomes, although to a lesser extent on vilo-trazo, and increased heart rate versus placebo. Commonly reported adverse events were insomnia, constipation, headache and xerostomia.

Conclusions

Viloxazine-trazodone reduced OSA severity. Potential deleterious effects of viloxazine on sleep quality appeared partly attenuated by trazodone.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^bfb30073]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

There are also inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing, after randomized allocation between groups, and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant in achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address. Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks, or whether they primarily reflect early treatment period effects. Even though there are no prospective long-term studies of trazodone for insomnia in elders, long-term persistent benefits have been observed in depression.

### Trazodone hydrochoride (trazodone hydrochloride) [^eab9c90b]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

General

The possibility of suicide in seriously depressed patients is inherent in the illness and may persist until significant remission occurs. Therefore, prescriptions should be written for the smallest number of tablets consistent with good patient management.

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope, has been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone HCl. Concomitant administration of antihypertensive therapy with trazodone HCl may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

Little is known about the interaction between trazodone HCl and general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, trazodone HCl should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.

As with all antidepressants, the use of trazodone HCl should be based on the consideration of the physician that the expected benefits of therapy outweigh potential risk factors.

Information for Patients

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with trazodone HCl and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for trazodone HCl. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking trazodone HCl.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^10fd2ae5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alternative antidepressants to SSRIs in dementia — alternative agents include but are not limited to venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system but does not induce or inhibit these enzymes and is less likely to interact with other drugs metabolized through the same system; one side effect more commonly seen with venlafaxine than other antidepressants is an elevation in blood pressure, which may be less likely with the sustained release formulation. Duloxetine is commonly used to treat major depression, but clinical experience with its use in geriatric patients with dementia is limited, and there are no published clinical trials to support its use. Mirtazapine can produce sedation and weight gain, especially at low doses, with rare but potentially serious side effects of liver toxicity and neutropenia. Bupropion has been associated with a risk of seizures, especially at high doses, in patients with anorexia or with structural neurological problems. Trazodone has sedative side effects and can be used when insomnia or severe agitation are prominent; at higher doses, significant side effects include postural hypotension and priapism.

### Effectiveness of common antidepressants: a post market release study [^01b809e4]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome: In clinical studies of effectiveness of antidepressants, the main outcome of interest is patient-reported remission of depression symptoms. Since this outcome is often missing in claims data, investigators have devised proxy measures for remission. We relied on patterns of antidepressant use to indicate remission, in particular we relied on: (1) duration of use, (2) reaching a therapeutic dose, (3) switch from one antidepressant to another, and (4) augmentation of current antidepressant. An index based on these factors accurately predict (Cross-validated Area under Receiver Operating Curve = 0.93) the probability of remission. This index assumes the patient is in remission if all four conditions are present, meaning that duration exceeded 10 weeks, the dose exceeded therapeutic level, and there was no switch or augmentation of the medication in the first 10 weeks. In addition, we relied on remission reported by clinicians within their codified diagnoses (e.g. ICD 9 code 296.25 indicates "partial or unspecified remission."). When the clinician had indicated remission, then we assumed remission independent of the pattern of use of the medication.

There are multiple reasons for stopping a medication (switching to another medication, or having a short intake of medication, or not receiving minimum effective dose). Some patients may stop taking the medication because it is not effective, others may stop because of side-effects. The present study does not clarify why a medication was stopped, just that it was stopped.

Treatment: This study separately analyzed the effectiveness of monotherapy with 15 most common antidepressant during the study period, including: Amitriptyline, Bupropion, Citalopram, Desvenlafaxine, Doxepin, Duloxetine, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, Mirtazapine, Nortriptyline, Paroxetine, Ropinirole, Sertraline, Trazodone, and Venlafaxine. Monotherapy with less common antidepressants besides the 15 studied, and combination of any two of the 15 antidepressants studied, when filled on the same day, were classified as treated with "Other" medications.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants: background paper for the American College of Physicians [^e5b0d473]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antidepressants dominate the management of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and subsyndromal depression. Evidence on the comparative benefits and harms is still accruing.

Purpose

To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine) for the treatment of depressive disorders in adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007, limited to English-language articles. Reference lists of pertinent review articles were manually searched and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research database was explored to identify unpublished research.

Study Selection

Abstracts and full-text articles were independently reviewed by 2 persons. Six previous good- or fair-quality systematic reviews or meta-analyses were included, as were 155 good- or fair-quality double-blind, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head randomized, controlled trials of at least 6 weeks' duration. For harms, 35 observational studies with at least 100 participants and follow-up of at least 12 weeks were also included.

Data Extraction

Using a standard protocol, investigators abstracted data on study design and quality-related details, funding, settings, patients, and outcomes.

Data Synthesis

If data were sufficient, meta-analyses of head-to-head trials were conducted to determine the relative benefit of response to treatment and the weighted mean differences on specific depression rating scales. If sufficient evidence was not available, adjusted indirect comparisons were conducted by using meta-regressions and network meta-analyses. Second-generation antidepressants did not substantially differ in efficacy or effectiveness for the treatment of major depressive disorder on the basis of 203 studies; however, the incidence of specific adverse events and the onset of action differed. The evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the comparative efficacy, effectiveness, or harms of these agents for the treatment of dysthymia and subsyndromal depression.

Limitation

Adjusted indirect comparisons have methodological limitations and cannot conclusively rule out differences in efficacy.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not warrant the choice of one second-generation antidepressant over another on the basis of differences in efficacy and effectiveness. Other differences with respect to onset of action and adverse events may be relevant for the choice of a medication.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b20ce656]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study is based on 522 double-blind studies, which included 116 477 patients randomly assigned to 21 individual first-generation and second-generation antidepressant drugs or placebo. The project extends our previous work that had addressed 12 antidepressants with data for head-to-head comparisons. The present analysis is substantially more comprehensive because it includes 21 active treatments and placebo. The much larger evidence base (about 117 000 vs 26 000 patients), obtained through exhaustive search for published and unpublished information, allowed us to investigate additional important outcomes, such as remission, change in mood symptoms and dropouts due to side-effects, and a number of methodological issues, such as sponsorship, dosing schedule, study precision, and novelty effect.

We found that all antidepressants included in the meta-analysis were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder and the summary effect sizes were mostly modest. Some antidepressants, such as escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, agomelatine, and sertraline had a relatively higher response and lower dropout rate than the other antidepressants. By contrast, reboxetine, trazodone, and fluvoxamine were associated with generally inferior efficacy and acceptability profiles compared with the other antidepressants, making them less favourable options. To make our results as relevant and robust as possible to inform clinical practice, we decided to focus on head-to-head studies and at the same time emphasise the certainty of the retrieved evidence. Our assessment overall found few differences between antidepressants when all data were considered, while there was more diversity in the range of efficacy and dropout patterns seen across the head-to-head comparisons than the meta-analysis of antidepressants versus placebo.

Treatment of Insomnia Disorder with Low-Dose Antidepressants

Insomnia belongs to the most frequent disorders of the brain. In industrialized countries, approximately 6% of the adults suffer from insomnia as a disorder and as many as 50% may suffer from transient insomnia symptoms. Although insomnia is not regarded as a severe mental disorder, it shares many features with depression. In order to offer a patient an effective treatment of insomnia, there is a need for a broader perspective, one that reaches far beyond the prescription of hypnotics. Current treatment guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder and only short-term use of the sleep-promoting drugs in patients with insufficient response to CBI-I. However, in daily clinical practice, the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia is very common. The most frequently used drugs to treat insomnia aside from benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine (eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) hypnotics are sedative antidepressants. However, due to the lack of methodologically sound randomized clinical trials in insomnia, only one of them, doxepin, is approved by FDA for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia. Furthermore, recent recommendations discourage the use of other drugs from this class than doxepin for the insomnia treatment. In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option of insomnia in a situation in which despite being in CBT-I therapy, the patient still requires sleep-promoting drugs more than 3–4 times per week. The use of sedative antidepressants should be also considered when there is a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder because such patients are at increased risk of developing hypnotic dependency. Moreover, in many insomnia patients, physiological parameters, e.g. hormone secretion, whole body, and brain metabolic rate, are altered in a similar fashion to the depressed ones what is called a hyperarousal, supporting the use of sedative antidepressants to treat such patients. The pros and cons of using sedative antidepressants in insomnia patients were discussed extensively in the earlier papers. This is especially true for trazodone that is very often used as a sleep-promoting drug. Frequently expressed concern with the usage of sedative antidepressants in insomnia is that their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be underrated. Indeed, although there is evidence for efficacy of sedative antidepressants to promote sleep, for example for TCA in a form of a recent meta-analytic study, it is important to remember that these drugs should be used in insomnia patients only in a very low dose, e.g. for doxepin as low as 3 to 6 mg or 25–50 mg for trazodone. Many psychiatrists are astonished that a sedative antidepressant can promote sleep in such a low dose. Firstly, it should be noted that such low doses are appropriate only for patients with primary insomnia. In the presence of a comorbid mood disorder, the antidepressants have to be used in a recommended therapeutic dose. Secondly, such treatment should be used only when combined with behavioral interventions from CBT-I protocol. When a patient restricts time in bed and uses stimulus control technique, even low-dosage pharmacological treatment starts to work. Thirdly, to be effective in treating sleep-onset insomnia, sedative antidepressants have to be taken much earlier than hypnotics in regard to their pharmacokinetics, especially the time they take to reach the maximum serum concentration (Cmax). It usually means at least 2 hours before sleep (in the case of more rapid drug action the patient should be encouraged to shorten this time). In our opinion, sedative antidepressants are a safe class of drugs when given in low doses. We use them in many patient groups where hypnotics are contraindicated, e.g. in the elderly patients, in patients with sleep apnea and in patients with a history of alcohol and substance abuse. Despite the fact that the use of atypical antipsychotics, mostly quetiapine, is increasing for treatment of insomnia accompanying bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we hold the conviction that sedative antidepressants are a valuable treatment option for such patients as well. Based on our clinical experience and review of published case reports, we believe that the use of sedative antidepressants in a low dose is not related to the increased risk of phase shift in bipolar disorder. Moreover, we have observed that for the treatment of insomnia low doses (5–10 mg) of citalopram administered in the morning can be an alternative to sedative antidepressants with good treatment effects.

### The treatment of chronic insomnia: drug indications, chronic use and abuse liability. summary of a 2001 new clinical drug evaluation unit meeting symposium [^886163fb]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.

### Review of priapism litigation in the United States [^f8442963]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review medical malpractice trends and to identify the most common claims filed against medical providers for the management of patients with priapism.

Methods

Using the Westlaw legal database, a search was done for the keyword "priapism" between July 1, 1980 and July 1, 2020. Cases were evaluated for plaintiff demographics, reasons for filing claims, management outcomes, legal verdicts and awards and further categorized based upon the timing of the alleged malpractice.

Results

Alleged negligence during the pre-management period was cited in 30 cases. Administration of psychotropic medications was the most common reasons for filing pre-management claims 22/56 (39.3%). Delay in care accounted for 18/56 (32.1%) and complications of surgery were 5/56 (8.9%) of claims. The majority of the completed cases were in favor of the defendants (39/47; 83.0%). There was no association between type of health care provider or timing of alleged malpractice and ultimate verdict.

Conclusions

Prescribing psychoactive medications without warning of the adverse effect profile is the most common reason for claims filed against providers with trazodone as the leading medication. Medical providers should ensure that patients are well informed of this adverse effect prior to prescription. Regardless, the majority of medical malpractice cases carry a verdict in favor of the defendant.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^ea95d023]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Trazodone has been used widely to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected to cause cardiovascular side effects.

Method

A retrospective study was done of 100 patients who received ECT with concurrent trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records had not been given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

Results

No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

Conclusion

Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^afdf20f4]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, the aetiology of antidepressant adverse side effects remains largely understudied. Thus, we aim to bridge this research gap by leveraging data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (AGDS) to gain insights into the prevalence, aetiology and genetic underpinnings of adverse side effects associated with antidepressant use. We investigate the prevalence and demographic risk factors for 23 side effects across ten commonly prescribed antidepressants. We test for SSRI or SNRI specificity and provide evidence for a co-occurring relationship between adverse side effects across different antidepressant medications. That is, participants who took two or more antidepressants were more likely to report the same side effects regardless of the antidepressant used. This co-occurrence would suggest a set of common risk factors underlie these side effects. Here, we use polygenic risk scores (PRS) to study the genetic aetiology of specific antidepressant adverse side effects to understand the nature of these common risk factors. PRS are an estimate of an individual's genetic risk for a given trait. They are calculated based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) results whereby genetic variants are linked to a trait of interest through an effect size (i.e. the increased risk per copy of the genetic variant). PRS are calculated in an independent sample by performing a sum of risk variants weighted by their effect size. PRS are gaining popularity due to their potential to enable many applications such as testing genetic overlap between traits, enabling risk stratification, and aiding diagnosis and personalised treatment. We use PRS for MDD, BMI, insomnia and headaches to test for evidence of non-specific or shared genetic factors underpinning specific side effects. Overall, our results suggest drug exposure alone does not explain the occurrence of side effects, and a combination of specific and non-specific factors underlie their aetiology.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including RALDESY, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of RALDESY and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing RALDESY.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in males receiving trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Males who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

RALDESY should be used with caution in males who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with RALDESY or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with RALDESY, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Because priapism has been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone HCl, patients with prolonged or inappropriate penile erection should immediately discontinue the drug and consult with the physician (see WARNINGS).

Antidepressants may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery; the patient should be cautioned accordingly.

Trazodone HCl may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Trazodone HCl should be given shortly after a meal or light snack. Within any individual patient, total drug absorption may be up to 20% higher when the drug is taken with food rather than on an empty stomach. The risk of dizziness/lightheadedness may increase under fasting conditions.

Laboratory Tests

Occasional low white blood cell and neutrophil counts have been noted in patients receiving trazodone HCl. These were not considered clinically significant and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug; however, the drug should be discontinued in any patient whose white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count falls below normal levels. White blood cell and differential counts are recommended for patients who develop fever and sore throat (or other signs of infection) during therapy.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders including a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

Guanfacine is a medication in the same drug class as clonidine (α 2 -adrenergic agonist), and some practitioners may prefer trying guanfacine before clonidine. Guanfacine is FDA-approved for ADHD in children but is used off-label for sleep disturbances. The short-acting guanfacine can be prescribed at a starting dose of half of a 1 mg tablet (0.5 mg) and can be increased by 0.5–1 mg every 3 to 5 days as tolerated up to 2 mg for sleep disturbances. Long-acting guanfacine preparations can be effective for sleep maintenance. If the short-acting preparation is effective with sleep onset and the patient can swallow a pill, then guanfacine ER can be tried. Dosing of guanfacine ER should start with 1 mg (these tablets cannot be broken or chewed) and can be increased every 5–7 days until achieving the desired clinical response or reaching a maximum dose of 4 mg/day.

Trazodone, a 5-HT 2 antagonist, was initially FDA-approved for the treatment of depression in adults and was found to be too sedating. It is thus frequently used for sleep disturbance in adults and children with mood and anxiety disorders. There are no RCTs of trazodone in children with ASD, yet clinically, it is a very effective medication for improving sleep onset and maintenance. Side effects, including prolonged erection of the penis (priapism), should be explained to patients and families. Start with half of a 50 mg tablet (25 mg) at bedtime and increase weekly by 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100–150 mg at bedtime, depending on body weight.

Mirtazapine is a central presynaptic α 2 -adrenergic antagonist and serotonin (5-HT) 2,3 antagonist and is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. There are no RCTs of mirtazapine for sleep, yet this also can be effective for sleep onset and maintenance. Some of the common side effects of mirtazapine include drowsiness, increased appetite, weight gain, and irritability. See the anxiety section for dosing and titration recommendations.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^40fb0d85]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic sleep aids — melatonin, ramelteon, trazodone, and antihistamines: Although melatonin is the first choice of psychiatrists for the treatment of insomnia in athletes, research investigating its use for primary insomnia is inconclusive; there is no evidence that melatonin is effective in the management of most primary sleep disorders with short-term use, though short-term use appears safe and it was not shown to improve sleep quality in athletes the next morning after ingestion. Exogenous melatonin is not regulated by the FDA, so elite athletes in drug testing programs must use this OTC supplement with caution because purity cannot be guaranteed. The melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon carries a longer half-life than melatonin with a greater likelihood of hangover effects and has not been studied in athletes. Trazodone is commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia; no studies have been performed in athletes, and one RCT versus zolpidem and placebo found no significant efficacy for trazodone and more side effects such as headache and somnolence. First-generation antihistamines are most often used for their sedating effect and longer duration of action, but there is weak evidence showing absence of efficacy for sleep onset insomnia and minimal evidence of adverse events beyond placebo.

### Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in people aged 20–64 years: cohort study using a primary care database [^74fdb5b5]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have found upper gastrointestinal bleeding to be more common among patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly when used in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A number of mechanisms have been proposed for this increased risk, including depletion of platelet serotonin content causing an inhibition of platelet plug formation or direct toxicity on the gastrointestinal mucosa. In our study, we found a higher risk for tricyclic and related antidepressants than for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although this was only in the lowest dose category and may therefore reflect preferential prescribing of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants rather than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in people with suspected risk factors for bleeding. We did not find a stronger association when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were used in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although, as our study was in a younger age group than most previous studies, these differences may be due to smaller numbers prescribed this drug combination. Our finding that venlafaxine and trazodone were associated with the highest risks has been found in other studies.

Increased tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants is long established, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors having fewer side effects and adverse reactions, particularly for anticholinergic and sedating effects. Lofepramine had the highest rate of adverse drug reactions in this study, as we also found in our study of older people, though this drug was prescribed at higher doses than the other antidepressants. Venlafaxine was also associated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions compared with citalopram, which concurs with the findings of a meta-analysis of double-blind randomized trials that reported higher rates of discontinuation due to adverse events for venlafaxine compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Amitriptyline was mainly prescribed at low doses, but still showed an increased risk of adverse drug reactions.

### Medications mostly associated with priapism events: assessment of the 2015–2020 food and drug administration (FDA) pharmacovigilance database entries [^09354054]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A range of drugs have a direct role in triggering ischaemic priapism. We aimed at identifying: a) which medications are associated with most priapism-reports; and, b) within these medications, comparing their potential to elicit priapism through a disproportionality analysis. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was queried to identify those drugs associated the most with priapism reports over the last 5 years. Only those drugs being associated with a minimum of 30 priapism reports were considered. The Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs), and their 95% confidence intervals were computed. Out of the whole 2015–2020 database, 1233 priapism reports were identified, 933 of which (75.7%) were associated with 11 medications with a minimum of 30 priapism-reports each. Trazodone, olanzapine and tadalafil showed levels of disproportionate reporting, with a PRR of 9.04 (CI95%: 7.73–10.58), 1.55 (CI95%: 1.27–1.89), and 1.42 (CI95%: 1.10–1.43), respectively. Most (57.5%) of the reports associated with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) were related with concomitant priapism-eliciting drugs taken at the same time and/or inappropriate intake/excessive dosage. Patients taking trazodone and/or antipsychotics need to be aware of the priapism-risk; awareness among prescribers would help in reducing priapism-related detrimental sequelae; PDE5I-intake is not responsible for priapism by itself, when appropriate medical supervision is provided.

### Depression, antidepressant medications, and risk of Clostridium difficile infection [^8cb854ab]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We cannot completely discern whether it is the pathophysiology of depression itself or the treatment for depression that is the major driver of these findings. In the case–control study, we categorized the anti-depressants by their mechanism of action, but this categorization did not perfectly discriminate between the drugs that were associated with higher CDI risk from those that were not. It is widely appreciated that the mechanisms of action of many anti-depressants are complex, and all their effects (both intended effects and side-effects) are not fully characterized. Many of the anti-depressants work by altering serotonin levels and, in an animal model, Ghia and colleagues found that serotonin plays a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis. However, even anti-depressants within the same general class may have slightly different actions; for example, fluoxetine has a longer half-life than other SSRIs, and has a greater incidence of weight loss and stimulant effects. It is also possible that inter-patient variation in genes encoding for serotonin receptors may play a role in mediating responses to therapy. For example, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of older patients taking mirtazapine versus those taking paroxetine, side-effects were strongly associated with the HTR2A C/C genotype in those receiving paroxetine but there was no effect with mirtazapine, suggesting that underlying genetic markers can also affect the mechanism of action. In our investigation, the case-crossover design provided some insights regarding discrimination between effects due to the pathophysiology of depression itself versus those due to specific anti-depressants. In this study, personal history of depression was, by design, held constant because of the within-person comparison and therefore, any difference found in antidepressant use was not due to a history of depression. In effect, we measured drug use at different times (hospitalizations) in the same individual. In these analyses, we found that usage of most types of anti-depressants did not affect the likelihood of developing CDI. However, in a small group of patients, there was a significantly higher risk of CDI when taking both mirtazapine and trazodone together. The use of trazodone alone appeared protective, but when combined with mirtazapine, the risk was increased. Larger studies are necessary for confirmation of these findings. However, this only occurred in a minority of patients with CDI, which suggests that, for most patients, there are underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of depression that result in their increased risk of CDI, independent of antidepressant use.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^009f74b5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) medication side effects — common SSRI effects and management: The most common SSRI side effects include gastrointestinal distress, agitation, insomnia or somnolence, increased tendency to sweat, and sexual side effects (diminished libido and difficulty with erection and orgasm). A first step is to consider dose reduction to alleviate side effects without loss of therapeutic effect; when this is not possible, specific interventions may be considered. Gastrointestinal distress will usually disappear within 1–2 weeks at a constant dose; insomnia may respond to morning dosing, standard sleep hygiene measures, or a sleep-promoting agent; fatigue or sleepiness may respond to modest doses of modafinil; and sweating has been treated with low-dose anticholinergics such as benztropine, or with clonidine, cyproheptadine, or mirtazapine.

### Trazodone hydrochloride oral (Raldesy) [^a86e4f4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing reports, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release trazodone hydrochloride tablets. RALDESY should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. RALDESY is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering RALDESY to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including RALDESY) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone hydrochloride prolongs the QT/QTcinterval. The use of RALDESY Should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^34a2480e]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Dementia — agitation and psychosis management emphasizes first addressing reversible causes [I], using environmental measures if symptoms are not causing significant danger or distress [I], and considering behavioral measures [III]; if these are unsuccessful or behaviors are dangerous or distressing, judicious pharmacologic treatment may be used [II] with ongoing reevaluation and documentation [I]. Antipsychotic medications are recommended for psychosis [II] and agitation [II], can provide modest improvement in behavioral symptoms [I], and have evidence based mostly on 6–12-week trials with limited research beyond 12 weeks though clinical experience supports use [II]. Antipsychotics must be used with caution at the lowest effective dosage [I], with patients and families advised about potential benefits and risks, particularly mortality [I]; second-generation agents have a black box warning for increased mortality in elderly patients and first-generation agents carry at least a similar risk, with selection based on side-effect profile and patient characteristics [I]. Benzodiazepine benefit is modest but they may have a role for prominent anxiety [III] or on an as-needed basis for infrequent agitation or procedural sedation [II], with lorazepam and oxazepam preferable to longer half-life agents such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide [III]. Anticonvulsants, lithium, and beta-blockers have minimal evidence and are generally not recommended except after other treatments have failed [III]; trazodone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not well studied for non-depressive symptoms but may be appropriate for nonpsychotic patients with agitation, especially with mild agitation or prior antipsychotic sensitivity [III].

### Psychotropic drug treatment for agitated behaviour in dementia: what if the guideline prescribing recommendations are not sufficient? A qualitative study [^99fad6cf]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Physicians indicated that they sometimes want to make use of the side effect of a PD, for example; the libido-inhibiting side effect of some PDs to treat sexual disinhibition. Also, sedating properties of several PDs were often mentioned, sometimes as a desired effect and other times as an unwanted side effect of the PD. In addition, they stated to be cautious for paradoxical reactions of PDs.

G5-F5: 'Yes, on the other hand, you can… a person can also become extra anxious if you also sedate them so that they completely lose control [others nodding along]'.
Several times considerations regarding the receptor binding profiles were mentioned. Some physicians based their specific PD choices largely on these pharmacodynamics.

E9-F2: 'Yes, I don't use benzos any more. I only use 5HT2A antagonists. So, that's a low dose of quetiapine, mirtazapine, trazodone… erm… right'.

Other drug properties that were frequently mentioned were the different administration forms. Sometimes PD choice was based on the ability of the drug to administer it intramuscular, nasal or (sometimes hidden) as drops in a drink.

E6-F1: 'But as has also been said, if you really have escalations, then midazolam. Right, even if it's only because you have to inject it at some point'.
Some physicians said they chose a specific drug because they saw a benefit in the dosing interval. Also, it was considered how a drug should be dosed in order to see effect. Physicians considered whether it is feasible to carry out necessary checks related to certain medication, for example, blood tests when prescribing clozapine. In addition, they said to consider how quickly the drug should work and whether the drug should be long-acting or short-acting.

### Unintentional trazodone overdoses in children ≤ 6 years of age: data from poison center over a period of 16 years [^6d0fdbcb]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Trazodone is an atypical antidepressant with no established safety in children. Previous case reports showed no complications at doses 50-500mg in children. Our study objective is to characterize the clinical effects, dose-related toxicity, and establish triage dose for acute trazodone ingestions in children ≤ 6 years of age.

Methods

Cases with acute trazodone ingestions in children ≤ 6 years of age between 2000 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Data were analyzed for dose (mg/kg), clinical effects, management site, treatment, and outcome. Cases with coingestions, unknown outcome, or unknown dose were excluded.

Results

A total of 84 patients (mean age 26.7 months, 35 females, 49 males) were included. Of those, 52 (61.9%) had no clinical effects; 29 (34.5%) had minor effects (vomiting, dizziness, headache); and three (3.6%) had moderate effects (ataxia, slurred speech, priapism). No major effects or deaths were observed. Moderate effects were manifested at doses ≥ 6.9mg/kg. Priapism occurred in a 2-year-old child at a dose of 6.9mg/kg. Sixteen (19%) patients were managed at home and 68 (81%) patients were referred to a HCF. Among those referred to a HCF, three (4.4%) patients had moderate effects with ingested dose ≥ 6.9mg/kg. However, 27 (39.7%) patients of those referred to a HCF had an ingested dose < 6mg/kg and none of them manifested symptoms beyond minor effects. All referred patients had uneventful recovery and no sequela.

Conclusions

Children should be referred for further evaluation in acute unintentional trazodone ingestions with doses ≥ 6mg/kg.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^462c886b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — scope and evidence base are stated as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of an MDD episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and costs. This update adds new key questions on patient values and preferences and costs of interventions and incorporates network meta-analyses on initial treatment strategies, and it evaluates the comparative effectiveness between treatment options but does not evaluate the effectiveness of the included treatments compared with no treatment. For initial treatment, the systematic review limited pharmacologic treatment to SGAs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; and others such as bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone, and vortioxetine.

### Treatment of insomnia in hospitalized patients [^95275384]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the short-term management of insomnia in hospitalized patients and review patient assessment, nonpharmacologic treatment modalities, and selection of hypnotic medications.

Data Sources

Review articles and primary literature representative of current knowledge regarding the treatment of insomnia were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-January 2001). Search terms included insomnia (sleep initiation and maintenance disorders), benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and trazodone.

Data Synthesis

Literature regarding the management of insomnia in hospitalized patients is limited; therefore, data pertinent to the treatment of ambulatory patients must be extrapolated to the inpatient setting. When evaluating insomnia in hospitalized patients, it seems reasonable to obtain a thorough history and physical examination to identify potential underlying etiologies. Treatment of these underlying etiologies should be considered. When the use of a sedative-hypnotic agent is necessary, medication and dose selection should be based on the pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles of each agent. Patent-specific characteristics should also be considered to provide effective treatment while minimizing adverse effects.

Conclusions

Nonpharmacologic approaches to the treatment of insomnia should be considered for hospitalized patients. When sedative-hypnotic medications must be administered, the pharmacokinetic profile of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, temazepam) makes them good first-line agents. Zaleplon and zolpidem are also attractive hypnotic agents; however, they are typically reserved for second-line therapy due to cost. Trazodone may be an alternative for patients unable to take benzodiazepines.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^5205ca86]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we characterised the aetiology of side effects in a sample of Australian adults who reported depression over their lifetime. Sexual dysfunction and weight gains are the most commonly reported side effects. Some side effects, including weight gain and sexual dysfunction, showed clear differential sex-specific prevalence. We used clustering and structural equation modelling to test for co-occurrence and drug-class specificity of the side effects. We observed that side effects significantly co-occurred across medications, suggesting shared pharmacological or genetic factors underlie their aetiology. As such, these reported side effects may be manifestations of depression severity, persistence, recurrence or non-response to treatment or its comorbidities. We employed PRS to test whether these shared factors had a genetic component. Depression PRS were associated with most of the side effects studied, strongly suggesting that a depression severity factor underpins reporting of some side effects. Furthermore, trait-specific PRS, such as BMI, were predictive of related side effects such as weight gain. Altogether, our results suggest that drug exposure alone does not explain the occurrence of side effects, and a combination of specific and non-specific factors underlie their aetiology. Future studies on the genetic aetiology (e.g. performing well-powered GWAS) of adverse side effects will enable further insights into their underpinnings as well as the possibility of genetically driven risk stratification and adverse side effect prophylaxis strategies.

### Sequential drug treatment algorithm for agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed dementia [^69cf5060]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Drugs included for PRN use – evidence and rationale

While the above sections describes steps the panel endorsed for sequential treatment of agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's and mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia, it was recognized that at times the regular treatments cannot offer adequate protection from the impact of these symptoms. Accordingly, the algorithm allows for the possibility of supplementing medication given in the main sequence with drugs to be given on a PRN basis. The main drug selected for this purpose was trazodone, with use of lorazepam considered acceptable in certain circumstances.

PRN drug 1: trazodone

Trazodone (NbN: serotonin receptor antagonist and receptor agonist) is an effective antidepressant. Although it was developed and entered the market concurrently to tricyclic agents such as clomipramine, desipramine, and nortriptyline, it differs markedly from these drugs in its mechanism of action and receptor binding profile. Its main antidepressant action is thought to be through direct blockade of certain serotonin receptors while weak serotonin reuptake inhibition and receptor agonism are adjunctive effects. It lacks affinity for cholinergic receptors (thereby avoiding many of the unwanted side effects associated with tricyclics) but does produce a strong histaminergic effect which directly promotes sedation. There is some evidence to suggest that this sedating effect may be responsible for reducing irritability and agitation although this evidence was deemed too limited in a Cochrane review to merit recommendation for routine use. Still, given this limited evidence and more than 20 years of experience with the use of trazodone to promote sedation in patients with dementia and its generally good tolerability, trazodone was selected as the PRN drug of choice.

PRN drug 2: lorazepam

Benzodiazepines (NbN: positive allosteric modulators, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, benzodiazepine site) have been widely used as anxiolytic and sedative/hypnotic agents since their introduction 50 years ago. However, they have been associated with falls and fractures, and acute cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly. Benzodiazepines are also associated with tolerance and addiction. For these reasons the panel chose not to recommend benzodiazepines in the sequence of regular treatments. Nevertheless, it concluded that occasional use of the benzodiazepine lorazepam as a PRN drug was acceptable in cases of extreme agitation or aggression where behavioural interventions and trazodone are ineffective, or when brief stressful circumstances might exacerbate or induce agitation and aggression, for example, medical tests or dental procedures.

### Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^e41a7ca7]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

Potential adverse events from study interventions

Adverse Effects from CBT-I: The risk classification for this arm is "not greater than minimal." The greatest risk with CBT-I is discomfort/fatigue associated with restricting time in bed (including reducing daytime napping); these symptoms are usually temporary but will be monitored closely given their overlap with post-dialysis symptoms. Additional potential risks include breach of confidentiality which is inherent to any telehealth intervention regardless of the participant's location.
Adverse Effects from Trazodone:

With drug-drug interaction trazodone could prolong QTc interval on the EKG
Side effects (> 5%) reported more frequently than with placebo are (i) drowsiness; (ii) nervousness; (iii) dizziness; (iv) fatigue; (v) dry mouth; (vi) nausea; and (vii) vomiting
Priapism is another possible but extremely rare side effect

3 Psychological discomfort from completing patient-reported scales
4 Loss of patient confidentiality

Anticipated adverse events in the hemodialysis population

Patients undergoing HD experience many adverse events from their underlying health, co-existing illnesses, and concomitant medications. These adverse events include: (1) death; (2) fluid overload; (3) congestive heart failure; (4) vascular access events, such as thrombosis or infection or dysfunction; (5) atherosclerotic cardiovascular events; (6) infections, such as pneumonia; and (6) laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Monitoring for adverse events

The participants will be monitored for the occurrence of adverse events as:
The informed consent document will provide the name of a study staff person with a phone number to be contacted in the case of an emergency or if an adverse event occurred outside the time frame of study visits;
Study staff will evaluate the participants 5–6 times during the 6-week treatment period either via tele-health, telephone, or in-person; and.
Participants will be withdrawn from treatment if they experience a serious adverse event directly attributable to the study intervention and, in the opinion of the site investigator, if the treatment cannot be safely reinstituted.

### Adverse effects of pharmacologic treatments of major depression in older adults [^3e23eba4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess adverse effects of pharmacologic antidepressants for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults 65years of age or older.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Specialist or generalist outpatient setting, rehabilitation facility, and nursing facilities.

Participants

Persons 65years and older with MDD.

Intervention

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, vilazodone, or vortioxetine compared with another antidepressant, placebo, or nonpharmacologic therapy.

Measurements

Adverse events, arrhythmias, cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, hospitalization, mortality, QTc prolongation, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Results

Nineteen randomized controlled trials and two observational studies were included. Most studies evaluated treatment of the acute phase (< 12wk) of MDD of moderate severity. SSRIs led to a statistically similar frequency of overall adverse events vs placebo (moderate strength of evidence [SOE]), but SNRIs caused more overall adverse events vs placebo (high SOE) during the acute treatment phase. Both SSRIs and SNRIs led to more study withdrawals due to adverse events vs placebo (SSRIs low SOE; SNRIs moderate SOE). Duloxetine led to a more falls vs placebo (moderate SOE) during 24weeks of acute and continuation treatment of MDD.

Conclusion

In patients 65years of age or older with MDD, treatment of the acute phase of MDD with SNRIs, but not SSRIs, was associated with a statistically greater number of overall adverse events vs placebo. SSRIs and SNRIs led to a greater number of study withdrawals due to adverse events vs placebo. Duloxetine increased the risk of falls that as an outcome was underreported in the literature. Few studies examined head-to-head comparisons, most trials were not powered to evaluate adverse events, and results of observational studies may be confounded. Comparative long-term studies reporting specific adverse events are needed to inform clinical decision making regarding choice of antidepressants in this population.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^7125f356]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, AMED, the UK National Research Register, and PSYNDEX from the date of their inception to Jan 8, 2016, with no language restrictions. We used the search terms "depress" OR "dysthymi" OR "adjustment disorder" OR "mood disorder" OR "affective disorder" OR "affective symptoms" combined with a list of all included antidepressants.

We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with placebo or another active antidepressant as oral monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults (≥ 18 years old and of both sexes) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10). We considered only double-blind trials because we included placebo in the network meta-analysis, and because this study design increases methodological rigour by minimising performance and ascertainment biases. Additionally, we included all second-generation antidepressants approved by the regulatory agencies in the USA, Europe, or Japan: agomelatine, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine. To inform clinical practice globally, we selected the two tricyclics (amitriptyline and clomipramine) included in the). We also included trazodone and nefazodone, because of their distinct effect and tolerability profiles. Additionally, we included trials that allowed rescue medications so long as they were equally provided among the randomised groups. We included data only for drugs within the therapeutic range (appendix pp 133, 134). Finally, we excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^286cbbb3]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

SSRIs are generally prescribed as first-line agents due to their safety profile, evident since clinical studies from the 1980s onwards, for individuals with multiple comorbidities –. Moreover, as they are better tolerated than older agents, this results in more effective long-term management. While we observed specific instances where side effects were more prevalent across other antidepressant types, we did not find a lower prevalence for any side effect nor a higher prevalence of no side effects for SSRIs. This might be explained by the fact that non-specific factors (i.e. regardless of medication class) seemed to underlie the self-reporting of side effects.

Side effects co-occurred across all antidepressants assessed despite their variable modes of action and metabolism. Participants who reported a side effect for one medication were more likely to report that same side effect for other medications. This strongly suggests the existence of common non-specific factors, which are potentially a mixture of shared pharmacological and genetic factors underlying their aetiology. Our structural equation modelling analyses suggested that for some side effects, a common factor model would be preferred over models considering the drug classes.

The evidence for lack of drug-class factors was not equally strong for all side effects. For example, sweating showed the best fit to a model containing an SNRI factor along with the common factor. This is consistent with the higher prevalence of sweating reported for SNRIs compared to other drugs, which would already imply an SNRI-specific factor increasing its prevalence. For some side effects, common factors are further supported by the fact that they are widely reported from other types of medications; for example, weight gain is a common side effect not only for antidepressants but also for antipsychotics, antihyperglycemics, antihypertensives and corticosteroids. The nature of these common factors is complex and might include a mixture of a nocebo effect, shared metabolism, common environmental and genetic factors.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^f5de73f1]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Side effects co-occur across medications

For each antidepressant taken, participants reported whether or not they had experienced specific side effects. Some individuals had taken more than one antidepressant. Thus, several subsets of participants with overlapping data for different antidepressants were available. This overlap enabled us to assess whether the same side effects occur independently across different antidepressants or whether they co-occur (covary) across medications. We identified high correlations for the same side effects across medications (within side effect median correlation = 0.57, within medication median correlation = across side effect median correlation = 0.27 see Supplementary Fig. 3). A clustering analysis based on these correlations visually grouped these variables by side effect rather than antidepressant or medication class (Fig. 2). Overall, these results would suggest that antidepressant side effects co-occur in the same people regardless of the medication of choice or their class, which would be consistent with the existence of a set of general non-specific (i.e. independent of drug mode of action) factors partly underlying their aetiology. Structural equation models were used to compare a bifactor model with common and drug-class factors against reduced models, including only specific drug classes or no drug class (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Our results suggested that the common factor captured a high proportion of the covariance across medications. A single common factor model was preferred over the SSRI, SNRI, or the full model for some side effects. However, we identified evidence for medication-class-specific effects for other side effects. For example, sweating, insomnia, suicide thoughts, and suicide attempts showed evidence of an SNRI-specific factor and vomits nausea, and drowsiness showed evidence of an SSRI-specific factor. In contrast, dizziness and constipation showed evidence for both factors over and above a general factor (Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 2).

### Hepatotoxicity after short-term trazodone therapy [^c81af914]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severe hepatotoxicity from a four-day course of trazodone in a patient being treated according to protocol in a detoxification center.

Case Summary

A 46-year-old HIV-positive man with a past medical history of intravenous drug abuse and hepatitis C, who was well controlled with HIV medications, was admitted for cocaine withdrawal. The patient was started on a standard protocol at the detoxification center with methadone 50 mg/d, clonidine 0.1 mg twice daily for four days, and trazodone 200 mg/d for four days. Laboratory results showed acute hepatitis and cholestasis five days following admission. Trazodone and clonidine were discontinued at that time. His methadone and HIV regimens remained unchanged. Liver function test results were greatly improved 10 days after trazodone and clonidine discontinuation.

Discussion

This is the first case report of trazodone-induced liver damage after only a few days of therapy. Previous reports describe hepatitis developing after weeks to months of trazodone therapy. All comorbidities thought to affect the described laboratory abnormalities were ruled out as a cause by a hepatologist. The observation of the sudden rise and fall of liver enzymes is characteristic of a drug reaction in the absence of trauma and severe shock.

Conclusions

Due to the temporal relationship of the introduction and withdrawal of trazodone in the medication regimen and the elevations in liver enzymes, we conclude that this patient experienced acute hepatitis induced by trazodone 200 mg/d therapy for four days. The findings of this case warrant caution and closer monitoring in a patient with multiple risk factors for liver damage.

Overdose evaluation for QT-prolonging drugs — emergency department care: "The risk for TdP should be evaluated in any patient who presents to the emergency department with an overdose of a QT-prolonging drug," and because the ingested drug(s) may be unclear, "the ECG of all drug overdose victims should be assessed for signs of prolonged QT, QT-U distortion, and other signs of impending TdP." Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline "can cause TdP, although the incidence is not well established" and sodium channel blocker toxicity may produce other arrhythmias. Beyond tricyclics, "TdP has been reported in patients with overdoses" of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors "such as citalopram," and "trazodone" has "also been implicated," and "both" typical and atypical antipsychotics had a "similar dose-related increased risk of sudden cardiac death compared with matched nonusers."
