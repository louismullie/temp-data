## Question

What is the diagnosis for pregnancy test that is negative as patient initially tested postive but is now mehative

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the likely diagnosis when a pregnancy test was initially positive and is now negative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key differentials for discordant hCG results, including early pregnancy loss, initial false-positive, and subsequent false-negative. Then, I should review serial quantitative hCG kinetics and ultrasound thresholds. Next, I will consider assay interferences and the hook effect. After that, I must not forget to evaluate for ectopic pregnancy despite negative tests when symptoms warrant. Finally, I will outline a confirmatory workup and targeted management based on the most likely diagnosis while integrating guideline-based follow-up and safety nets.

> Let me first interpret the clinical scenario carefully: a conversion from positive to negative pregnancy testing implies either loss of hCG production due to very early pregnancy failure, an initial false-positive that subsequently cleared, or a later false-negative due to analytic limitations such as low hCG near detection thresholds or a hook effect, so I should correlate with timing, symptoms, and risk factors before concluding anything definitive [^111VneQh] [^117WL1B7] [^113DQBHK] [^1118v3KR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the most common explanation here is a very early miscarriage, often termed a chemical pregnancy, especially if bleeding or cramping followed the initial positive test, with epidemiology showing early pregnancy loss in 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies and a predominance in the first trimester due to chromosomal abnormalities, which aligns with a pattern of an initial rise and then decline in hCG after implantation failure [^111VneQh].

> I need to check the expected hCG dynamics to support early pregnancy loss: when initial quantitative hCG is low, expected declines range roughly 12–24% at 48 hours and 34–68% at 7 days, so documenting a falling trend on serial serum testing would confirm this trajectory and help distinguish it from a plateau or slow rise pattern that could suggest ectopic pregnancy or from an analytic artifact that might falsely read negative [^111Zz3sz] [^1143nGXz].

> Wait, let me verify potential causes of an initial false-positive result, because if the first test was wrong, the subsequent negative might be the true baseline: heterophilic antibodies, pituitary hCG, cross-reactivity with LH, or anti-animal antibodies can yield spurious positives on some serum assays, and typical clues include relatively low serum hCG values, negative urine hCG, lack of expected serial change, and nonparallelism on serial dilutions; repeating testing with an alternate assay and using urine testing promptly can resolve the discrepancy [^111Uqy19] [^113DQBHK] [^1118v3KR] [^115mNjtN].

> But wait, what if the subsequent negative test is the erroneous one; I should consider a false-negative due to early gestational age below assay sensitivity, variant hCG forms later in pregnancy that some assays miss, or the high-dose hook effect at very elevated hCG concentrations as seen in molar pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic disease; if suspicion is high, instructing the lab to serially dilute the sample or using a different platform can unmask the true positivity [^114zkLvw] [^114Y4kWZ] [^117LAAnf] [^1178AV8V].

> I should confirm that ectopic pregnancy is not being overlooked, because symptoms can be disproportionate to low or even negative urine qualitative tests, and rare cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy have presented with negative urine testing; thus, in the presence of unilateral pain, syncope, or hemodynamic instability, immediate transvaginal ultrasound and surgical consultation should proceed irrespective of a single negative hCG result [^115iRgDd] [^114xv27n] [^116uyMXM].

> Next, I should review a confirmatory diagnostic approach: obtain a baseline quantitative serum hCG and repeat in 48 hours to assess the trend, then add transvaginal ultrasound once the hCG reaches the discriminatory zone of roughly 1,500–3,000 mIU/mL to locate the pregnancy; if results remain discordant with the clinical picture, request serial dilutions and an alternate assay to exclude interference and the hook effect before committing to treatment decisions [^1119Cf46] [^1143nGXz] [^113DQBHK] [^1118v3KR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the expected 48-hour rise in a viable pregnancy must exceed 53% universally, but I should correct that based on the initial hCG level; ACOG-consistent data indicate that the minimal acceptable rise can be as low as about 35% over 48 hours when starting levels are higher, so I need to interpret the slope in the context of starting concentration and use clinical judgment rather than a single rigid cutoff [^1119Cf46] [^1143nGXz].

> I will now examine the clinical context to strengthen the interpretation: bleeding, cramping, and passage of tissue increase the likelihood of early pregnancy loss, while advanced maternal age and history of prior loss raise baseline risk; when clinical findings and lab results do not align, pathology guidance emphasizes verifying results and considering assay limitations before acting, which is exactly the type of cross-checking I need here [^111VneQh] [^114kMv3Z] [^117WL1B7] [^113DQBHK].

> Let me think about a practical management plan if early pregnancy loss is confirmed by declining serial hCG: expectant management with follow-up of hCG to zero is appropriate for most stable patients, reserving intervention for heavy bleeding, signs of infection, lack of resolution, or patient preference, and limiting ultrasound or additional hCG checks to ongoing concerns such as prolonged bleeding or amenorrhea as recommended by contemporary guidance [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify contingency steps if ectopic pregnancy remains a concern: a negative urine test should not reassure me if symptoms or risk factors are present, so I would prioritize urgent transvaginal ultrasound, obstetrics–gynecology consultation, and, if indicated, medical management with methotrexate guided by initial hCG level or surgical exploration based on stability and imaging, consistent with ACOG recommendations [^115iRgDd] [^113MMHeZ] [^116uyMXM].

> I need to ensure that suspected assay interference is handled correctly: I should request an alternate assay methodology, perform serial dilutions to assess for nonlinearity, consider using intact hCG–specific reagents when appropriate, and document the risk of false results in the chart, all of which reduce misclassification and prevent unnecessary or harmful interventions [^113DQBHK] [^1118v3KR] [^114S2FXF].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure nothing is missed: the pattern of initially positive followed by negative pregnancy testing most commonly reflects a chemical pregnancy with appropriate decline on serial quantitative hCG, but I must actively exclude an initial false-positive from interfering antibodies, a later false-negative from hook effect or variant hCG, and ectopic pregnancy that can present with low or negative qualitative results, with the definitive diagnosis resting on serial quantitative hCG trends, ultrasound correlation, and the clinical picture rather than any single test alone [^111VneQh] [^111Zz3sz] [^114Y4kWZ] [^117LAAnf] [^115iRgDd] [^1119Cf46] [^113DQBHK] [^1118v3KR].

The most likely diagnosis for a patient who initially had a positive pregnancy test but now has a negative result is **early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)** [^111VneQh], defined as a very early miscarriage before 5 weeks' gestation, often detected only by transient hCG rise [^1143nGXz]. Alternative explanations include **false-positive initial test** (e.g. assay interference, heterophilic antibodies) [^111Uqy19], **false-negative follow-up test** (e.g. hook effect [^114zkLvw], dilute urine) [^117LAAnf], or **resolved ectopic pregnancy** [^1143nGXz] [^113MMHeZ]. Confirm the diagnosis with serial quantitative serum hCG and transvaginal ultrasound if indicated; if hCG falls to zero without ultrasound evidence of pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy is confirmed [^116uyMXM].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)

- **Definition**: Spontaneous loss before 13 weeks, often before 5 weeks, detected only by transient hCG rise [^111VneQh].
- **Pathophysiology**: Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause [^111VneQh].
- **Clinical course**: Initial positive test followed by rapid hCG decline and negative test within days to a week [^111Zz3sz].

---

### False-positive initial pregnancy test

- **Assay interference**: Heterophilic antibodies or nonactive hCG forms can cause false positives [^111Uqy19].
- **Medications**: Promethazine and others may cause false positives [^111YnCd9].
- **Laboratory error**: Rare but possible [^113DQBHK].

---

### False-negative follow-up pregnancy test

- **Hook effect**: Very high hCG can cause false negatives [^114zkLvw] [^114Y4kWZ].
- **Dilute urine**: Excess fluid intake or diuretics can lower hCG below detection [^114zkLvw].
- **Improper testing**: User error or expired tests [^117LAAnf].

---

### Resolved ectopic pregnancy

An ectopic pregnancy that resolves spontaneously, characterized by an initial positive test with a subsequent negative result as hCG declines [^1143nGXz]. Clinical course: The test becomes negative as hCG falls [^116uyMXM].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm initial positive result

Review documentation to verify the initial positive result and method used, and **repeat testing** with a quantitative serum hCG to confirm current status [^117WL1B7].

---

### Step 2: serial quantitative serum hCG measurements

Serial hCG should be measured every 48 hours [^1143nGXz] to assess the trend. Falling hCG to zero supports biochemical pregnancy; rising or plateauing hCG suggests ectopic or persistent trophoblastic tissue [^1119Cf46].

---

### Step 3: transvaginal ultrasound

If hCG is rising or plateauing, perform **transvaginal ultrasound** to localize the pregnancy. No intrauterine pregnancy with rising hCG suggests ectopic pregnancy [^113MMHeZ].

---

### Step 4: evaluate for assay interference

Consider **Heterophilic antibodies** if the initial positive was serum-based; use heterophile blocking agents or alternative assays [^111Uqy19] [^115mNjtN]. Repeat testing with a different assay or laboratory to confirm results [^113DQBHK].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)**: Provide **reassurance**, as most women have successful future pregnancies. No intervention is needed if **hCG returns to zero** and there are no retained products [^111VneQh].

- **False-positive initial test**: Explain **assay interference** or error; no pregnancy occurred. No further action is needed if the **negative result is confirmed** [^111Uqy19].

- **False-negative follow-up test**: Confirm with **serum hCG and ultrasound** if indicated. Explain the limitations of urine tests and the importance of **confirmatory testing** [^114zkLvw].

- **Resolved ectopic pregnancy**: Ensure **hCG returns to zero** and monitor symptoms [^113MMHeZ]. Discuss future pregnancy planning and the need for **early monitoring**.

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis for a patient with an initial positive pregnancy test followed by a negative result is **early pregnancy loss (biochemical pregnancy)**. Alternative explanations include a false-positive initial test, a false-negative follow-up test, or a resolved ectopic pregnancy. Confirm the diagnosis with serial quantitative serum hCG and transvaginal ultrasound when indicated [^111VneQh].

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### False-positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin results: Causes, characteristics, and recognition [^111Uqy19]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

False-positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin results are estimated to occur in 1 in 10³ to 1 in 10⁴ tests. Most of these false-positive results are due to interference by non-human chorionic gonadotropin substances, particularly human luteinizing hormone and anti-animal immunoglobulin antibodies, and the detection of pituitary human chorionic gonadotropin.

False-positive human chorionic gonadotropin measurements are characterized by:

- **Serum levels**: Generally < 1000 mIU/mL.
- **Urinalysis**: Absence of human chorionic gonadotropin.
- **Serial dilutions**: Nonparallelism of the human chorionic gonadotropin levels with the standard.
- **Clinical findings**: Results not consistent with clinical or operative findings.
- **Change over time**: Absence of a substantial change in serum levels over time or after therapy.
- **Alternative assays**: Negative result when an alternative type of human chorionic gonadotropin assay is used.

An algorithm is presented to aid in the recognition of false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin results in patients.

### False-negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin testing in the clinical laboratory [^114zkLvw]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays are used to detect pregnancy, and urine point-of-care tests are frequently used to triage patients. Under certain conditions, urine tests can fail to detect pregnancy, which can have serious consequences for patient management.

- **Objectives**: To understand the prevalence of different factors contributing to false-negative urinary hCG testing results at our institution.

- **Methods**: Clinical data for patients with negative urine hCG results and subsequent positive or equivocal serum hCG results within a 1-year period were reviewed.

- **Results**: Out of 9447 negative urine hCG results, 11 potential missed diagnoses were identified, with early gestational age as the most common factor, followed by β-core hook effects.

- **Conclusions**: Although false-negative urine hCG test results are rare, understanding the commonly encountered reasons for inaccurate testing results can help clinical centers develop strategies to minimize risk for patients.

### Acog practice bulletin no. 200: Early pregnancy loss [^111VneQh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy loss:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy loss is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks of gestation.

- **Pathophysiology**: The majority of early pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities, found in approximately 50–82% of cases. The most common are autosomal trisomies, particularly trisomy 15, 16, 21, and 22, along with triploidy, monosomy X, and structural rearrangements. These losses typically occur between 5 and 9 weeks of gestation. Immunologic factors, such as impaired regulatory T cell function or abnormal endometrial decidualization, can disrupt maternal tolerance of the fetus and contribute to early pregnancy loss. Infections including CMV, HIV, rubella, and malaria have also been implicated through direct placental infection, immune-mediated disruption, or maternal systemic illness.

- **Epidemiology**: Early pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with about 80% of losses taking place during the first trimester. The true incidence is likely underestimated, as many early miscarriages are not clinically diagnosed and may be misattributed to delayed or heavy menstrual bleeding.

- **Risk factors**: Advanced maternal age is a major nonmodifiable risk factor for early pregnancy loss, with risk increasing significantly after age 35 and reaching over 50% by age 45. Other maternal factors include a prior history of early pregnancy loss, adverse outcomes in previous pregnancies (such as preterm birth, stillbirth), and Black ethnicity.

### SPL drug information for pomalidomide [^115fKyjQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of pomalidomide PO (also known as Pomalyst) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to therapy initiation. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second test within 24 hours before therapy initiation. Tests should be conducted weekly during the first 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles.

Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy through abstinence from heterosexual sex or by using 2 forms of contraception. These precautions should begin 4 weeks prior to therapy initiation, continue during therapy, during dose interruptions, and for 4 weeks following therapy discontinuation. If pregnancy occurs, or if a female patient misses her period or experiences any abnormalities in menstrual bleeding, therapy must be discontinued immediately. These patients should be referred to a physician specializing in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

This drug is present in the semen of male patients. They must not donate semen or sperm, and must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females during therapy and for 28 days after therapy completion, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following therapy discontinuation to prevent their blood from being given to a pregnant female.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^115SebdW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

For other clinical studies not discussed in the four bullets above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical. If protocol‐scheduled visits are more than one month apart, then testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Additional tests may also be conducted if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or prior to a protocol‐required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated prior to pharmaceutical re‐administration when the administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for more than seven days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use, regardless of the reason for the disruption (e.g. temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, such as during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study).

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue at a minimum until plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels (i.e. after at least five terminal phase half‐lives) and any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in (i) cases of drugs with very short exposure times (e.g. imaging agents like contrast media) and/or (ii) if study participants remain in-house (e.g. in a Phase I unit during clinical trials).

### Coping with worry while waiting for diagnostic results: A qualitative study of the experiences of pregnant couples following a high-risk prenatal screening result [^111hSZLZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Many couples described how they turned to home and everyday life as a meaningful counterbalance to their high-risk status, expressing a renewed and humble awareness of all the good things they already had in their lives, such as amazing children, fulfilling lifestyles, and loving relationships:

"I tried to focus on my daughter and how blessed we are to have her", shared Cristina, 42 years old with one child.

Turning their focus away from statistics and uncertainty toward the blessings of everyday life highlighted everything that was not at risk and would persist beyond an abnormal test result. Choosing this perspective allowed the couples to create meaning and certainty in the midst of uncertainty, thus offering a positive counterbalance to worry.

Discussions about what to do in case of an abnormal test result were notably absent in the majority of the couples' accounts of waiting. When asked about this during interviews, they provided two main reasons. First, the majority of couples were certain they would terminate the pregnancy in the case of an abnormal result. Second, those who expressed uncertainty about termination preferred to postpone the final decision until the final result was available. This approach allowed the couples to continue and maintain a sense of a 'normal' pregnancy. Many couples described how they consciously employed an "innocent-till-proven-guilty" approach to deal with their worries about the fetus's health.

In summary, the couples coped with worry by using reassuring interpretations of the uncertain situation.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: Meta-analysis of cohort studies [^112HNY4h]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are the most common causes of consultation in early pregnancy. Thirty percent of women will experience pain or bleeding in their first trimester. These symptoms lead to anxiety and can be the first signs of a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in 10–20% of all recognized pregnancies, and the prevalence of ectopic pregnancies in the United Kingdom is 1.6%, which is raised to 3% in women with symptoms. Most women seeking medical advice have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to confirm a viable pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. However, even with expert use of transvaginal ultrasound, confirming if a pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine may not be possible in 8–31% of cases at the first visit. An observational study of pregnancies with inconclusive ultrasound results has shown that 50% spontaneously resolve with decreasing concentrations of β human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG), 27% are subsequently diagnosed as viable, and 14% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies. The high incidence of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in women with inconclusive ultrasound results warrants further tests to reach a diagnosis. Measurement of serum β-hCG can be useful, but often more than one β-hCG measurement is needed to make a diagnosis.

Serum progesterone has been proposed as a useful test to distinguish a viable pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Low progesterone values are associated with miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, both considered non-viable pregnancies.

### Acog practice bulletin No. 191: Tubal ectopic pregnancy [^113MMHeZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ectopic pregnancy, specifically with methotrexate, the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend choosing a methotrexate protocol guided by the initial hCG levels and a discussion with the patient about the benefits and risks of each approach. It is advised to prefer a single-dose protocol in patients with a relatively low initial hCG level or a plateau in hCG values. Consider using a two-dose regimen as an alternative to the single-dose regimen, particularly in patients with an initial high hCG value.

### Pathology consultation on human chorionic gonadotropin testing for pregnancy assessment [^117WL1B7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

To provide clarity on the use of qualitative and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests for the assessment of pregnancy, a case scenario and a brief review of the relevant literature describing clinical and analytical considerations regarding hCG testing are presented. In pregnancy, hCG is nearly always detectable in serum and urine within 16 days after ovulation. Serial hCG testing is valuable in the evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy. hCG assays vary in their analytical specificity, and qualitative tests may be less analytically sensitive than claimed. Erroneous hCG test results can occur for several reasons. hCG assays are reliable diagnostic tests for pregnancy assessment, but a clear understanding of their limitations is necessary for appropriate result interpretation.

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 223 [^116wGGhG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for thyroid disease in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining TSH as a first-line screening test to assess thyroid status if indicated.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1167h8LQ]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding Graves' disease, particularly concerning pregnancy planning, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a pregnancy test within 48 hours before radioactive iodine therapy in any female patient with childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing should be conducted, and a negative result must be verified before administering radioactive iodine.

### Society for Endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^111hJZdR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

In all infants with ambiguous genitalia and/or bilateral impalpable gonads, a first tier of investigations should be undertaken to define the sex chromosomes and delineate, by pelvic ultrasound, the internal genitalia and exclude life‐threatening congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) — the commonest cause of ambiguous genitalia of the newborn. This first tier should, therefore, also include plasma glucose, serum 17OH‐progesterone (17OHP), and serum electrolytes. Serum 17OHP is usually unreliable before the age of 36 hours, and in the salt‐losing form of CAH, serum electrolytes usually do not become abnormal before day 4 of life. The results of PCR or FISH analysis, using Y‐ and X‐specific markers, should be available within one working day, and the 17OHP results should be available within a maximum of two working days in all specialist DSD centres.

In situations where the level of suspicion of CAH is very high and the infant needs immediate steroid replacement therapy, further serum samples should be collected and stored before starting therapy. These should be of a sufficient volume to assess 17OHP, testosterone, androstenedione, and possibly renin activity or concentration, in that order of priority. At least one spot or 24-hour urine sample (at least 5 ml) for a urine steroid profile should be collected before starting therapy. The results of these initial investigations shall often dictate the second tier of investigations.

In an infant with impalpable gonads, a karyotype of 46, XX, a significantly elevated serum 17OHP, and the presence of a uterus makes congenital adrenal hyperplas

### Principles of screening [^116Cvfd4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially oriented procedures for progressively analyzing risk. Screening is broadly based and aimed at identifying those at high risk of a disease or condition. Diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively answer whether or not a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests — sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value — is necessary for proper utilization of screening tests.

### The complex interpretation and management of Zika virus test results [^112qjw2o]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Zika virus disease provides the latest example of a critical nexus between public health and clinical practice. Interpreting Zika virus test results is complicated by the absence of a single testing approach with superior validity across contexts and populations. Molecular tests are highly specific, variably sensitive, and have a short window period. Serologic tests identify antibodies against Zika virus and are more likely than molecular tests to cross-react with other related viruses, reducing specificity. The type of test performed and timing relative to possible Zika virus exposure depend on public health guidance, testing algorithms, test availability, and capacity.

Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments has changed throughout the course of the US epidemic based on prevalence, geography, and clinical concerns. Women with a low pretest probability of infection should be counseled against testing. Women with a high pretest probability of Zika virus infection should still receive enhanced prenatal monitoring and newborn evaluation, regardless of the test result. An appropriate interpretation of results depends on what tests are used, patient characteristics, and reasons for testing. Clinicians should take these factors into account in shared decision-making discussions with pregnant women about Zika virus testing.

### Gestational trophoblastic disease diagnosis delayed by the hook effect [^114Y4kWZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

A "hook effect" resulting from saturation of antibodies used in pregnancy tests can occur at human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels above 500,000 milliinternational units/mL, resulting in falsely negative values.

- **Case**: A 34-year-old woman, gravida 5 para 3, presented to the emergency department after heavy bleeding. An ultrasonogram revealed a uterine mass, the urine pregnancy test result was negative, and the endometrial biopsy was inconclusive. The patient was discharged and presented 10 days later with rebleeding. The urine pregnancy test result was again negative, but serum hCG was 581 milliinternational units/mL. Serial dilution revealed an actual hCG higher than 5 million milliinternational units/mL. She was diagnosed with gestational trophoblastic disease.

- **Conclusion**: Awareness of the risk of a false-negative pregnancy test result when hCG levels are extremely high may prevent delayed diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease.

### Eshre guideline: recurrent pregnancy loss [^114KokZt]. Human Reproduction Open (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent pregnancy loss, specifically in relation to genetic testing of products of conception, the 2018 ESHRE guidelines recommend not to perform routine genetic analysis of pregnancy tissue. However, it is advised to consider obtaining it for explanatory purposes. For genetic analysis of the pregnancy tissue, use array-based comparative genomic hybridization, which minimizes maternal contamination.

### ESHRE guideline: Recurrent pregnancy loss [^112CvsFb]. Human Reproduction Open (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for recurrent pregnancy loss, specifically in relation to immunological evaluation, the ESHRE 2018 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend NK cell testing of either peripheral blood or endometrial tissue in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.

### High rates of persistent and recurrent chlamydia in pregnant women after treatment with azithromycin [^115NDHif]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Low credibility.

There are four explanations commonly cited for repeat positive chlamydia tests after treatment: (1) reinfection, (2) medication non-adherence, (3) false-positive NAAT result, and (4) treatment failure. Although we cannot distinguish among these possibilities given our retrospective design, we discuss the likelihood of each. The prevalence of chlamydia in pregnancy in our cohort was 10% overall, and 9% of women with repeat testing had reinfection. We suspect that most cases of repeat positivity were caused by reinfection.

This study and others emphasize the urgent need to improve access to expedited partner therapy (EPT) for sex partners of pregnant women with chlamydia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended partner therapy for pregnant women with chlamydia when sex partners are unable or unwilling to seek medical care since 2018. Concomitant patient-partner antibiotic therapy reduced recurrent sexually transmitted infections (STI) in pregnancy in an observational cohort study by Mmeje et al. (0% recurrence in the intervention arm vs. 18% in the standard referral arm). Alabama is one of only five states in the United States where EPT is "potentially allowable" instead of "permissible". This restriction may contribute to the high rates of repeat positive testing that we observed.

Medication non-adherence may have explained some of our study findings. Non-adherence to electronically prescribed medication is reported, but young women and pregnant women generally have higher rates of adherence, and single-dose oral azithromycin is a simple regimen.

### Zenatane [^114ypbyT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Menstrual cycle considerations**: For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be conducted during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy, and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after using two forms of contraception for one month.

- **Pregnancy testing protocol**: A negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory is required before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, before the patient receives each prescription.

- **Contraception requirements**: Patients must select and commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence. Exceptions apply if the patient has undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated monthly.

### Claravis [^113ZrSQD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be conducted during the first five days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy. This should occur after the patient has utilized two forms of contraception for one month.

- **For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive form that precludes withdrawal bleeding**: The second pregnancy test must be performed immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. The patient must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

- **Contraception selection and use**: The patient has selected and committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence. This involves not having any sexual contact with a partner that could result in pregnancy, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be postmenopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to the initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy, and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated monthly.

### Defining the curve when initial levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in patients with spontaneous abortions are low [^111Zz3sz]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Lower initial hCG concentrations are associated with slower rates of decline in spontaneous abortions. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the expected rates of hCG decline in patients presenting with very low initial hCG levels and who ultimately were confirmed to have spontaneous abortions. When initial levels lie between 50 and 500 mIU/mL, the slowest expected percentage decline ranges from 12% to 24% in 2 days and from 34% to 68% in 7 days.

### ACOG. Committee opinion: Number 278, November 2002. Avoiding inappropriate clinical decisions based on false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin test results [^113DQBHK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinically significant false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test results are rare. However, some individuals have circulating factors in their serum, such as heterophilic antibodies or nonactive forms of hCG, that interact with the hCG antibody and cause unusual or unexpected test results. False-positive and false-negative test results can occur with any specimen, and caution should be exercised when clinical findings and laboratory results are discordant.

Methods to rule out the presence of interfering substances include using a urine test, rerunning the assay with serial dilutions of serum, preabsorbing serum, and using another assay. Physicians must decide whether the risks of waiting for confirmation of results outweigh the risks of failing to take immediate medical action. Patients should be notified if they are at risk for false-positive hCG test results, and this information should be included in the patient's medical record.

### Qualitative investigation of the factors that generate ambivalent feelings in women who give birth after receiving negative results from non-invasive prenatal testing [^113hTScK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Ambivalent feeling comprised five subcategories: "Options in the case of a positive result", "Guilt towards the child", "Criticisms on NIPT from others", "Denial of disabled people", and "How to tell the child".

Some respondents stated their decision regarding the course of action in the event of a positive NIPT result, whereas others expressed difficulty stating their decision about continuing or terminating their pregnancy. In both cases, respondents seemed agonized over their decision in the case of positive results.

"I had decided that if the results came out positive, I would not give birth to the baby. However, even though I now know that the results were negative, I haven't told my own parents that I took the test. At the same time that I feel negative about the idea that we were picking and choosing who to keep if the results were positive, I also blame myself for my lack of confidence in raising the child, even though it is because I have health problems myself".

Some women seemed to have a sense of guilt towards the child after giving birth and parenting the child, knowing that they were trying to decide the life of the child.

"I don't think I would have taken the test if I were younger. Some people criticize that people take the test too casually because it places very little stress on the mother or child. But I believe that anybody who chose to take the test did so after putting a lot of thought into it. Looking into my child's face, sometimes I remember".

### Postdates and antenatal testing [^112Capdj]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The standard definition of a prolonged pregnancy is 42 completed weeks of gestation. The incidence of prolonged pregnancy varies depending on the criteria used to define gestational age at birth. It is estimated that 4 to 19% of pregnancies reach or exceed 42 weeks of gestation. Several studies utilizing large computerized databases of well-dated pregnancies have provided insights into the incidence and nature of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as increased fetal and neonatal mortality, as well as increased fetal and maternal morbidity in prolonged pregnancy. Fetal surveillance may be employed to monitor prolonged pregnancies while awaiting the onset of spontaneous labor. This article reviews the different methodologies and protocols for fetal surveillance in prolonged pregnancies.

On the one hand, false-positive tests commonly lead to unnecessary interventions that are potentially hazardous to the gravida. On the other hand, at the time of writing, no program of fetal testing has been shown to completely eliminate the risk of stillbirth.

- **Serum potassium**: Evaluate potassium levels to detect and manage imbalances.
- **Fasting blood glucose**: Check glucose levels to rule out gestational diabetes.
- **Urinalysis**: Perform this test to identify any renal anomalies or proteinuria.

### Transient false-positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin in septic shock [^116gc5mv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Point-of-care testing for urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) allows rapid diagnosis of pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders at the bedside. Urine hCG test kits use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology and incorporate two types of monoclonal antibody in a sandwich structure. There have been case reports in a variety of disease states reporting interference with this method, leading to false-positive results. We describe the case of a nonpregnant female presenting to the emergency department with septic shock secondary to severe colitis. Three sequential urine tests using the Clearview hCG test kit (Alere Limited, Stockport, United Kingdom) yielded positive results, whereas quantitative serum analysis was negative for hCG. This initial test result reverted to a true-negative result after 48 hours, suggesting the transient passage of an interferent into the urine at the time of initial testing. This may have been a molecule produced as part of the host inflammatory response or from bacterial synthesis of an interferent with hCG-like antigenic structure. It is important that clinicians are aware of the mechanisms and limitations of urine hCG testing and maintain a low threshold to undertake early serum hCG testing to confirm diagnosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, specifically in relation to hCG, the 2019 guidelines of the AAFP recommend considering the initial β-hCG level when monitoring the rate of β-hCG increase in early pregnancy. In viable intrauterine pregnancies with initial β-hCG levels of 3,000 mIU/mL, it is important to recognize a 99% probability that the β-hCG level will increase by at least 49%, 40%, and 33% over 48 hours, respectively.

### Pregnancies with 'double-positive' multiple marker screening results: a population-based study in Ontario, Canada [^116JR7YU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

In the analytic sample, pregnant individuals in the group of 374 pregnancies with double-positive results were older than those in the group of 428,466 individuals with screen-negative results (mean age at estimated date of delivery of 35.5 years versus 31.2 years, respectively), and they were also less likely to be nulliparous (22.9% versus 46.4%). In pregnancies with double-positive results, 44.1% (152/345) had a multiple marker screening result for which the fetal nuchal translucency measurement was below the threshold of 3.5 mm, compared to 99.96% (396,017/396,186) for pregnancies in the group with screen-negative results.

- **Characteristics of the study population**: EDD, estimated date of delivery; SD, standard deviation; IVF, in vitro fertilization; ART, assisted reproductive technology.

a. Pregnancies with double-positive results include pregnancies with a double-positive multiple marker screening result where trisomies 21 and 18 were excluded by cytogenetic testing or a low-risk cfDNA screening result.

b. Pregnancies with screen-negative results include pregnancies with a screen-negative multiple marker screening result in which pregnancies with a diagnosis of full, partial, or mosaic trisomy 21 or 18 were excluded.

c. Missing data for more than 10.0% of the pregnancies.

The biomarker patterns varied in the two groups and are described in Supplemental Table 6: in pregnancies with double-positive results, the nuchal translucency measurement, and second trimester total human chorionic gonadotropin and inhibin A were increased, while all other biomarkers were…

### "Hook-like effect" causes false-negative point-of-care urine pregnancy testing in emergency patients [^117LAAnf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Failure to detect pregnancy in the emergency department (ED) can have important consequences. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (uhCG) point-of-care (POC) assays are valued for rapidly detecting early pregnancy with high sensitivity. However, under certain conditions, POC uhCG tests can fail to detect pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: In investigating a series of late first-trimester false-negative pregnancy tests in our ED, a novel and distinct causative phenomenon was recently elucidated at our institution. We discuss uhCG POC tests, review our false-negative rate, and describe mechanisms for false negatives and potential remedies.

- **Discussion**: The false-negative POC uhCG rate is very low, but in the setting of a large volume of tests, the numbers are worth consideration. In positive uhCG POC tests, free and fixed antibodies bind hCG to form a "sandwich"; hCG is present in several variant forms that change in their concentrations at different stages of pregnancy. When in excess, intact hCG can saturate the antibodies, preventing sandwich formation (hook effect phenomenon). Some assays may include an antibody that does not recognize certain variants present in later stages of pregnancy. When this variant is in excess, it can bind one antibody avidly and the other not at all, resulting in a false-negative test (hook-like phenomenon). In both situations, dilution is key to an accurate test.

- **Conclusions**: Manufacturers should consider that uhCG tests are routinely used at many stages of pregnancy. Characterizing uhCG variants recognized by their tests and eliminating lot-to-lot variability is essential in minimizing false-negative results.

### Zenatane [^111TbMnc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Laboratory tests**: Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Zenatane prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Zenatane. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory, with an interval of at least 19 days between the two tests.

- **For patients with regular menstrual cycles**: The second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Zenatane therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month.

- **For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding**: The second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Zenatane therapy, following the use of two forms of contraception for one month.

Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. This test must be repeated each month in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to patients who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

### Management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 76 [^113STRfF]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, particularly concerning the management of euthyroid antibody positivity, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend offering thyroid function test measurements in the first trimester. This should ideally occur at the first contact with a healthcare professional, including during primary care booking, and again at 20 weeks of pregnancy. This recommendation applies to patients already known to be positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies but euthyroid, in order to detect the development of hypothyroidism.

### Reducing false-positive pregnancy test results in patients with cancer [^114S2FXF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the use of a laboratory test specific for intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) would reduce the number of false-positive pregnancy test results.

- **Methods**: From October 21, 2014, to January 20, 2015, and April 1, 2015, to June 2, 2015, all serum samples sent for pregnancy screening at a large cancer center with a value of 5 milli-international units/mL or greater total β-hCG were frozen, stored, and then retested using intact hCG reagent. We compared the accuracy of total β-hCG and intact hCG results for the diagnosis of clinically confirmed pregnancy. A negative test was defined as 14 milli-international units/mL or less, our institutional cutoff. We also assessed a cutoff of less than 5 milli-international units/mL, a historical cutoff to rule out pregnancy.

- **Results**: We performed intact hCG testing on 64 patient samples, of which 34 had originally resulted positive when tested for total β-hCG. These included 21 cases of clinically confirmed pregnancy and 13 false-positive cases. No women were pregnant when their intact hCG concentration was 14 milli-international units/mL or less, and all pregnancies were detected at and above this concentration. Intact hCG reduced the number of false-positive pregnancy test results from 13 to 1, a 92% reduction (95% CI 64–99%), corresponding to a reduction in the false-positive rate from 38% (95% CI 22–56%) to 3% (95% CI 1–15%).

- **Conclusion**: The use of intact hCG reagent in patients with cancer reduces the rate of false-positive pregnancy test results without increasing the rate of false-negative results.

### Reproductive factors and subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with prior pregnancy loss [^114kMv3Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

At present, individualized interventions can be given to patients with a clear etiology of pregnancy loss to improve subsequent pregnancy outcomes; however, the reproductive status of the patient cannot be changed. This study aimed to investigate the association between female reproductive status and subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with prior pregnancy loss (PL).

- **Methods**: A prospective, dynamic population cohort study was conducted at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University. From September 2019 to February 2022, a total of 1,955 women with at least one previous PL were enrolled. Maternal reproductive status and subsequent reproductive outcomes were recorded through an electronic medical record system and follow-up. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reproductive status and the risk of subsequent reproductive outcomes.

- **Results**: Among all patients, the rates of subsequent infertility, early PL, late PL, and live birth were 20.82%, 24.33%, 1.69%, and 50.77%, respectively. In logistic regression, we found that age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.13) and previous cesarean delivery history (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.27–4.76) were risk factors for subsequent infertility in patients with PL. Age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), age at first pregnancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10), BMI (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11), previous PL numbers (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.57), and absence of pre-pregnancy intervention (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.35–2.24) were risk factors for non-live birth.

### Vaccine effectiveness against mild and severe covid-19 in pregnant individuals and their infants in England: Test negative case-control study [^114DJpr5]. BMJ Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Our large study investigated the effectiveness of maternal COVID-19 vaccines on both maternal and infant health. The test negative case-control design has been well validated and used for the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines. One of the key strengths of our study is that this approach helps in dealing with unmeasured confounders related to differences in health-seeking behaviors and infectious disease exposure between individuals who are vaccinated and those who are not vaccinated.

The study had several limitations. We found some apparent protection in the early period after vaccination before a true effect would be expected, as in our previous test negative case-control studies. We suspect that this effect is likely related to a combination of deferral of vaccination in individuals who knew they were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus because of a positive test result from a lateral flow test at home, and a healthy vaccinee effect (i.e. those with early symptoms of COVID-19 were more unwell than controls and consequently less likely to be vaccinated). Our estimates of vaccine effectiveness were only for those pregnancies that resulted in a delivery (a live birth or stillbirth), and pregnancies resulting in miscarriage or termination at less than 24 weeks' gestation were not included. Our estimates were similar to other estimates of vaccine effectiveness in non-pregnant individuals and hence should also be generalizable to all pregnancies.

Coding errors in the electronic database of the Hospital Episode Statistics could result in misclassification.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy in emergency department patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding [^114xv27n]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Strategies for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy that defer endovaginal ultrasound in women with suggestive symptoms and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels less than 1500 mIU/mL ignore the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in these patients.

- **Objective**: To quantify this increased risk by establishing and comparing the beta-hCG distributions of symptomatic women with ectopic pregnancies, abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and normal intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the records of a cohort of women who visited an urban emergency department (ED) during a 34-month period with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and non-zero quantitative beta-hCG levels. Explicit criteria were used to determine whether the pregnancy ultimately turned out to be intrauterine and normal, intrauterine and abnormal, or ectopic. Probability distributions were compared using frequency distributions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios.

- **Results**: Of 730 ED patients included in the analysis, 96 (13%) had ectopic pregnancies, 253 (35%) had abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and 381 (52%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. The beta-hCG distributions of patients with ectopic pregnancies and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies were similar and much lower than the beta-hCG distribution of patients with normal intrauterine pregnancies. A beta-hCG level less than 1500 mIU/mL more than doubled the odds of ectopic pregnancy (likelihood ratio = 2.24). Of the 158 patients with beta-hCG below 1500 mIU/mL, 40 (25%; 95% confidence).

### Exclusion of pregnancy in dialysis patients: Diagnostic performance of human chorionic gonadotropin [^112xL6YT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A positive pregnancy test in acute or chronically ill patients has implications for the use of potentially mutagenic or teratogenic products in urgent medical therapies, such as chemotherapies or therapies with immunosuppressants, anesthesia, and for time-sensitive indications like urgent surgery or organ transplantation.

Despite a lack of evidence, it is currently believed that human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) serum concentrations are always elevated in female dialysis patients, even without pregnancy. It is also believed that hCG cannot be used to confirm or exclude pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Human chorionic gonadotropin was examined in female dialysis patients (18–50 years of age) and was classified as positive above 5 mIU/ml. In addition, fertility status was determined. For an enhanced index test, the cut-off of 5 mIU/ml was used for potentially fertile patients and 14 mIU/ml for infertile patients to calculate diagnostic test accuracy. The ideal cut-off for hCG was estimated using Liu's method with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Predictors of hCG increase were analyzed using multivariable linear regression.

- **Results**: Among 71 women, two (2.8%) were pregnant, 46 (64.8%) potentially fertile, and 23 (32.4%) infertile. We observed hCG concentrations > 5 mIU/ml in 10 patients, which had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval: 100 to 100) and a specificity of 86% (95% confidence interval: 77 to 94). The positive predictive value was 17% (95% confidence interval:…).

### Performance of a checklist to exclude pregnancy at the time of contraceptive initiation among women with a negative urine pregnancy test [^112nyFGe]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Our objective was to measure the sensitivity and specificity of a six-item "pregnancy checklist" in excluding early- or luteal-phase pregnancy among women with a negative urine pregnancy test who were initiating contraception.

- **Study design**: This was a secondary analysis of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, a prospective cohort study of 9,256 women in the St. Louis region. Women who had a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of enrollment were included in this analysis. Women with a positive urine pregnancy test or without urine pregnancy testing were excluded. We identified all luteal-phase pregnancies that occurred among women with a negative urine pregnancy test and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios of the pregnancy checklist for excluding luteal-phase pregnancies.

- **Results**: There were 6,929 women included in this analysis; 69% of these women met at least one checklist criterion to exclude pregnancy ("negative screen"). There were 36 luteal-phase pregnancies (0.5%) subsequently diagnosed among women with a negative urine pregnancy test. The sensitivity and specificity of the checklist were 77.7% and 69.1%, respectively. The NPV of the checklist was 99.8% and the positive predictive value was 1.3%.

- **Conclusion**: Among women with a negative urine pregnancy test, the pregnancy checklist can be used to safely exclude more than 99% of early pregnancies at the time of contraceptive initiation.

### Reconsidering the use of urine drug testing in reproductive settings [^116QG7Zy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

The urine drug test is ubiquitous within reproductive healthcare settings. Although the test can have evidence-based use for a patient and clinician, in practice, it is often applied in ways that are driven by bias and stigma, do not correctly inform decisions about clinical aspects of patient care, and cause devastating ripple effects through social and legal systems. This paper proposes a framework of guiding questions to prompt reflection on:

- **The question the clinical team is trying to answer**: Evaluate what specific information the team seeks through testing.
- **Whether a urine drug test answers the question at hand**: Consider the test's ability to provide the needed data.
- **How testing benefits compare with the associated risks**: Weigh the potential positive outcomes against possible negative impacts.
- **A more effective tool for clinical decision-making if the urine drug test does not meet the standards for use**: Identify alternative methods if the current test is inadequate.
- **Individual and institutional biases affecting decision-making**: Reflect on any biases that may influence the testing process.

We demonstrate the use of this framework using three common uses of the urine drug test within abortion care and labor and delivery settings.

### Empty follicle syndrome — does repeat administration of hCG really work [^112Tff8S]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

In this retrospective case series with historic control subjects, repeat administration of hCG after failure to retrieve oocytes from the first ovary in the setting of unexpectedly low serum hCG levels resulted in unsuccessful IVF outcomes. This represents the largest case series at the time of writing regarding repeat administration of hCG in so-called "false" empty follicle syndrome cycles and indicates that patients should be counseled regarding the low likelihood of cycle success after repeat administration of hCG in this setting.

- **Urinalysis with microscopy**: Obtain a comprehensive urinalysis to assess for proteinuria.

- **CBC, peripheral blood smear**: Evaluate complete blood count and examine peripheral blood smear for abnormalities.

- **Serum creatinine, uric acid**: Measure serum creatinine and uric acid levels to assess renal function.

- **Glucose**: Monitor glucose levels for potential abnormalities.

- **AST, ALT**: Conduct liver function tests, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.

- **LDH**: Check lactate dehydrogenase as part of hemolysis evaluation.

- **Bilirubin**: Assess bilirubin levels to identify liver involvement.

- **Albumin**: Measure serum albumin as part of the overall health assessment.

- **INR, aPTT, fibrinogen**: Evaluate coagulation profile, including International Normalized Ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen.

### Negative urine pregnancy test in a molar pregnancy: Is it possible [^1178AV8V]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A urine pregnancy test is commonly used to detect pregnancy and is based on finding intact β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) molecules in the urine by an immunoassay system. However, the significantly large amount of β-hCG in molar pregnancy may paradoxically lead to a false-negative result due to a phenomenon known as the 'high dose hook effect'. A case of molar pregnancy with a negative urine pregnancy test but very high serum β-hCG is reported. Every obstetrician should be aware of this limitation in the presence of a high index of suspicion of gestational trophoblastic disease but a negative urine pregnancy test.

### Claravis [^115TnMfE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Claravis prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Claravis. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

- **For patients with regular menstrual cycles**: The second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- **For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding**: The second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Claravis therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month.

- **Monthly requirements**: Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to patients who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Claravis therapy is identified.

### Accuracy of three screening tools for prenatal substance use [^114VXeN4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Biological screening tests, although considered the gold standard, are not without flaws. Both urine and hair testing have been shown to produce false-positive results and are unable to provide information about the timing or dosage of drug use. Urine tests, although relatively easy to obtain, are subject to variable excretion rates, meaning that a negative toxicology test does not necessarily exclude the possibility of recent use, particularly for drugs with a short half-life. Although hair sampling tests for a longer duration of exposure, its collection is more arduous and not likely to be employed in most obstetric practices.

Although our study has the strength of using two biological tests to confirm use, these tests evaluate a different group of substances, with hair testing not including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or tricyclic antidepressants, which makes comparison of the two difficult. Neither biological test measured alcohol use, which was not a focus of this study. This may explain why the sensitivity of the screening tools decreased slightly when a combination of hair and urine was taken into account. Drugs are typically eliminated much sooner from the urine than from hair, resulting in different timeframes of use being tested. In our study, 13 participants had inconclusive hair sampling. Although the number of inconclusive hair samples was relatively low in this sample, exclusion of inconclusive tests from the analysis may have resulted in an underestimation of the actual sensitivity of these screening tools.

### Recurrent miscarriage green-top guideline no. 17 [^111LoW4A]. BJOG (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pregnancy loss, specifically with respect to products of conception genetic testing, the RCOG 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a cytogenetic analysis on pregnancy tissue in cases of the third and subsequent miscarriages and in any second-trimester miscarriage.

### Clinical relevance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in late pregnancy [^1173gDvU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Firstly, the reliability of the diagnostic tests is still a source of debate. Even if SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated using three different modalities, the accuracy of all the tests used is yet uncertain. The nasopharyngeal swab could detect only ongoing infections, and the sensitivity in affected cases was reported to be only 63%. Preliminary evidence is comforting for the other two tests employed to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, but available studies for validation are not optimal. In particular, no attempts have yet been made to investigate the accuracy of these tests for asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic cases.

Inferring results obtained in patients with moderate or severe forms of the disease to the whole population is arguable. More in general, the clinical and biological significance of the different types of antibodies remains to be ascertained. Noteworthy, in our experience, agreement between the two tests was not excellent, as only 17 women were found to be positive to both tests while 7 were positive only to one of the two. In addition, our test mainly evaluated IgG antibody (only one of the two kits included also other types of antibodies). Including precise evidence also for IgM and IgA could provide a more complete figure of the situation. On the other hand, misdiagnoses were unlikely considering that all women also performed the nasopharyngeal swab. Recent infections that could have not yet generated the immunological response were expected to be identified by the RT-PCR.

### Pregnancy of unknown location: Evaluation and management [^116uyMXM]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of an extrauterine pregnancy is important for safe and effective management. However, a pregnancy's location often cannot be easily determined with abnormal implantations or prior to 5–6 weeks' gestation. Multiple testing strategies exist to diagnose an abnormal pregnancy when its location is unknown, but caution needs to be used to avoid a false diagnosis. Medical treatment is optimal when an abnormal pregnancy is diagnosed early. Because most of these pregnancies are intrauterine, additional testing to localize the pregnancy will allow the correct choice of therapy and avoid unnecessary exposure to toxic therapy. This testing strategy should be reserved for patients with significant concern for ectopic pregnancy, based on either risk factors or clinical findings. Overuse of this approach can lead to the interruption of normal pregnancies.

### Promethazine [^111YnCd9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride:

- **Pregnancy tests**: Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations.

- **Glucose tolerance test**: An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine hydrochloride.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with this drug. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames.

- **Pregnancy**: Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine hydrochloride. These doses are approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats. Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of promethazine were not consistent with this finding.

### Guideline no. 460: Diagnosis and management of intrauterine early pregnancy loss [^114oFkot]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for early pregnancy loss, the SOGC 2025 guidelines specifically recommend obtaining clinical follow-up for a definite intrauterine early pregnancy loss managed expectantly or medically that results in heavy bleeding, which subsequently resolves. Reserve ultrasound and β-hCG levels for clinical concerns such as ongoing heavy bleeding, suspected infection, spotting for more than 3 weeks, or amenorrhea for more than 8 weeks.

### Cabometyx [^1117jrEZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Cabometyx [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Contraception**: Cabometyx can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Cabometyx and for 4 months after the final dose.

- **Infertility**: Based on findings in animals, Cabometyx may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Does labeling prenatal screening test results as negative or positive affect a woman's responses [^11513NCy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

We tested whether adding interpretive labels (e.g. "negative test") to prenatal genetic screening test results changes perceived risk and preferences for amniocentesis.

Women (N = 1688) completed a hypothetical pregnancy scenario on the Internet. We randomly assigned participants into two groups: high risk of fetal chromosomal problems (12.5/1000) or low risk (2/1000). After prenatal screening, the estimated risk was identical (5/1000) for all participants, but results were provided either alone or with interpretive labels.

When receiving test results without labels, all participants reacted similarly. With labels, the participants who received "positive" or "abnormal" results reported a higher perceived risk (P < .001), greater worry (P < .001), and greater interest in amniocentesis (57% vs. 37%; P < .001) than did the participants who received "negative" or "normal" results.

Interpretive labels for test results can induce larger changes to a woman's risk perception and behavioral intention than can numeric results alone, which create decision momentum. This finding has broad clinical implications for patient-provider communication.

### Accuracy of a point-of-care test for quantifying human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the management of pregnancy of unknown location in an abortion service [^113RL99M]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). Low credibility.

Women may seek abortion at gestations when there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound scanning. Clinical protocols for pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) require measurement of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommending that values above 1500 IU/L be further investigated to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Our aim was to determine whether a point-of-care test (POCT) could be used instead of laboratory serum hCG measurement.

- **Methods**: Over 12 months, women who presented to an abortion service with a PUL had a POCT for blood or urine hCG and laboratory serum hCG measurement. The POCT machine used provides a discrete hCG value below 1000 IU/L and above this gives results as a range. The sensitivity and specificity of the POCT in identifying cases where laboratory serum hCG results were above 1500 IU/L were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 118 women presented with a PUL, of whom 70 had a POCT on blood (n = 49) or urine (n = 21) and a corresponding laboratory serum hCG. The sensitivity of the blood POCT was 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.87) and the specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.99). The sensitivity of the urine POCT was 0.25 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.78) and the specificity was 0.94 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.99).

- **Conclusion**: Although both the blood and urine POCTs had a high level of specificity, neither test was acceptably sensitive. While promising, this POCT for hCG is not sufficiently reliable to replace laboratory serum hCG testing in the management of women with PUL in an abortion service.

### Hemorrhagic shock from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in a patient with a negative urine pregnancy test result [^115iRgDd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy has been increasing in frequency over the past two decades. The sudden rupture of a fallopian tube caused by ectopic pregnancy can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. The emergency physician is often the health professional called upon to make the diagnosis and coordinate timely and effective intervention. The first step in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy is the demonstration of pregnancy through a rapidly performed and sensitive qualitative urine test for the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). A negative urine pregnancy test result generally excludes ectopic pregnancy from further consideration.

This report presents a patient who arrived at an emergency department experiencing hypovolemic shock, alongside two negative urine beta-hCG analyses and a quantitative serum beta-hCG level of 7 mIU/mL. This value is below the lower limit of detection for highly sensitive qualitative urine and serum tests. This case report demonstrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, even in the setting of a negative urine pregnancy test result.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fyBdF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

"Probable active syphilis" is defined as seroreactivity in both non-treponemal and treponemal tests. A correction factor of 65%, namely the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis test type that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to global estimates of syphilis during pregnancy based on data reported to WHO.

- **Objectives**: To identify more accurate correction factors based on test type reported.

- **Search strategy**: Medline search using "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]".

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models.

- **Main results**: Countries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Countries not reporting test type required a correction factor of 68.6%.

- **Conclusions**: Future estimates should adjust reported maternal syphilis seropositivity by test type to ensure accuracy.

### Pomalyst [^115YF6EY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Females and males of reproductive potential should be aware of specific considerations when using POMALYST.

- **Pregnancy testing**: POMALYST can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating POMALYST therapy and during therapy. Advise these females that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy, while taking POMALYST, during dose interruptions, and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.

	- Females of reproductive potential must have two negative pregnancy tests before initiating POMALYST treatment. The first test should be performed within 10–14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST. Once treatment has started, and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use. Subsequently, pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be conducted if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. POMALYST treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.

- **Contraception for females**: Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously: one highly effective form of contraception, such as tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings), in combination with another form of contraception.

### The clinical utility of DNA-based screening for fetal aneuploidy by primary obstetrical care providers in the general pregnancy population [^113aUKoK]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The initial cfDNA test failure rate was 5.6% (150/2,681; 95% CI, 4.8 to 6.5%) and all were subject to active outcome ascertainment. For the 85 plasma samples subsequently submitted for cfDNA testing, 65 (76%) results were reported, all of which were screen-negative. An additional 63 women relied on reflexive serum/ultrasound results; 54 (86%) were screen-negative and 9 (14%) were screen-positive. Eight of these nine women delivered a normal infant (four also had a subsequent screen-negative cfDNA test). The ninth woman was diagnosed with a mosaic condition following a positive cfDNA test from another sequencing laboratory; a normal female infant was delivered. Figure 2 lists outcomes for the remaining pregnancies with test failures.

Our follow-up revealed that none of these 150 women chose invasive testing. To verify provider awareness that open neural tube defect screening is indicated despite normal cfDNA test results, records from 100 women consecutively screened in May 2015 (near the end of the study) were reviewed: 72% had serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for open neural tube defects, with no screen-positive results (≥ 2.0 MoM). It was not possible to determine whether the 28% of women who did not undergo open neural tube defect screening were not offered serum screening, declined serum screening, or underwent alternative testing such as a level II ultrasound.

### The performance of a rapid diagnostic test in detecting malaria infection in pregnant women and the impact of missed infections [^113AcFQy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of P. falciparum infection in Ghanaian pregnant women was highest at enrollment and remained high throughout pregnancy. The study shows the overlap in the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), PCR, and blood smear microscopy at any routine ANC contact at which Ghanaian women were screened.

- **Prevalence of malaria infection in peripheral blood**: At different time points in pregnant Ghanaian women, the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT were measured. The sensitivity of the RDT against the combined measure of PCR and/or blood smear positivity was 88.8% (95% CI, 85.0%, 91.9%) at the first ANC visit, 83.7% (95% CI, 76.2%, 89.6%) at the second ANC visit, 77.4% (95% CI, 67.0%, 85.8%) at the third ANC visit, and 48.6% (95% CI, 31.4%, 66.0%) at delivery. Specificity was generally high, over 80% on all occasions and in all gravidities, but slightly higher in secundigravidae than in primigravidae.

During the course of pregnancy, 709 positive RDT tests were obtained, 380 of which (53.6%) were obtained at enrollment. Screening with an RDT at enrollment detected 339 of the 639 P. falciparum infections detected by microscopy or PCR during the course of pregnancy (53.1% (95% CI, 49.1%, 57.0%)). Subsequently, one or more infections were recorded in 172 of the 380 women (45.2%) who were positive at enrollment by RDT, compared to 101 (36.2%) in the 272 women who had a negative RDT test at enrollment. Among the 380 women, there were 212 positive RDTs at subsequent ANC contacts.

### Amnesteem [^116Jh584]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients who can become pregnant must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test, a screening test, is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to qualify the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test, a confirmation test, must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test, performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory, before receiving each prescription.

- **Lipids**: Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After the consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129weuA]. International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

For each study identified from the literature review, we manually retrieved or calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal (Category 2) and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal (Category 3) tests, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the assessed outcomes. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models, which account for the presence of between-study heterogeneity. This approach was chosen over a fixed effects model since the underlying syphilis prevalence and other factors varied in each population studied.

### Falsely elevated human chorionic gonadotropin leading to unnecessary therapy [^115mNjtN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Analysis of serum beta-hCG aids diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic gestations, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Beta-hCG concentrations are specific for trophoblastic tissue and are rarely questioned.

- **Cases**: An 18-year-old nullipara experienced bleeding and tested positive for beta-hCG. Ultrasound identified no pregnancy. She passed tissue and the bleeding stopped. Despite uterine curettage and three courses of methotrexate, serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Results of urine beta-hCG were negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay. A 31-year-old nullipara had a spontaneous abortion, but serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Uterine curettage revealed secretory endometrium, yet elevated serum beta-hCG persisted. Urine beta-hCG was negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with histories incongruent with serum beta-hCG findings should have urine beta-hCG analysis.

### Reducing the overuse of βhCG measurements in the emergency gynaecology clinic [^113awZk6]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Serial βhCG testing can be a helpful tool in deciding how to manage a pregnancy of unknown location. Its use in emergency gynaecology clinics can prevent unnecessary admission and intervention. However, despite NICE guidelines on when it is safe to opt for conservative management, it was identified that there was a problem with over-testing of βhCG when patients could be discharged with instructions to repeat a urinary pregnancy test in two weeks. Two PDSA cycles were undertaken to improve awareness of NICE guidelines:

- **Educational interventions**: The first involved formal and informal educational sessions.

- **Guideline summary inclusion**: The second involved the inclusion of a guideline summary on the front of patients' notes when they were having serial βhCG tests, for doctors to refer to.

Case notes were reviewed for 157 women who had βhCG tests at baseline and 48 hours. Of these, 139 were suitable for serial βhCG testing, and 83 of these were suitable for discharge after 48 hours. Of the 83 patients eligible for discharge, 31 unnecessary βhCG tests were done, 23 of which were prior to intervention. A significant improvement was noted, with between 4–10 unnecessary βhCG tests per fortnight prior to intervention, 0–3 following the first intervention, and 0–2 following the second.

Reduction in unnecessary βhCG testing has positive implications for patients, who do not have to take unnecessary time off work, prolong an already very distressing period, and have unnecessary blood tests. There are also cost and time-saving implications for the hospital.

### Retrospective review of universal preoperative pregnancy testing: Results and perspectives [^1165JD1G]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Unrecognized pregnancy in patients presenting for elective surgery is of particular concern due to the potential for significant complications. Accurate and inexpensive urine pregnancy tests are widely available in the developed world. As a result, universal preoperative pregnancy screening is commonly implemented. However, the utility of such routine testing is controversial. We retrospectively studied 8,245 immediate presurgery pregnancy tests at Mayo Clinic Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, and found 11 positive tests of which 6 were false positives. We constructed a census-based approximation for unrecognized pregnancies, which shows significantly low pretest probability in this patient population. Taken together, the utility of immediate universal presurgical pregnancy testing is questionable.
